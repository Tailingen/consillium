Reduced Intensity Flu/Mel/TBI Conditioning for HAPLO HCT Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
This is a single arm, phase II trial of HLA-haploidentical related hematopoietic cells transplant (Haplo-HCT) using reduced intensity conditioning (fludarabine and melphalan and total body irradiation). Peripheral blood is the donor graft source. This study is designed to estimate disease-free survival (DFS) at 18 months post-transplant.

Disease Free Survival, Disease Free Survival (DFS) is defined as the time from the date of Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant (PBSCT) to first documentation of relapse or death due to any cause, whichever comes first., Up to 18 months post-transplant
Percentage of Participants With Graft vs Host Disease (GVHD) Free Survival, GVHD-free survival is defined as the time from the date of PBSCT to date of events which include grade III-IV acute GVHD and systemic therapy-requiring chronic GVHD., At 180 days post-transplant|Percentage of Participants Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of PBSCT to the date of death due to any cause., Up to 18 months|Percentage of Participants With Treatment Related Mortality (TRM) at 6 Months, TRM is defined as death not directly due to disease, at 6 months post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Treatment Related Mortality (TRM) at 18 Months, TRM is defined as death not directly due to disease, at 18 months post-transplant|Percentage of Participants With Relapse Free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the time from the date of PBSCT to relapse or death., Up to 18 months post-transplant
