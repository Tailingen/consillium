A Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Effects of Cobimetinib and GDC-0994 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a two-stage dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability and effects of oral dosing of cobimetinib and GDC-0994 administered in combination in patients with histologically confirmed, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors for which standard therapies either do not exist or have proven ineffective or intolerable.
