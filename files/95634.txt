Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection in Recurrent/Refractory Lymphoma Subjects
This is a single-center, open, randomized parallel group design study to investigate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride liposome injection in the treatment of relapsed/refractory lymphoma after the first administration, and the safety and efficacy.
Recurrent/Refractory Lymphoma
DRUG: Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Injection
Pharmacokinetic indexes, Cmax Maximum concentration (Cmax), aximum concentration (Cmax) of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome, Up to 28 days|Pharmacokinetic indexes, Tmax, Time to Cmax (Tmax) of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome, Up to 28 days|Pharmacokinetic indexes, Maximum concentration (Cmax,u), Maximum concentration (Cmax,u) of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome, Up to 28 days
progression-free survival(PFS), progression-free survival(PFS) of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first（assessed up to 100 months）
Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse Events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant temporally associated with the use of study investigational product (IP), whether or not considered related to the study IP. "Adverse event" means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, From the initiation of the first dose to 28 days after the last dose
The study was divided into three dosage groups: 12 mg/m2, 16 mg/m2 and 20 mg/m2,and three dosage groups were randomly divided into parallel groups.Every 28 days is a administration cycle, a total of 4 cycles.Until the subject's PD or intolerable or withdrawal (whichever occurs first).

In the study before administration of the first cycle to cycle second will set up 16 blood points,to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters of total mitoxantrone and free mitoxantrone after the first administration.
