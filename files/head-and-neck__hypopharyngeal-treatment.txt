Epidemiology
Cancer of the hypopharynx is uncommon; approximately 2,500 new cases are diagnosed in the United States each year.[
1
]  The peak incidence of this cancer occurs in people  aged  50 to 60 years.[
2
]  Excessive alcohol and tobacco use are the primary risk factors for hypopharyngeal cancer.[
3
,
4
]  In the United States, hypopharyngeal cancers are more common in men than in women.[
5
]  In Europe and Asia, high incidences of pharyngeal cancers, namely,   oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal, have been found among men in France, in the counties of Bas-Rhin and Herault; Switzerland, in the section of Vaud; Spain, in the Basque Country region; Slovakia; Slovenia; and India, in the cities of Bombay and Madras.[
6
]  This cancer is extremely rare in children.[
7
]
Upper hypopharyngeal cancers appear to be associated more with heavy drinking and smoking, whereas the lower hypopharyngeal, or postcricoid, cancers are more often associated with nutritional deficiencies.[
1
,
8
]  Although earlier reports from northern Europe, particularly from Sweden, indicated a link between Plummer-Vinson syndrome, which consisted of   sideropenic anemia and epithelial changes of the aerodigestive tract, and other nutritional deficiencies in women, current cases of hypopharyngeal cancer among women are more likely to be associated with excessive use of alcohol and tobacco, rather than with deficiency diseases.[

Anatomy
Anatomically, the hypopharynx extends from the plane of the hyoid bone above to the plane of the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage below. The hypopharynx is  composed of the following three parts and does not include the larynx:
The pyriform sinus.
The postcricoid area.
The posterior pharyngeal wall.
Clinical Features
The lymphatic drainage from the pharynx is into the jugulodigastric, jugulo-omohyoid, upper and middle deep cervical, and retropharyngeal nodes.  In the United States and Canada, 65% to 85% of hypopharyngeal carcinomas involve the pyriform sinuses, 10% to 20% involve the posterior pharyngeal wall, and 5% to 15% involve the postcricoid area.[
12
]  Pyriform sinus and postcricoid carcinomas are typically flat plaques with raised edges and superficial ulceration. In contrast, posterior hypopharyngeal wall tumors tend to be exophytic and are often large (i.e., 80% >5 cm) at presentation.[
13
]  Hypopharyngeal carcinomas tend to spread within the mucosa, beneath intact epithelium, and are prone to skip metastasis  and to resurface at various locations remote from the primary site.[
1
,
13
]  Because of this fact and the abundant lymphatic network of the region, a localized hypopharyngeal tumor is the exception.[
1
]
Almost all hypopharyngeal cancers are mucosal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs).[
1
]  Multiple primary tumors are not uncommon.  Approximately 25% of patients in a retrospective study of 150 cases were found to have second primary tumors.[
14
]  Field cancerization may be responsible, in part, for the multiple, synchronous, primary malignant neoplasms that occur in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer.[
1
,
14
-
16
]  The concept of field cancerization, originally described in 1953, proposes that tumors develop in a multifocal fashion within a field of tissue that has been chronically exposed to carcinogens.[
17
]
Clinically, cancers of the hypopharynx tend to be aggressive and demonstrate a natural history that is characterized by diffuse local spread, early metastasis, and a relatively high rate of distant spread. More than  50% of patients with hypopharyngeal cancer have clinically positive cervical nodes at the time of presentation.  In 50% of these individuals, a neck mass is the presenting symptom.[
2
,
18
,
19
]  In a retrospective study of 78 cases of hypopharyngeal cancer, other symptoms in addition to a neck mass (25.6%) included dysphagia (46.1%), odynophagia (44.8%), voice change (16.3%), and otalgia (14.2%).[
2
]  A voice change resulting from pyriform sinus or postcricoid lesions is a late symptom that usually indicates invasion into the larynx or the recurrent laryngeal nerve.[
1
]
In a large retrospective study of patients with SCC of the larynx and hypopharynx, 87% of patients with pyriform sinus SCC were found to have stage III or stage IV disease; 82% of patients with SCC of the posterior pharyngeal wall were found to have stage III or stage IV disease.[
20
]   As many as  17% of hypopharyngeal SCCs may be associated with distant metastases when clinically diagnosed.[
20
]  This is quite different from the rate of distant metastasis detected at autopsy, which has been reported to be as high as 60%.[
21
]  A relatively high incidence of delayed regional (i.e., 2 or more years after completion of primary therapy) and distant metastatic disease in hypopharyngeal SCC is related to the advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis.  Almost 33% of pyriform sinus tumors may be associated with delayed regional metastases.[
20
]
The treatment of hypopharyngeal cancer is controversial, in part because of its low incidence and the inherent difficulty in conducting adequately powered, prospective, randomized clinical studies.[
22
]  Therefore, it is difficult to define the ideal therapy for a specific site or stage of hypopharyngeal cancer. In general, both surgery and radiation therapy are the mainstays of most curative efforts. In recent years, chemotherapy has been added to the treatment strategies for selected advanced presentations of hypopharyngeal cancer.[
23
] In pyriform sinus cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy may achieve larynx preservation without jeopardizing survival.[
24
]
Prognosis and Survival
Chronic pulmonary and hepatic diseases related to the excessive use of tobacco and alcohol are found in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer.  Recognition of these comorbidities is essential when planning appropriate treatment.[
1
] The primary prognostic factors for hypopharyngeal SCC include:[
1
,
25
,
26
]
Stage.
Age.
Performance status.
Factors that contribute to an overall poor prognosis with hypopharyngeal SCC include:
Presentation at a late stage.
Multisite involvement within the hypopharynx.
Unrestricted soft-tissue tumor growth.
An extensive regional lymphatic network conducive to metastases.
Restricted surgical options for complete resection.
In many patients, a poor prognosis is related to poor overall health.[
13
]  The most common cause of failure of treatment of the primary tumor is local and/or regional recurrence. Most treatment failures occur within the first 2 years following definitive therapy. The burden of lymph node metastases may yield information of prognostic value. In a retrospective study, a total volume of metastatic disease of more than 100 cm
3
indicated a particularly poor prognosis.[
25
]
Risk Factors
In addition to the risk of delayed regional metastases, the risk of developing a second primary tumor in patients with tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract has been estimated to be 4% to 7% per year.[
20
,
26
-
28
]   Because of these risks, surveillance of patients with hypopharyngeal cancer should be lifelong.
Histopathology
SCC of the hypopharynx has not been associated with any specific chromosomal or genetic abnormalities;[
13
]   however, loss of chromosome 18 was observed in 57% of hypopharyngeal tumors in one study.[
29
]  Several other studies have emphasized the importance of chromosome 11q13 amplification, which may be related to the presence of nodal metastases, greater local aggressiveness, and a higher incidence of tumor recurrence.[

Cellular Classification of Hypopharyngeal Cancer
Almost all hypopharyngeal cancers are epithelial in origin, predominantly squamous cell (i.e., epidermoid) carcinomas (SCCs), and may be preceded by various precancerous lesions.[
1
,
2
] Rare types of hypopharyngeal carcinomas include:
Basaloid squamoid carcinomas.
Spindle-cell (i.e., sarcomatoid) carcinomas.
Small-cell carcinomas.
Nasopharyngeal-type undifferentiated carcinomas (i.e., lymphoepitheliomas).
Carcinomas of the minor salivary glands.
Nonepithelial tumors, including lymphomas, sarcomas, and melanomas, require separate consideration and are not included in the staging and treatment options discussed in this summary.[
1
,
3
-
8
]
Invasive SCCs are usually moderately or poorly differentiated and invariably stain positively for keratin.[
1
]
In situ
carcinoma is often seen adjacent to invasive SCC.[
1
,
9
]
The term, leukoplakia, should be used only as a clinically descriptive term
meaning that the observer sees a white patch that does not rub off, the
significance of which depends on the histological findings.[
10
]  Based on this description, leukoplakia can range from
hyperkeratosis to an actual early invasive carcinoma or may represent only a
fungal infection, lichen planus, or other benign oral disease.

Stage Information for Hypopharyngeal Cancer
In This Section
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
The staging systems are all clinical staging and are based on the best possible
estimate of the extent of disease before treatment.  The assessment of the
primary tumor is based on inspection and palpation, when possible, and by both
indirect mirror examination and direct endoscopy.  The tumor must be confirmed
histologically, and any other pathological data obtained from a biopsy may be
included.  Additional radiographic studies may be included.  As an adjunct to clinical examination, computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging are needed for an accurate staging of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal carcinomas because both cross-sectional imaging modalities are known to reliably evaluate deep tumor infiltration.[
1
-
3
] The appropriate nodal
drainage areas are examined by careful palpation.  If a patient relapses,
complete restaging must be done to select the appropriate additional therapy.
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
The AJCC has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define hypopharyngeal cancer.[

Treatment Option Overview for Hypopharyngeal Cancer
In This Section
Treatment Overview
Fluorouracil Dosing
Hypopharyngeal cancer usually does not cause symptoms until late in the course of the disease. Coupled with the high incidence of early metastasis, survival rates for carcinoma of the hypopharynx are perhaps the lowest of all cancer sites in the head and neck.
No single therapeutic regimen offers a superior survival advantage over other regimens. Although the literature highlights various therapeutic options, few reports present any valid comparative studies. The ultimate therapeutic choice will depend on a careful review of each individual case, paying attention to the staging of the neoplasm, the patient's general physical condition and emotional status, the experience of the treating team, and the available treatment facilities.[

Treatment Overview
Except for very early stage (T1) cancers of this region, treatment has primarily been surgery, usually followed with postoperative radiation therapy (PORT).  Some early stage (T1 and T2), low-volume, exophytic pyriform sinus carcinomas have been successfully treated with radiation therapy alone.[
3
-
5
]  Single-modality therapy of advanced-stage hypopharyngeal cancer, with either surgery or radiation therapy, has resulted in consistently poor survival.[
6
-
8
]
Combined-modality treatment should be considered for patients with stage III or stage IV disease.[
4
,
6
,
9
,
10
]  When used with surgery, radiation therapy is typically administered postoperatively.  In selected advanced cases, alternative strategies using neoadjuvant  chemotherapy and radiation therapy may increase the chance for local control as much as resection and PORT.[
4
]
A review of published clinical results of radical radiation therapy for head and neck cancer suggests a significant loss of local control when radiation therapy was prolonged; therefore, lengthening of standard treatment schedules should be avoided whenever possible.[
11
,
12
]
Chronic pulmonary and hepatic diseases related to excessive tobacco and alcohol use are common in patients with head and neck cancer; recognition of these comorbidities is essential when planning appropriate treatment.[
6
]  Patients who smoke during radiation therapy appear to have lower response rates and shorter survival durations than those who do not.[
13
] Consequently, patients should be counseled to stop smoking before beginning radiation therapy. Evidence has demonstrated a high incidence (i.e., >30%–40%) of hypothyroidism in patients who have received external-beam radiation therapy to the entire thyroid gland or to the pituitary gland. Thyroid function testing of patients should be considered before therapy and as part of posttreatment follow-up.[
14
,
15
]
Fluorouracil Dosing
The
DPYD
gene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil. An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants in
DPYD
, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[
16
,
17
] Patients with the
DPYD*2A
variant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal. Many other
DPYD
variants have been identified,  with a range of clinical effects.[
16
-
18
] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on  the patient's
DPYD
genotype and number of functioning
DPYD
alleles.[
19
-
21
]
DPYD
genetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to  a lack of national guidelines.[
22
] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations. This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[

Treatment Options for Stage I Hypopharyngeal Cancer
Except for the very early T1 cancers of this region, treatment has been
primarily surgery, usually followed with postoperative radiation therapy. 
Because these tumors are clinically silent until they reach advanced stages,
it is very unusual to diagnose them at the T1 N0 stage.  In most
available retrospective reviews, T1 N0 cases represent only 1% to 2% of all
patients seen.  In the case of exophytic T1 N0 lesions, radiation therapy alone
may be considered.[

]
Treatment options for stage I hypopharyngeal cancer include:
Laryngopharyngectomy and neck dissection has been the most frequently used
therapy for hypopharyngeal cancers.
In very selected cases of pyriform sinus
cancers, that is, those arising in the upper lateral wall, a partial laryngopharyngectomy may
be successfully used to  preserve vocal function.  All groups who use radiation
therapy advocate high-dose treatment to the primary site and to both sides of the neck to
include the retropharyngeal and lateral cervical nodes.[

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is commonly used to treat patients who present with
advanced disease to  improve locoregional control or survival, despite the
lack of data from randomized, prospective trials.[

The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to increase organ
preservation has also been advocated.  In a prospective randomized trial (
GORTEC-TREMPLIN
trial [NCT00169247]), the
European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer compared surgery plus PORT with  neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (i.e., cisplatin plus fluorouracil) followed by radiation therapy in responding
patients. Local and regional failures were similar in both groups.  Although
median survival was 25 months in the immediate surgery arm of the study and 44
months in the induction chemotherapy arm (
P
= .006), 5-year disease-free  and
overall survival were the same.  A functional larynx was preserved in 42% of
patients at 3 years and 35% at 5 years in patients who received induction
chemotherapy.  These data have not been confirmed by other phase III trials but
suggest that larynx preservation may be feasible without jeopardizing
survival.[

Treatment Options for Stage III Hypopharyngeal Cancer
The management of patients with stage III hypopharyngeal cancer is complex and requires
multidisciplinary input to establish the optimal treatment regimen.  New
surgical techniques and reconstructions (using the gastric pull-up operation or
free jejunal transfers) have greatly reduced the morbidity associated with
resection of these tumors and have almost eliminated the need for multistage
reconstructions.  This has greatly aided the combined treatment regimens 
because these patients have a high likelihood of beginning postoperative
radiation therapy (PORT) within 3 to 4 weeks following resection.
Details of surgical procedures and modifications of radiation fields or
dosage schedules are not specifically designated here because of
legitimate variations in techniques that,  according to various retrospective
data, give similar survival results in different treatment centers.  This group
of patients should be managed by surgeons and radiation oncologists who are
skilled in the multiple procedures and techniques available, and who are
actively and frequently involved in the care of these patients.
Treatment options for stage III hypopharyngeal cancer include:
The combination of surgery and radiation,  most often postoperative as seen in a follow-up study of preoperative versus PORT (RTOG-7303), has
become the usual form of therapy for this group of patients in the United
States.[

Immunotherapy
Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody and an inhibitor of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway. Studies have evaluated pembrolizumab in patients with incurable metastatic or recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Evidence (pembrolizumab as first-line therapy):
KEYNOTE-048
(NCT02358031) was a nonblinded, randomized, phase III study of participants with untreated locally incurable metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC that was performed at 200 sites in 37 countries.[
3
] A total of 882 patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab alone (n  = 301), pembrolizumab plus a platinum and fluorouracil (5-FU) (pembrolizumab with chemotherapy)  (n = 281), or cetuximab plus a platinum and 5-FU (cetuximab with chemotherapy) (n = 300). Investigators, patients, and representatives of the sponsor were masked to the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) results; PD-L1 positivity was not required for study entry. A total of 754 patients (85%) had a CPS of 1 or higher and 381 patients (43%) had a CPS of 20 or higher.
The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Progression was defined as radiographically confirmed disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, in the intention-to-treat population.
At the second interim analysis, pembrolizumab alone showed improved or noninferior OS compared with cetuximab with chemotherapy. The median OS results were reported as follows:[
3
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Among the population with a CPS of 20 or higher,  the median OS was 14.9 months in patients who received pembrolizumab alone and 10.7 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45–0.83;
P
= .0007).
Among the population with a CPS of 1 or higher, the median OS was 12.3 months in patients who received pembrolizumab alone and 10.3 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96;
P
= .0086).
Among the total population, patients who received pembrolizumab alone had noninferior OS (11.6 months) compared with patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (10.7 months) (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.71–1.03;
P
= .0456).
Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy showed improved OS versus cetuximab with chemotherapy. The OS results were reported as follows:
At the second interim analysis, among the total population, the median OS was 13.0 months in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and 10.7 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63–0.93;
P
= .0034).
At the final analysis, among the population with a CPS of 20 or higher, the median OS was 14.7 months in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and 11.0 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.45–0.82;
P
= .0004).
At the final analysis, among the population with a CPS of 1 or higher, the median OS was 13.6 months in patients who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy and  10.4 months in patients who received cetuximab with chemotherapy (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53–0.80;
P
< .0001).
At the second interim analysis, neither pembrolizumab alone nor pembrolizumab with chemotherapy improved PFS.
At the final analysis, grade 3 or higher all-cause adverse events occurred in 164 of 300 patients (55%) in the pembrolizumab-alone group, 235 of 276 patients (85%) who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, and 239 of 287 patients (83%) who received cetuximab with chemotherapy.
Adverse events led to death in 25 patients (8%) in the pembrolizumab-alone group, 32 patients (12%) who received pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, and 28 patients (10%) who received cetuximab with chemotherapy.
Pembrolizumab plus a platinum and 5-FU is an appropriate first-line treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC. Pembrolizumab monotherapy is an appropriate first-line treatment for patients with PD-L1–positive metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC. These results were confirmed at a longer median follow-up of 45 months (interquartile range, 41.0–49.2).[
9
]
Evidence (pembrolizumab after progression on platinum-based treatment):
The phase III
KEYNOTE-040
(NCT02252042) trial included patients with incurable metastatic or recurrent head and neck SCC who had received platinum-based treatment within 3 to 6 months.[
4
] Patients were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab arm  (200 mg every 3 weeks [247 patients]) or to the standard therapy arm of the investigator’s choice (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab [248 patients]). Patients received treatment until progression or toxicity. The maximum duration of pembrolizumab was 24 months. The primary end point was OS in the intention-to-treat population.
The median OS was 8.4 months in the pembrolizumab arm and 6.9 months in the standard therapy arm (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65–0.98; nominal
P
= .0161).[
4
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Pembrolizumab was associated with fewer grade 3 or higher adverse events (pembrolizumab, 13%  vs. standard therapy, 36%). The most common treatment-related adverse events were  hypothyroidism (13%) in the  pembrolizumab arm and fatigue (18%) in the standard therapy arm.
In patients who received pembrolizumab, there were four treatment-related deaths resulting from  large intestinal perforation, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and unspecified malignant progression. Two treatment-related deaths in the standard therapy arm resulted from malignant progression and pneumonia.
The PD-L1 CPS was 1 or higher in 79% of the patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 77% of the patients in the standard therapy  arm.
Compared with patients treated with standard therapy, a reduced HR
death
was noted for patients who received pembrolizumab and had PD-1 expression on their tumors or in the tumor microenvironment as noted by a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–0.93; nominal
P
= .0049) or a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or higher (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.35–0.81; nominal
P
= .0014).
Nivolumab
Nivolumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 anti–PD-1 monoclonal antibody.
Evidence (nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in patients who have not previously received systemic therapy):
The
CheckMate 651
trial (NCT02741570) evaluated first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus EXTREME (cetuximab, cisplatin/carboplatin, and 5-FU for up to six cycles followed by  cetuximab maintenance) in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck SCC.[
5
] The primary end points were OS in all randomly assigned patients and patients with a PD-L1 CPS  of 20 or higher. Secondary end points included OS in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher and PFS, objective response rate, and duration of response in all randomly assigned patients and patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 20 or higher.
Among all randomly assigned patients, there was no statistically significant difference in OS with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus EXTREME (median OS, 13.9 vs. 13.5 months;  HR, 0.95; 97.9% CI, 0.80–1.13;
P
= .4951). Among patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 20 or higher, there was also no statistically significant OS difference between the two treatments (median OS, 17.6 vs. 14.6 months; HR, 0.78; 97.51% CI, 0.59–1.03;
P
= .0469).[
5
][
Level of evidence A1
]
In patients with a CPS  of 1 or higher, the median OS was 15.7 months for patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus 13.2 months  for patients who received EXTREME (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.97).
Among patients with a CPS  of 20 or higher, the median PFS was 5.4 months for patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 7.0 months for patients who received EXTREME. The objective response rate was 34.1% for patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.0% for patients who received EXTREME.
Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 28.2% of patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 70.7% of patients who received EXTREME.
CheckMate 651 did not meet its primary end points of OS in the randomly assigned or CPS of 20 or higher populations.
The absence of a survival benefit for immune checkpoint inhibitors in this trial was an unexpected outcome, given the similarity of nivolumab to pembrolizumab in the studies of patients with cisplatin-refractory disease.[
4
,
7
] An editorial accompanying the CheckMate 651 trial analyzed some of the factors that may have contributed to a different result. The editorial suggested that  survival in the control group, which was longer than that reported in prior studies, may have been impacted by the greater availability of second-line immunotherapy in the control group (46% in CheckMate 651 compared with 25% in the KEYNOTE-048 trial). The authors also suggested that the coadministration of ipilimumab detracted from the activity of nivolumab, as shown  in the  CheckMate 714 trial.[
10
]
CheckMate 714
(NCT02823574), a double-blind phase II trial, evaluated the clinical benefit of first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone in 425 patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck SCC.[
6
] Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously [IV] every 2 weeks) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV every 6 weeks) or nivolumab (3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks) plus placebo. Treatment continued for up to 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or consent withdrawal. The primary end points were objective response rate and duration of response between treatment arms by blinded independent central review in the population with platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic disease. These were patients who had recurrent disease less than 6 months after completion of platinum-based chemotherapy (adjuvant or neoadjuvant, or as part of multimodal treatment [chemotherapy, surgery, and/or radiation therapy]). 	Among the  241 patients (56.7%) with platinum-refractory disease, 159 were assigned to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 82 were assigned to receive nivolumab alone. Among the 184 patients (43.3%) with platinum-eligible disease, 123 were assigned to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 61 were assigned to receive nivolumab alone.[
6
][
Level of evidence B3
]
At primary database lock, the objective response rate in the population with platinum-refractory disease was 13.2% (95% CI, 8.4%–19.5%) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 18.3% (95% CI, 10.6%–28.4%) with nivolumab alone (odds ratio, 0.68; 95.5% CI, 0.33–1.43;
P
= .29).
The median duration of response was not reached (NR) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group (95% CI, 11.0 months–NR) and was 11.1 months (95% CI, 4.1–NR) in the  nivolumab-alone group. 
In the population with platinum-eligible disease, the objective response rate was 20.3% (95% CI, 13.6%–28.5%) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 29.5% (95% CI, 18.5%–42.6%) with nivolumab alone.
Among the population with platinum-refractory disease, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in  25 of 158 patients (15.8%) who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and in 12 of 82 patients (14.6%) who received nivolumab alone. 	Among the population with platinum-eligible disease, grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in  30 of 122 patients (24.6%) who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and in 8 of 61 patients (13.1%) who received nivolumab alone.
This trial did not meet its primary end point of objective response rate benefit with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus nivolumab alone in patients with platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic head and neck SCC.
Evidence (nivolumab after progression on platinum-based treatment):
A phase III open-label trial included 361 patients with recurrent SCC of the head and neck and disease  progression within 6 months after platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either nivolumab  (at a dose of 3 mg/kg of body weight) every 2 weeks or standard single-agent systemic therapy (methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab). The primary end point was OS.[
7
]
The median OS was 7.5 months (95% CI, 5.5–9.1) in the nivolumab group versus 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.0–6.0) in the standard therapy group. OS was statistically significantly longer with nivolumab than with standard therapy (HR
death
, 0.70; 97.73% CI, 0.51–0.96;
P
= .01). The estimated 1-year survival rate was approximately 19% higher in patients who received nivolumab (36.0%) than in those who received standard therapy (16.6%).[
7
][
Level of evidence A1
]
There was no statistically significant difference in median PFS between treatment groups. The 6-month PFS rate was 19.7% with nivolumab versus 9.9% with standard therapy.
The response rate was 13.3% in the nivolumab group versus 5.8% in the standard therapy group.
Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 13.1% of the patients in the nivolumab group compared with  35.1% of the patients in the standard therapy group.
Quality-of-life outcomes—including physical, role, and social functioning and pain, sensory, and social contact problems—were stable in the nivolumab group but worse in the standard therapy group. These outcomes were assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) Core Module (QLQ-C30) and the Head and Neck Module (QLQ-H&N35).
In the subgroup of patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 1% or higher, the HR
death
among patients treated with nivolumab versus standard therapy was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.36–0.83). In  the subgroup of patients with a PD-L1 expression level lower than 1%, the HR was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.54–1.45;
P
= .17 for interaction).
A randomized, phase III, superiority study in India evaluated the dose of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of palliative care for patients with advanced head and neck cancer. Low-dose IV nivolumab (20 mg every 3 weeks) was added to a triple metronomic chemotherapy regimen of oral methotrexate (9 mg/m
2
once weekly), celecoxib (200 mg twice daily), and erlotinib (150 mg once daily). Notably, this nivolumab dose is less than 10% of the dose recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. A total of 151 patients were randomly assigned to receive either triple metronomic chemotherapy alone (n = 75) or triple metronomic chemotherapy with nivolumab (n = 76). The primary end point was 1-year OS.[
8
]
The addition of low-dose nivolumab to triple metronomic chemotherapy improved the 1-year OS rate from 16.3% (95% CI, 8.0%–27.4%) to 43.4% (95% CI, 30.8%–55.3%) (HR, 0.545; 95% CI, 0.362–0.820;
P
= .0036).[

][
Level of evidence A1
]
The median OS was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.8–8.1) for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy alone and 10.1 months (95% CI, 7.4–12.6) for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy with nivolumab (
P
= .0052).
The rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 50% for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy alone and 46.1% for patients who received triple metronomic chemotherapy with nivolumab (
P
= .744).
Although the control arm in this study cannot be considered standard care, lower doses of immunotherapy appeared to have some benefit in this setting.[

Posttreatment follow-up for metastatic and recurrent hypopharyngeal cancer
These patients should have a careful head and neck examination, looking for
recurrence monthly for the first posttreatment year, every 2 months for the
second year, every 3 months the third  year, and every 6 months thereafter.
