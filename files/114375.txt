68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in Detecting Prostate Cancer Recurrence in Patients With Elevated PSA After Initial Treatment
The purpose of this research study is to see if recurrent prostate cancer can be identified using a special procedure called a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. PET/CT is used to describe information regarding the function, as well as location and size of a tumor.

PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography (CT) scan|DRUG: 68Ga-PSMA-11|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
Confirmation of Prostate Cancer Recurrence by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, Participants had suspected prostate cancer recurrence, and were evaluated with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and by conventional methodologies, eg, histopathology/biopsy and/or conventional imaging. The outcome will be reported as the percentage of participants for whom the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan was positive (confirmed by conventional methodologies) or negative (not confirmed by conventional methodologies). The outcome is reported as the number of participants without dispersion. Up to 1 year was allowed for result by the conventional methodology., up to 12 months
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Sensitivity and Specificity, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT sensitivity and specificity were assessed by comparing 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan results with conventional imaging follow-up and/or histopathology/biopsy within the following 1 year. Sensitivity is a percentage that estimates, within a group of participants, the proportion within that group that truly has a disease or condition. Specificity is a percentage that estimates, within a group of participants, the proportion within that group that truly does not have the disease or condition. The outcome is reported as the point estimates for sensitivity and specificity, given as percentages representing agreement between the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan result and the conventional assessment, and the 95% CI. A higher point estimate represents better agreement between the methodologies., up to 12 months|68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Predictive Value by Region, Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that participants with a positive screening test truly have the disease, and negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that participants with a negative screening test truly do not have the disease. Predictive Value for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was assessed by evaluating scans of the prostate, pelvic lymph nodes, paraaortic lymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes, bone, and lung. The outcome is reported as the probability as a percentage and the 95% CI., up to 12 months|Overall 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT Scan Quality Stratified by PSA Level, Scan quality was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) determinations for the 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans in participants stratified by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in ng/mL. Stratification levels were as follows.

* 0.2 to \< 0.5
* 0.5 to \< 1.0
* 1.0 to \< 2.0
* 2.0 to \< 5.0
* â‰¥ 5.0, The outcome is expressed as the Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, and NPV values observed for the PSA level strata, with 95% confidence interval., up to 12 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for detection of recurrent prostate cancer after initial therapy in patients with elevated PSA. PSMA refers to prostate-specific membrane antigen.

Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments at enrollment. Study participants will receive 68Ga-PSMA-11 and undergo a PET/CT. Participants will be contacted at 24 to 72 hours following the scan in order to capture potential late occurring adverse events. Clinical follow up of participant at 3 to 12 months following the scan in order to analyze secondary endpoints.
