A Study of Intravenous and Oral Isavuconazonium Sulfate in Pediatric Patients
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of multiple doses of intravenous (IV) and oral isavuconazonium sulfate administered daily in pediatric patients. The PK data will be utilized to establish a pediatric population PK model of isavuconazole, the active moiety of isavuconazonium sulfate.
Hematological Malignancy
DRUG: isavuconazonium sulfate - intravenous|DRUG: isavuconazonium sulfate - oral
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of isavuconazole in plasma: Cmax at steady state, Maximum concentration at steady state (Cmax) will be derived from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 7 days|PK of isavuconazole in plasma: AUCtau, Area under the concentration time curve from the time of dosing to the start of next dosing interval at multiple dose conditions (AUCtau) will be derived from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 7 days|PK of isavuconazole in plasma: tmax, Time of maximum concentration (tmax) will be derived from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 7 days|PK of isavuconazole in plasma: Ctrough, Concentration - trough level (Ctrough) will be derived from the PK plasma samples collected., Up to 28 days|PK of isavuconazole in plasma: CL, Clearance (CL) will be model-derived., Up to 28 days|PK of isavuconazole in plasma: Vss, Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) will be model-derived., Up to 28 days|PK of isavuconazole in plasma: AUCss, Area under the concentration-time curve at steady state (AUCss) will be model-derived., Up to 28 days|PK of isavuconazole in plasma: t 1/2, Half-life (t1/2) will be model-derived., Up to 28 days|Safety assessed by nature, frequency and severity of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), A TEAE is defined as an Adverse Event (AE) observed after starting administration of the study drug through follow-up. AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Number of patients with TEAE's will be summarized., Up to 58 days|Number of patients with vital sign abnormalities and/or adverse events, An abnormality identified during a medical test (e.g. vital signs) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets 1 of the following criteria: induces clinical signs or symptoms; requires active intervention; requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug; or the abnormality or test value is clinically significant., Up to 28 days|Number of patients with laboratory value abnormalities and/or adverse events, An abnormality identified during a medical test (e.g. laboratory parameter) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets 1 of the following criteria: induces clinical signs or symptoms; requires active intervention; requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug; or the abnormality or test value is clinically significant., Up to 28 days|Safety assessed by routine 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG), Standard 12-lead ECG recordings will be used for the purposes of safety assessment. A 12-lead, resting ECG is to be recorded. Patients should remain supine for at least 5 minutes prior to all ECGs being performed. The results (normal, abnormal not clinically significant, abnormal clinically significant) are to be recorded., Up to 28 days
