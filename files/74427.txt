mFOLFOXIRI Compared to mFOLFOX6 or CapeOx as Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage IIIB or IIIC Colorectal Cancer
This study will focus on postoperative patients of stage IIIB or stage IIIC colorectal cancer. These patients will start to accept chemotherapy in 3-4 weeks after operation, these patients were randomly divided into two groups, one group will accept adjuvant chemotherapy of mFOLFOX6 or CapeOX; another group will use mFOLFOXIRI, they can change the regimen to mFOLFOX6 or CapeOx after accepting not less than two complete chemotherapy regimen, if can not tolerate the adverse reaction of mFOLFOXIRI. The efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy will be compared between the two groups. Disease-free survival, overall survival, incidence of adverse reaction of chemotherapy and postoperative quality of life will be recorded.
