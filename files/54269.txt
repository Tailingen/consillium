Markers to Evaluate the Efficacy of PH-based Regimen as a Neoadjuvant Therapy for Operable HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
This study is to explore the markers in early prediction of the efficacy of pre-operative pertuzumab plus trastuzumab (PH) combined with chemotherapy for early stage or locally advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) positive primary breast cancer.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: TCHP
Percent Change in Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) on Positron Emission Tomography and Change in Gene Expression With Response, Change in SUVmax from baseline to Day 15 on 18-FDG PET and 68Ga-Affibody HER-2 Imaging PET in correlation with pathological complete response (pCR) in patients treated with preoperative pertuzumab/trastuzumab., From baseline to day 15
Pathologic complete response in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis ypN0), To determine whether the composite markers can predict pathologic complete response in the breast and lymph nodes in HER-2 positive breast cancer with PH combination with chemotherapy adjuvant therapy. Defined as the absence of any invasive component in the resected breast specimen and all resected lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant therapy (ypT0/Tis ypN0)., Immediately after the surgery|Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) (excluding Second Primary Non-Breast Cancer [SPNBC]), To determine the correlation between the composite markers and invasive disease free survival in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab pre-operatively. iDFS event was defined as the first occurrence of one of the following events: Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence; ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence; distant recurrence; death attributable to any cause; contralateral invasive breast cancer. All SPNBCs and in situ carcinomas (including ductal carcinoma in situ \[DCIS\] and lobular carcinoma in situ \[LCIS\]) and non-melanoma skin cancer were excluded as an event., Following surgery until Year 5|iDFS (including SPNBC), The iDFS event was defined as the first occurrence of one of the following events: Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence; ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence; distant recurrence; death attributable to any cause; contralateral invasive breast cancer; SPNBC (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers and in situ carcinoma of any site)., Following surgery until Year 5|Overall survival (OS), To determine the correlation between the composite markers and overall survival in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab pre-operatively. Percentage of participants who died due to any cause is reported., Following surgery until Year 5
This study is to evaluate the correlation between early changes in multiple markers and pathological complete response in breast and lyphm nodes (tpCR) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer receiving carboplatin, docetaxel and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (TCHP) pre-operatively. The markers would be examined by gene expression assays, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET), 68 Ga-Affibody HER-2 Imaging PET, and organoid drug sensitivity test. Approximately 94 patients were treated with PH-based neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, and would complete 1 year of PH-based regimen in the adjuvant setting. The primary endpoint is the percent change of SUVmax from baseline to Day 15 (after the first cycle of anti HER-2 targeting drug treatment) on FDG PET and HER-2 imagining PET in correlation with pathological complete response (pCR) in patients treated with preoperative pertuzumab and trastuzumab. pCR was defined as no viable invasive cancer in breast and axilla by local pathology review.
