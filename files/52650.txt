A Multi-omics Study of Metastatic Prostate Cancer (MOSMPCA)
The investigators plan to perform multi-omics technologies, including genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic methods, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, aiming at uncovering the mechanism of the tumor progression, identifying distinct tumor subtypes and finding new treatment targets.

Prostate cancer is the commonest malignancy and the second leading cause of tumor-related death among males worldwide. Though patients with early stage prostate cancer can obtain satisfactory therapeutic efficacy from radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, the prognosis of men with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa), especially metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), is still poor. Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of the high-throughput technologies, including genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic methods. These techniques are promising in uncovering the mechanism of the tumor progression, identifying distinct tumor subtypes and finding new treatment targets.

In the current prospective study, the investigators plan to perform multi-omics technologies in patients with mPCa, aiming at uncovering the mechanism of the tumor progression, identifying distinct tumor subtypes and finding new treatment targets.
