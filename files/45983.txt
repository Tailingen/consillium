Study of Venetoclax and Azacitidine in Advanced BCR-ABL Negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
The purpose of this research study is to look at how safe and useful a drug called azacitidine in combination with a drug called venetoclax, is in people with accelerated or blast phase BRC-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Myeloproliferative Neoplasm
DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Venetoclax
Proportion of participants achieving complete remission (CR)., 3 years|Proportion of participants achieving complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi)., 3 years|Proportion of participants achieving reversion to chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (CMPN)., 3 years
Average number of days from the first dose of azacytidine and venetoclax to the date of death., 3 years|Average number of days from CR until relapse., 3 years|Average number of days from CRi until relapse., 3 years|Average number of days from CMPN until relapse., 3 years|The proportion of patients proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation in those eligible for transplantation., 3 years
All participants in this study will receive azacitidine and venetoclax.

This study will be done in multiple stages:

Safety Run-In Period - 7 participants will receive the study drugs to ensure that the combination is safe and tolerable.

Stage 1 - About 15 participants will receive the study drugs and will be evaluated to see whether they respond to the study drugs.

Stage 2 - If enough participants in Stage 1 respond to the study drugs, then Stage 2 will begin. During this stage, an additional 25 participants will take part in the study to further see if participants respond to the study drugs.
