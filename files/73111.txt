Anti-CD33 CAR NK Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
CAR technology has been used in T cell therapy and gets great success in treating hematological diseases. Following models of CAR T cells, CAR NK cell therapy has been one hot point. For myeloid malignancies, CD33 is widely expressed. Targeting CD33 surface antigens by CAR NK cells provides an off-the-shelf immune cell therapy.
