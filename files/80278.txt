Mechanism of Response to IMFINZI Neoadjuvant Therapy in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Based on Multiple-omics Models
A single-center prospective exploratory single-arm neoadjuvant therapy study, based on a prospective cohort study, according to patients' blood and tumor samples before and after neoadjuvant treatment, WES, GEP gene expression profiling, TCR sequencing and ctDNA dynamic monitoring were used to explore the intratumoral immune consequences of PD-1 monoclonal antibody administration and identify potential Response biomarker.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Albumin Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin/Cisplatin
MPR, Major pathologic response is defined as the presence of 10% or less of vital tumor cells in the sections of the primary lesion and/or mediastinal lymph nodes presenting focal microscopic disease after surgery, At the date of tumor assessment after surgery, estimated at approximately 24 weeks post-baseline
Progression free survival, The progression free survival is the time until the patients disease progresses, at 24 months from the first dose of neadjuvant treatment|Overall survival, Time when the patient is still alive, at 3 years from the first dose of neoadjuvant treatment|Toxicity profile, Toxicities caused by the drug during the study, from the first dose of neoadjuvant treatment until 90 days after the last dose of adjuvant treatment
To explore the safety and immunobiological effects of 2 cycles of duvalumab combined with albumin paclitaxel + cisplatin/carboplatin for patients with stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer; use whole exome sequencing , GEP gene expression profile detection based on NanoString platform and other methods to predict the efficacy of IMFINZI neoadjuvant therapy, looking for potential biomarkers; study the impact of neoadjuvant therapy of I drug on the tumor microenvironment at multiple levels such as genome, transcriptome, PD-1/PD-L1 protein transcription and expression, T cell TCR immune groupthe library and T cell subsets, and provide comprehensive exploratory research evidence for finding the biomarker for the neoadjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy of lung cancer .
