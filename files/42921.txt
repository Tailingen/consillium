Expanded Cord Blood Cell Infusion Following Combination Chemotherapy in Younger Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This pilot clinical trial studies infusion of expanded cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells following combination chemotherapy in treating younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has relapsed or has not responded to treatment. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Chemotherapy also kills healthy infection-fighting cells, increasing the risk of infection. The infusion of expanded cord blood hematopoietic progenitor cells may be able to replace blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. This cellular therapy may decrease the risk of infection following chemotherapy.
