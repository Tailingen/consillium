Effects of Preoperative Anxiety and Depression on Short-term Postoperative Recovery in Early Gastric Cancer
This study aims to investigate preoperative anxiety, depression, and coping strategy of the patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy for early gastric cancer and their effects on short-term postoperative recovery measured by Quality of Recovery-15 (QOR-15). The findings of the study would improve the perioperative management of early gastric cancer patients.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Quality of Recovery -15
Quality of Recovery -15 score at postoperative 72 hours, There are total 15 items where each of them is an 11-point numerical rating scale (for positive items, 0 = "none of the time" to 10 = "all of the time"; for negative items, the scoring was reversed; maximum score 150), at postoperative 72 hours
Quality of Recovery -15 score at postoperative 24 hours, There are total 15 items where each of them is an 11-point numerical rating scale (for positive items, 0 = "none of the time" to 10 = "all of the time"; for negative items, the scoring was reversed; maximum score 150), at postoperative 24 hours|Quality of Recovery -15 score at postoperative 48 hours, There are total 15 items where each of them is an 11-point numerical rating scale (for positive items, 0 = "none of the time" to 10 = "all of the time"; for negative items, the scoring was reversed; maximum score 150), at postoperative 48 hours|Postoperative pain score, 11-pointed NRS pain score at resting/coughing/movement NRS (0-10): 0, "no pain"; 10, "worst pain imaginable", at postoperative 24, 48, and 72 hours|Length of stay, The number of days that patients spend in the hospital after surgery, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Postoperative nausea or vomiting, Patients' postoperative nausea/vomiting: for each, 0, no; 1 yes, but not severe enough to take antiemetics; 2, yes, severe enough to take antiemetics, at postoperative 24, 48, and 72 hours
The researchers plan to investigate preoperative psychological factors such as anxiety, depression, and coping strategy in association with short-term quality of recovery from surgery in 100 patients scheduled for early gastric cancer surgery (laparoscopic gastrectomy).

The following items are investigated before surgery; Age, sex, BMI, level of education, occupation, marital status, ECOG performance status, ASA physical status, Apfel score, history of mental disorder, type of surgery, past surgical history, the number of days from diagnosis of cancer to surgery, clinical stage of cancer, histological type of cancer, presence of chronic pain, Quality of Recovery-15 (QOR-15), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS), Coping and Adaptation Scale-Short Form (CAPS-SF).

The QOR-15 is investigated for 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. The severity of postoperative pain by the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) is concurrently measured at 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery. In addition, the researchers measure postoperative complications, particularly nausea/vomiting, at 24, 48, and 72 hours after surgery and length of stay by counting the number of days from the day of surgery to discharge.
