Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, For participants who demonstrate confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR, DOR is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions) until progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1 adjusted for this study to allow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the SOD of target lesions.

The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD., Up to approximately 28 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved CR (disappearance of all target lesions), PR (at least a 30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions), or stable disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD) after ≥6 weeks (the start of the window for the first scheduled scan) per RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR.
