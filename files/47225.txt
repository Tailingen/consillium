Supportive Care for Patients With Hematological Malignancies Undergoing Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
This pilot clinical trial studies supportive care for patients with hematological malignancies undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant. Supportive care may improve quality of life in this patient population.
Hematopoietic/Lymphoid Cancer
OTHER: palliative care|OTHER: questionnaire administration|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment
Study participation rates defined as the proportion of patients who consent to enroll, Will mainly be descriptive., Up to 5 months|Completion time for the supportive care consultation, Will mainly be descriptive., Up to 90 days post-treatment|Level of comfort / distress attributed to individual parts of the consultation, Will mainly be descriptive. The post-consultation scores measuring level of comfort or distress per topic in the supportive care consultation will be summarized per item., Up to 90 days post-treatment|Completeness of follow-up data collection, where completeness is defined by the proportion of instrument scores that can be calculated per given time point, Will mainly be descriptive. The completeness of follow-up data collection will be calculated and reported as a proportion of successfully completed scales vs. scales attempted to be collected or completed by patients., Up to 90 days post-treatment
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Pilot a supportive care intervention that begins prior to transplantation and continues through the acute peritransplant period.

II. Determine the proportion of patients who enroll and the level of comfort / distress of hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients who meet with the supportive care team.

III. Pilot data collection mechanisms and cost retrieval in preparation for a randomized clinical trial.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo supportive care consultation before transplantation and at least once monthly while they remain at the transplant center.
