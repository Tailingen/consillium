Study to Evaluate Markers of Response in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the association between image and certain molecular markers with complete response in patients with locally advanced breast cancer, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy composed of Bevacizumab, Docetaxel and Doxorubicin.
Breast Neoplasms
OTHER: Bevacizumab, docetaxel and doxorubicin followed by surgery
Evaluation of SNPs genotyping., The analysis of genetic differences will be determined through analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms. It will be assesed before starting the treatment using Affymetrix's Human Mapping 500k array set., This evaluation will be performed within 14 days before start of treatment|Assessment of tumoral response by Dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), The radiological interpretation of the images will evaluate size, shape, extent, distribution and kinetics of the lesons according to American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR BIRADS- MRI (2003) guidelines)., This evaluation will be performed within 14 days before start of treatment (baseline assesment).|Assessment of tumoral response by Dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), The radiological interpretation of the images will evaluate size, shape, extent, distribution and kinetics of the lesons according to American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR BIRADS- MRI (2003) guidelines)., This evaluation will be performed within 12-19 days after first cycle|Assessment of tumoral response by Dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), The radiological interpretation of the images will evaluate size, shape, extent, distribution and kinetics of the lesons according to American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR BIRADS- MRI (2003) guidelines)., This evaluation will be performed within 12-19 days aftet fifth cycle.|Positron emission tomography (PET) scan, It will be determined the association between tissue:blood activity ratio and hypoxic tumor volume by 18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography (FMISO-PET). DNA synthesis, assesed by \[18F\]-fluoro-3'-deoxy-3'-L-fluorothymidine PET (FLT-PET), will be compared to quantitative kinetics data adquired through previously described DCE-MRI. Finally, these results will be correlated with the Risk Score obtained in the genomic analysis, This evaluation will be performed within 14 days before start of treatment (baseline assesment)|Positron emission tomography (PET) scan, It will be determined the association between tissue:blood activity ratio and hypoxic tumor volume by 18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography (FMISO-PET).

Description:|Evaluation of Proteomic expression in blood serum, To determine the proteomic expression in blood serum, a ZeptoMARK Reverse Array assay will be performed according to manufacturer's instructions., This evaluation will be performed within 12-19 days aftet fifth cycle.
Evaluation of Complete pathological response in surgical piece, To determine if a patient has undergone complete pathological response, an anatomo-pathological study will be conducted on the surgical piece. The evaluation will follow the Miller and Payne criteria; a complete response will be considered just in the absence of invasive tumor cells in breast and lymphatic nodules., This evaluation will be performed within 20-22 weeks after start of treatment.
This is a pharmacogenomic phase II, multicenter, prospective clinical trial whose main objective is to evaluate the association of molecular and imaging markers with the response to bevacizumab administration in combination with docetaxel and doxorubicin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients diagnose with locally advanced breast cancer.
