Antibodies Production After Covid-19 Vaccination Among Patients With Medical History of Cancer and Anti-CD-20 Treatment
This is a Phase II study designed to investigate if the Covid 19 vaccines are capable of eliciting production of antibodies against S protein of Sar-S-Cov-2 virus among patients with medical history of cancer previously treated with monoclonal anti CD-20 antibodies. The antibody production is defined based on the detection of antibodies in the serologic Covid-19 rapid test against S protein or with semiquantitative assay when it becomes available.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Laboratory Samples
Primary Objective, To determine if patients with cancer history or HIV positivity previously treated with monoclonal anti CD-20 are able to produce antibodies after Covid-19 vaccination.

a. Antibody Production defined as: 1. Positive serologic Covid-19 antibodies rapid test against S protein., Two weeks after full dose vaccination.
Secondary objective 1, Evaluate the Correlation of immunoglobulin levels and the development of Covid-19 antibodies., Two weeks after full dose vaccination.|Secondary objective 2, Evaluate the correlation of CD4/CD8 counts with the development of Covid-19 antibodies., Two weeks after full dose vaccination.
