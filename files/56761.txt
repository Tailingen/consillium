MR-guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) on Pediatric Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine if Magnetic Resonance guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ablative therapy is safe and feasible for children, adolescents, and young adults with refractory or relapsed solid tumors.

Toxicity, Toxicity will be evaluated using CTCAEv4. Adverse events will be summarized descriptively with tabulations of adverse event type, severity, and relationship to study treatment., 28 days following ablative therapy
Disease response, We will preliminarily define tumor response from MR-HIFU ablative therapy assessed according to a modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). We will also evaluate functional tumor response using FDG-PET post MR-HIFU ablative treatment for patients with PET avid target lesions., Up to 1 year|Patient reported outcomes and quality of life measurements, We will use a validated symptom distress scale and quality of life metrics pre- and post-therapy at scheduled intervals., Up to 1 year|Immune Markers, Changes in immune markers from baseline and post therapy will be evaluated., Pre-treatment, 1 day post treatment, 7 days post treatment
Magnetic Resonance (MR)-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is an innovative technique that allows for non-invasive thermal ablation of tissue. Advantages over conventional local tumor control such as surgery, radiation, or radiofrequency are that MR-HIFU is completely non-invasive, non-ionizing, and enables ablation of large tumor volumes with avoidance of adjacent tissue injury. This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of MR-HIFU ablative therapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with refractory or relapsed solid tumors that are located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone. Patients â‰¤ 30 years of age with refractory or relapsed solid tumors with measurable target lesions that are located in bone or soft tissue in close proximity to bone are eligible. Tolerability will be defined during the 14 days following MR-HIFU ablation. Patients will continue to be followed for tumor response and secondary outcomes for up to one year post ablation treatment.
