Prognostic Factors Influencing the Recurrence Rate and Survival of Patients With Colorectal Cancer: a Single Institution Experience
over the past decade colon cancer has emerged as the second most deadly and the third most common type of cancer in the world with increasing incidence in Egypt due to life style and diet change. some research showed relation between colon cancer recurrence and advanced tumor staging. To investigators knowledge, this is the first time to be done in Zagazig University.

Data was collected from records in a retrospective cohort study
Colorectal Cancer
