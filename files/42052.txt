The Exploratory Study on the Biological Function of Dendritic Cells In Vivo Supported by Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (Vital NAD)
The main purpose of this study is to explore the PK/PD changes of NMN and DC cells after oral NMN combined with DC cells injection in patients after tumor surgery, and evaluate the biological age of adults, TCR diversity, SiRT1 expression level, SF-36 quality of life, OS, antigen specific immune response (TAA), cytokines and so on. In this study, 20 postoperative tumor patients who meet the entry and excretion criteria were recruited to explore the clinical potential of NMN combined with DC cell vaccine.
