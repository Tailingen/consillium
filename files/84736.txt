Phase II, Open Label, Single Arm Study of SAR302503 In Myelofibrosis Patients Previously Treated With Ruxolitinib
Primary Objective:

- To evaluate the efficacy of once daily dose of SAR302503 in subjects previously treated with ruxolitinib and with a current diagnosis of intermediate-1 with symptoms, Intermediate-2 or high-risk primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (Post-PV MF), or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (Post-ET MF) based on the reduction of spleen volume at the end of 6 treatment cycles;

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the effect of SAR302503 on Myelofibrosis (MF) associated symptoms as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) diary
* To evaluate the durability of splenic response
* To evaluate the splenic response to SAR302503 by palpation at the end of Cycle 6
* To evaluate the splenic response to SAR302503 at the end of Cycle 3
* To evaluate the effect of SAR302503 on the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F allele burden
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAR302503 in this population
* To evaluate plasma concentrations of SAR302503 for population PK analysis, if warranted

The expected duration of the treatment in this study is approximately 8 months, based on a maximum 28-day screening period, followed by a 6-month (6-cycle) treatment period, and an EOT visit for subjects who will not continue the treatment after completing the 6 cycles of SAR302503, or discontinue the treatment early for any reasons as well as a follow-up visit which should occur 30 days after the last administration of SAR302503. Patients who continue to benefit clinically will be allowed to remain on study medication beyond the 6-month treatment period until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
