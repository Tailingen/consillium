A Phase II Pilot Study to Assess the Presence of Molecular Factors Predictive for Hematologic Response in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Patients Receiving Deferasirox Therapy.
Several previous studies (clinical and non-clinical) hypothesize that treatment with deferasirox causes a hematological improvement in transfused patients with low and intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome. The purpose of this study was to assess the presence of genetic biomarkers predictive for hematologic response by the use of gene expression profiling of bone marrow aspirates obtained from MDS patients with or without hematological response.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
PROCEDURE: Bone marrow aspirate|DRUG: Deferasirox
Fold Increase/Decrease in Gene Transcription From Baseline Bone Marrow Aspirate of Responders Versus Non-responders', Using next-generation sequencing, gene expression profiling in responder and non-responder patients were to be performed on existing bone marrow aspirate samples. Gene transcription were then to be compared between the two groups and the fold increase/decrease in differentially expressed genes were to be calculated., 18 months
Time to Response, The time to response is defined as the time (in months) between the date of deferasirox initiation and the date of the first documented hematological response only in the responder group., 18 months|Changes in Serum Ferritin Levels, From baseline to time of response (responder group) or time to last follow up (non-responders), Baseline, 18 months|Deferasirox Dose Used, Deferasirox dose is defined as the average daily dose (mg/kg/d) given to the patient from treatment initiation to the emergence of hematological response in the responder group or the time of enrollment in the study in the non-responder group., 18 months|Changes in Serum Transferrin Levels, From baseline to time of response (responder group) or time to last follow up (non-responders), Baseline, 18 months|Changes in Transferrin Saturation Levels, From baseline to time of response (responder group) or time to last follow up (non-responders), Baseline, 18 months
This trial was terminated due to low enrollment.
