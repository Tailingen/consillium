Predicting toxicity in elderly patients with head and neck cancer, validating a disease-oriented toxicity predictive tool and integrating it with avail-able screening tools for better outcomes, 2 years
We aim to analyze clinical and biochemical variables to prospectively create and validate an independ-ent predictive score to identify the probability of G3-5 toxicity in HNC elderly patients candidated to a curative treatment with radiation treatment +/- systemic treatment.
