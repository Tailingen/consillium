Telehealth & HPV Self-Collection
This study aims to compare the efficacy and participant experience of telehealth-based, self-collected cervical cancer screening to mail-based, self-collected cervical cancer screening across the adult female screening lifespan. This will be done by evaluating sufficient Human papillomavirus (HPV) sample collection and determining preference for self-collection verses provider collection, comparing role of telehealth in pre- and post- menopausal women's comfort with self-collection, comparing self-collection completion rates for women with and without telehealth visits.
