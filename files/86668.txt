A Study of Ametumumab in Combination With Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody and FOLFIRI in Patients With RAS Wild-type Advanced Colorectal Cancer
This is a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, A phase IIb clinical trial of efficacy and safety of Ametumumab in combination with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody and FOLFIRI versus Ametumumab or Cetuximab in combination with FOLFIRI in patients with RAS wild-type advanced colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Ametumumab|DRUG: Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: FOLFIRI
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS will be measured from the date of first dose of study drug until first documented clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression by RECIST 1.1, clinical progression, start of new therapy or death. approximately 45 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as a CR or PR per RECIST version 1.1 recorded from the date of randomization until date of first documentation of PD, death, or start of new anti-cancer therapy, approximately 45 months.|incidence of adverse events, Incidence and severity of AEs graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0, Duration of study, approximately 45 months
This is a multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, phase IIb trial. This study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of Ametumumab (anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) combined with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody in first-line treatment of RAS wild-type colorectal cancer patients, as well as to assess the immunogenicity and pharmacokinetic profile and recommend dosing regimen for phase III clinical trials.Conditions and keywords.
