Pyrotinib as Neoadjuvant Agent for Non-objective Response HER2-positive Early Breast Cancer
The study assesses the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment with pyrotinib and trastuzumab with chemotherapy, mainly pathological complete response (pCR) rates in the breast and axilla.

And also assesses side effects, event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and objective response rates (ORR).
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pyrotinib|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, Number of patients with pCR (no invasive breast cancer in the breast and axilla), up to 30 weeks
Number of patients with grade >3 adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, To describe the safety of the various regimens toxicity is compared between the two arms., up to 30 weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., up to 30 weeks|Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS was defined as the time from surgery to the first date of breast cancer relapse, second primary tumor (including contralateral breast cancer), or death without documented prior relapse. Data will be reported when they are mature and available, likely when a median of 3 years follow up has been reached., Following surgery, every 12 months until Year 10|Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS will be defined as the time from random assignment to documentation of the first of the following events: discontinuation of study therapy due to protocol-defined progression prior to surgery; local, regional, or distant recurrence of breast cancer following curative surgery; a new breast cancer; another new onset malignancy; or death as a result of any cause., From date of randomization until follow-up to 10 years|Distant-disease- free survival (DDFS), DDFS is defined as the time period from randomization to the first event., From date of randomization until follow-up to 10 years
Investigational Medical Products (IMPs) will be pyrotinib (B), trastuzumab (H), pertuzumab (P), docetaxel (T), epirubicin (E), and cyclophosphamide (C).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed at baseline and 2 cycles after neoadjuvant therapy with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel (THP\*2). Non-objective response patients will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 2 cycles of pyrotinib and trastuzumab with docetaxel followed by 4 cycles of pyrotinib and epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (THB\*2-ECB\[epirubicine, cyclophosphamide, and pyrotinib\]\*4, cohort A), or 2 cycles of trastuzumab and pertuzumab with docetaxel followed by 4 cycles of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (THP\*2-EC\*4, cohort B).

During the neoadjuvant therapy, the side effects and all the events were recorded and analyzed. After surgery, the efficacy of pCR rate and ORR were analyzed. And long time follow-up will also be performed to analyze EFS, DFS, DDFS, and ORR.
