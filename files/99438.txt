Tranexamic Acid Use for Bleeding Prevention in the Surgical Treatment of Metastatic Spinal Tumor in Lung Cancer Patients
Massive blood loss occurs in metastatic spinal tumor resection and may cause severe complications. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the use of tranexamic acid will reduce perioperative and postoperative bleeding when compared to those without use of tranexamic acid.
Metastasis Spinal Tumor
DRUG: Tranexamic Acid|DRUG: stroke-physiological saline solution (SPSS)
total blood loss, the loss of total blood volume caused by various operations (mainly during surgical operations) throughout the entire treatment process.

Total blood volume = preoperative blood volume \*（preoperative hematocrit - hematocrit 3 days postoperatively）, measured 3 days postoperatively|Intraoperative blood loss, Refers to the total blood loss of a patient experienced during operation from skin incision to wound suture.

Intraoperative blood loss = intraoperative drainage volume - intraoperative flushing volume + blood loss estimation using gauze (calculated as 10 cm × 10 cm gauze absorbs 10 ml), 1 day (measured once after surgery)
allogeneic transfusion blood volume, amount of allogeneic transfusion blood volume needed during operation, 1 day (measured once during surgery)
