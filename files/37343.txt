Anti-PD-1 Re-challenge After Immune Priming by Ipilimumab and Immune Boosting by Radiotherapy in Advanced NSCLC
Still many advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients do not benefit from PD-(L)1 inhibition or will eventually develop progression through secondary resistance. Inhibition of CTLA-4, application of radiotherapy together with PD-1 inhibition showed synergistic effects and is deemed safe.

Still many advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients do not benefit from PD-(L)1 inhibition or will eventually develop progression through secondary resistance. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the combining of T cell priming by CTLA-4 inhibition (ipilimumab) ad subsequent immune boosting by stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on 1-4 tumor lesions can re-invigorate the response on PD-1 inhibition (cemiplimab) after initial non-response or secondary resistance to anti-PD-(L)1 treatment. Elaborate translational research by repeat biopsies in combination with blood collection during the different stages of treatment will help improve understanding of the joint effort of these different interventions.
