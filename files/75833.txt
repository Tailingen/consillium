Validation of Ferromagnetic Tracer in Melanoma Sentinel Node
This study has been designed to validate a non-radioactive method to identify the sentinel lymph node using a superparamagnetic iron-oxide (SPIO) tracer respect to the traditional isotopic method. Both methods are used in every included patient and each patient is its own control.
Melanoma Stage|Sentinel Lymph Node
SN detection, Detection of potential sentinel nodes using both methods (isotopic and ferromagnetic tracers). Máximum register of isotopic and ferromagnetic measurement will be the main criteria., During surgery
SN agreement, Agreement in isotopic and ferromagnetic sentinel node identification. Measurement criteria will be coincidence in the same node (or nodes)., During surgery
* Injection of the isotopic tracer in standard form and in the usual preoperative period (hours-day).
* Identical injection in three-four punctures of 2 mL of Sienna+ ® and local massage of 5-10 minutes.
* Optional: colorant injection in standard form. Local massage of 5-10 minutes.
* After 20 minutes: transcutaneous measurement with SentiMag®
* Valuing territories (lymphoscintigraphy information?)
* Surgical identification measures:

  1. st with SentiMag®
  2. nd with gamma detection probe
* Ex vivo check and HRD record
