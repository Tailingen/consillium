Phase 2a Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of HL301 on Radiation Pneumonitis in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety when HL301 is administered to unresectable non-small cell lung cancer patients who receive chemoradiotherapy with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin and to search for a clinically appropriate dose by evaluating the efficacy by comparing the radiation pneumonia incidence rate with the control group.
