Elastography Interest in the Management of Thyroid Nodules
Define an ultrasound/elastography benignity criteria in strategy management of a patient population carries one or more thyroid nodules.
Thyroid Nodules
DEVICE: Medical ultrasound device (ShearWave system)
Defined echo/elastography benignity criteria, For ultrasound and elastography benignity criteria which will be retained, outcome focus on cytoponctions number for benin nodules can be avoided by taking into account this benign criteria, two and half years
Evaluate the diagnostic performance of elastography ShearWave for characterization of thyroid nodules in a population of patients referred for needle biopsy or surgery nodule thyroid, ROC curves for performance of ultrasound, elastography and their coupling, compared to the reference cytology / histology., two and half years|Assessing the use of elastography in clinical practice, two and half years
Define an ultrasound/elastography benignity criteria in strategy management of a patient population carries one or more thyroid nodules.
