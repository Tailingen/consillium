This is a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study conducted in adult subjects with relapsed and refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in China to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics(PK), pharmacodynamics(PD) of JWCAR029 and immune response after JWCAR029 treatment.

R/R MCL patients will be enrolled in dose level of 1.0 x 10\^8 CAR+ T cells. All subjects will be followed for 5 years following JWCAR029 infusion.
