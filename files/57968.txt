Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. It is not yet known which regimen of stereotactic body radiation therapy is more effective in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of two radiation therapy regimens and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

Counts of ≥ Grade 3 Adverse Events (AE) Graded by CTCAE v4 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) That Are Definitely, Probably, or Possibly Related to Treatment (DPPRT), Number of patients with ≥ grade 3 AE occurring within 1 year of treatment (TRT) start and reported as DPPRT among this subset of CTCAE v4: pericardial effusion, pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, dysphagia, esophagitis, esophageal fistula/obstruction/perforation/stenosis/ulcer/hemorrhage, rib fracture, brachial plexopathy, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, myelitis, atelectasis, bronchopulmonary/mediastinal/pleural/tracheal hemorrhage, bronchial/pulmonary/bronchopleural/tracheal fistula, hypoxia, bronchial/tracheal obstruction, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, skin ulceration (thorax only), FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume) or FVC (forced vital capacity) decline, or grade 5 related to TRT. Each arm is considered independently. For each arm, \>=5 of 38 analyzable subjects experiencing a grade ≥ 3 AE during the 1st year following TRT start would determine the respective TRT excessively toxic. For each arm this design provides 88% power with a 0.10 type I error rate., From start of treatment to 1 year
1-year Primary Tumor Control Rate, Primary tumor control is defined as the lack of primary tumor failure. Primary tumor failure is defined as the development of in-field or marginal failure. Primary tumor control time is defined as time from randomization to the the date of primary tumor failure, last known follow-up (censored), or death without failure (competing risk). Primary tumor control rates are estimated using the cumulative incidence method., From start of treatment to 1 year|1-year Overall Survival Rate, Overall survival time is defined as time from registration/randomization to the date of death from any cause or last known follow-up (censored). Overall survival rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method., From start of treatment to 1 year|1-year Disease-free Survival Rate, Disease-free survival is defined as being alive without experiencing in-field, marginal, involved lobe, regional or metastatic failure, development of a second primary, or death due to any cause. Disease-free survival time is defined as time from randomization to the the date of first failure or last known follow-up (censored). Disease-free survival rates are estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., From start of treatment to 1 year|Change in Peak Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) at 12 Weeks Post-radiotherapy, Standardized uptake value (SUV) describes the level of biologic activity in a particular spot compared to activity elsewhere in the body. An SUV reading of 1 is considered normal cellular activity, with higher values indicating increased activity. Peak SUV is an average SUV computed within a fixed-size volume of interest (VOI), most often containing (and not necessarily centered on) the hottest pixel value. Peak SUV was measured from whole-body FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography) scans that were required at baseline and requested (not required) at 12 weeks and 12 months post-radiotherapy. Change from baseline is calculated by subtracting the follow-up value from the baseline value. A positive change from baseline indicates decreased SUV., Baseline and 12 weeks post-radiotherapy|Change in Peak Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) at One Year Post-radiotherapy, Standardized uptake value (SUV) describes the level of biologic activity in a particular spot compared to activity elsewhere in the body.

An SUV reading of 1 is considered normal cellular activity, with higher values indicating increased activity. SUV was measured from whole-body FDG-PET scans that were required at baseline and requested (not required) at 12 weeks and 12 months post-radiotherapy. Normalized SUV = peak SUV of regions of interest / mean SUV of the aortic arch. Change from baseline is calculated by subtracting the follow-up value from the baseline value.

Secondary

* To estimate the 1-year primary tumor control rate in these patients.
* To estimate the 1-year overall survival and disease-free survival rate of these patients.
* To assess FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography) standardized uptake value changes as a measure of treatment response and outcomes.
* To determine pulmonary function changes by treatment arm and response.
* To determine the association between biomarkers and primary tumor control and/or ≥ grade 2 radiation pneumonitis.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Zubrod performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2) and T stage (T1 vs T2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
