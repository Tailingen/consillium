A Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Volrustomig Â± Casdatifan vs Nivolumab + Ipilimumab as 1L Treatment for Advanced ccRCC
This is a Phase Ib/III, randomized, multicenter, global study evaluating the efficacy and safety of volrustomig in combination with casdatifan for the first-line (1L) treatment of participants with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Volrustomig|DRUG: Casdatifan|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Phase Ib: Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Number of participants who received at least one dose of study treatment will be assessed., Approximately 39 months|Phase III: Progression-free Survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Approximately 38 months|Phase III: Overall Survival (OS), The OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Approximately 67 months
Phase Ib: Objective Response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR)., Approximately 39 months|Phase Ib: Duration of Response (DoR), The DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented confirmed response until date of documented progression or death due to any cause., Approximately 39 months|Phase Ib: Progression-free Survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Approximately 39 months|Phase Ib: Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed CR or PR or who have stable disease (SD) after randomization., Approximately 39 months|Phase Ib: Volrustomig concentration in serum, To assess the serum concentration of volrustomig when administered concomitantly with casdatifan., Up to 27 months|Phase Ib: Casdatifan concentration in plasma, To assess the plasma concentration of casdatifan when administered concomitantly with volrustomig., Up to 27 months|Phase Ib: Time to Response (TTR), The TTR is defined as the time from randomization until the first documentation of a subsequently confirmed objective response., Approximately 39 months|Phase III: Overall Survival, The OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Approximately 67 months|Phase III: Number of participants with AEs and SAEs, Number of participants who received at least one dose of study treatment will be assessed., Approximately 67 months|Phase III: Time to second progression or death (PFS2), The PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to the earliest progression event after the start of the first subsequent therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 67 months|Phase III: Objective Response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or confirmed PR., Approximately 67 months|Phase III: Duration of Response (DoR), The DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented confirmed response until date of documented progression or death due to any cause., Approximately 67 months|Phase III: Progression-free Survival, The PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Approximately 67 months
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the recommended Phase III dose (RP3D) of volrustomig and measure the efficacy and safety of volrustomig in combination with casdatifan compared with nivolumab plus ipilimumab in participants with advanced ccRCC (as 1L treatment).

The study comprises of 2 parts -

In Phase 1b part of the study, participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either dose 1 or dose 2 of volrustomig in combination with casdatifan.

In Phase III part of the study, participants will be randomized in 1:1:1 to receive either Volrustomig (at the dose to be determined in the Phase Ib) in combination with casdatifan, volrustomig monotherapy or standard of care (nivolumab plus ipilimumab).
