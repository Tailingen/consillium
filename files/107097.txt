Efficacy and Safety of Sitravatinib Plus Tislelizumab or Placebo Plus Tislelizumab Versus Placebo as Adjuvant Treatment in Participants With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of sitravatinib plus tislelizumab or placebo plus tislelizumab versus placebo. The study will also compare the recurrence-free survival (RFS) in participants with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are at high risk of recurrence after surgical resection.
