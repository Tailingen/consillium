Percentage of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03, from screening to post-study visit, assessed up to 28 days
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalency of two preparations of ensartinib capsules in Chinese healthy volunteers under fasted state or after meal. In addition, the safety of single dose administration of ensartinib capsules in Chinese healthy volunteers will also be evaluated.
