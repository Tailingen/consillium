A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of QLC1101 in Combination With Other Therapies in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring a KRAS G12D Mutation
A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of QLC1101 in Combination with Other Therapies in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring a KRAS G12D Mutation.

The study includes Phase Ib (combination therapy with dose escalation stage) and Phase II (expansion stage). The study will includes a total of 4 cohorts:

Phase Ib will enroll subjects in 4 cohorts (cohorts 1-4). Subjects will be allocated to appropriate cohorts by the investigator according to specific indications and treated with the corresponding combination regimen for safety and tolerability assessment. The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design will be used for dose escalation and MTD determination.

In Phase II, according to the results of the Phase Ib and SMC decision, 1-2 appropriate dose groups will be selected. In the dose group(s), the sample size (including subjects in the dose escalation stage) will be increased to 20 for each indication according to the cohort for expansion to further evaluate the efficacy of QLC1101 combination therapy in the treatment of subjects with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12D mutations
