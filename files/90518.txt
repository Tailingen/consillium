This trial is a multi-center, open label, single-arm, phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HY004 treatment in Adult (aged 18\~65 years old) patients with r/r B-cell ALL.

The phase I part of the trial is to evaluate the safety, optimal dose of HY004, Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics(PK/PD)and preliminary efficacy in the treatment of Adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL. The phase II part of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HY004 in in the treatment of Adult patients with r/r B-cell ALL. The study includes screening, pre-treatment (Cell Product manufacture \& lymphodepletion), HY004 infusion, safety and efficacy follow-up, and survival follow-up. All subjects who have received HY004 infusion will be followed for up to 2 years.
