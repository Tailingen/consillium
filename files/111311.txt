Pre- vs. Postoperative Scalp Block for Pain Control After Supratentorial Craniotomy
Study was designed to evaluate optimal timing for selective scalp block in patients undergoing general anesthesia for supratentorial craniotomy.Pain score assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) preoperatively (baseline) and after extubation at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours; time first request of a patient for rescue analgesia; intraoperative anesthetics and opioids consumption; awakening time; perioperative complications.
Supratentorial Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Scalp Block
Visual Analogue Scale score at 24 h after surgery, Visual Analogue Scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain),, up to 24 hours
