A Study of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Infusion
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)(Phase 1), Phase 1 -MTD defined as the highest dose level in which 6 patients have been treated with less than 2 instances of dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Dose limiting toxicity is based on adverse events and includes unacceptable hematologic toxicity, unacceptable non-hematologic toxicity, and laboratory abnormalities of Grade 4 or higher., 28 day cycle of therapy|Objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response [CR + PR])(Phase 2), Tumor response and progression will be evaluated every 8 weeks according to the Lugano Classification (Cheson et al 2014)., Approximately 2 years
Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of PLM60, Approximately 1 years
Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the time point of t (AUC0-t), Approximately 1 years|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity (AUC0-∞), Approximately 1 years|Apparent terminal phase elimination rate constant (λz), Approximately 1 years|Apparent terminal elimination half-life (T½β), Approximately 1 years|Apparent volume of distribution (V), Approximately 1 years|Total clearance (CL/F), Approximately 1 years|Distribution volume (Vd/F), Approximately 1 years
The Phase 1 part of this study is designed to identify the MTD and RP2D, and to characterize the safety, tolerability, and PK. The Phase 1 part of the study will include 2 parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

After confirmation of the RP2D in the expansion part of Phase 1, enrolment into the Phase 2 part of the study will begin. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the investigational drug when administered to patients with relapsed or refractory NHL.
