MRI in Assessing Hypoxia in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI, may help measure oxygen levels in tumor cells. It may also help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well MRI works in assessing hypoxia in patients with localized prostate cancer undergoing stereotactic body radiation therapy.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging|PROCEDURE: dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging|PROCEDURE: magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging|PROCEDURE: tissue-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging
Status of global hypoxia within the prostate as assessed by blood-oxygen-level-dependent and tissue-oxygen-level-dependent MRI|Tumor vasculature and metabolism within the prostate as assessed by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging|Correlation of prostate and normal tissue hypoxia before treatment with clinical outcomes after treatment
OBJECTIVES:

* To characterize the status of global hypoxia within the prostate before stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as assessed by blood-oxygen-level-dependent and tissue-oxygen-level-dependent MRI.
* To characterize tumor vasculature and metabolism within the prostate before SBRT as assessed by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, respectively.
* Correlate prostate and normal tissue hypoxia before SBRT with clinical outcomes (toxicity and biochemical \[PSA\] control) after SBRT.

OUTLINE: Within 1-3 weeks before beginning stereotactic body radiotherapy, patients undergo T2-weighted anatomic MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging, blood-oxygen-level-dependent and tissue-oxygen-level-dependent MRI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.
