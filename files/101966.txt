A Phase Ib Study of LXH254-centric Combinations in NSCLC or Melanoma
To characterize safety and tolerability and identify a recommended dose and regimen for the LXH254 in combination with LTT462 or trametinib or ribociclib.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Melanoma
DRUG: LXH254|DRUG: LTT462|DRUG: Trametinib|DRUG: Ribociclib
Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a measure of safety and tolerability, up to 5 years|Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) (dose escalation only), up to 3 years|Tolerability measured by the number of subjects who have interruptions/reductions of study treatment and reason for interruptions/reductions, up to 5 years|Tolerability measured by the dose intensity of study drug, Relative Dose intensity for subjects with non-zero duration of exposure is computed as the ratio of dose intensity and planned dose intentity, Up to 5 years
