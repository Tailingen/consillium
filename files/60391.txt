Advanced or Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma
This is a single-arm, open, multicenter trial of carralizumab in combination with albumin paclitaxel and apatinib mesylate for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. The study enlists patients with histopathologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (including intrahepatic, extrahepatic, and distal cholangiocarcinoma). Previously, she had received systematic internal medicine anti-tumor therapy with gemcitabine regimen as standard, which met the inclusion criteria of this study. She was given oral therapy with albumin binding paclitaxel combined with carrilizumab and apatinib mesylate. Treatment continued or was evaluated every 2 cycles until disease progression or toxic side effects of patient intolerance to the treatment regimen. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) in second-line therapy with carrilizumab in combination with albumin paclitaxel and apatinib mesylate in patients with advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a cancer that easily invades adjacent structures. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) are increased in most types of cancer and inhibit tumor progression by blocking VEGF/VEGFR2 \[16\]. Apatinib is a highly selective VEGFR2 antagonist that inhibits apoptosis and growth of CCA cells. Apatinib is also a derivative of PTK787, and its targets include VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, PDGFR, c-kit, c-Src, etc. The activity of Apatinib against VEGFR-2 is 137 times that of PTK787, the IC50 is only 1nmol/L, and it can strongly inhibit tumor angiogenesis. At the same time, it can also inhibit the downstream signal transduction mediated by KDR and inhibit tumor growth.
