Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Are at High Risk for Cardiac Insults
Objectives: Evaluation of the cardiovascular (CV) risk in a sample of CV asymptomatic infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Patients \& Methods: 100 infertile PCOS women older than 30 years (PCOS group) and 50 fertile non-PCOS women (Non-PCOS group) underwent gynecological and laboratory diagnosis and then underwent a diagnostic protocol consisting of determination of body mass index (BMI), Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scoring and cardiologic evaluation using echocardiography, estimation of carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT), coronary artery calcium (CAC) score using multi-slice non-contrast cardiac CT and cardiac risk ratio (CRR). Study outcomes included the incidence of abnormal cardiac risk parameters and the determination of the best minimally invasive modality to be used as a screening test for these women.
Cardiac Disease
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Cardiac risk ratio (CRR)
Abnormal Cardiac Outcomes, incidence of abnormal cardiac risk parameters among PCOS women who were apparently cardiac free women, 1 to 3 months
Women attending the infertility clinics at Tanta and Benha University Hospitals were eligible for evaluation for PCOS as a cause of infertility. Gynecological evaluation entails data concerning present and past history of menstrual regularity, previous pregnancy for married women, previous investigations or therapies for PCOS or infertility. PCOS was diagnosed depending on the presence of at least two of the Rotterdam criteria
