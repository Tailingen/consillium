Determination of Fraction Size Equivalent Dose (FED) Levels for Intracranial Conformal Avoidance Radiotherapy
The primary objective is to evaluate and quantify the reproducibility of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) maps of the eloquent brain areas corresponding to specific neurological functions based on activation maps obtained with different thresholds in patients with benign and biopsy proven low-grade brain neoplasms. Another objective is to access the impairment in neurological function in image guided intracranial radiotherapy using neurocognitive assessment tools and to derive dose response curves relating the impairment in a particular neurological function to the FED received by the area of eloquent brain corresponding to it.
