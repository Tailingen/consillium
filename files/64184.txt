Study of GDC-0980 Versus Everolimus in Participants With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Who Have Progressed on or Following Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor- (VEGF) Targeted Therapy
Study PIM4973g is a multicenter, international, open-label Phase II trial. Participants with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have progressed on or after VEGF targeted therapy will be randomized in 1:1 to two groups either to receive daily GDC-0980 or everolimus orally.
