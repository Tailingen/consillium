Determining Individualized Cancer Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer
This is a non-therapeutic exploratory observational precision oncology study designed to collect and analyze data that demonstrate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of personalized treatments based on molecular tumor profiling assessments (i.e., matched therapy) in adult pancreatic cancer patients. Patient medical records, obtained both retrospectively and prospectively, will be examined for results of molecular profiling obtained through standard of care testing to help understand how well molecular testing might predicts response to therapy. Patient demographic and outcome parameters to be evaluated include, but are not limited to, tumor response, time to treatment failure, patient survival, and toxicity.
