Transanal Reinforcement of Low Rectal Anastomosis in Rectal Cancer Surgery
Anastomotic leak after low rectal cancer surgery occurs between 3 and 24% of the cases and is a severe complication leading to sepsis, permanent colostomy, higher risk of local cancer recurrence and eventually death. In order to prevent this complication a protecting diverting stoma is usually fashioned with consequent morbidity due to the stoma and its closure and severe impact on patients' quality of life. This prospective, multi-center, parallel-arm, randomized controlled equivalence trial is aimed to demonstrate whether a transanal reinforcement of the suture line can prevent anastomotic leakage after low rectal cancer surgery thus avoiding the need for a covering ileostomy
