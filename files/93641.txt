Activating mutations of the BRAF gene have been observed in a variety of cancers, including 55-68% of malignant melanomas. In general, oncogenic mutations of BRAF correlate with a poor outcome. PLX4032 is a compound that selectively inhibits oncogenic B-Raf kinase.

Two extension cohorts of patients with confirmed V600E mutations will be recruited, consisting of advanced melanoma and metastatic colorectal carcinoma.
