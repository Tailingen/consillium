Radiotherapy Combined With ICIs as Treatment for LA-NSCLC After Failing Induction Immunochemotherapy
Patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer initially evaluated as unresectable are selected for the program, who are remained unresectable after 2-4 cycles of conversion chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Investigators will stratify the treatment according to different performance status scores and radiotherapy plan bi-lung receptor volume to evaluate the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy followed by combined radiotherapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage III

radiation pneumonitis, Incidence of grade 2 or higher radiation pneumonitis., Within 6 months after radiation therapy
progression-free survival, Time from enrolment to disease progression or death from any cause or censored at the last follow-up., 2 years|overall survival, Time from enrolment to death or censored at the last follow-up., 3 years
This is a prospective, real-world cohort study, which aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of immunotherapy followed by combined radiotherapy. Participants will be selected and entered into three different cohorts according to different performance status(PS) scores and radiotherapy schedules based on the amount of bilateral lungs treated. Cohort A: PS=0-1 and bilateral lung V20≤20%, mean lung dose(MLD)≤11 gray(Gy), radiotherapy and immunotherapy, followed by immunotherapy for up to 1 year; Cohort B: PS=0-1 and 20%\<bilateral lung V20≤25% or 11 Gy\<MLD≤13 Gy, radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy, followed by immunotherapy for up to 1 year; Cohort C: PS=2 or 25%\<bilateral V20≤30% and 3 Gy \<MLD≤ 17 Gy, radiotherapy alone, followed by immunotherapy for up to 1 year.
