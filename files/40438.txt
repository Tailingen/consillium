A Study of Anti-Cancer Therapies Targeting the MAPK Pathway in Patients With Advanced NSCLC
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 in combination with other cancer therapies in study participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
* To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Dose (RD) of ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 administered in combination with other cancer therapies.
* To evaluate the antitumor activity of ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 in combination with other cancer therapies.
* To evaluate the PK profiles of ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 and other cancer therapies when administered in combination.

This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multicenter master protocol evaluating safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 in combination with other cancer therapies in study participants with advanced NSCLC. The study will commence with the following dose escalation cohorts: ERAS-007 plus osimertinib in study participants with advanced NSCLC harboring epidermal growth factor receptor-sensitizing mutation(s) (EGFRm); ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 plus sotorasib in study participants with advanced NSCLC harboring Kirsten rat sarcoma G12C mutation (KRAS G12Cm). Dose expansion will follow and will evaluate ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 drug combinations administered at the RD identified from each respective dose escalation cohort in study participants with advanced EGFRm or KRAS G12Cm NSCLC.
