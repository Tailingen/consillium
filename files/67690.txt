Telmisartan in Prostate Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the tolerability of telmisartan in patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Telmisartan|OTHER: Standard of Care Regimen
Tolerability of oral telmisartan, Ability of the participant to tolerate telmisartan alone or with standard of care agents as defined by maintaining a systolic blood pressure \>110mmHG and are without greater than grade 2 toxicities, 12 months
Increase in tumor DNA damage, Determine if telmisartan increases tumor DNA damage or alters immunity in ways consistent with anti-tumor activity when given alone or with selected standard of care treatments in selected patients with prostate cancer as determined by counting gamma-H2AX foci in tissue sections and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 24 months
Reduction of blood prostate specific antigen, This exploratory objective is to determine whether telmisartan when given alone or combined with selected standard of care therapies can reduce blood prostate specific antigen or slow its rise in selected patients with prostate cancer as determined by Roche Cobas immunoassay in ng/mL blood, 24 months
The primary objective of this study is to test the tolerability of oral telmisartan given as a single agent or combined with specific standard of care agents in selected participants with PC. Patients will be defined as tolerating telmisartan if they maintain systolic blood pressure \>110 mm Hg and are without greater than grade 2 toxicities as defined in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.1 for at least 60 days total telmisartan treatment.
