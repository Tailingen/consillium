Efficacy and Safety of Idelalisib in Combination With Obinutuzumab Compared to Chlorambucil in Combination With Obinutuzumab for Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of idelalisib with obinutuzumab versus the combination of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab on progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

An increased rate of deaths and serious adverse events (SAEs) among participants with front-line CLL and early-line indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) treated with idelalisib in combination with standard therapies was observed by the independent data monitoring committee (DMC) during regular review of 3 Gilead Phase 3 studies. Gilead reviewed the unblinded data and terminated those studies in agreement with the DMC recommendation and in consultation with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). All front-line studies of idelalisib, including this study, were also terminated.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Idelalisib|DRUG: Chlorambucil|DRUG: Obinutuzumab
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval from randomization to the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause. Definitive disease progression is CLL progression based on standard criteria, excluding lymphocytosis alone. PFS was to be assessed by an independent review committee (IRC)., Up to 11 months
Overall Response Rate, Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a confirmed complete or partial response. ORR was to be assessed by an IRC., Up to 11 months|Nodal Response Rate, Nodal response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a 50% decrease from baseline in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters of index lesions. Nodal response rate was to be assessed by an IRC., Up to 11 months|Complete Response Rate, Complete response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a confirmed complete response. Complete response rate was to be assessed by an IRC., Up to 11 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the interval from randomization to death from any cause. Overall survival was to be assessed by an IRC., Up to 11 months|Minimal Residual Disease Negativity Rate at Week 36, Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate is defined as the proportion of participants with MRD \< 10\^-4 assessed by flow cytometry in bone marrow at Week 36 after therapy initiation. For participants receiving the final dose of obinutuzumab after the original scheduled date, the MRD assessment was performed no less than 12 weeks after the last dose of obinutuzumab. MRD negativity rate was to be assessed by an IRC., Up to 11 months
