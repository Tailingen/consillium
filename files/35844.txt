Clinical Trial of PM54 in Advanced Solid Tumors Patients.
The first part of the study (phase Ia - dose escalation) will evaluate the safety and tolerability and identify the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of PM54.

The second part of the study (phase Ib - expansion) will be to evaluate the antitumor activity of PM54 in terms of clinical benefit (response or stable disease \[SD\] ≥4 months associated with tumor shrinkage), according to the RECIST v.1.1 (or modified RECIST \[mRECIST\] v.1.1 in case of malignant pleural mesothelioma \[MPM\]) and/or serum markers as appropriate, in patients with selected advanced solid tumors.

Phase 1b: Adverse events (AEs), AEs will be graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v.5., Screening to end of study (up to approximately 36 months)|Phase 1b: Treatment discontinuation, Day 1 up to end of study (up to approximately 36 months)|Phase 1b: Dose reductions, Day 1 up to end of study (up to approximately 36 months)|Phase 1b: Treatment delays due to adverse events (AEs), Day 1 up to end of study (up to approximately 36 months)|Phase 1b: QT Assessment, The QT assessment will evaluate the risk of prolongation of the QT interval by PM54., Day 1 of Cycle 1 for all patients participating in the QT assessment, and on Day 1 of Cycle 2 for patients treated during the Phase Ia stage once the MTD has been determined, will be used in this substudy.|Phase 1b: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 during the Phase Ia (dose expansion) stage once the MTD has been determined. Each cycle is 21 days.|Phase 1b: Concentration in urine samples, Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 during the Phase Ia (dose expansion) stage once the MTD has been determined. Each Cycle is 21 days.|Phase 1b: Percentage of patients with clinical benefit (overall response rate (ORR) or stable disease (SD) ≥4 months associated with tumor shrinkage), Day 1 up to end of study (up to approximately 36 months)|Phase 1b: Response rate, Response rate defined as percentage of patients with partial response (PR), with complete response (CR), or the sum of both \[overall response rate (ORR)\]., Day 1 up to end of study (up to approximately 36 months)|Phase 1b: Percentage of patients with stable disease (SD) ≥4 months, Day 1 up to end of study (up to approximately 36 months)|Phase 1b: Duration of Response (DoR), From the date of the first documentation of response to the date of documented progression or death, assessed up to 36 months|Phase 1b: Progression-free Survival (PFS), From the date of first infusion of study treatment to the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months|Phase 1b: Overall survival (OS), From the date of first infusion of study treatment to the date of death (due to any cause) or last contact (in this case, survival will be censored on the date of last contact), assessed up to 36 months
