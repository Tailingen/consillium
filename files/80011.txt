Safety of Trifluridine/Tipiracil in Patients With Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency Diagnosed With Metastatic Colorectal or Gastroesophageal Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the safety of the trifluridine/tipiracil as replacement of fluoropyrimidines based chemotherapy as first line metastatic colorectal or gastroesophageal cancer regimens in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is this alternative chemotherapy option a better option in term of safety for this type of patients?
* Does the combination of treatments improves the overall safety?
* Does the combination of treatments improves the progression-free survival, overall survival, objective response rate and disease control rate?
* Does the combination of treatment have an effect on quality of life?

Participants will:

* Receive the trifluridine/tipiracil with oxaliplatin every 14 days, associated with:

  * Panitumumab or bevacizumab for colorectal adenocarcinomas
  * Nivolumab or trastuzumab for gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas.
* Have a CT-Scan every 2 months until disease progression
* Complete Health-related quality of life questionnaire every 2 months for a maximum of 6 months
* Participate to the optional translational research: Blood samples fo DPYD genotyping and pharmacokinetic analysis

Treatment specific safety, The percentage of patients without specific toxicities defined as grade 3-4-5 digestive toxicities (diarrhoea and/or stomatitis) and grade 4-5 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia over the first 2 cycles of first-line metastatic treatment.

Toxicities will be graded using the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (NCI-CTCAE v5), widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., 1 month
Overall Safety, All types of toxicities occuring during the study. The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (NCI-CTCAE v5) is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events. This scale, divided into 5 grades (1 = "mild", 2 = "moderate", 3 = "severe", 4 = "life-threatening", and 5 = "death") determined by the investigator, will make it possible to assess the severity of the disorders., Throughout study completion, up to 2 years|Compliance with study treatment, Patients will record Trifluridine/tipiracil intake within a leaflet every day. Investigators will collect this data at every on site visit during the first 2 cycles (before Cycle 3)., 1 month|Progression Free Survival, The progression-free survival is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., From baseline until disease progression or death, up to 2 years|Overall Survival, The overall survival is the length of time from baseline that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., From baseline until disease progression or death, up to 2 years|Objective response rate, The objective response rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) for a given treatment., From baseline until disease progression, up to 2 years|Disease control rate, The disease control rate is defined as the percentage of patients with a CR, a PR or stable disease for a given treatment., From baseline until disease progression, up to 2 years|Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., At baseline, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months|Quality of life questionnaire - Oesophago-Gastric (QLQ-OG25), This EORTC oesophago-gastric cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.

The QLQ-OG25 contains 25 items organized into six scales: dysphagia (three items), eating restrictions (four items), reflux (two items), odynophagia (two items), pain and discomfort (two items) and anxiety (two items), and ten single items: eating in front of others, dry mouth, trouble with taste, body image, trouble swallowing saliva, choked when swallowing, trouble with coughing, trouble talking, weight loss and hair loss. All items are rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (1 = "not at all", 2 = "a little", 3 = "quite a bit", and 4 = "very much"), and are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms., At baseline, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months|Quality of life questionnaire - Colorectal (QLQ-CR29), This EORTC colorectal cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.

The QLQ-CR29 has 5 functional and 18 symptom scales. It contains 29 items organized into four subscales: urinary frequency (two items), blood and mucus in stool (two items), stool frequency (two items), and body image (three items), and 19 single items (urinary incontinence, dysuria, abdominal pain, buttock pain, bloating, dry mouth, hair loss, taste, anxiety, weight, flatulence, fecal incontinence, sore skin, embarrassment, stoma care problems, sexual interest, impotence, sexual interest, and dyspareunia). All items are rated on a four-point Likert-type scale (1 = "not at all", 2 = "a little", 3 = "quite a bit", and 4 = "very much"), and are linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale. Higher scores represent better functioning on the functional scales and a higher level of symptoms on the symptom scales., At baseline, 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months
