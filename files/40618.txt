HLX35(EGFRÃ—4-1BB Bispecific) in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This Phase1, multicenter, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose expansion study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of HLX35 administered as a single-agent by IV infusion every 2 weeks to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies, who have failed or are intolerant to standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy is available. This study has two parts: phase 1a dose escalation and phase 1b dose expansion.
