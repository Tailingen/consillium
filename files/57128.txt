A Survival Study in Patients With High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes Comparing Azacitidine Versus Conventional Care
The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) treated with azacitidine have improved survival compared to conventional care treatments. The study will also assess the effect of treatments on response, duration of response, and transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The study will continue for 12 months following last patient enrolled.

Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Median Time to Death From Any Cause, Kaplan-Meier estimates for the median months until death from any cause within the intent-to-treat population. Patients surviving at the end of the follow-up period were censored at the date of last contact. If a patient withdrew consent to follow-up or was lost to follow-up, the patient was censored as of the last date of contact., Day 1 (randomization) to 42 months|Summary of Subgroup Analyses for Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Time to Death From Any Cause, Kaplan-Meier estimates for the median months until death from any cause within the intent-to-treat population.

Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent., Day 1 (randomization) to 42 months|Summary of Participants' Platelet Transfusion Status for Participants Who Were Transfusion Dependent at Baseline, Summary of dependence and independence from platelet transfusion at baseline and during treatment for patients who were dependent at baseline. A patient was considered transfusion independent at baseline if the patient had no transfusions during the 56 days prior to randomization. During study, a patient was considered transfusion independent during the on-treatment period if the patient had no transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent., Day 1 (randomization) to 42 months|Summary of Participants' Platelet Transfusion Status for Participants Who Were Transfusion Independent at Baseline, Summary of dependence and independence from platelet transfusion at baseline and during treatment for patients who were independent at baseline. A patient was considered transfusion independent at baseline if the patient had no transfusions during the 56 days prior to randomization. During study, a patient was considered transfusion independent during the on-treatment period if the patient had no transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more. Otherwise, the patient was considered transfusion dependent., Day 1 (randomization) to 42 months|Number of Participants Considered Hematologic Responders by Investigator Determinations Using International Working Group (IWG 2000) Criteria for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Investigator determined responses followed IWG criteria for

* complete remission(CR): repeat bone marrow show \<5% myeloblasts, and peripheral blood evaluations lasting \>=2 months of hemoglobin(\>110 g/L), neutrophils(\>=1.5x10\^9/L), platelets(\>=100x10\^9/L), blasts (0%) and no dysplasia
* partial remission(PR) is the same as CR for peripheral blood: bone marrow shows blasts decrease by \>=50% or a less advanced FAB classification from pretreatment
* stable disease(SD) is a failure to achieve at least a partial remission, but with no evidence of progression for at least 2 months., Day 1 to 42 months|Number of Participants Showing Hematologic Improvement Using International Working Group (IWG 2000) Criteria for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Assessed by Independent Review Committee, IWG 2000 Criteria: Pretreatment=hemoglobin \<100g/L or RBC transfusion-dependent, platelet count \<100x10\^9/L or platelet transfusion dependent, absolute neutrophil count \<1.5x10\^9/L.

Erythroid response: Major-\>20g/L increase or transfusion independent. Minor- 10-20g/L increase or \>=50% decrease in transfusion requirements.

Platelet response: Major-absolute increase of \>=30x10\^9/L or platelet transfusion independence. Minor-\>=50% increase.

The individual options for Conventional Care Regimens (Best Supportive Care Only, Low-Dose Cytarabine, and Standard Chemotherapy) are presented as separate treatments., Day 1 (randomization) to 42 months
Comparison/Control Interventions offered the physician three options:

* Best supportive care (BSC) alone,
* Low-dose cytarabine subcutaneously for 14 days every 28 to 42 days, or
* Standard chemotherapy administered for induction as a continuous intravenous infusion of cytarabine over 7 days plus an anthracycline (daunorubicin, idarubicin, or mitoxantrone) on Days 1, 2, and 3; and, for those eligible, 1 or 2 consolidation cycles administered as continuous intravenous infusions of cytarabine for 3 to 7 days with the same anthracycline that was used at induction on Days 1 and 2 (each cycle between 28 to 70 days from the start of the previous cycle).

All three options included best supportive care. Neither the experimental group (azacitidine) nor any of the comparison/control options allowed use of erythropoietin.

Duration of Intervention: Patients will be treated until death, withdrawal, unacceptable toxicity or conclusion of the study.
