Skin Protection During Radiotherapy in Patients With Breast Cancer
Radiotherapy may cause severe skin changes that significantly interfere with the patient's quality of life and may reduce radiotherapy effectiveness. Many skin care instructions and various topical agents are recommended to help patients in the management of radiation skin reactions, but evidence to support the value of the topical treatments of the irradiated skin is lacking. In the present study we investigated the effects of two topical agents used as supportive care to protect skin during radiotherapy.
Radiation Dermatitis
DRUG: Evoskin|DRUG: Trixiera
Average of the radiation dermatitis intensity, Radiation dermatitis will be assessed by means of a spectrophotometer after the patient has received 50Gy, at 3 months
Clinical grade of dermatitis, dermatitis grade will be assessed according to CTCAE after the patient has received 50 Gy, at 3 months
Women with breast cancer and were to receive breast radiotherapy to 50 Gy were enrolled in a prospective randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of EvoskinÂ®) for protecting skin compared to Trixiera. To account for individual differences in radiation each subject served as her own control, as each was to apply the experimental and control agents to the irradiated breast. Each patient was randomly assigned to use Evoskin on the half of the irradiated breast and to use the Triexiera on the other half. Dermatitis was graded weekly by means of a spectrophotometer.
