Antecolic Versus Retrocolic Gastrojejunostomy During Whipple's Procedure
Aim: This randomized clinical study aims to compare occurrence of DGE in patients undergoing either antecolic or retrocolic gastrojejunostomy following pancreaticoduodenectomy.

Methods: Participants of this study will be patients undergoing pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy at the Surgical Department of the University Hospital of Larissa. Patients will be randomized to undergo either an antecolic or a retrocolic gastrojejunostomy and the occurrence of DGE will then be compared between the two groups. Individuals younger than 18 or older than 75 years old, as well as patients who do not consent to participate in this trial, will be excluded.

Expected results: Based on available literature, antecolic gastrojejunostomy may be related with a lower incidence of DGE, without a statistically significant difference between the two methods. We aim to show if one of the two methods of gastrointestinal reconstruction (antecolic versus retrocolic) affects DGE.
