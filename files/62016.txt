Digitally Captured Activity Data and PROs to Monitor Physical Function in Prostate Cancer Patients
Prospective observational research study to evaluate the role of wearable activity monitors to predict physical function decline among prostate cancer survivors receiving ADT.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Wearable Activity Monitor
Physical function decline within 3 months from baseline, Patient-reported physical function defined as 5-point change in standardized NIH PROMIS t-scores (mean 50, SD: 10), where higher scores represent higher physical function), 3 months|Absolute change in average step counts at 3 months from baseline, Change will be calculated based on difference in average weekly step count at baseline from the average weekly step count at end-of-study visit as measured using a Fitbit activity monitor where mean weekly Fitbit activity values will be calculated, 3 months
Mean change in Fitbit 24-hour activity, Change will be calculated based on difference in 24 hour activity as defined as periods of active minutes, sedentary time, and sleep at baseline and end-of-study, 3 months|Key themes and concepts surrounding the relationships patients have with their treatment symptoms and how they affect their daily activity, as assessed in qualitative interviews., This is a qualitative endpoint assessed in individual patient interviews at end of study., 3 months
Physical function is a known predictor of QOL in advanced prostate cancer patients and key measure of treatment tolerability. While treatment with Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) improves survival, it is associated with significant toxicities that lead to physical function (PF) decline. The average age of incident prostate cancer is 66 years, and in this older group of men, chronic comorbid conditions often co-occur with diagnosis, further adding to the risk for PF decline. With over 2.9 million prostate cancer survivors in the US, there is an increasing demand for adequate symptom monitoring and PF assessment throughout cancer care. However, there are currently no validated methods to systematically evaluate and predict PF decline. Thus, the overarching objective of this proposal is to determine whether the use of wearable technology to monitor objective daily activity combined with routine symptom reporting can predict PF decline. To accomplish this, we propose a mixed-methods approach that will provide quantitative information to help identify PC survivors at higher risk for PF decline as well as a qualitative aim gain a deeper understanding of the perceived relationships that PC survivors have with their physical activity levels and treatment symptoms.
