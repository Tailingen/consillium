Ph II of Non-myeloablative Allogeneic Transplantation Using TLI & ATG In Patients w/ Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma
Non-myeloablative approach for allogeneic transplant is a reasonable option, especially given that the median age at diagnosis is 55-60 years and frequently present compromised skin in these patients, which increases the risk of infection. Therefore, we propose a clinical study with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using a unique non-myeloablative preparative regimen, TLI/ATG, to treat advanced mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (MF/SS).

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 180 Days, Progression-Free Survival (PFS; time to disease progression or death from any cause) assessed at 180 days (Kaplan-Meier estimate). Disease progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 180 days

Primary Objectives

-To evaluate the graft versus lymphoma effect by monitoring rate of clinical response, event-free and overall survival.

Secondary Objectives

-To evaluate the incidence and extent of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and time to engraftment.
