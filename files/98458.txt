CLIC-1901 for the Treatment of Patients With Relapsed/Refractory CD19 Positive Hematologic Malignancies
The investigators propose an early phase study defined as a phase I/II trial assessing safety, feasibility and efficacy of CLIC-1901 autologous anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR-T) cells for participants with relapsed/refractory CD19 positive (CD19+) Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). The Initial Stage of the study (n=20 participants) will focus on feasibility and safety while the Extended Stage will include all participants enrolled in the study (n=additional 80 participants for a total of 100) and will focus on efficacy and safety outcomes. In the proposed trial, we will administer our CAR-T cell product to these participants as a single infusion. Participants will undergo (a) lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by (b) infusion of autologous CLIC-1901 CAR-T cells. All treatments will be delivered intravenously.

The investigators have designed a two-stage, single-arm, open-label early phase study to determine the safety and efficacy of CLIC-1901 cell therapy in patients with CD19+ ALL and NHL. The primary objective in the initial stage of 20 participants will be to evaluate the feasibility of our protocol and the safety and tolerability of infusing autologous CLIC-1901 cells into patients with relapsed/refractory CD19+ ALL or NHL. Once 20 participants have been treated and the treatment is deemed safe, up to 80 more participants will be enrolled in an extension stage where the primary objective will be overall response rate (defined as complete or partial response) at 6 months after CLIC-1901 infusion.
