Real-Time CAD for Colonic Neoplasia: A RCT
This study assesses the sensitivity and added benefits of computer-aided detection compared to standard care (white-light) in detecting colon polyps in patients undergoing colonoscopy.

Failure in polyp detection leads to colon cancer after colonoscopy. Artificial intelligence systems allow real-time computer-aided detection of polyps with high-accuracy. This study will compare GI-Genius, a real-time CAD system to standard colonoscopy in terms of how many colonoscopies detect an adenoma.
