Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy vs. Single Session Radiosurgery in Patients With Larger Brain Metastases
Phase III trial comparing local control and side effects after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and single session radiosurgery in patients with larger brain metastases (2-4 cm)
Cerebral Metastases of Solid Cancers
RADIATION: Radiosurgery|RADIATION: Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy
Time to local progression - TTLP, Local progression will be defined according to the RANO-BM criteria by an increase of at least 20% in the longest diameter of the metastasis relative to nadir or baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20% the lesion must increase by an absolute value of 5 mm or more.

TTLP is defined as the time from randomization until the detection of progression as per the RANO-BM criteria. Patients will be censored if they have no signs of local progression at the time of last tumor monitoring during follow-up or at the onset of one of the following competing risk events not associated with local progression: death, lost to follow up, unauthorized non-protocol treatment of the target lesion.

Confirmatory analysis of the primary endpoint variable will be performed using a p-value of pâ‰¤0.05 as the global significance level., 12 months
CNS toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0, CNS toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0, 12 months|Time to local progression (Volumetric RANO-BM criteria), Based on the RANO-BM criteria, progression is defined as an increase in volume of 72.8% or more (corresponds to a 20% increase in diameter for a perfect sphere)., 12 months|Quality of Life according to EORTC QLQ-C30, Quality of life measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaire QLQ C30, Change from baseline to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|Local-Progression-Free Survival, Local-Progression-Free Survival is defined like TTLP except that death not associated with local progression will not be censored but assessed as a separate event, 12 months|Overall Survival, Overall Survival, 24 months|Quality of Life according to EORTC QLQ-BN20, Quality of life measured by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) questionnaire QLQ BN20, Change from baseline to 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
This is a prospective, multicenter randomized trial comparing local control and side effects after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with 12 x 4 Gy and single session radiosurgery according to RTOG 9005 in patients with larger brain metastases (2-4 cm). Patients will be randomized to either fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with 12 x 4 Gy or radiosurgery with 1 x 18 Gy (2-3 cm) or 1 x 15 Gy (3-4 cm) as defined by the RTOG 9005. Randomization will be stratified by metastasis volume and histology.
