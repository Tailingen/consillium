Melanoma
DRUG: disulfiram and chelated zinc
Overall Response Rate to Treatment of Melanoma With Disulfiram and Chelated Zinc, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, or PET/CT scanning.: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Response to treatment will be measured by RECIST evaluation at disease assessment time-points from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause whichever came first (up to 15 months.)
Progression Free Survival, Every 56 days - for up to two years
