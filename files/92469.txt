A Comparison of Skin Grafts Versus Local Flaps for Facial Skin Cancer From the Patient Perspective: A Feasibility Study
A prospective single-centered feasibility study will be conducted. The purpose of the feasibility study is to define the variables to be included in a subsequent pilot study, assess the feasibility of conducting a prospective cohort study, and the logistics for the study (i.e., training, patient recruitment, data collection, statistical analysis, etc.).

FACE-Q score, FACE-Q is a recently developed and validated patient reported outcome measure (PROM) tool that allows clinicians to assess patient perspectives after skin cancer surgery of the face.The PROM is used to assess the perspective and impact of skin cancer as well as its treatment on the patient's quality of life (QoL). Patients with skin cancer may have increased anxiety, social isolation, and cosmetic concerns after surgery. The FACE-Q utilizes five scales to measure the psychometric, QoL, patient experience, and cosmetic outcomes. Raw scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale with a higher score indicating a better outcome, 12 months|Facial photos, Patient photos will be taken post-op at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and one-year post-operation, if feasible, 12 months
A prospective single-centered feasibility study will be conducted. The purpose of the feasibility study is to define the variables to be included in a subsequent pilot study, assess the feasibility of conducting a prospective cohort study, and the logistics for the study (i.e., training, patient recruitment, data collection, statistical analysis, etc.).

Upon completion of the feasibility study, a prospective pilot cohort study would be performed to measure outcomes using the FACE-Q Skin Cancer module for patients receiving skin grafting or local flaps after excision of facial skin cancers.
