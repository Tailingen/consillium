Evaluation of a 3D Functional Metabolic Imaging and Risk Assessment System for Classifying Women at High Risk of Breast Cancer
The objective of the study is to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of cancer detection when MIRA technology is combined with mammography, by evaluating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of mammography vs. mammography plus MIRA. This evaluation will be done in a Reader Study on a subset of women with histology confirmed cancer and healthy women with dense breast.
