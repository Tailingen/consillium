Observational Study in Adults With Imatinib-resistant/Intolerant Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Treated With Nilotinib
The GIMEMA CML Working Party promotes an observational (retrospective and perspective) study of Imatinib-resistant or intolerant CML patients treated with Nilotinib in Italy. Enrollment will include all patients who started Nilotinib between January 2005 and December 2012. Patients will be followed for 4 years since treatment start. After this time, survival data, disease status and treatment will be recorded at 6-months-interval. This study will help the definition of guidelines for a proper management of Nilotinib in any-phase CML patients.

Follow-up is required until the end of treatment for the purposes of the study for all patients by standard hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular criteria. This study will not contemplate any additional expense beyond what is expected for a regular follow-up, according to the international guidelines for CML.

Sample Size: target accrual was not defined, all eligible patients observed between January 2005 and December 2012 will be included.
