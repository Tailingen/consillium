Neo-Adjuvant Chemotherapy and Conservative Surgery in Cervical Cancer to Preserve Fertility
If no metastases are observed, patients will start a short protocol of four courses of weekly neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (12 weeks). If response to chemotherapy results in a tumor of less than 2 cm, cervical conisation will be performed.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|PROCEDURE: conisation
efficacy of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, efficacy of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy on tumor response, week 6 of neoadjuvant treatment|safety of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, defined as number of women who get recurrence within two years after conisation, 2 years after conisation
fertility, number of patients who are still fertile after treatment, 5 years after treatment|ovarian function, hormone levels will be measured to evaluate ovarian function, 2 years after conisation
The standard treatment of stage Ib1 2-4 cm cervical cancer in women who wish to preserve fertility is an abdominal radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. Since the number of take home babies after completing this procedure is below 10%, there is a need for exploration of alternative treatment modalities with better chances of preserving fertility at equal risk of recurrence. Since low fertility rates after abdominal radical hysterectomy are observed due to the radical surgery performed on the uterine cervix, less radical surgery is warranted. To enable less radical surgery by cervical conisation, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy to reduce tumor size is incorporated to the multi-modal treatment scheme of these patients.
