Phase 2 Study of AFM13 in Combination with AB-101 in Subjects with R/R HL and CD30+ PTCL
AFM13-203 is a phase 2, open-label, multi-center, multi-cohort study with a safety run-in followed by expansion cohorts. The study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of AFM13 in combination with AB-101 in subjects with R/R classical HL and CD30-positive PTCL.

Objective Response Rate by Independent Radiology Committee, ORR (complete response (CR) + partial response \[PR\]) by Independent Radiology Committee (IRC) based on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) as assessed by the Lugano classification, From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
Duration of Response by Investigator and Independent Radiology Committee, Duration of response (DOR) defined as time from first assessment of PR or CR to the first assessment of progressive disease. Response based on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) as assessed by the Lugano classification., Tumor assessment performed every 6 weeks for 3 cycles, if no disease progression on completion of treatment, then every 3 months for the first 12 months and then every 6 months (up to 24 months)|Complete response rate (CRR) by Investigator and Independent Radiology Committee, Complete Response Rate based on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) as assessed by the Lugano classification., Tumor assessment performed every 6 weeks for 3 cycles, if no disease progression on completion of treatment, then every 3 months for the first 12 months and then every 6 months (up to 24 months)|ORR by Investigator based on PET-CT as assessed by the Lugano classification, ORR (CR + PR) by Investigator based on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) as assessed by the Lugano classification, Tumor assessment performed every 6 weeks for 3 cycles, if no disease progression on completion of treatment, then every 3 months for the first 12 months and then every 6 months (up to 24 months)|Incidence of subjects receiving subsequent transplant, The incidence of subjects receiving subsequent transplant will be assessed and summarized by percentage rates and 95% Confidence Intervals, Throughout study completion (estimated up to 24 months)|Incidence of TEAEs and SAEs, Frequency of subjects with study-drug related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), From the time of first protocol-specific intervention until 30 days after the last administration|Immunogenicity assessment of AFM13 in combination with AB-101, Frequency of subjects developing anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against AFM13 or AB-101, During treatment cycles (estimated up 6 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS) by Independent Radiology Committee, Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as time from first treatment (AFM13/AB-101) received until PD/OS., Throughout study completion (estimated up to 24 months)|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival rate, up to 24 months
The study will start with a safety run-in exploring AFM13/AB-101 combination treatment in subjects with classical HL. Two dose levels of AFM13 and AB-101, respectively, will be tested in 4 cohorts. Cohort 1 and 2 will enroll in parallel. Enrolment into Cohort 3 and 4 will start only if the combination treatment has been well tolerated.

Following the safety run-in observation period, a thorough risk-benefit analysis will be performed to determine 2 of the 4 cohorts/dose levels that will be further evaluated in the main part of the study which will also include subjects with classical HL and will follow a Simon two-stage design.

An additional exploratory cohort (Cohort 5) will enroll subjects with select CD30-positive PTCL subtypes after completion of the safety run-in.

All subjects will be treated with AFM13/AB-101 for a maximum of 3 cycles (cycle length is 48-days).
