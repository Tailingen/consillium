PET/CT Assessment of Tumor Perfusion in Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma
Given the growing importance of anti-angiogenic therapies in the treatment of metastatic renal carcinoma, it is expected that this trial will establish the preliminary data needed to apply for funding of a larger clinical investigation of the potential role of PET perfusion imaging in management of renal carcinoma, and potentially other cancers.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: 150-Water|DRUG: 62Cu-ethylglyoxal bis|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography|DRUG: Sunitinib
Number of Patients Where 62Cu-ETS PET and 15O-water PET Was Obtained, Number of patients who had at least a baseline measurement of 62Cu-ETS PET and 15O-water PET, Baseline
Maximum Standard Uptake Value (SUV) for Lesion Data, Average values of the magnitude of tumor perfusion before and 14-28 days after initiation of Sunitinib treatment as measured by the maximum standard uptake value for all the lesion data. Standard uptake values were calculated as the ratio of the image derived radioactivity concentration and the whole body concentration of the injected radioactivity tracer. There were 14 patients who had a baseline reading and 12 patients who had a reading after treatment., Baseline and 14-28 days after initiation of Sunitinib
