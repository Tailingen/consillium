Phase 2 Trial of Gemcitabine vs S-1 vs Gemcitabine Plus Nab-paclitaxel as Adjuvant Chemotherapy of Post-operative Pancreatic Cancer Patients
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest tumor types, there is no effective treatment method clinically. Recently radical surgical resection is recommended for this cancer, How to improve the survival rate of patients is the doctors' goals . Postoperative chemotherapy can partly raise post-operative survival rate. the purpose of this study is to three chemotherapy regimens(gemcitabine monotherapy, S-1 monotherapy and combining nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine),which is best regimens for raising patients' survival rate, and will provide a chemotherapy choice for clinic therapy of pancreatic cancer.
