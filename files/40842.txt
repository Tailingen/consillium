S1314, Co-expression Extrapolation (COXEN) Program to Predict Chemotherapy Response in Patients With Bladder Cancer
The primary focus of this study is to see if looking at tumor biomarkers using a program called coexpression extrapolation or "COXEN" may predict a patient's response to chemotherapy before surgery.

DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Vinblastine|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Filgrastim
Assessment of Whether the Treatment-specific COXEN Score is Prognostic of pT0 Rate, The proportion of participants achieving pT0 in both favorable and unfavorable treatment specific-COXEN score categories.

Unit of measure is the number of participants in each category that achieved pT0

The relationship of dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (DDMVAC)- and gemcitabine+cisplatin (GC)- specific CO-eXpression ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) scores

This will be done in two ways:

* By assessing whether the treatment-specific COXEN score is prognostic of pT0 rate or ≤ pT1 in this patient population and to assess in a preliminary fashion whether the COXEN score is a predictive factor distinguishing between these two chemotherapy regimens. .
* By evaluating the correlation between the GC- and the DDMVAC-COXEN score., Up to 5 years post registration|Assessment of Whether the Treatment-specific COXEN Score is Prognostic of ≤ pT1 Rate, The proportion of participants achieving \<=pT1 in both favorable and unfavorable treatment specific-COXEN score categories.

Unit of measure is the number of participants in each category that achieved \<= pT1

P-values are reported as a measure of whether COXEN can select between GC/DDMVAC and to determine the significance of interactions between treatment specific COXEN scores and treatment arms in models predicting either pT0 or \<= pT1. Interactions with p-values \> 0.05 are interpreted as not significant.

Predictability of the CO-eXpression ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) Score to Direct Which of the Two Regimens the Patient Should Receive: Gemcitabine+Cisplatin (GC) Versus Dose-dense Methotrexate, Vinblastin, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin (DDMVAC), In addition to stratification factors and dichotomous COXEN GEM score, an indicator for treatment arm and the interaction of treatment arm with COXEN GEM score was also included in a logistic regression model. A significant interaction would suggest that the respective COXEN GEM score was able to differentiate whether a patient was more likely to respond to one chemotherapy regimen over another. \*note that this is the same objective at Primary Outcome #3 above - this was erroneously listed twice in the protocol., Up to 5 years post registration|Value of Gene Expression Profiling in Predicting Overall Survival (OS), 5-year OS curve was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Included all COXEN evaluable participants regardless of arm assignment.

Only adverse events that are possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug are reported. Grade 3 is less severe than Grade 5.

Grade 3 - Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL\* (bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).

Grade 4 - Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 - Death related to AE

\*ADL- Activities of Daily Living, Duration of treatment and follow up until death or 5 years post registration
The COXEN program will not select a patient's therapy, but the type of chemotherapy that he/she will receive will be randomly decided. The patient's response to chemotherapy will be used to test the usefulness of the COXEN program, which is the main goal of this trial. Other potential tests to predict a patient's response to chemotherapy will also be evaluated. In this study, the patient may receive the treatment in Arm 1 (gemcitabine and cisplatin) or the treatment in Arm 2 \[methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and filgrastim (or pegfilgrastim)\]. There will be about 230 people taking part in this study (115 in each arm).
