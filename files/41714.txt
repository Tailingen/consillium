SBRT as Bridging Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients on Transplant Waitlist
This is a single center, prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as bridging treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients on transplant waitlist.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
RADIATION: SBRT
Risk of classical radiation induced liver disease (RILD) after SBRT, Defined as elevated liver transaminases \>5 times of upper normal limit or worsening of Child's score by \>2 within 3 months after SBRT, From time of SBRT to 3 months afterwards|Rate of transplant complication, Perioperative complication will be assessed according to Clavien-Dindo classification, From time of transplant to 1 months afterwards
Rate of dropout from transplant waitlist, All HCC patients on waitlist will be assessed regularly and will be removed from waitlist if HCC stage is beyond UCSF criteria., From time of enrolment to up to 2 years
The study population includes patients 18 years of age or older with HCC, who are accepted on waiting list for deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT).

Patient will be assessed in a multidisciplinary committee and they will receive SBRT unless otherwise contraindicated. Patients will undergo SBRT under standard protocol.

Patients with HCC beyond University of California, San Francisco criteria (UCSF) will be removed from waitlist.
