IMPACT: IMplementation of Physical Activity for Children and Adolescents on Treatment
Physical activity can enhance well-being among youth diagnosed with oncological or hematological diseases. We developed a tailored, 1:1, online physical activity program (i.e., IMPACT), to promote physical activity in this cohort. The proposed single-group, mixed-methods project will assess the effect of IMPACT and explore markers of implementation.

BEHAVIORAL: Physical Activity
Reach, The number of people who participate, and reasons why or why not., Through study completion, an average of 6 years.
Attendance, Number of sessions attended out of the number of sessions offered by study staff., Through study completion, an average of 6 years.|Adherence, Number of assessments completed out of number of scheduled assessments., Through study completion, an average of 6 years.|Self-Reported Physical Activity Behaviour, Modified Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (Godin \& Shephard, 1985). Time spent in mild, moderate, and vigorous activity will be calculated. Higher numbers indicate greater physical activity., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Directly Assessed Physical Activity Behaviour, 7-day wear period (minimum) with an activity monitor. Higher numbers indicate greater time spent in physical activity and intensity., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Functional Mobility, The timed up and go test (shorter time indicates better functional mobility). Note, this and other "physical tests" to follow were selected based on use with healthy children, children with chronic conditions, and adults with and without chronic conditions (e.g., Bohannon, 1995; Canadian Society of Exercise Physiology, 2019; Deforche et al., 2003; Haas et al., 2017; Jankowski et al., 2015; Kolber \& Hanney, 2012; Lemmink et al., 2003; McNeely et al., 2019; Muir et al., 2010; Podsiadlo \& Richardson, 1991; Thorsteinsson et al., 2013)., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Lower Extremity Endurance, 30-second sit to stand test (more sit/stands indicates greater lower extremity endurance)., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Balance, Flamingo balance test (longer time without falling, reaching, shuffling/jumping indicates better balance)., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Range of Motion, Shoulder range of motion (ROM; greater number indicates greater ROM)., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Flexibility, sit and reach flexibility (greater distance indicates higher flexibility)., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Aerobic Capacity, Aerobic step tests (more steps indicates higher aerobic capacity)., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Cancer-Specific Quality of Life, PedsQL 3.0 Cancer Module (Varni et al., 2009). Score range 0-100; higher scores indicate better quality of life., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Health-Related Quality of Life, PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales (Varni et al., 2009). Score range 0-100; higher scores indicate better quality of life., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Symptoms, Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (Hyslop et al., 2018). Score range 0-60; higher score indicates more symptoms experienced and greater severity of symptoms experienced., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Cognitive Functioning, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function 2nd Ed (Gioia et al., 2015). Frequency of behaviors are ranked from "Never" to "Often," and results are reported as t scores where higher scores indicate greater deficits., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Maintenance of Physical Activity, Number of participants who maintain physical activity following the program., Baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 8-12), 6-month follow-up (week 20-24), 1 year follow-up (week 48-52)|Physical Activity Fidelity, Fidelity of the physical activity program implementation will be assessed via randomly video-auditing a subset of sessions., Through study completion, an average of 6 years.|Time to Implement and Deliver, Time and expertise to deliver the intervention and physical assessments will be tracked., Through study completion, an average of 6 years.|Adverse Events, Adverse events will be defined as any negative effect caused (or suspected to be caused by) the physical activity program., Through study completion, an average of 6 years.|Healthcare Provider and Staff Uptake, Healthcare providers' and clinical staffs' referral to the physical activity program, Through study completion, an average of 6 years.
