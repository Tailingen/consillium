A Study of HMPL-689 in Patients With Lymphomas Failed of Standard of Care or no Standard of Care Existed
This is a Phase 1, open-label study of HMPL-689 administered orally to patients with lymphoma for whom failed of standard care or have no standard of care.This study consists of a dose escalation stage (Stage I) and a dose expansion stage (Stage II).
Lymphomas
DRUG: HMPL-689
Dose limited toxicities evaluated with NCI CTCAE v4.03, Incidence of dose limited toxicities and associated dose of HMPL-689, within 28 days after the first dose|Objective response rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients who have a CR or PR, Through study completion, 1 year after the last patient has enrolled in the study or all patients have discontinued the study, whichever comes sooner
Maximum plasma concentration calculated with Blood samples, Blood samples will be taken to measure the levels of study drug, within 29 days after the first dose|Time to reach maximum concentration calculated with Blood samples, Blood samples will be taken to measure the levels of study drug, within 29 days after the first dose
Adverse events evaluated by NCI CTCAE v4.03, Incidence of adverse events and associated dose of HMPL-689, from the first dose to within 30 days after the last dose|Complete response rate (CR rate), Complete response rate (CR rate) is defined as the proportion of patients who have a CR Other lymphomas: Lugano Response Criteria for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma \[the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2014), Through study completion, 1 year after the last patient has enrolled in the study or all patients have discontinued the study, whichever comes sooner|Time to response (TTR), Time to response (TTR) is defined as the date from the first dose of study drug to the date of first CR or PR, Through study completion, 1 year after the last patient has enrolled in the study or all patients have discontinued the study, whichever comes sooner|Duration of response (DoR), Duration of response (DoR): defined as the time from when the first CR or PR was achieved until the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause Other lymphomas: Lugano Response Criteria for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma \[the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2014), Through study completion, 1 year after the last patient has enrolled in the study or all patients have discontinued the study, whichever comes sooner|Clinical benefit rate (CBR):, Clinical benefit rate (CBR): defined as the proportion of patients who have a CR/CRi, PR/PR-L or SD, Through study completion, 1 year after the last patient has enrolled in the study or all patients have discontinued the study, whichever comes sooner|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first dose to the first occurrence of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Through study completion, 1 year after the last patient has enrolled in the study or all patients have discontinued the study, whichever comes sooner
Both Stage I and Stage II include the following periods: screening period, treatment period, safety follow-up period, and extended progression free survival (PFS) follow-up period, as defined in Dose Escalation Stage (Stage I).

Dose escalation will be performed according to a modified toxicity probability interval scheme-2 (mTPI-2).To further characterize safety and efficacy of HMPL-689 at RP2D, expansion stage of the study enrolled 144 patients with B cell lymphoma, including CLL/ SLL, FL, MZL, DLBCL, MCL and PTCL. Patients were treated with RP2D as starting dose.
