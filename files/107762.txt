Efficacy of Type-5 Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors in Primary and Secondary Pulmonary Hypertension
The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of type-5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafil) in primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension
Primary and Secondary Pulmonary Hypertension
DRUG: type-5 phosphodiesterase Inhibitor (Sildenafil)
mean pulmonary artery pressure|6 min walking distance|WHO functional status|PaO2
cardiac output|VO2max
Patients with primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension will be recruited and admitted to the ICUs of the National Taiwan University Hospital. Each patient will undergo Swan-Ganz catheterization and hemodynamic monitoring during administration of sildenafil. Efficacy of inhaled NO and Iloprost will also be compared.
