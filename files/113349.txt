Nivolumab and Oral Cyclophosphamide for R/R AML and HIgh Risk MDS
This is a phase II trial of nivolumab and low dose cyclophosphamide (CTX) when given in combination to patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are not eligible for or decline hematopoietic stem cell transplant. It includes a randomized pilot sub-study during stage 1.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Low dose Cyclophosphamide (CTX) Daily|DRUG: Low dose Cyclophosphamide (CTX) Every 7 Days
Stage 1: Dosing Schedule of Low-dose Cyclophosphamide, Number of participants with adverse events, 4 weeks from start of treatment|Clinical Benefit and Immunologic Response of the Combination Therapy, Overall response rate at 90 days from treatment start. Response is defined as CR + CRi + CRp + PR in AML and CR/PR/hematologic improvement (HI) in MDS.

Complete Remission (CR) - subjects must have bone marrow regenerating normal hematopoietic cells and achieve a morphologic leukemia-free state, an ANC \> 1 x 109/L and platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L and normal marrow differential with \< 5% blasts, and they will be RBC and platelet transfusion independent (defined as 1 week without RBC transfusion and 1 week without platelet transfusion). There should be no evidence of extramedullary leukemia

Complete Remission with Incomplete Hematologic Recovery (CRi) - subjects must fulfill all the criteria for CR except for incomplete hematological recovery

Complete Remission with Incomplete Platelet Recovery (CRp) - subjects must achieve CR except for incomplete platelet recovery

Partial Remission (PR) - subjects must have ≥50% bone marrow blast reduction or decrease to 5 to 25%, 90 days from start of treatment
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Incidence of overall response., 30 days from start of treatment|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Incidence of progression free survival., 6 months from start of treatment|Overall Survival (OS), Incidence of overall survival., 6 months from start of treatment
