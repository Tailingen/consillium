NLCR in Prediction of the Grade of Lung Tumor.
The aim of the study is to assess whether the value of neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio from the routine preoperative blood test may predict lung tumors' grading.
Lung Neoplasm
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Complete blood count|OTHER: Histopathological examination
Neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio, Neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio is measured during routine preoperative blood tests., From October 1, 2014 to October 15, 2018
Neutrophil count, Neutrophil count is measured during routine preoperative blood tests., From October 1, 2014 to October 15, 2018|Lymphocyte count, Lymphocyte count is measured during routine preoperative blood tests., From October 1, 2014 to October 15, 2018|Leucocyte count, Leucocyte count is measured during routine preoperative blood tests., From October 1, 2014 to October 15, 2018
Lung cancer remains as one of the leading causes of death among oncology patients. Close connection between inflammation and pathogenesis of some neoplasms was determined in a number of studies. Some studies show promise that ratio of neutrophil to lymphocyte count (NLCR) may be recognized as a prognostic marker for several carcinomas: renal, lung and colorectal. The aim of the study is to assess whether the value of neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio from the routine preoperative blood test may predict lung tumors' grading. During routine preoperative blood tests complete blood count is done and NLCR, WBC, neutrophil and lymphocyte count is noted. After the thoracic surgery intervention and histopathological examination grading of lung tumor is noted.
