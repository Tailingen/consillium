A Study to Compare Eribulin Mesylate + Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab With Paclitaxel or Docetaxel + Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab
To verify that combination therapy with trastuzumab + pertuzumab + eribulin brings similar PFS and better QOL compared to trastuzumab + pertuzumab + taxane in advanced/recurrent HER2-positive breast cancer patients who have no medical history of chemotherapy except ado-trastuzumab emtansine
