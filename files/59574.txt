Single-arm, Single-center, Exploratory Phase II Clinical Study of Envafolimab Combined With Chemoradiotherapy in the Treatment of Locally Advanced pMMR/MSS Rectal Cancer
Preoperative radiotherapy combined with 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine is currently the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. Although this strategy effectively reduces the risk of local recurrence, it fails to effectively improve the overall survival rate of patients . The root cause is that 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine based local radiotherapy is not effective in controlling potential micrometastases. Therefore, many studies try to combine preoperative radiotherapy with more intense chemotherapy and targeted drugs at the same time, as well as induction chemotherapy before preoperative radiotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy after, in order to obtain better efficacy. However, a number of studies have shown that increasing cytotoxic drugs fail to effectively improve pathologic complete response rate (pCR) and long-term survival rate, and significantly increase therapeutic toxicity . Therefore, the idea of trying to increase the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs by accumulating them does not work.Based on the use of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody in colorectal cancer and other solid tumors, and referring to the scheme of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody combined with radiotherapy in other solid tumors, we added envafolimab to local radiotherapy for advanced rectal cancer for exploration, with a view to further improving the pCR rate and long-term survival of patients.

   Describe the medication or treatment in detail:

   1.1 Induction therapy stage (2 cycles of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy)

1 Envafolimab: 200mg, subcutaneous injection, Q2W, 2 cycles (simultaneous administration on the first day of chemotherapy).

2mFOLFOX6: Q2W, 2 cycles: oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 intravenous infusion for 2h, day 1. Calcium folinate 400mg/m2 intravenous infusion for 2 hours, day 1. Fluorouracil was injected intravenously at 400mg/m2 on day 1, followed by 1200mg/ (m2·d) × 2d with continuous intravenous infusion (total 2400mg/m2, infusion for 46\~48h). 1.2 Simultaneous chemoradiotherapy (long-term radiotherapy

Chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy for 3 cycles)

Radiation therapy: 50Gy/25f, 2Gy daily, 5 days a week for 5 weeks.

Body position fixation: prone position, full bladder, body fixator or vacuum bag fixation;

CT scan: Before the scan, intravenous contrast agent was injected to develop the intestine, fill the bladder, empty the intestine, and collect two sets of CT images of plain scan and enhanced phase (only plain scan images can be collected for those allergic to contrast agent).

Radiotherapy equipment: linear accelerator;

Target area and irradiation field: The target area includes the primary rectal area and lymphatic drainage area. The treatment plan is designed by IMRT radiotherapy. The target area coverage and normal tissue limit are determined by the radiotherapy doctor according to the specific conditions of the patient.
