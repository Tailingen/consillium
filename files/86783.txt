A Study to Test the Safety of the Investigational Drug Selitrectinib in Children and Adults That May Treat Cancer
This research study is done to test the safety of the new drug selitrectinib in children and adults with cancer having a change in a particular gene (NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3). The drug may treat cancer by interfering with the effect of the NTRK genes on cancer growth. The study also investigates how the drug is absorbed and processed in the human body, and how well and for how long the cancer responds to the drug. This is the first study to test selitrectinib in humans with cancer, for whom no other effective therapy exists.
Solid Tumors Harboring NTRK Fusion
DRUG: Selitrectinib (BAY2731954)
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Up to 42 days|Recommended dose, Up to 12 months

The primary objective is to determine the recommended dose for further study of oral selitrectinib with previously treated neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (NTRK) cancers in 2 patient groups: a) aged 12 years and older and b) younger than 12 years. Secondary objectives of Phase I are to characterize the pharmakokinetic properties of the test drug, its safety and tolerability, and to assess the objective response rate (ORR) of NTRK-tumors.
