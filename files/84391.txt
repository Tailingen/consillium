This observational registry and banking study is being performed on a large cohort of subjects who have received molecular testing to better understand the relationship between genomic and molecular information and clinical outcomes, and to enable timely and informed treatment decisions by physicians for their cancers. We hypothesize that large gene panels, sequencing (DNA/RNA), and epigenetics of tumors can identify molecular aberrations that can be leveraged to offer more effective treatment. Findings may highlight additional areas of research required to better understand the molecular underpinnings of the relationship between molecular abnormalities and disease. Banked specimens and the creation of tumor cell lines and xenograft models will facilitate further advancement of this research.
