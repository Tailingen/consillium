Predicting Outcome in Cervix Carcinoma: a Prospective Study
The main aim is to validate and improve the predictive model for survival and toxicity in patients with cervical cancer through multicentric prospective data collection. The data contain information on patient, tumor and treatment characteristics. For this study, additional health related QOL scores will be assessed using the EORTC Quality of Life Questionair-CX24 and C30. The long term aim, beyond this specific study, is to build a Decision Support System based on the predictive model validated in this study.
