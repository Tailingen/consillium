Results are reported only for arms with responders., Starting from Day 1 until disease progression (up to 4 years and 7 months)|Part B: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR, and stable disease (SD)., Starting from Day 1 until disease progression (up to 4 years and 7 months)|Part B: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR, and SD lasting ≥ 24 weeks., Starting from Day 1 until disease progression (up to 4 years and 7 months)|Part B: Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to death due to any cause., From Day 1 Every 3 months following completion or discontinuation of the treatment (up to 4 years and 7 months)
Part A: Minimum Observed Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) Of Tislelizumab, Cycle 4 Day 1 (0 hours and 4 hours) post dose|Part A: Ctrough Of Pamiparib, Cycle 2 Day 1 (Pre-dose and 7 hours Post-dose)|Part A: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration At Steady State (Cmax,ss) Of Pamiparib, Cycle 2 Day 1 (Pre-dose and 7 hours Post-dose)|Part A: Time To Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration At Steady State (Tmax,ss) Of Pamiparib, Cycle 2 Day 1 (Pre-dose and 7 hours Post-dose)|Part A: Ctrough At Steady State (Ctrough,ss) Of Pamiparib, Cycle 2 Day 1 (Pre-dose and 7 hours Post-dose)|Part A: ORR, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR and PR., Starting from Day 1 until disease progression (up to 4 years and 7 months)|Part A: PFS, PFS was defined as the time from first dose of study medication to the first documented objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Starting from Day 1 until disease progression (up to 4 years and 7 months)|Part A: DCR, DCR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR, and SD., Starting from Day 1 until disease progression (up to 4 years and 7 months)|Part A: CBR, CBR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR, and SD lasting ≥ 24 weeks., Starting from Day 1 until disease progression (up to 4 years and 7 months)|Part A: OS, OS was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to death due to any cause., Starting from Day 1 Every 3 months following completion or discontinuation of the treatment (up to 4 years and 7 months)|Part A: Percentage Of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) For Tislelizumab, Immunogenicity was summarized by participants who were ADA positive and developed detectable ADAs., Within 24 hours before the start of the first dose of tislelizumab in Cycle 1, Day 8 of Cycle 1, and Day 1 of Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle 5, Cycle 9, and Cycle 17|Part B: Number Of Participants Experiencing AEs, An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether considered related to study drug or not. All AEs reported are treatment-emergent, which was defined as having a reported onset time or worsening in severity on or after the date of the first dose of study treatment through 30 days after the last dose (permanent discontinuation of study treatment) or initiation of new anticancer therapy. A summary of serious and all other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module., Day 1 of Cycle 1 up to 4 years and 7 months|Part B: Ctrough Of Tislelizumab, As pre-specified in the protocol, pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed for all Part B dose expansion arms combined., Cycle 4 Day 1 ( 0 hours and 4 hours post dose)|Part B: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) Of Tislelizumab, As pre-specified in the protocol, pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed for all Part B dose expansion arms combined., Cycle 4 Day 1 ( 0 hours and 4 hours) post dose|Part B: Ctrough Of Pamiparib, As pre-specified in the protocol, pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed for all Part B dose expansion arms combined., Cycle 2 Day 1 (7 hours Post-dose)|Part B: Cmax Of Pamiparib, As pre-specified in the protocol, pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed for all Part B dose expansion arms combined., Cycle 2 (7 hours Post-dose)|Part B: Percentage Of Participants With ADAs For Tislelizumab, Immunogenicity was summarized by participants who developed detectable ADAs.
