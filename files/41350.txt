A Study of the Safety, Tolerability and Effectiveness of Hydroxychloroquine and Itraconazole in Platinum-resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This is a phase I/II study to find the highest dose of hydroxychloroquine that can be given safely with itraconazole in patients with advanced platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. The study will also determine the safety, tolerability, and initially determine whether the combination is useful in the treatment of patients with advanced platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer.
