A Study of a Comprehensive Prevention Program to Reduce Lymphedema After Axillary Lymph Node Dissection in People With Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study to test whether a comprehensive program may help the lymph fluid to drain out of the arm and prevent lymphedema in participants with breast cancer.

PROCEDURE: Immediate Lymphatic Reconstruction|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Volumetric arm measurements|OTHER: Lymphatic massage|OTHER: Range of motion exercises|OTHER: Compression garment use
The difference between the baseline and postoperative arm volume measurement, The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of a prevention program in decreasing the development of lymphedema in participants treated for breast cancer with Axillary Lymph Node Dissection/ALND by use of arm volume measurements. A â‰¥ 10% increase in RVC (arm volume difference between the affected and unaffected arms) between baseline and postoperative measures occurring at 12 months or later will indicate the development of lymphedema, Up to 24 months
The purpose of this study to test whether a comprehensive program may help the lymph fluid to drain out of the arm and prevent lymphedema in participants with breast cancer.
