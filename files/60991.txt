Search of Protein Biomarkers in Order to Achieve a Molecular Classification of Gliomas
The aim is to classify high grade glioma by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI). In order to provide more specific informations for the diagnosis and the prognosis of high grade glioma.
