Compassionate Use of Asparaginase and Pembrolizumab Combination Theaapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The goal of this study is to investigate the outcomes of patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-NPC) or recurrent-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC) treated with a combination of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and asparaginase.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)
DRUG: Anti-PD1|DRUG: asparaginase
Quantitative Analysis of Plasma EBV DNA Levels for Treatment Response, In nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA serves as a crucial biomarker for both diagnosis and monitoring. EBV, a herpesvirus that infects epithelial cells, is strongly associated with NPC development, especially in endemic regions. The transformation from latent EBV infection to active viral replication is considered a critical step in NPC pathogenesis. This transformation can be detected through circulating viral DNA levels in plasma or by measuring antibodies against various EBV antigens, such as EBNA1, VCA, and EA-D. Elevated EBV DNA levels often correlate with tumor burden and may serve as a predictor of NPC recurrence or progression. Consequently, plasma EBV DNA testing has become an essential tool in NPC clinical management, helping to guide treatment decisions and evaluate treatment response., Until the end of the study

This study is being conducted to investigate the synergistic effect of combining asparaginase with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in tumor-bearing mice. Findings indicate that asparaginase enhances CD8+ T cell activation, and previous reports have shown that nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients exhibit a lower response rate to ICB treatment. This study aims to determine whether the combination therapy of asparaginase and ICB is more effective or less effective compared to the standard ICB-only approach for patients with locoregionally advanced (LA-NPC) or recurrent-metastatic NPC (RM-NPC). Participants are being enrolled who have previously received ICB but continue to experience disease progression.
