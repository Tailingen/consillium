A Randomized Trial of Delayed Radiotherapy in Patients Low-grade Oligodendrogliomas Requiring a Treatment Other Than Surgery
Because of their prolonged survival, patients with 1p/19q-codeleted low-grade oligodendrogliomas treated with RT + PCV are at risk of neurocognitive deterioration. We make the hypothesis that withholding radiotherapy until tumor progression could reduce the risk of neurocognitive deterioration without impairing overall survival.

Survival without neurocognitive deterioration, Survival without neurocognitive deterioration (whatever the cause of deterioration, i.e toxicity or tumor progression) defined as the time from study randomization to failure in any of the 6 cognitive domains that will be explored (i.e memory, working memory, language, visuo-spatial ability, cognitive executive functions, behavioral executive functions) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., During 9 years
Progression free survival, Time from study randomization to the time of progression of the tumor, During 9 years|Overall survival, Time from study randomization to the time of death, During 9 years
