Early Detection of Heart Problems in Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy
Subjects will include patients diagnosed with breast cancer or hematological cancer who are planned for chemotherapy treatment with anthracycline or trastuzumab; and who have one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Subjects will received an extra echocardiogram to determine if heart problems can be detected earlier.
Heart Failure
OTHER: Extra echocardiogram
Change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), a decrease in LVEF of ≥10 percentage points from baseline to a value of \< 50% OR a decrease of LVEF by ≥ 5 percentage points from baseline to LVEF \<50% for patients who have a baseline LVEF of 50-54%, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Survival status, alive or deceased, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Change in symptoms that may be indicative of heart failure, Presence of absence of symptoms, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Change in treatment that may be indicative of heart failure, Presence or absence of treatment for heart failure, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Change in strain echo that may be indicative of heart failure, Presence or absence of heart failure by imaging, through study completion, an average of 1 year
* Patients scheduled for potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy would receive a baseline echocardiogram as per standard protocol which should be covered by the routine insurance
* Follow-up with an extra echocardiogram for research purposes would be performed after 2 cycles of that chemotherapy - supplied by the study
* Clinical assessment at 3 to 6 months including repeat echocardiography as per standard care with the research question as whether any differences in strain pattern between pre-chemo and post 2 cycles studies all identify patients who are more likely to have cardiac issues later.
* Patients will have standard of care visits at 3 month, 6 month and 12 month and will be evaluated for cardiac status and survival.
* Patient records will be reviewed at 5 years to check cardiac status and survival.
