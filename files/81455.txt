A Study of CT0596 in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Relapsed/ Refractory Plasma Cell Leukemia
A Clinical Study to Explore the Safety, Efficacy, and Cellular Metabolic Dynamics of CT0596 CAR-T Cell Injection in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Leukemia.
Relapsed/Refractory Plasma Cell Leukemia|Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: CAR-T cells Infusion chimeric antigen receptor T cells
Adverse Events (AE) after CT0596 infusion, An assessment of severity grade will be made according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria, 12 months after CT0596 infusion]|Maximum tolerated dose and/or dose range, Evaluate Dose limited toxicity and recommended dosage range after CT0596 infusion, 12 months after CT0596 infusion
Overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by the investigator, Overall response rate (ORR) defined as proportion of patients achieving partial response or better based on International Myeloma Working Group defined response criteria, 12 months after CT0596 infusion|Complete response/stringent complete response (CR/sCR) rate, Rate of complete response/stringent complete response (CR/sCR) defined as proportion of patients achieving complete response or better based on International Myeloma Working Group（ IMWG） defined response criteria., 12 months after CT0596 infusion|Rate of very good partial response (VGPR) and above, Rate of complete very good partial response response/stringent complete response (VGPR/CR/sCR) defined as proportion of patients achieving VGPR or better based on International Myeloma Working Group（IMWG） defined response criteria, 12 months after CT0596 infusion|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response （DOR） is defined as the time from first achievingpartial response（ PR ）or better to confirmed disease progression or death from any cause, 12 months after CT0596 infusion|Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate, Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate is defined as the proportion of patients with VGPR or better who achieved 10-5 sensitivity of nucleated cell, 12 months after CT0596 infusion|Time to response (TTR), Time to response（TTR ）defined as the time from the date of apheresis to the date of initial assessment of PR or better according to IMWG2016 criteria, 12 months after CT0596 infusion|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival（PFS） defined as the time from the date of apheresis of the subject to the first assessment of confirmed disease progression or death from any cause according to International Myeloma Working Group（ IMWG）2016 criteria, whichever occurs first., 12 months after CT0596 infusion|Test Copy number of CAR, Evaluate cellular pharmacokinetics of CT0596, 12 months after CT0596 infusion]|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival（OS） defined as the time from the date of apheresis of the subject to death from any cause, 12 months after CT0596 infusion|Cytokines in the peripheral blood after CT0596 infusion, Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6 after CT0596 infusion, 12 months after CT0596 infusion]
