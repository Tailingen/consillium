MRI and Biomarkers for Lung Nodules Detected During Lung Cancer Screening
The primary objective of this pilot observational study is to evaluate the accrual and retention rate of a study population from a centralized lung cancer screening program to support MRI and blood-based biomarker research for lung cancer screening.
Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Lung MRI|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood Draw
Accrual and Retention Rate, The primary outcome measure is the accrual and retention rate of a study population from a centralized lung cancer screening program to support MRI and blood-based biomarker research., 3 years
Concordance of Size of Nodules, The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the concordance of imaging features of nodules on LDCT versus MRI in a screening population. Concordance of the size of nodules on LDCT versus MRI will be analyzed using Bland Altman and linear regression., 3 Years|Concordance of Nodule Features: Presence of Calcifications, The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the concordance of imaging features of nodules on LDCT versus MRI in a screening population. Concordance for the presence of calcifications will be analyzed using McNemar's test, sensitivity and specificity., 3 years|Concordance of Nodule Features: Presence of Fat, The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the concordance of imaging features of nodules on LDCT versus MRI in a screening population. Concordance for the presence of fat will be analyzed using McNemar's test, sensitivity and specificity., 3 years|Concordance of Nodule Features: Presence of Spiculations, The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the concordance of imaging features of nodules on LDCT versus MRI in a screening population. Concordance for the presence of spiculations will be analyzed using McNemar's test, sensitivity and specificity., 3 years|Concordance of Nodule Features: Solid, Part Solid, Non-Solid, The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the concordance of imaging features of nodules on LDCT versus MRI in a screening population. Concordance for whether the nodule is solid, part solid, or non-solid will be analyzed using McNemar's test, sensitivity and specificity., 3 years
Exploratory Outcomes, The exploratory objectives of this study are to generate preliminary data in support of larger studies in a lung cancer screening population looking at: 1) the use of genetic biomarkers and 2) the use of novel MRI acquisition parameters and radiomics, 3 years
