Colonic Stenting With Elective Surgery Versus Emergency Surgery in the Management of Acute Malignant Colonic Obstruction
The use of colonic stenting with elective surgery has been suggested as an alternative management for acute malignant colonic obstruction, as emergency surgery has a high risk of morbidity and mortality.

However, the available body of literature addressing their benefit in this setting is contradictory.

The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of colonic stenting with elective surgery versus emergency surgery in the management of acute malignant colonic obstruction.
Acute Malignant Colonic Obstruction|Colorectal Cancer|Colonic Obstruction
PROCEDURE: Colonic Stenting with Elective Surgery|PROCEDURE: Emergency Surgery
Rates of primary colorectal anastomosis, The primary colorectal anastomosis was defined as: the patients received one-stage surgery and colorectal anastomosis by whatever elective or emergency surgery., From date of randomization until the first follow-up ended, assessed up to 30 days
Stoma rates, The stoma constructed for any reason, whether temporary or definitive., From date of randomization until the follow-up ended, assessed up to 2 years|Mortality, Death from any cause., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 2 years|Procedure related complication, Including but not limited to: anastomotic leakage, wound infection, intra-abdominal sepsis, re-obstruction, stent migration, perforation, bleeding, etc., From date of randomization until the first follow-up ended, assessed up to 30 days|Re-operation rates, Re-operation is defined as repeat surgery or endoscopic treatment for whatever reason within 2 years., From date of randomization until the follow-up ended, assessed up to 2 years|R0 resection, R0 resection is defined as negative resection margins and no residual tumor., From date of randomization until the first follow-up ended, assessed up to 30 days|Quality of life, Quality of life assessments will be done with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire,EORTC QLQ-C30, and the questionnaire module for colorectal cancer, EORTC QLQ-CR29., From date of randomization until the follow-up ended, assessed up to 2 years|Hospital stay and cost, From date of the admission to discharge, assessed up to 30 days|Recurrence of colorectal cancer, From date of randomization until the follow-up ended, assessed up to 2 years
Technical success, Technically success is defined as successful endoscopic placement of the stent in the correct position., From date of randomization until the first follow-up ended, assessed up to 30 days|Clinical success, Clinical success is defined as the resolution of obstructive symptoms and the production of flatus or stool within 3 days after colonic stenting., From date of randomization until the first follow-up ended, assessed up to 30 days
Colorectal cancer is one commonly diagnosed malignancy worldwide, with an estimated 10 million new cases and 6 million deaths . Around 8%-29% of patients with colorectal cancer present with acute colonic obstruction, and 70% of all malignant obstruction occurs in the left-sided colon. It has been reported that about 15%-20 % of patients with colorectal cancer present with acute obstructive symptoms at the time of diagnosis.

Conventionally, these patients are treated with emergency surgery to restore luminal continuity, which includes a variety of strategies such as the so-called two-stage surgery involving primary resection with colostomy (i.e., Hartmann's procedure) or proximal colostomy followed by resection, and one-stage surgery involving primary resection with anastomosis. Whatever the strategy chosen, the emergency surgery has an associated high risk of morbidity and mortality, and about two-thirds of such patients end up with a permanent stoma, which caused lower health-related quality of life and costs associated with stoma care.

Since 1991, the colonic stenting has been applied as palliative treatment for patients with unresectable colorectal cancer. In 1993, Tejero et al. reported using colonic stenting as a bridge to definitive surgery. Recently, Zhang et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 8 studies (6 retrospective and 2 randomized trials) and indicated that stent placement before elective surgery, also known as a bridge to surgery, lead to a reduction in need of intensive care (risk ratio \[RR\], 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.19-0.93), stoma creation (RR, 0.70; 0.50-0.99), and overall complications (RR, 0.42; 0.24-0.71) compared with the emergency surgery cohort, meanwhile, colonic stenting with elective surgery achieved higher primary anastomosis rate (RR, 1.62; 1.21-2.16), and did not adversely affect the mortality and long-term survival. The most common complications of colonic stenting were re-obstruction (12%), migration (11%), and perforation (4.5%).

However, the available body of literature addressing the benefit of colonic stenting with elective surgery is contradictory, and limited by the lack of the prospective randomised controlled trials. Therefore, we plan to conduct this multicenter, prospective, open label,cohort study, to determine the efficacy and safety of colonic stenting with elective surgery versus emergency surgery in the management of acute malignant colonic obstruction.
