PALS for Pap Smear Follow up
In this study, the researchers will utilize information gained from patient interviews about their knowledge of the cervical cancer screening and treatment process, and perceived barriers surrounding appropriate follow up, to create content for the intervention.

The overall goal of this research is to develop and test an intervention designed to improve knowledge and follow up among underserved women with abnormal pap smears. The researchers will use a unique web-based platform, the Patient Activated Learning System (PALS), which provides engaging and informative video and text designed to improve patient knowledge specifically among underserved populations. Twenty diverse patients with abnormal pap smears will be recruited from the Women's Health colposcopy clinic for initial qualitative interviews. Forty patients from the same population will then be engaged in a pre-post pilot to examine feasibility, acceptability, and impact of modules on improving knowledge.
