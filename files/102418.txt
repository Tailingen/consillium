Neoadjuvant PD-1 Blockade in Resectable Merkel Cell Carcinoma
The main purpose of this study is to determine the response of Merkel cell carcinoma to pembrolizumab before surgery and to determine whether it further reduces the risk for disease recurrence. Another purpose of this study is to look at the side effects that occur when the experimental drug pembrolizumab is given to people with Merkel cell carcinoma before and after their standard of care surgery to remove the Merkel cell carcinoma.
Merkel Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
: Pathologic Response Rate, The number of subjects with pathologic complete response (CR) or near CR defined by less than 10% viable tumor cells will be determined for subjects who received 1 dose of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab and underwent definitive surgery. PathCR/nearCR rate is defined as the percentage of treated subjects who achieve PathCR/nearCR, Approximately 3 weeks
Frequency and incidence of adverse events, Toxicity will be determined by scoring treatment-related AEs and SAEs. CTCAE version 5.0 grades will be employed., Up to 13 months|Tumor infiltrating response (TIL), Patients will be assessed for TIL response at the 3-week resection time point, with the resection tumor assessed for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by a board-certified pathologist. TIL response will be captured as a binary outcome that is either brisk TIL (diffuse lymphocytes throughout the tumor) or not (non-brisk TIL or absent TIL), Approximately 3 weeks|Two Year Recurrence-Free Survival, Recurrence-free survival (RFS) is defined as the time from date of surgery to date of disease recurrence, death due to any cause or most recent follow-up documenting freedom from recurrence (i.e., scan date)., Approximately 2 years
