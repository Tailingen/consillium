Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Heart-rate Corrected QT(QTc) Interval Prolongation During Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy -Randomized Blind Clinical Trial-
Sympathetic activity could be increased during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, which is performed in a steep trendelenburg position under CO2 pneumoperitoneum.

Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system prolongs the QT interval and can increases the susceptibility to life threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

Dexmedetomidine has sympatholytic effects and potential antiarrhythmic properties. Perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine is a potential preventive and treatment strategy for tachyarrhythmia. Thus the investigators decided to evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on heart-rate corrected QT interval during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Furthermore, the investigators evaluated the Tp-e, Tp-e/QT ratio and Tp-e/QTc ratio as well.
