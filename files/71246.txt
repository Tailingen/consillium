Predictive Response to Chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) by ex Vivo Culture 3D Technique in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Prospective, open labelled, multicenter trial to evaluate the feasibility of ex vivo culture 3D (chemogram obtaining) on biopsies in order to estimate the predictive value of this technique for treatment response in patients treated by two different chemotherapies (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) for colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: biopsy to obtain a chemogram
Number of interpretable chemogram, In ex vivo 3D culture from tumor biopsies, number of interpretable chemogram., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Correlation between chemogram results obtained by 3D culture and RECIST 1.1 response assessement., Number of chemogram showing the same response to treatment than patient RECIST 1.1 measured response., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Chemosensitivity evaluated on 3D culture., on untreated and treated fragments : proliferating index (ki67) and apoptosis (M30) will be assessed., through study completion, an average of 1 year|time to obtain chemogram, through study completion, an average of 1 year
The CULTURE 3D study is a prospective, open labelled, multicenter trial. The aim is to evaluate the feasibility of ex vivo culture 3D (chemogram) on biopsies in order to estimate the predictive value of this technique for treatment response in patients treated by two different chemotherapies (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) for colorectal cancer.

Patients will have biopsies in a metastasis or in the primitive tumor before treatment. The sample will be used for a 3D ex vivo cells culture. A chemogram will be made based on cells proliferation data (Ki67) and apoptosis (M30).

Results from this chemogram will not interfere with the treatment combination choice.

The treatment response will be evaluated by the RECIST assessment and will be then compared to the chemogram.
