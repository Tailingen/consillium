Autologous Immune Killer Cells to Treat Liver Cancer Patients as an Adjunct Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ex vivo expanded autologous immune killer cells in treating hepatocellular carcinoma patients inï¼š

1. Reduction of tumor size
2. Reducing the relapse rate: Reducing the frequency of TACE treatment by IKC injections.
HepatoCellular Carcinoma|Liver Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: IKC (Immune Killer Cells)|PROCEDURE: TACE (Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization)
Change of tumor size, Evaluate the efficacy of autologous immune killer cells using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) by recording net changes of tumor sizes, One year|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse, One year
Improvement of immune responses, Evaluate the efficacy and safety of in vitro proliferating autoimmune killer cells as adjuvant therapy for the treatment of liver cancer patients and promote anti-cancer immune responses, One year
This is a phase II/III clinical study. Blood is drawn from the patient and brought to our laboratory for isolation of immune cells. These immune cells are then proliferated over a two week period and used to produce the patented product IKC (Immune Killer Cells). The IKC will then infused back into the patient to treat the cancer. Each patient will receive a total of twelve infusions.

60 patients are anticipated to be recruited. This is a double-arm study, the experimental group will receive IKC treatment along with TACE treatment. The control group will receive only TACE treatment. 30 patients will be randomized into each arm.
