Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a promising 3D imaging technique for breast imaging that use in breast cancer detection. it acquires reconstructed volume data , the data is reconstructed secondarily in mammary slices from several radiographs acquired from different angles of view (-15◦ to +15◦ for Fuji). It theoretically improves the sensitivity of detection by enabling enhanced delimitation of the lesion margins, and the specificity by avoiding the problem of glandular superimposition, By separating overlapping breast tissues \& it enhances detection of abnormalities located in different planes. DBT has higher breast cancer detection rates and lower recall rates compared with digital mammography (DM). There is also evidence of the diagnostic efficacy of DBT in women with clinical symptoms and women with screen-detected findings who have been recalled for work-up. Consequently, recommendations have been made about the role of DBT in screening asymptomatic women according to their risk levels, in evaluation of symptomatic women, and in work-up of suspicious DM findings. The main objective of this study was to compare tomosynthesis with 2D mammography in cases with suspected BI-RADS 4 or 5 anomalies, to determine its potential benefit for staging.
