A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of HB0052 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of HB0052 in patients with advanced solid tumors
Solid Tumors
DRUG: HB0052 Injection
Safety and tolerability, Number of participants with a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) \[ Time Frame: During the first 21 days \]DLTs will be assessed during the first 21 days of treatment for dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected or definite relationship to study drug, Up to 12 Months|MTD, MTD or OBD and/or RP2D., Up to 24 Months
AUC, Area Under concentration-time Curve (AUC), Up to 24 Months|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax), Up to 24 Months|Tmax, Half-life time of maximum concentration, Up to 24 Months
ORR assessment in dose-escalation phase, Overall response rate (ORR) as measured by RECIST v1.1., Up to 24 Months
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or dose-limiting toxicity（DLT）or optimal biological dose (OBD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) for HB0052.
