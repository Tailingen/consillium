Intraoperative Monitoring of Heart rate variability, Blood pressure variability, Baroreceptorsensivity etc.
Brain Tumor, Recurrent|Vestibular Schwannoma|Brainstem Neoplasm|Brainstem Glioma
PROCEDURE: Intraoperative Monitoring during resection of brain tumor
Heart rate variability (HRV), Comparison of HRV in the 2 groups (brain stem-associated vs. non associated surgery), intraoperatively
Rate of cardiovascular complications, Comparison of no. of cardiovascular complications (cardiac arrest, sudden tachy/bradyarryhthmia, hyper/hypotension, trigeminocardiac reflex) in the 2 groups, intraoperatively
Intraoperative Monitoring of Heart rate variability, Blood pressure variability, Baroreceptorsensivity etc.
