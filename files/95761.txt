Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Sham-Controlled Study of Plasma Exchange for Acute Severe Attacks of Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease Refractory to Intravenous Methylprednisolone
OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate the effectiveness of plasma exchange in the treatment of acute severe attacks of inflammatory demyelinating disease in patients who have failed intravenous steroid therapy.
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis|Devic's Syndrome|Marburg's Variant of Multiple Sclerosis|Balo's Concentric Sclerosis|Acute Transverse Myelitis
PROCEDURE: Plasma exchange
PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by disease type; each stratum is randomized separately.

The first group of patients receives a true plasma exchange using continuous-flow centrifugation with serum albumin and crystalloid replacement every 2 days for a total of 7 exchanges.

The second group receives a sham plasma exchange with no centrifugation every 2 days for a total of 7 exchanges.

Patients cross to the alternate therapy if there is less than a moderate improvement by day 14. The treatment decision is based on a blinded neurologic assessment.

Concurrent corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, and high-dose barbiturates are not allowed.

Patients are followed at 1 and 6 months after the last exchange.
