Impact of Adapted Physical Activity on Patient's Recovery Following Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Hematological Malignancy
It is a study about adaptated physical activity for patients receiving a stem cell transplantation. They will benefit of 6 adaptated individuals lessons at home between 1 month and 3 months after stem cell transplantation. The study's goal is to observe if adaptated activity has an positive impact on weight loss and on life quality.
Haematological Malignancy
OTHER: 6 sessions of adapted physical activity after stem cell transplant
weight loss, Body weight n in kilograms, before stem cell transplantation, 1 month , 3 months, 1 year after stem cell transplantation|weight loss, Calculation of the percent of body weight loss between the " before stem cell transplantation evaluation " and each evaluation after stem cell transplantation and after adaptated physical activity sessions., before stem cell transplantation, 1 month , 3 months, 1 year after stem cell transplantation
patient's ability to attend the classes, number of adaptated physical activity lessons attended by each patient after stem cell transplantation, calculation of feasibility, 3 months after stem cell transplantation|body mass index, Measure of weight and height to evaluate the nutriotional status of a patient, before stem cell transplantation, 1 month , 3 months, 1 year after stem cell transplantation|brachial muscle circumference, evaluation in centimeters of the brachial circumference to evaluate the evolution of the muscle circumference after stem cell transplantation and adaptated physical activity compared to the evaluation before stem cell transplantation. Using a measuring tape, before stem cell transplantation , 1 month , 3 months, 1 year after stem cell transplantation|grip strength evaluation, it is a measure of muscular strength, before stem cell transplantation , 1 month , 3 months, 1 year after stem cell transplantation|short physical battery test, it is a series of 3 physical tests to evaluate mobility the first test is a balance test (4 points), the second test is an evaluation of a walking speed (4 points) and the third test is a Chair rise test (4 points) The global test is on 12 points (12 is the better score), before stem cell transplantation , 1 month , 3 months, 1 year after stem cell transplantation|Quality of Life Questionary C30 (QLQ-C30), it is a score to evaluate the quality of life of patients facing illness The subscales scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher score on functionnal scales indicating better function and higher scores on sumptom scales indicating worse symptoms, before stem cell transplantation , 1 month , 3 months, 1 year after stem cell transplantation|in house developped physical activities questionary, it is a questionnary created especially for this study to evaluate on each step the capacity of each patient to maintain physical activities (social activities, autonomy at home for cooking and hygiene care, autonomy for transport to go to hospital appointments), before stem cell transplantation , 1 month , 3 months, 1 year after stem cell transplantation
