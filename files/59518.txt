A Study of GSK5764227 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The goal of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, clinical activity and pharmacokinetics of GSK5764227. The study will also see how the levels of GSK5764227 will change over time at different dose amounts when administered alone and in combination with other medicines like carboplatin, cisplatin, atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab.
