A Dose-finding Study of RO5323441 in Patients With Metastatic Treatment-Refractory Colorectal or Ovarian Cancer
This exploratory, open label study will assess the the dose-effect relationship, efficacy and safety of RO5323441 in patients with metastatic treatment-refractory colorectal or ovarian cancer. Cohorts of patients will receive doses of intravenous RO5323441 in the range of 25mg to 3g every 1 or 2 weeks and will undergo serial dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) assessments. In the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity, patients may continue to receive their maximum dose of RO5323441 for a core treatment phase of up to a total of 6 months. Treatment with RO5323441 can be extended at the investigator's discretion until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Target sample size is \<100.
