A Study of RO5429083 in Patients With Metastatic and/or Locally Advanced, CD44-Expressing, Malignant Solid Tumors
This open-label 2-arm study will assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and efficacy of RO5429083 in patients with metastatic and/or locally advanced CD44-expressing malignant solid tumors. In Part A, cohorts of patients will receive RO5429083 intravenously at escalating doses. In Part B, patients will receive 89Zr-labelled RO5429083 in Cycles 1 and/or 2, followed by RO5429083. For all patients there will be an option to continue treatment with RO5429083 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
