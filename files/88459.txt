Detection of Lymphnodes Using ICG During RARP
The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether the detection of lymph nodes by means of intraoperative fluorescence lymphography as part of lymphadenectomy in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is higher than without the use of indocyanine green (ICG).
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: ICG
The total number of detection rate of (positive) lymph nodes using ICG, during the surgery
Measurements of the time, that takes to remove the lymph nodes, During the surgery
Determine the anatomical location of the ICG-positive lymph node, During th surgery
ICG is a fluorescent dye that fluoresces green bound to proteins under illumination in the near-infrared range. Using this dye allows to visualize lymphatic nodes, by being injected into the tumor or directly surrounding tissue.
