ONO-4538 Study in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of ONO-4538 in subjects with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer unsuited to radical radiotherapy and resistant to a platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen.
Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: ONO-4538|DRUG: ONO-4538
Response Rate (Centrally Assessed), Response rate (%) = (Number of subjects whose confirmed best overall response was complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) / Total number of FAS)\*100. 95% Confidence interval (CI) was calculated by Wilson method., Screening phase: Up to 14 days before enrollment.Treatment phase: Day 43 of each cycle or end of treatment phase (up to approximately 10 months).Follow-up phase: 28 days after final dose or for discontinuation occurring 28 or fewer days after final dose.
Response Rate (Investigator-assessed), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Screening phase: Up to 14 days before enrollment.Treatment phase: Day 43 of each cycle or end of treatment phase (up to approximately 10 months).Follow-up phase: 28 days after final dose or for discontinuation occurring 28 or fewer days after final dose.|Overall Survival, Overall survival (days) = (the date of death due to any cause) - (the first dose date of investigational product) + 1. 95% CI was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method., Follow-up phase: Every 6 months after the first day of treatment of the last subject enrolled in the study, until death or study completion.|Progression Free Survival (Centrally Assessed), Progression free survival (days) = (the earlier date of the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause) - (the first dose date of investigational product) + 1. 95% CI was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method., Screening phase: Up to 14 days before enrollment.Treatment phase: Day 43 of each cycle or until central PD was confirmed or data cut-off point.Follow-up phase: Until beginning subsequent treatment for non-small cell lung cancer or PD or recurrence.|Duration of Response (Centrally Assessed), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions assessed by CT or MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. Duration of response (days) = (the date of the first documented PD or death due to any cause after response was confirmed) - (the date of the first confirmed CR or PR) + 1. Median (95% CI) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method., Screening phase: Up to 14 days before enrollment.Treatment phase: Day 43 of each cycle or end of treatment phase(up to approximately 10 months).Follow-up phase: Until beginning subsequent treatment for non-small cell lung cancer or PD or recurrence.
