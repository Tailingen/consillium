PreventiOn of DYSbioSis Complications With Autologous FMT in AML Patients
The investigators propose to use autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (AFMT) to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with intensive chemotherapy and antibiotics in order to restore the balance of their intestinal microbiome and thereby eradicate treatment-induced multidrug resistant bacteria (MDRB), infection-related complications, as well as sequelae to the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, the investigators propose to perform a single-arm multicentre prospective fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) trial in AML patients receiving intensive chemotherapy, and who are usually heavily treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics during aplasia that generate a profound status of dysbiosis. For this purpose, at the time of admission and AML diagnosis, patients will be requested to donate stools that will be comprehensively screened, and if deemed appropriate according to protocol criteria, conditioned and stored frozen until future processing and transplantation after aplasia completion.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
DRUG: Autologous Fecal Microbiota Transplantation
Evaluation of AFMT efficacy in dysbiosis correction by measure of microbiota diversity, Comparison of Alpha and Beta diversity indexes at baseline, after chemotherapy and after AFMT will be performed, 40 days|Evaluation of AFMT efficacy in MDRB eradication based on bacterial culture, MDRB carriage and resistome will be compared at baseline, after chemotherapy and after AFMT, 40 days
Definition of a dysbiosis biosignature using combination of biological parameters, Microbiota sequencing results will be correlated with immune parameters, 40 days
