Eighty eight children (44 with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 44 healty; age range 7-14 years) will be recruited for the study. The children will be classified into four subgroups based on their periodontal status; 1) Children with gingivitis and diabetes mellitus (MG, n=22); 2) Children with type 1 diabetes mellitus with healthy periodontium (MH, n=22); 3)Healthy children with gingivitis (HG, n=22); 4) Healthy children with healthy periodontium (HH, n=22). Probing pocket depth (PPD), gingival index (GI) and plaque index (PI) will be recorded. Interleukin-18 and TNF-α will be analyzed in GCF and saliva samples by ELISA.
