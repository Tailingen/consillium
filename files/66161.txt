A Genotype-Phenotype Urothelial Cancer Registry
This study is being done to create a registry to help us learn more about urinary and other cancers. This will let us look at large groups of people who do and do not have this kind of cancer.

The investigators will look at risk factors to learn more about how these impact cancer. The investigators will also look at genetic markers. These are genes that are found in a known place. They are often associated with a particular trait. If the gene changes in some way, it may predict cancer or response to treatment. The investigators will look for markers in your saliva.

This registry will help us develop better methods of:

Preventing these cancers. Diagnosing these cancers. Treating these cancers.

OTHER: saliva sample and questionaire|OTHER: saliva sample, questionaire
Determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms in regions discovered from whole genome scans, such as 8q24 & chromosome 3, & candidate genes, include NAT2 & GSTM1, prev found to be assoc with bladder ca risk, are assoc with UC in this study population, 2 years
To determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genes and regions listed above are associated with outcomes after UC diagnosis in the population, 2 years
