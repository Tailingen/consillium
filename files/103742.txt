the Serum Metabolite Based PrecogColo Dx Test for Advanced Colorectal Neoplasia Screening
This study is to Evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity of the serum metabolite based PrecogColo Dx test for advanced colorectal neoplasia Screening, including advanced adenoma and colorectal cancer. There are two steps in this study. Firstly, the diagnostic model is established based on tumor-specific and gut-microbiome related serum metabolites. Secondly, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the diagnostic model is evaluated in detecting advanced adenoma and colorectal cancer stages in an independent multi-centered cohort.
Colorectal Adenoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PrecogColo Dx test
Primary Effectiveness Evaluations, Lower bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval of PrecogColo Dx Sensitivity for CRC was greater than 65%, and lower bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval of PrecogColo Dx specificity for non-advanced neoplasia (including normal, non-adenomas polyps and low risk adenoma) was greater than 85%., 2 weeks
Subjects aged \>45 at average risk for development of CRC will be enrolled. Subjects will complete the PrecogColo Dx test, followed by completion of a screening colonoscopy. . Results from PrecogColo Dx test were compared to the results of an optical colonoscopic examination, and histopathological diagnosis of all significant lesions discovered during the colonoscopy, in order to determine the sensitivity for CRC and advanced adenoma, respectively, as well as determining specificity of non-advanced neoplasia individuals. Histopathological results from biopsied tissue or excised lesions were categorized based on the most clinically significant lesion present by a central pathologist.
