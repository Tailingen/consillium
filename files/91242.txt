A Study to Evaluate [18F]-FDG PET (Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron) in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer (MK-0000-144)
This study will determine whether \[18F\]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can be used to screen for the activity of novel pancreatic cancer treatments.
Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Comparator: [18F]-FDG PET/CT and Volumetric CT
Association of changes in FDG uptake with overall survival (OS), Week 3 and at least 7 months after the last patient is treated
Association of metabolic response with OS, Baseline, Week 3, and at least 7 months after the last patient is treated|Correlation between FDG standardized uptake values (SUV) at Week 3 and Week 6-7, Week 3 and Week 6-7
This study will determine whether \[18F\]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can be used to screen for the activity of novel pancreatic cancer treatments.
