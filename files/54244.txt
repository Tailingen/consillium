Purpose Project: Reclaiming Life Purpose After Breast Cancer (Feasibility Study)
The Purpose Project intervention is an 8-session progressive structure that was developed based on theoretical and scientific evidence from psychology and occupational therapy. The goal of the intervention is to provide participants with information, tools, and support that help them move towards reclaiming a sense of self-grounded purpose in daily life. The study will use a convenience sample of women with breast cancer to evaluate the feasibility of the Purpose Project intervention in terms of demand/acceptability, implementation, and limited-efficacy testing. Findings will be used to inform a later study to evaluate the efficacy of the Purpose Project intervention.
