First-line Treatment of Advanced/unresectable DDLPS
Evaluating the efficacy and safety of liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride and apatinib in combination with camrelizumab for the first-line treatment of advanced/unresectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma
Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma|Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS)
DRUG: Liposomal Doxorubicin (Doxil)|DRUG: Apatinib|DRUG: Camrelizumab
overall response rate, ORR, the best response rate, up to two years
progression free survival, PFS, from first dose treatment to disease progression, up to three years|overall survival, OS, overall survival, up to three years|adverse events, AE, treatment related adverse events, TRAEs, up to three years
Based on the clinical benefits provided by doxorubicin liposome, apatinib and camrelizumab treatment in STS, this study intends to explore the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin liposome hydrochloride and apatinib combined with camrelizumab in the first-line treatment of advanced/unresectable dedifferentiated liposarcoma with the aim of providing a better therapeutic option for the clinic.
