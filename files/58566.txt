Treatment of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-Related Hemangioblastoma With PTK787/ZK 222584
The purpose of this study is to determine whether PTK787/ZK 222584 is effective in treating hemangioblastoma of the brain and/or retina in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. The study will also assess safety and tolerability of PTK787/ZK 222584, and changes in markers of angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth).
