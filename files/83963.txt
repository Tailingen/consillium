Study of KRN951 in Patients With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of KRN951 administered to patients with solid tumors. In the single dose period, patients in each cohort will receive one oral dose of KRN951 in the first day, followed by a 6-day rest period during which no treatment is received. After that, patients in each cohort will receive one oral dose of KRN951 daily over a 21-day treatment period, followed by a 7-day rest period during which no treatment is received. Treatment will be continued in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable adverse events.
