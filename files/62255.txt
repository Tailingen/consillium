Study of KITE-197 in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Large B-cell Lymphoma
This study will have two Phases: Phase 1a and Phase 1b. The goal of Phase 1a of this clinical study is to learn more about the safety, tolerability and dosing of study drug KITE-197, in participants with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (r/rLBCL). The goal of Phase 1b of this clinical study is learn about the effectiveness of the recommended dose of KITE-197 in participants with r/r LBCL.

The primary objectives of this study are:

Phase 1a: To evaluate the safety of KITE-197 in participants with r/r LBCL and determine the target dose level for Phase 1b.

Phase 1b: To evaluate the efficacy of KITE-197 in participants with r/r LBCL as measured by the complete remission (CR) rate.

DRUG: KITE-197|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine
Phase 1a: Percentage of Participants Experiencing any Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), First infusion date of KITE-197 up to 28 days|Phase 1b: Complete Remission (CR) Rate, Complete remission rate is defined as the proportion of participants with complete remission, per international working group (IWG) Lugano classification, as assessed by the investigator., Up to 24 months

Participants will be followed for approximately 24 months after the infusion of KITE-197 before transitioning to a separate Kite long-term follow-up study KT-US-982-5968, in which they will be followed for the remainder of the 15-year follow-up period.
