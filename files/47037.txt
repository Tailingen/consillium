BNT001 Digital Therapeutic Feasibility Pilot Study
This single arm phase II trial focused on cancer patients and cancer survivors in the Veterans Health Administration will gather data on feasibility, acceptability, ease of clinical implementation, and preliminary efficacy of BNT001, a prescription digital software application. BNT001 delivers a 10-session digitally administered version of a published manualized therapy for stress management in adult cancer patients that has established efficacy in improving quality of life and mood.

Identification of promoters and barriers to clinical implementation, Identification of promoters and barriers to clinical implementation of BNT001, a software application that delivers a 10-session, cancer-specific, behavioral intervention called Cognitive-Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM), to adult patients currently undergoing cancer treatment., Baseline to 4 weeks|To measure changes in pre and post cancer-related distress in patient participants., Patient participants symptoms will be assessed with the Veterans Symptom Assessment Screen (VSAS). The VSAS is a clinical patient reported outcomes tool to document cancer-related symptoms to improve quality of life that has been adopted across VA hematology-oncology sites. The VSAS is comprised of 13 symptoms, rated on a 0 to 10 scale., Baseline to 12 weeks
Patient completion rates, To measure patient completion rates via the BNT001's underlying device data capture system., Baseline to 12 weeks|Patient feasibility and acceptability, To measure patient feasibility and acceptability via a midpoint and post-completion questionnaire., Baseline to 12 weeks
This pilot will study specific implementation barriers and facilitators, procedures that are necessary to ensure adherence to utilization of the digital program, as well as any potential safety issues associated with recruiting and offering an intervention to cancer patients with moderate anxiety or mild depressive symptoms. Data relating to patient experience, adherence, satisfaction and pre-post intervention outcomes will also be tracked.

The study will run in two distinct phases to first assess the process of clinical implementation by prescribing oncology clinicians, and in a second more expanded phase, further assess the clinical implementation and impact on enrolled patients.

Study Phase 1: We aim to identify promoters and barriers to the clinical implementation of BNT001, a software application that delivers a 10-session digitally administered version of a published manualized therapy for stress management in adult cancer patients that has established efficacy in improving quality of life and mood.

Study Phase 2: We aim to further identify promoters and barriers to provider clinical implementation of BNT001, assess patient acceptability and feasibility including patient adherence to BNT's 10-sessions, and obtain preliminary data on BNT001's impact on cancer-related distress.
