Dual PSMA and FDG PET Imaging for Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer
This study will use Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) and (18)F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET) imaging in patients with advanced prostate cancer to learn about tumor biology across disease stages and during treatment. This may help with treatment selection and potential response monitoring in the future.
