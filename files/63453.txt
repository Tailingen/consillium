A Study of Oral Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (Vorinostat) in Patients With Solid Tumors (0683-048)
This is a clinical study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of an overseas determined maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-0683 (vorinostat) in a Japanese patient population with solid tumors.
Tumors
DRUG: Vorinostat|DRUG: Vorinostat
Number of Participants With a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Dose Limiting Toxicity = Drug-related side effects that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment, 21 Days (first cycle)
Area Under the Curve (AUC(0-infinity)) at Day 1 (600 mg and 400 mg), Area Under Curve (AUC(0-infinity))=Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to extrapolated infinite time (o- ∞). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - ∞). At 600 mg, t=12 hours and at 400 mg, t=24 hours., Day 1 (600 mg and 400 mg)|Area Under the Curve (AUC(0-infinity)) at Day 3 (600 mg), Area Under Curve (AUC(0-infinity))=Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to 24 ｈours. It is obtained from AUC (0 - 12) plus AUC (12 - ∞), Day 3 (600 mg)|Area Under the Curve (AUC(0-infinity) at Day 21 (400 mg), Area Under Curve (AUC(0-infinity))=Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to 24 ｈours. It is obtained from AUC (0 - 24) plus AUC (24 - ∞), Day 21 (400 mg)|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) at Day 1 (600 mg and 400 mg), Day 1 (600 mg and 400 mg)|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) at Day 3 (600 mg), Day 3 (600 mg)|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) at Day 21 (400 mg), Day 21 (400 mg)
