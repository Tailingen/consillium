Phase 3 Trial of Elacestrant vs. Standard of Care for the Treatment of Patients With ER+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer
This Phase 3 clinical study compares the efficacy and safety of elacestrant to the standard of care (SoC) options of fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) in women and men with breast cancer whose disease has advanced on at least one endocrine therapy including a CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) .
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Elacestrant|DRUG: Standard of Care
Progression-free Survival in ESR1-mut Subjects, Progression-free Survival based on blinded IRC assessment in ESR1-mut subjects defined as the length of time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) as assessed by the blinded IRC or death from any cause. Progression is defined per RECIST v1.1 as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From Date of Randomization until Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (up to 12 Months)|Progression-free Survival in All Subjects, Progression-free Survival based on blinded Imaging Review Committee (IRC) assessment in all (ESR1-mut and ESR1-WT) subjects, From Date of Randomization until Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (up to 12 Months)
Overall Survival in ESR1-mut Subjects, Overall Survival in ESR1-mut subjects, where Overall Survival is defined as the length of time from randomization until the date of death from any cause, From Date of Randomization until Death Due to Any Cause (Estimated up to 24 Months)|Overall Survival in All Subjects, Overall Survival in All (ESR1-mut and ESR1-WT) Subjects, From Date of Randomization until Death Due to Any Cause (Estimated up to 24 Months)
This is an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, event-driven, Phase 3 clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of elacestrant to the SoC options of fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women and in men with advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer, either in subjects with tumors that harbor mutations in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene (ESR1-mut subjects) or in all subjects regardless of ESR1 status (ESR1-mut and ESR1 wild type \[ESR1-WT\]) and whose disease has relapsed or progressed on at least one and no more than two prior lines of endocrine therapy (with documented progression), which must have included prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy in combination with fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) and for whom hormonal monotherapy with one of the SoC drugs (fulvestrant, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) is an appropriate treatment option.
