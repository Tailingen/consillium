Nonrelapsing Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (NRSPMS) Study of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) Inhibitor Tolebrutinib (SAR442168) (HERCULES)
Primary Objective:

To determine the efficacy of SAR442168 compared to placebo in delaying disability progression in NRSPMS

Secondary Objective:

To evaluate efficacy of SAR442168 compared to placebo on clinical endpoints, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, cognitive performance, physical function, and quality of life To evaluate safety and tolerability of SAR442168 To evaluate population pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR442168 and relevant metabolites in NRSPMS and its relationship to efficacy and safety To evaluate pharmacodynamics (PD) of SAR442168

This was an event-driven (6-month CDP) trial with a variable treatment duration (end-of-study \[EOS\] duration: up to approximately 47months).

Participants with 6-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) had an option to receive tolebrutinib in the open-label (OL).
