Comparison of Weekly Versus Every Three Weeks of Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
The aim of the current study is to compare weekly versus three-week collective of carboplatin/paclitaxel in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. The author's hypothesis was to study and correlate routine laboratory tests, clinical biomarkers and quality of life questionnaires between weekly and three-week standard carboplatin regimens in order to reveal any possible superiority for the weekly study arm.
Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin/paclitaxel
Routine blood work and tumor markers, Quantitative continuous parameter assay of blood samples to measure hemoglobin gram/deciliter, total leukocyte count, platelets, neutrophils all in (number/unit liter), serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, serum calcium in (milligram/deciliter), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase in (unit liter), albumin (gram liter), carcinoembryonic antigen (nano-gram milliliter), and cancer antigen-125 (unit milliliter)

This was cross-referenced against the universal laboratory values to identify the degree of anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, calcium deficiency, kidney injury, liver toxicity, and tumor progression comparing pre-and post-treatment results for patients on each regimen separately and also compare post-treatment between the two regimens by end of treatment (weekly dose of carboplatin group and 3-week collective dense dose carboplatin regimens)., 6 cycles for each patient with a total of126 days|Additional kidney and anemia biomarkers, Cystatin-C ng/mL, Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ng/mL, Interleukin-18 pg/mL, Kidney injury marker-1 ng/mL, and Hepcidin pg/mL

Acute kidney injury to the glomerular capsule and proximal tubule was assessed by the increase in Cys-C, NGAL, KIM-1, and IL-18 Anemia and diminished renal clearance resembling kidney injury were measured by increased levels of HEPC

Pre-and post-treatment concentrations were compared for patients on each carboplatin regimen \& post-treatment concentration by the end of treatment between weekly and collective 3-week dense dose

* Biomarkers were measured using ELISA reader
* Absorbance was converted to serum concentration using the standard curve for each biomarker constructed using the readings for standard serial dilutions
* Concentrations were used to compare regimens and outline the carboplatin dosing schedule with the least margin of toxicity

(Higher marker levels outline greater toxicity), 6 cycles for each patient with a total of126 days|Improved quality of life, Functional assessment of cancer therapy-ovarian (FACT-O) \& functional assessment of cancer therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTX)

A 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). FACIT organization developed questions into 5 compartments: {Personal (PWB), Emotional (EWB), Social (SWB), Functional (FWB), Ovarian cancer (OC) \& Neurotoxicity (NTX))

Hard copies, consume 10-15 mins to fill, patients documented their responses, guideline reverse calculation \& trial outcome indices analyzed

Compared at baseline, post-treatment by the end of therapy for each group individually \& post-treatment between both carboplatin regimens FACT-G total score = PWB + EWB + SWB + FWB FACT-O total score = PWB + EWB + SWB + FWB + OC FACT/GOG-Ntx total score = PWB + EWB + SWB + FWB + NTX FACT-O Trial Outcome Index (TOI) = PWB + FWB + OC FACT/GOG-Ntx Trial Outcome Index (TOI) = PWB + FWB + NTX

High scores = enhanced QOL, low scores = poor QOL, 6 cycles for each patient with a total of126 days
Ovarian cancer as the fifth leading cause of death in women worldwide. Since most women suffer asymptomatic manifestations or nonspecific symptoms, subsequent diagnosis is very tricky and late most of the time. Carboplatin/paclitaxel has been among the first line options for treatment of ovarian cancer for decades however, account for a great of deal of adverse effects affecting patient safety. These side effects are dose related whereas, dose of carboplatin is calculated individually for each patient using the Calvert equation focusing on renal functions at baseline. Carboplatin adverse effects are believed to mainly affect the kidneys, hematological system and may cause neurotoxicity thus, exhibit quality of life deteriorations.

The study purpose was to investigate a triple correlation between 3 different aspects comparing the weekly dose versus the three-week dense dose of carboplatin/paclitaxel in treating advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.

Points of comparison:

1. Routine laboratory parameters in an attempt to identify the possible adverse effects accounted to each regimen focusing on hematological, renal, hepatic, and tumor marker panels.
2. Additional biomarkers including cystatin-C, neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin, hepcidin, kidney injury marker-1 and interleukin-18 assessing the probable incidence of acute kidney injury and anemia.
3. Quality of life analyzed by comparing functional assessment of cancer therapy-ovarian and functional assessment of cancer therapy/gynecologic oncology group-neurotoxicity surveys between both groups.

The study encouraged the patient right to be involved and consent to the assigned protocol

The correlation between all three aspects studied as of routine lab work, toxicity biomarkers and quality of life besides the economic burden aim to provide a decent patient tailored treatment regimen balancing efficacy and safety.
