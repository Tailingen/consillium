Study of JSKN016 Combination Therapy in Inoperable Locally Advanced or Metastatic HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of JSKN016 in combination with different treatments for patients with HER2-negative breast cancer that cannot be removed by surgery or has spread to other parts of the body. The study includes four groups of patients based on treatment history and tumor characteristics. Each group will receive JSKN016 with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The goal is to find out how well the treatment works and how safe it is.
Inoperable Locally Advanced HER2-Negative Breast Cancer|Metastatic HER2-Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: JSKN016|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Paclitaxel (albumin bound)|DRUG: Eribulin|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Objetctive Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of participants who achieve a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by investigators according to RECIST v1.1 criteria., From baseline until disease progression, death, or end of treatment, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 24 months)
Duration of Response (DoR), The time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as assessed by investigators per RECIST v1.1., From first documented response to progression or death (up to approximately 24 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of participants who achieve a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), as assessed by investigators using RECIST v1.1 criteria., From baseline to disease progression or end of treatment (up to approximately 24 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time from the date of first dose of study drug to the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1., From first dose until disease progression or death (up to approximately 24 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Time from the date of first dose of study drug to death from any cause., From first dose to death (up to approximately 36 months)|Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), Frequency and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events of special interest (AESIs), coded using MedDRA and graded per NCI-CTCAE v5.0., From first dose through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment (up to approximately 30 months)
This clinical study investigates the safety and efficacy of JSKN016 combined with various therapies for patients with advanced, inoperable, or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer. The study includes four groups with different treatment regimens, targeting HR+HER2-negative breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with varying prior treatments. Participants will receive JSKN016 in combination with paclitaxel, capecitabine, eribulin, or pembrolizumab. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. The secondary endpoints include efficacy, safet, and other related outcomes.
