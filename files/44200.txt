A Phase I/II Study of Tivozanib and Erlotinib as Initial Treatment for Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Assigned by VeriStrat® Serum Proteomic Evaluation
The current trial "A Phase I/II study of Erlotinib +/- Tivozanib as initial treatment for Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer assigned by VeriStrat® Serum Proteomic Evaluation" will begin by evaluating toxicity for the combination of Tivozanib and Erlotinib to determine a phase II dose. The phase II portion of the study will seek to duplicate the finding of the BEER trial in a selected population of patients with NSCLC with a VeriStrat® Good signature using two oral agents with Tivozanib substituted for bevacizumab. Phase II will be designed as a selection-based randomized trial. Patients with VeriStrat® Good signature will be assigned to EGFR inhibitor therapy with a randomization to Erlotinib plus/minus Tivozanib. Patients with VeriStrat® Poor signature will be assigned to standard of care. Standard-of-care chemotherapy as first treatment at the discretion of patient and physician will be evaluated for response to treatment, survival and repeat VeriStrat® signature.
