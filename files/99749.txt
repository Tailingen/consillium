Patient Characteristics, Associated Factors, and Clinical Outcomes of Prescribing Encorafenib and Binimetenib Versus Dabrafenib and Trametinib Among BRAF v600 Mutated Metastatic Melanoma Patients
This was a retrospective real-world evidence cohort study. The study was conducted using the NOBLE (Novartis Braf+ meLanoma patients ObsErvational) dataset, with a study period from 01 January 2011 to 31 May 2020. All included patients were ≥18 years of age and were required to have a diagnosis of unresectable stage III or IV melanoma (ICD-9 172.x \& ICD-10 C43 or D03x), treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib (dab/tram) or encorafenib and binimetenib (enco/bini) on or after 01 June 2018, and evidence of a BRAF-positive result prior to or up to 30 days after therapy initiation.

No quota of centers was established a priori. Given the retrospective nature of this study, all patients who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria from the NOBLE dataset were included.
