Phase IIa Study of Copanlisib in Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
The primary objective of this study is to assess objective response rate (ORR) in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL who failed ibrutinib treatment or were unable to tolerate ibrutinib.
Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell
DRUG: Copanlisib (BAY80-6946)
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during study conduct according to the criteria defined by the Lugano response criteria in NHL 2014., 24 weeks
Complete response rate (CRR), Defined as the proportion of patients who have a best overall response of CR during study conduct according to the criteria defined by the Lugano response criteria in NHL 2014, 24 weeks|Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of patients who have a best response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD), 24 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time (in days) from the date of first administration of study treatment to radiological disease progression or death from any cause (if death occurs before radiological progression is documented). PFS for patients without radiological progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at the last date of evaluable tumor assessment. PFS for alive patients who have no tumor assessments after baseline will be censored at day 1., 24 weeks|Duration of response (DOR), Defined as the time (in days) from the date of first observed tumor response of CR or PR, whichever was noted earlier, to radiological disease progression or death from any cause (if death occurs before radiological progression is documented), 24 weeks|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time (in days) from the date of first administration of study treatment to death from any cause. The OS time for patients alive at the time of analysis will be censored at their last known alive date., 24 weeks|Number of participants with treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as a measure of safety and tolerability, Approximately 7 months
