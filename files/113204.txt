Multi-mode Rehabilitation of Abdominal Tumor Patients Undergoing Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy
The investigators carry out a multi center, randomized controlled clinical study to analyze the impact of the whole process multi-mode rehabilitation management (nutrition-Sports-Psychology) on the nutritional status, physical status, psychological status, treatment side effects and the completion rate of radiotherapy and chemotherapy of patients with abdominal tumors; To explore and establish a multi-mode rehabilitation management path for patients with malignant tumors undergoing concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Research shows that the combination of early nutritional intervention and psychological palliative intervention can improve the quality of life of patients, reduce the probability of depression, improve the prognosis of patients and prolong the overall survival time for up to two months. The research of Peking University Cancer Hospital in China shows that early nutrition and psychological palliative intervention can improve the prognosis of patients with advanced esophageal cancer and prolong the overall survival by nearly three months. The first mock exam (including exercise, nutrition and Psychology) seems to be more effective than a single model of pre rehabilitation. Therefore, the current triple rehabilitation strategy is advocated, namely, high intensity aerobic exercise during the waiting period, nutritional support based on protein supplementation, and psychological support to eliminate anxiety. Tumor multimodal rehabilitation has received more and more attention, but there is no clinical research on the "triple multimodal rehabilitation" of nutrition + Exercise + psychology in patients with abdominal tumor concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Therefore, the research on the impact of whole process multimodal rehabilitation (nutrition-Exercise-Psychology) on patients with abdominal tumor concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy has been carried out, It has important scientific significance and value to promote the rehabilitation and development of tumor patients undergoing concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

In this study,the investigators carry out a multi center, randomized controlled clinical study to analyze the impact of the whole process multi-mode rehabilitation management (nutrition-Sports- Psychology) on the nutritional status, physical status, psychological status, treatment side effects and the completion rate of radiotherapy and chemotherapy of patients with abdominal tumors; To explore and establish a multi-mode rehabilitation management path for patients with malignant tumors undergoing concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
