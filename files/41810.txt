Microbiome and Rectal Cancer
The purpose of our study is to determine if an association exists between the microbiome of those with rectal adenocarcinoma who are complete pathologic responders and those who have a partial or no response to neoadjuvant therapy.
Rectal Cancer|Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Tissue collection
16s rRNA gene sequencing to study bacterial phylogeny and taxonomy, 16s rRNA sequencing from biopsy specimens, 5 years
rectal microbiota to study bacteria strains, rectal microbiota - bacteria strains from biopsy specimens, 5 years
This study will help to further elucidate the association of bacteria with rectal cancer, while also characterizing the genes associated with that risk. Furthermore it will attempt to better understand which patients may have an optimal response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation allowing for possible predictive metagenomics evaluation, investigators may be able to augment treatments as well as provide recommendations for the success and cost effectiveness of cancer care.
