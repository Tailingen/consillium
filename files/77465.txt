Iodine-125 Brachytherapy Together With Chemotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Iodine-125 brachytherapy together with chemotherapy compared with surgical resection followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma
OTHER: Iodine-125+Chemotherapy|OTHER: Surgical resection+Radiochemotherapy
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to progression or death from any causes. Progression is defined as the RANO Criteria indicated., 2.5 years after randomization
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any causes., 2.5 years after randomization|Survival rates at 6 months and 1 year, The survival rates were measured at 6 months and 1 year, at 6 months and 1 year after operation respectively|EORTC QLQ-C30, The Quality of life is measured with EORTC QLQ-C30 (The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life questionnaire). The EORTC QLQ-C30 is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions. The questionnaire is composed of multi-item scales and single items., 2.5 year after randomization|ECOG Performance Status, ECOG PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, performance status) is to assess how a patient's disease is progressing, and how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis. The scale is from 0 to 5. Higher scores mean a worse outcome., 2.5 year after randomization|Complications, Complications 1 week after operation were assessed. The complications after operation include headache, nausea, vomit, myodynamia, seizer, and so on., within 1 week after operation
This is a prospective, multicentric open-label trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Iodine-125 brachytherapy together with chemotherapy compared with surgical resection followed by concomitant radiochemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

The primary efficacy outcome was evaluated with progression-free survival (PFS).
