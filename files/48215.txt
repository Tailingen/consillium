A Study of Fedratinib With IDH Inhibition in Advanced-Phase, IDH-Mutated Ph-Negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of fedratinib (a drug called a "jak inhibitor" ) in combination with ivosidenib or enasidenib (two anti-cancer drugs). While all three drugs are FDA-approved for various conditions, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the combination of these drugs for the treatment of rare blood cancers that present Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, and therefore these drugs can only be given in a research study.
IDH Mutation|IDH1 Mutation|IDH2 Gene Mutation|Blood Cancer|Myeloproliferative Neoplasm
DRUG: Ivosidenib|DRUG: Enasidenib|DRUG: Fedratinib
Maximum Tolerated Dose of Fedratinib Combined with Ivosidenib in Participants Who Have IDH1 Mutations, The maximum tolerated dose of fedratinib in combination with ivosidenib in participants who have IDH1-mutated blood cancer. This will be assessed by the number of reported dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events among participants according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5., 24 months|Maximum Tolerated Dose of Fedratinib Combined with Enasidenib in Participants Who Have IDH2 Mutations, The maximum tolerated dose of fedratinib in combination with ivosidenib in participants who have IDH1-mutated blood cancer. This will be assessed by the number of reported dose-limiting toxicities and adverse events among participants according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5., 24 months
1-Year Overall Survival, The number of patients who are living 1 year after the beginning of treatment on study as assessed by data from clinical records., 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate as assessed by the number of participants who achieve a complete molecular response (CMR), cytogenetic complete response (CCR), acute leukemia response-complete (ALR-C), or acute leukemia response-partial (ALR-P)., 24 months|Time to Response, Time to response will be defined as time from treatment administration to first documented complete molecular response (CMR), cytogenetic complete response (CCR), acute leukemia response-complete (ALR-C), or acute leukemia response-partial (ALR-P). DCR will be defined as the portion of subjects achieving a complete molecular response,cytogenetic complete response (CCR), acute leukemia response-complete (ALR-C), or acute leukemia response-partial (ALR-P) or stabilized disease for â‰¥ 3 months., 24 months
Doctors leading this study hope to learn about the safety of combining fedratinib (a type of drug called a "JAK inhibitor" whichblocks the activity of janus kinase enzymes in your body) with anti-cancer drugs ivosidenib and enasidenib in participants who have rare blood cancers that show Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations (a type of genetic mutation). Your participation in this research will last about 24 months.
