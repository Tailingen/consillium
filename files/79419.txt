Lapatinib In Combination With Chemotherapy In Subjects With Relapsed Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy (capecitabine, docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel) in subjects with ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer whose disease has progressed during or within 12 months after completion of trastuzumab-containing therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.

DRUG: Lapatinib|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: nab-Paclitaxel
Overall Tumor Response, Overall tumor response is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed complete or partial tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. CR could only be declared if all target and non-target lesions had disappeared. Partial response (PR) is defined as a decrease of 30% or greater in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., from start of treatment and every 6 weeks (wks) until Wk 12, then every 12 wks thereafter through the end of treatment (~95 wks; dependent on when participant discontinued study therapy due to disease progression, death, adverse event, of other reason)
Clinical Benefit (CB), CB is defined as the percentage of participants (par.) with either a confirmed CR or PR or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks. SD is defined as small changes that do not meet criteria for CR, PR, or Progressive Disease (defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions)., from start of treatment and every 6 weeks (wks) until Wk 12, then every 12 wks thereafter through the end of treatment (~95 weeks; dependent on when participant discontinued study therapy due to disease progression, death, adverse event, or other reason)|Duration of Response, For the subset of participants with a confirmed CR or PR, duration of response was measured as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death., time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death (approximately 95 weeks)|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documented evidence of PR or CR (whichever status was recorded first). When tumor response was confirmed at a repeat assessment, the TTR was taken to be the first time that the response was observed., start of treatment until first documented evidence of CR or PR (approximately 95 weeks)|Progression-free Survival, The time from the start of treatment until the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause was measured., from start of treatment and every 6 weeks (wks) until Wk 12, then every 12 wks thereafter through the end of treatment (~95 weeks); dependent on when participant discontinued study therapy due to disease progression, death, adverse event, or other reason)|Number of Participants With the Indicated Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events, Qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with the combination of capecitabine, docetaxel, or nab-paclitaxel and lapatinib were measured. Data are presented as serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs). See the SAE/AE section of the results record for data., Baseline through End of Treatment, or discontinuation of study therapy (approximately 95 weeks); from the first dose of lapatinib until 5 days after the last dose of lapatinib
