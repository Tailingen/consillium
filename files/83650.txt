ML Models for Predicting Postoperative Peritoneal Metastasis After Hepatocellular Carcinoma Rupture
This study aimed to address the issue of peritoneal metastasis (PM) following the rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its adverse impact on patient prognosis. Clinical data from 522 patients with ruptured HCC who underwent surgery at seven different medical centers were collected and analyzed. Machine learning models were employed for analysis and prediction.
