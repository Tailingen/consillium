the Role of ctDNA in Predicting the Recurrence Risk of Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study was to observe the relationship between ctDNA as a molecular marker of colorectal cancer and the risk of postoperative recurrence.
Colorectal Cancer Stage II|Colorectal Cancer Stage III
PROCEDURE: Chemotherapy time|PROCEDURE: Chemotherapy time
ctDNA status, Detect postoperative tissue ctDNA status, Two weeks|ctDNA dynamic detection, ctDNA dynamic monitoring during postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, 6 months
Imaging examination, Imaging examination during postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, 6 months|Tumor Marker examination, Tumor marker examination during postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, 6 months
In this clinical study, ctDNA will be detected in postoperative patients with stage Ⅱ and Ⅲ colorectal cancer to evaluate the correlation between ctDNA and the risk of postoperative recurrence. According to the dynamic changes of ctDNA after adjuvant chemotherapy, the correlation between ctDNA and postoperative DFS will be compared, and the feasibility of ctDNA as a molecular marker to evaluate the risk of postoperative recurrence of colorectal cancer will be investigated.
