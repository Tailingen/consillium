Study of Adebrelimab With Chemotherapy, Endoscopy and Sequential Chemoradiotherapy In Inoperable Esophageal Cancer
Evaluating the efficacy and safety of PD-L1 (Programmed Death-L1)antibody combined with endoscopy and radiotherapy for inoperable cT1b-2 (clinical stage tumor 1b-2) esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Adebrelimab injection|DRUG: Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin injection
Pathological complete response of primary lesion, defined as the proportion of subjects with no residual tumor in the primary tumor site and histologically negative lymph nodes, 14 days after endoscopic resection
Major pathological response, defined as the percentage of subjects with \<10% residual tumor in the primary tumor site, 14 days after endoscopic resection|Overall Survival, Overall Survival, From date of signed informed consent until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Recurrence free survival, Recurrence free survival, From the time of complete response to the date of recurrenceï¼Œassessed up to 100 months|Incidence of Adverse events, Incidence of Adverse events, through study completion, assessed up to 50 months|Patients' quality of life, Assessment of patients' quality of life by means of quality of life score questionnaires, such as EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30), through study completion, assessed up to 50 months
Previous studies have already confirm immunotherapy combine with chemotherapy can improve pathological complete response rates. Therefore, it is proposed to carry out a study of immuno-combination chemotherapy combined with endoscopic resection and synchronous radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with clinical stage cT1-2N0M0 (clinical stage tumor 1b-2 clinical stage nodes 0 stage metastasis 0) to evaluate the efficacy and safety
