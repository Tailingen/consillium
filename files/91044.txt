Observational Study of Vectibix With Chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients
The primary objective was to describe the pattern of use of panitumumab (Vectibix®) in combination with chemotherapy in patients with wild-type rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC): as first-line treatment in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI or second-line treatment in combination with FOLFIRI in patients who have received first-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (excluding irinotecan).
