Pylorus Dysfunction After Esophagectomy and Gastric Tube Reconstruction. Effect of Pneumatic Pylorus Dilatation During Hospital Stay, Surgical Complications During in Hospital Stay
Delayed emptying of the gastric tube after esophagectomy is a frequent and durable problem. No treatment is currently available. It can be hypothesized that incomplete relaxation of the pyloric sphincter may be a significant contributing factor. Pneumatic dilatation may therefore be a potentially effective treatment.
Esophagectomy|No Signs of Cancer Recurrence|Delayed Gastric Emptying
DEVICE: Pneumatic pyloric dilatation|OTHER: 15 mm pyloric balloon dilatation
Symptoms suggestive of delayed gastric emptying, Symptoms will be assessed at 3, 6 and 12 months after therapy. In case of failure the code will be broken and if sham procedure has been done the patient will be offered pneumatic dilatation., 3-12 months after treatment

In case of failure the code will be broken and if sham procedure has been done the patient will be offered pneumatic dilatation. Paracetamol test done only 3 months after treatment., 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment.
Patients surviving one year after esophagectomy are sent questionnaires to pick up symptoms suggestive of delayed gastric emptying.Those fulfilling predefined criteria for delayed gastric emptying will be invited to the study. The study design is sham controlled single blind with a follow up extending to twelve months post treatment.
