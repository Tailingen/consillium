Metabiomics Colon Cancer Clinical Research Study
The specific aim of the study is to determine the false negative rate of the Metabiomics Colon Polyp and Colorectal Cancer Assay for Cancer.
Colonic Neoplasms
False negative rate of test for colon cancer, The False Negative Rate is calculated as (100\*False Negative) /(True Positive + False Negative)., immediately post surgery
The purpose of this study is to conduct clinical research to investigate the association of the gut microbiome with colonic neoplasia. In this case several types of gut microbiome samples will be collected from patients undergoing colectomy for colonic adenocarcinoma; those samples will be tested by Metabiomics Colon Polyp and Colorectal Cancer Assay and the percentage of false negative (test returns a negative for cancer) results determined.
