An Investigational Immuno-therapy Study of Nivolumab Combined With Ipilimumab Compared to Nivolumab by Itself After Complete Surgical Removal of Stage IIIb/c/d or Stage IV Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether an investigational immunotherapy Nivolumab, when combined with Ipilimumab, is more effective than Nivolumab by itself, in delaying the return of cancer in patients who have had a complete surgical removal of stage IIIb/c/d or stage IV Melanoma
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: nivolumab|BIOLOGICAL: ipilimumab
Recurrence-free Survival (RFS) - All Randomized Participants, RFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma (including melanoma in situ), or death (from any cause), whichever occurred first.

Median values based on Kaplan-Meier Estimates., From randomization to Primary Completion Date (up to approximately 3 years)|Recurrence-free Survival (RFS) - All Randomized Participants With PD-L1 Expression Level < 1%, RFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma (including melanoma in situ), or death (from any cause), whichever occurred first.

Median based on Kaplan-Meier Estimates., From randomization to Primary Completion Date (up to approximately 3 years)
Overall Survival (OS) - All Randomized Participants, OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. Median based on Kaplan-Meier Estimates., From randomization to date of death (up to approximately 45 months)|Overall Survival (OS) - All Randomized Participants With PD-L1 Expression Level < 1%, OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. Median based on Kaplan-Meier Estimates., From randomization to date of death (up to approximately 45 months)|Recurrence-free Survival (RFS) by Baseline Tumor PD-L1 Expression, RFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma (including melanoma in situ), or death (from any cause), whichever occurred first.

Median based on Kaplan-Meier Estimates., From randomization to Study Completion Date (up to approximately 45 months)|Time to Next-Line Therapies - All Randomized Participants, Time to next therapy was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the start date of next systemic therapy. Participants who did not receive next treatment were censored at the last known alive date.

Time to second next therapy was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the start date of second next systemic therapy. Participants who did not receive second next treatment were censored at the last known alive date., From randomization to start of next therapy or second next therapy (up to approximately 45 months)|Time to Next-Line Therapies - All Randomized Participants With PD-L1 Expression Level < 1%, Time to next therapy was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the start date of next systemic therapy. Participants who did not receive next treatment were censored at the last known alive date.

Time to second next therapy was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the start date of second next systemic therapy. Participants who did not receive second next treatment were censored at the last known alive date, From randomization to start of next therapy or second next therapy (up to approximately 45 months)|Time From Next Therapy to Second Next Therapy - All Randomized Participants, Time from next treatment to second next treatment was defined as the time from the start date of next systemic therapy to start date of second next systemic therapy. No censoring rules were applied here as analysis was only performed for the subset of participants who received second next treatment., From start of first next systemic therapy to start of second next systemic therapy (up to approximately 28 months)|Time From Next Therapy to Second Next Therapy - All Randomized Participants With PD-L1 Expression Level < 1%, Time from next treatment to second next treatment was defined as the time from the start date of next systemic therapy to start date of second next systemic therapy. No censoring rules were applied here as analysis was only performed for the subset of participants who received second next treatment., From start of first next systemic therapy to start of second next systemic therapy (up to approximately 28 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) on Next-line Therapy - All Randomized Participants, PFS2 was defined as the time from randomization to the progression date on next-line systemic therapy or the end date of next-line systemic therapy (if progression date not available) or death from any cause (if both progression date and end date not available), and to last known alive date in case of no event (ie, censoring), meaning either (1) no subsequent systemic therapy and no death OR (2) subsequent systemic therapy but no progression date nor end date available and no death., From randomization to progression event (up to approximately 45 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) on Next-line Therapy - All Randomized Participants With PD-L1 Expression Level < 1%, PFS2 was defined as the time from randomization to the progression date on next-line systemic therapy or the end date of next-line systemic therapy (if progression date not available) or death from any cause (if both progression date and end date not available), and to last known alive date in case of no event (ie, censoring), meaning either (1) no subsequent systemic therapy and no death OR (2) subsequent systemic therapy but no progression date nor end date available and no death., From randomization to progression event (up to approximately 45 months)
