K-Basket, Avelumab, Biomarker-driven, Advanced Solid Tumor
Investigators have conducted K-BASKET trial (Korea-Biomarker-driven multi-arm drug-screening, knowledge and evidence-generating targeted trial), which was based on the specific genetic aberration, not the cancer type, which could accelerate matching the right drug to the right target so that every cancer patient could get the right specific drug based on the specific genetic biomarker, like NCI-MATCH trial. Next generation sequencing (NGS) focusing panel has the mutation and copy number variation of MET, PIK3CA and AKT. Investigators will open new treatment arms during the progress of K-BASKET trial. Patient with PD-L1 positive or EBV positive or MSI-H or POLE/POLD1 mutation tumor will be assigned to Avelumab monotherapy.
