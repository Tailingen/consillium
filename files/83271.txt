Computed Tomography (CT) Reconstruction for Axillary Lymph Node Structure
This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, non-controlled observational study.
Invasive Breast Cancer
Sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value (PPV) and negative-predictive value (NPV) of Computed tomography (CT) reconstruction for axillary lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy., Sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value (PPV) and negative-predictive value (NPV) of Computed tomography (CT) reconstruction for axillary lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be assessed., within 6 weeks after obtaining the post-surgery pathological results
Rreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, The diagnostic performance of computed tomography (CT) reconstruction for the evaluation of ALN after NAC was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The diagnostic accuracy was estimated by calculating the area under the ROC curve., within 6 weeks after obtaining the post-surgery pathological results
The negative predictive value of ultrasound for lymph node with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is low, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or PET/CT did not significantly improve specificity to axillary lymph node. The aim of this study is to determine performance of computed tomography (CT) reconstruction on evaluation of lymph node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.
