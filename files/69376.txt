Dose Escalation Study of EM-1421 for the Treatment of Recurrent or Refractory Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, dose escalation study of EM-1421 administered by intravenous infusion (IV) for five consecutive days every 28 days to patients with solid tumors refractory to current therapies. There have been no previous human studies of intravenous (into one's vein) EM-1421 treatment; however, lab research (research in test tubes and/or animals) suggests that EM-1421 has shown some activity against tumors in animals. This activity in animal models suggests that EM-1421 may be a useful chemotherapy for human cancer.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of EM-1421 given by intravenous infusion. The efficacy of the treatment will also be measured.
