Role of Immune Activation in Response of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma to Therapy
The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the immune system in the response of squamous cell cancers of the head and neck to treatment that includes radiation therapy. Current research demonstrates that several natural immune cells and molecules affect the way the body's immune system interacts with a cancerous growth. Some cancers may be related to infection with a virus, such as the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Studying the activity of the immune system in head and neck cancers, especially cancers related to HPV infections, can provide valuable information to better understand the body's interaction with cancer cells.

This is a study of the immune response in patients with oropharyngeal cancer who undergo treatment with radiation, chemoradiation, or robotic surgery. Many oropharyngeal cancers are caused by infection with the human Papillomavirus (HPV), and patients with HPV-mediated tumors have much better prognosis and treatment response compared to patients with HPV-negative tumors. The investigators will test the hypothesis that radiation-based therapy of oropharyngeal cancer is associated with activation of the endogenous HPV-specific immune response. In this study the investigators will collect blood at several time points before, during, and after treatment to monitor the immune response in patients with tumors positive and negative for HPV versus normal healthy volunteers.
