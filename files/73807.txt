A Phase Ib/II Study of BYL719 and Cetuximab in Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This was a multi-center, open-label, Phase Ib dose escalation /Phase II study in recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (RM HNSCC) patients considered to be resistant, ineligible or intolerant to platinum-based chemotherapy. The Phase Ib included three arms. Three different methods of administration and two different BYL719 formulations were studied to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of BYL719 in combination with cetuximab:

Arm A - film-coated whole tablets were orally administered to patients who were able to swallow the tablets; Arm B - a drinkable suspension prepared from crushed film-coated tablets was administered orally to patients with swallowing dysfunction Arm C - a suspension from a dispersible tablet administered via G-tube, in patients with swallowing dysfunction. Arm C was used to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), compared to Arm A (film coated tablet), and safety of the dispersible tablet of the dispersible tablet formulation of BYL719.

The Phase II investigated the clinical efficacy of BYL719 and consisted of an open label, randomized Phase II part investigating BYL719 in combination with cetuximab compared to cetuximab alone in patients resistant or intolerant to platinum and naïve to cetuximab (Scheme 1: Arm 1 and Arm 2), and a non-randomized Phase II part Scheme 2: Arm 3. In addition, patients who experienced disease progression in Arm 2 (cetuximab) were allowed to switch to the combination regimen (cross-over, Arm 2B). The safety of the BYL719 in combination with cetuximab was also further characterized in Arms 1, 2B and 3.

Patients were treated until progression of disease), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurred first (except for phase II Arm 2 had the opportunity to crossover to the combination treatment (Arm 2B). In the follow-up period all patients had to complete the safety follow-up assessments within 30 days after the last dose of the study treatment. Patients who did not have disease progression at the time of discontinuation of study treatment were radiologically followed for disease status until disease progression, initiation of subsequent anticancer therapies, or death, whichever occurred first. In addition, all patients enrolled in Phase II were followed for survival.

Phase Ib Arms A: Probability That Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) Rate is in the Recommended Phase 2 Dose in Cycle 1 (Cycle 1=28 Days), Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTDs) and/or recommended Phase II doses (RP2Ds) of BYL719 in combination with cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (RM HNSCC) in arm A (BYL719 administered as a whole tablet in patients able to swallow the tablets). Dose recommendation was based on posterior summaries including the mean, median, standard deviation, 95%-credibility interval, and the probability that the true DLT rate for each dose combination lies in one of the following categories: (0%, 16%) under-dosing; (16%, 35%) targeted toxicity; (35%, 100%) excessive toxicity. The combination treatment was considered superior to cetuximab alone if the posterior probability (HR \> 1) \< 10%, and the posterior median HR \< 0.7., until disease progression or intolerable toxicity (approximately 6 months)|Phase Ib Arm B: Probability That Distribution of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) is in the Recommended Phase 2 Dose in Cycle 1 (Cycle 1=28 Days), Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTDs) and/or recommended Phase II doses (RP2Ds) of BYL719 in combination with cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (RM HNSCC) in arm B (crushed film-coated tablets as an oral suspension with swallowing dysfunction). Dose recommendation was based on posterior summaries including the mean, median, standard deviation, 95%-credibility interval, and the probability that the true DLT rate for each dose combination lies in one of the following categories: (0%, 16%) under-dosing; (16%, 35%) targeted toxicity; (35%, 100%) excessive toxicity.
