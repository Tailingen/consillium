Fruquintinib Plus Camrelizumab and Capecitabine as Salvage Therapy After Progression on FOLFOXIRI-based First-line Treatment in Patients With Unresectable/Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
FOLFOXIRI-based regimen is more used as a first-line therapeutic approach for patients diagnosed with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer for its superior efficacy. However, there are no standard recommendations for second-line therapy after progression on FOLFOXIRI with or without targeted therapy. Here, the investigators conduct this open-label, single arm phase II study to evaluate whether fruquintinib in combination with camrelizumab and capecitabine can be the salvage therapy following FOLFOXIRI based regimen for mCRC. Patients diagnosed with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer progression on FOLFOXIRI-based regimen are included;or patients have progression or untolerated toxicity with irinotecan, oxaliplatin and fluorouracil successively within one year; patients with BRAF mutation were allowed to receive BRAF inhibitor therapy with or without MEK inhibitor therapy after FOLFOXIRI-based regimen.

Patients participated in this study will receive fruquintinib 5 mg once daily, 2 weeks on/1 week off, plus camrelizumab 200 mg Q3W and capecitabine 750mg/square meter twice, 2 weeks on/1 week off, repeated every three weeks. The primary endpoint is Objective Response Rate(ORR). The investigators estimated that 30 patients were necessary. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, and exploratory ctDNA for efficacy prediction for unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer.
Unresectable/Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib plus camrelizumab and capecitabine
Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate is defined as the percentage of patients relative to the total of enrolled subjects who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on CT or MRI scan images confirmed 4-6weeks later., Undergo imaging examination to evaluate efficacy every 6 weeks ±7 days, and every 9 weeks ±7 days in the second year (up to 2 years)
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from study enrollment to first disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, Undergo imaging examination to evaluate efficacy every 6 weeks ±7 days, and every 9 weeks ±7 days in the second year (up to 2 years)|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from study enrollment to the date of death due to any cause, from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause，assessed up to 2 years|Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Assessment of Safety and tolerance for Fruquintinib plus camrelizumab and capecitabine as salvage therapy in patients with unresectable/metastatic colorectal cancer，including incidence, severity and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0., from the date of the first medicine to 28days after the last medicine，assessed up to 2 years|Circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA) and efficacy, Explore the correlation between dynamics of serum ctDNA and efficacy., from the date of enrollment to the date of progression，assessed up to 2 years
