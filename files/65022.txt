Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most difficult-to-treat breast cancer subtype, lacks well-defined treatment options. This is a prospective, single-center, one-arm, open-label, phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of chidamide in combination with cisplatin in subjects with relapsed or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.
