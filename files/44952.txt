68Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT for Predicting Histological Response in Triple-negative Breast Cancer (FAP-IT)
Prospective multicenter study evaluating the prediction of histological response after neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy by pre-treatment 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT imaging in patients with early-stage high-risk TNBC.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT imaging
Area under the ROC curve, To measure the performance of 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT imaging to predict complete histological response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus Pembrolizumab, in terms of Area under the ROC curve (AUC of the ROC curve)., 6 months

Prospective multicenter study evaluating the prediction of histological response of pembrolizumab in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy by pre-treatment 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT imaging in patients with early-stage high-risk TNBC.

Patients will receive the newly established standard of care of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W given with 4 cycles of paclitaxel + carboplatin, then with 4 cycles of doxorubicin or epirubicin + cyclophosphamide. After definitive surgery, patients will receive adjuvant pembrolizumab for 9 cycles or until recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

The 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT scan will be performed for each patient pre-therapy and on the same machine as the 18F-FDG PET/CT scan and within 14 days before the start of treatment.
