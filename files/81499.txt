Clinical Trial for the Safety and Efficacy of Anti-CD7 CAR-T Cell Therapy for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD7 Positive Hematological Malignancy
This is a prospective, open-label, single-center clinical trial. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-CD7 CAR-T cells in the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD7 positive T-ALL/LBL, T-NHL and AML. The primary endpoints are dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the incidence of treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE).
