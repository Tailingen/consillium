A Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Trial of WTX212A in the Treatment of Patients with Advanced Malignant Tumors
This trial is a multi-center, open-label investigator-initiated clinical study (IIT) to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and effectiveness of WTX212A injection in the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic advanced solid tumors who failed in previous systematic therapy.

The study was divided into two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion
Unresectable or Metastatic Advanced Solid Tumors
