Study of CX-5461 in Patients With Solid Tumours and BRCA1/2, PALB2 or Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) Mutation
This is an open-label, multi-center, phase 1b study designed to determine a tolerable dose of CX-5461 administered by IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 28-day cycle in patients with selected solid tumours and associated mutations for future Phase II trials. The safety and tolerability of CX-5461, preliminary evidence of antitumor effect and the effect of CX-5461 on the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will also be evaluated. The study will also evaluate the predictive value of mutational signatures and explore the significance of dynamic changes in ctDNA levels and plasma DNA methylome profiling in this study's exploratory cohort.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: CX-5461
Determination of Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), To identify the number of patients who discontinue study drug due to toxicity for each of the two dosing regimens independently., Safety cohort review will be conducted every 4 weeks from the date of first patient's enrollment to review safety data, until all patients have been enrolled and evaluated for toxicity, assessed up to 24 months
Adverse Event (AE), To identify the incidence, severity, and relationship of AEs (as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0), serious adverse events (SAEs), dose modifications due to AEs., After initiation of study drug, all AEs and SAEs, regardless of attribution, will be collected until 30 days following the last dose of study drug|Objective Response, To identify the number of patients with clinical benefit (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease) and objective response (defined as complete response or partial response) based on the best overall response from tumor evaluations performed every 2 cycles, according to RECIST v1.1, and Duration of Response., After initiation of study drug, through 24 weeks or at the time of clinical response if prior|Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO), To identify the incidence, severity, and relationship of AEs using NCI PRO-CTCAE v1.0 questionnaires to evaluate cutaneous, gastrointestinal, visual/perceptual, cardio/circulatory, sleep/wake, and miscellaneous symptoms (as determined by expected toxicity from CX-5461)., At screening, the start of each cycle of treatment (each cycle is 28 days), day 8 of every cycle of treatment, and every 12 weeks for 2 years after completion of therapy or withdrawal from study.
Characterize the molecular profile of tumors and evaluate the predictive value of mutational signatures, Tumor biopsies are collected from patients to characterize the molecular profile of tumors and evaluate the predictive value of mutational signatures (including BRCA 1/ 2, PALB2, and other HRD-associated somatic mutations) in predicting response or resistance to CX-5461., collected at screening and through 24 weeks, or at the time of disease progression if prior.|Correlate the significance of changes in ctDNA levels and plasma DNA methylome profiling to detect the evolution of resistant sub-clones and monitor treatment response, Blood samples are collected from patients to explore the significance of dynamic changes in ctDNA levels and plasma DNA methylome profiling to detect the evolution of resistant sub-clones and monitor response to treatment., collected at screening, Day 1 and Day 8 of cycles 1 and 2 (each cycle is 28 days), every 8 weeks after cycle 2, and through 24 weeks, or at the time of study discontinuation, if prior.
CX-5461 (Pidnarulex), a synthetically-derived small molecule that selectively kills HR-deficient cancer cells through the binding and stabilization of G4 DNA structure. Early phase 1 studies suggest CX-5461 has activity and warrants further investigation in HR-deficient tumors. This study aims to determine the tolerable dose of CX-5461 for phase II studies, amongst an expansion cohorts of BRCA1/2, PALB2 or HRD mutant tumors.
