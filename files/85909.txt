Dynamic Multi-omics Integration Model to Predict Neoadjuvant Therapy Response in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
The goal of this observational study is to establish a dynamic multi-omics integration model for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced (T3-4NxM0) rectal cancer, providing support for subsequent patient selection for the watch-and-wait strategy. The main question it aims to answer is:

What is the predictive value of this model to assess individual achievement of pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant treatment? Eligible patients will be prospectively enrolled, and the clinical features of their pre-neoadjuvant treatment, during-treatment, and post-treatment preoperative will be collected and annotated.

This is a single-center, prospective, observational phase II clinical study aimed at validating a dynamic multi-omics (imaging, pathology, molecular biomarkers) integration model for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced (T3-4NxM0) rectal cancer. Specifically, the study aims to validate the predictive accuracy of the dynamic multi-omics prediction model and determine whether it outperforms other conventional prediction models based on single-modality imaging, pathology, and molecular biomarkers.

Eligible patients will be prospectively enrolled, and images of their pre-neoadjuvant treatment, during-treatment, and post-treatment preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, histopathology slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) will be collected and annotated. MRI, H\&E images, CEA, ctDNA, and their change features will be applied to the prediction model to assess individual achievement of pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant treatment. The predictive results will be further compared with the pathological tumor response obtained from resected specimens.
