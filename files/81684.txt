Impact of Continuous Defocused CO2 Laser Vaporisation on the Histological Malignant Transformation of Erosive Oral Lichen Planus in Patients
Oral Lichen Planus (OLP) is a common condition with its erosive variant occasionally presenting a management challenge to the clinician. In addition it can have debilitating consequences on the patients' quality of life. The malignant transformation of OLP has been well documented. The aims of this work were to measure the number of patients developing malignant transformationof OLP to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) comparing patients undergoing traditional symptomatic treatments with those patients that were treated by CO2 laser from 2004 - 2011. Outcome measures were rated by incisional biopsy (histology Report).
