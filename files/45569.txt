Study to Explore the Mechanism of Acquired Immune Escape In Participants With Metastatic Cancer Progressing on CPI Therapy
The purpose of this study is to identify mechanisms associated with acquired immune escape by comparing baseline and at-progression tissue samples from participants who derive clinical benefit from CPI treatment of metastatic cancer or hematologic malignancies.
Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Biopsy
Number of Gene Alterations in at-Progression Biopsy of Patricipants with Acquired Immune Escape, Number of Gene Alterations Will Be Evaluated Using NGS Approaches by Comparing At-Progression Biopsy with Pre-Treatment Biopsy, Day 1
