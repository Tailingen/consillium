Surufatinib Combined With Toripalimab and HAIC in the Treatment of Inoperable or Metastatic Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
This study is a single-arm, open-arm, single-center clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of HAIC in combination with Surufatinib and Toripalimab in patients with inoperable or metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

The study was divided into three stages: screening period, treatment period and follow-up period. During the treatment period, the tumor status was evaluated by imaging every 6 weeks (±7 days), and the efficacy was changed to every 8 weeks (±7 days) after 12 weeks until the disease progressed (RECIST 1.1) or death (during the treatment of the patient) or toxicity became intolerable. The tumor treatment status and survival status after the disease progression were recorded. Safety outcome measures included AE, changes in laboratory test values, vital signs and electrocardiogram changes.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Surufatinib、Toripalimab、Gemcitabine、Oxaliplatin
ORR objective response rate, objective response rate (ORR)Defined as percentage of participants achieving assessed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) by the investigator according to the RECIST 1.1., 24 months
Progression-Free Survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.Responses are according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1(RECIST 1.1) as assessed by investigator, 24 months|OS overall survival, OS is the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., 24 months|DCR disease control rate, DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response (CR)or partial response (PR)or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator, 24 months|Adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0, overall incidence of adverse events (AE); incidence of grade 3 or higher AE; incidence of severe adverse events (SAE); incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of drug use; incidence of AEs leading to suspension of drug use, 24 months
