Adding Magnesium Sulfate to Local Anesthetic in Combined Pectoral Nerve and Stellate Ganglion Block for Postoperative Pain Control After Modified Radical Mastectomy
We aim to study the effect of adding magnesium sulfate as an adjuvant to the local anesthetic used in the combined Pectoralis Nerve Block II (PECS II) and stellate ganglion block for postoperative pain control in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy.

Total morphine consumption, With numeric rating scale (NRS) rest score ≥ 3 or NRS evoked score ≥ 4, morphine will be administered intravenously by a dose of 0.05 mg/kg at 30-minute intervals until NRS rest score \< 3 or NRS evoked score \< 4., 24 hours postoperatively
Degree of pain, The severity of pain will be assessed postoperatively using a numeric rating scale (NRS) both at rest and evoked (0 = no pain and 10 = worst imaginable pain). NRS will be recorded at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively., 24 hours postoperatively|Time to first request analgesia, The time to first request analgesia will be recorded from the end of surgery till the first dose of morphine is administrated., 24 hours postoperatively|Incidence of adverse events, Incidence of adverse events such as nausea and vomiting will be recorded., 24 hours postoperatively
Post-operative pain from breast surgery can be controlled by regular pain medications such as paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs), and narcotics. Nerve blocks are commonly used as multimodal approaches for acute post-operative pain relief.

Pectoral and stellate ganglion blocks are regional anesthesia techniques that target the thoracic nerves and sympathetic nerve ganglia to provide analgesia for the upper extremity and chest regions. When combined, these blocks have shown promising results in alleviating perioperative pain for patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy.

Magnesium sulfate, a well-known adjuvant, has been studied extensively for its analgesic properties and anti-inflammatory effects.
