A Study to Assess the Effect of CC-95251 in Participants With Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity of CC-95251 alone and in combination with antineoplastic agents in participants with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia and relapsed or refractory and treatment-naive higher risk melodysplastic syndromes.
