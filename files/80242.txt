Immunotherapy With Bispecific CAR-T Cells for B-Cell Lymphoma, ALL and CLL
This study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of anti-CD19 anti-CD20 Bispecific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) redirected autologous T-cells in patients with high risk, relapsed CD19+ and CD20+ haematological malignancies.
Leukemia|Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: anti-CD19 anti-CD20 Bispecific CAR-T
Antitumor Effects, Tumor load will be quantified with radiology, bone marrow and/or blood samples dependent on diagnosis., Every 3 months post treatment up to 24 months
Survival time of Anti-CD19 Anti-CD20 CAR T cells in vivo., To evaluate the presence of circulating CAR T cells with flow cytometry and real time PCR in patient blood., 3 years|Adverse events of each patient., Determine the toxicity profile of the CD19 CD20 targeted CAR T cells with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 4.0., 3 years
This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 CD20 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells (CD19 CAR T-cells) in patients with high risk, relapsed CD19+ and CD20+haematological malignancies (Leukemia and lymphoma). Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the CD19 CD20 CAR T-cells. Patients will receive the CD19 CD20 CAR T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD19 CD20 CAR T-cells in patients with high risk relapsed CD19+ malignancies.
