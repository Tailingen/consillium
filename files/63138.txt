A Phase II Study of HLX22 in Combination With Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in HER2-low, Hormone Receptor Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
This is a Phase II Study of HLX22 in Combination with Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) in HER2-low, Hormone Receptor Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients with Disease Progression or Intolerable Adverse Reaction on Standard of Care. Eligible subjects will be treated with the study drug until the loss of clinical benefit, death, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or other reasons specified by the protocol (whichever occurs first).
HER2-low Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: HLX22|DRUG: Trastuzumab Deruxtecan
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) assessed by IRRC (Independent Radiology Review Committee) per RECIST 1.1 . PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) assessed by IRRC per RECIST v1.1. ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (\[CR\], disappearance of all evidence of disease) or Partial Response (\[PR\], regression of measurable disease and no new sites) per RECIST 1.1, Up to 2 years
PFS, PFS assessed by investigator per RECIST 1.1 . PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years|ORR, ORR assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1. ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a Complete Response (\[CR\], disappearance of all evidence of disease) or Partial Response (\[PR\], regression of measurable disease and no new sites) per RECIST 1.1, Up to 2 years|Aderse events (AE), AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment., Up to 5 years
experimental group: HLX22(15 mg/kg) + Trastuzumab Deruxtecan( 5.4 mg/kg), once every 3 weeks (Q3W).
