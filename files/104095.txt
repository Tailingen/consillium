A Study of STI-3031 (an Anti-PD-L1 Antibody) in Patients With Selected Relapsed/Refractory Malignancies
This study evaluates the efficacy, as measured by the objective response rate, of STI-3031, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in previously treated patients with selected advanced lymphomas or biliary tract cancer.

Objective Response Rate, Percentage of participants achieving a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) at any time during the study as assessed by an Independent Response Committee (IRC) per the Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification or RECIST 1.1, Approximately 24 months
Objective Response Rate by treating physician, Percentage of participants achieving a CR or PR at any time during the study as assessed by the Investigator per the Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification or RECIST 1.1, Approximately 24 months|Duration of Response, Time from the first documentation of response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) as assessed by an IRC per the Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification or RECIST 1.1, Approximately 24 months|Complete Response Rate, Percentage of participants achieving a CR at any time during the study as assessed by an IRC per the Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification or RECIST 1.1, Approximately 24 months|Duration of Complete Response Rate, Time from the first documentation of CR to the first documentation of PD as assessed by an IRC per the Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification or RECIST 1.1, Approximately 24 months|Progressive-free survival, Time from enrollment until PD or death as assessed by an IRC per the Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification or RECIST 1.1, Approximately 24 months|12-month Progressive-free survival, Percentage of participants without PD or death at 12 months after their first dose of study intervention as assessed by an IRC per the Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification or RECIST 1.1, Approximately 30 months (18 months for enrollment plus 12 months follow-up for the last participant enrolled)|Event free survival, Time from enrollment to PD, death, or start of new treatment as assessed by an IRC per the Lugano criteria with LYRIC modification or RECIST 1.1, Approximately 24 months|Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the blood levels of STI-3031, Measure the actual body exposure to STI-3031, Approximately 24 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of STI-3031, Measure the maximum (or peak) blood concentration of STI-3031, Approximately 24 months|Time of Maximum concentration observed (Tmax) of STI-3031, Measure the is the time at which the maximum blood concentration of STI-3031 is observed, Approximately 24 months|Half-life (t1/2) of STI-3031, Measure the time it takes for the concentration of the drug in the blood to be reduced by 50%, Approximately 24 months|Immunogenicity, Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) (serum titers of anti-STI-3031 antibodies) and correlation with exposure and activity, Approximately 24 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability] of STI-3031, Terms, frequency, severity and seriousness of adverse events (AEs) and relationship of AEs to STI-3031 the actual body exposure to drug after administration, Approximately 24 months
This is an open-label, multicenter, global Phase 2 basket study to investigate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of STI-3031 in patients with selected relapsed or refractory (R/R) malignancies. The study will be conducted as separate Phase 2, single arm substudies for each of the indications below:

* Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL)
* Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL)
* Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with PD-L1 gene translocation, copy gain, amplification, polysomy detectable by a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay or Epstein-Barr virus positivity (EBV+) as assessed by EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) testing
* Biliary tract cancers (BTC) (intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer)

All participants will receive the study intervention, STI-3031.
