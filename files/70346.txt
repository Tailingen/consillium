The Study of Olaparib Combined With Abiraterone and Prednisone in mHSPC Patients With HRR Gene Mutation
This is a single-center, single-arm, prospective study to assess the efficacy and safety of Olaparib combined with Abiraterone plus Prednisone in subjects with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) who carry deleterious germline or homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations.

Olaparib is an oral, highly selective poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor that potently inhibits the activity of deoxyribonucleic acid repair polymerases. Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a prodrug of abiraterone that potently inhibits cytochrome P450c17, a key enzyme in androgen biosynthesis.

A total of 30 mHSPC subjects with HRR gene mutations that meet the criteria will be included in the study. Eligible subjects will receive oral Olaparib tablets 300 mg BID, combined with Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg QD plus Prednisone 5 mg, and the study will end when the primary endpoint radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) data maturity reaches 60%. During the treatment and follow-up periods, all subjects will have regular visits to assess the efficacy and safety of Olaparib in combination with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), prostate-specific antigen response (PSA response rate), prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), radiological objective response rate (ORR) and other indicators will be assessed and calculated.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Carcinoma|Metastatic Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Olaparib tablet|DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Prednisone tablet
Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS) Per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, Time from the start of study drug to radiographic progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 18 month
PSA response rate, PSA response is defined as a ≥ 50% decline in PSA from baseline PSA value. This PSA decline must be confirmed as sustained by a second PSA value obtained ≥ 3 weeks later., 18 month|PSA Progression Free Survival (PSA-PFS) by Investigator, PSA-PFS is defined as the time from the start of study drug to the first PSA progression or death due to any cause without progression. PSA progression is defined as a first PSA increase greater than or equal to 25% of baseline and ≥ 2 ng/ml and confirmed a second time after 3 or more weeks., 18 month|Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Investigator, ORR is the percentage of patients with at least one visit response of Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR), in their soft tissue disease assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), in the absence of progression on bone scan assessed by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)). Per RECIST v1.1, CR=Disappearance of all target lesions; PR = \>=30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; For each treatment group, ORR is the number of patients with a CR and PR., 18 month
Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment, 18 month
