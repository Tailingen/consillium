Determination of Blood Tumor Cells
Magnetic nanoparticles coated with anti-EpCAM or anti-CD52 antibodies will be tested ex-vivo in patients blood .

Magnetic nanoparticles, coated with epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-antibodies are designed to interact with epithelial tumor cells. Aim of this study is to see if circulating tumor cells (EpCAM as marker)can be removed out of the blood with the help of these particles. Patients suffering from prostate, colon, lung or pancreatic cancer will be asked to test their blood.

Similarly, magnetic nanoparticles will be coated with antibodies, directed against non-solid tumors in the blood such as lymphoma or leukemia (CD52 as marker).
