Visual Management for the Radiotherapy Process
The Visual Management for Radiotherapy Practice (VMRTP) aims to analyze, predict, visualize and shorten the waiting times for radiotherapy patients. The hypothesis is that this can be done by the introduction of models that can predict a patient being at risk for waiting too long as well as visual management tools that visualize the radiotherapy process.

In a retrospective cohort of radiotherapy patients, time stamps of various steps in the radiotherapy process (diagnosis, multi-disciplinary board, referral, intake, simulation, treatment planning, quality control, first fraction of radiotherapy) will be collected. These will be combined with patient, tumor and patient-process (e.g. referring physician, treating physician, busy-at-the-time, referring hospital) related features. Based on these a predictive model will be learned that can estimate the probability at various stages of the process that the patient waits too long. Visual management will be developed that can visualize the predicted waiting time.

Process interventions aimed at reducing waiting times will be tested prospectively.
