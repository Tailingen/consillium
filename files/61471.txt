Phase II (Treatment) Study of Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine in Advanced Head and Neck Malignancies
This phase II study will test the response rate of combined oxaliplatin and capecitabine treatment when administered at a given dose and schedule, in patients with Head and Neck cancer for which there is no curative treatment.
Head or Neck Cancer
DRUG: Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine
Overall Response Rate, Among the 15 patients treated, 2 (13%) achieved partial response (PR), and 5 (33%) achieved stable disease (SD), for a Overall Response Rate (ORR) of 46% measured by RECIST criteria.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.

Overall Response Rate (ORR)=PR+CR., Every two 28 day treatment cycles until subject no longer on treatment due to disease progression
Qualitative and Quantitative Toxicity, Number of patients that developed common side effect of diarrhea., At study enrollment, Every two 28 day treatment cycles, and at end of treatment due to disease progression
The optimal dose and schedule for the combined treatment with oxaliplatin and capecitabine have not been defined. The aim of this Phase II study is to determine the response rate of combined oxaliplatin and capecitabine treatment at a given dose and schedule in patients with Head and Neck cancer for which there is no curative treatment.

The study also aims to determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity and reversibility of toxicity of the above combination and to evaluate any changes in performance status, quality of life, overall survival and progression-free survival.
