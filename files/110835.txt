Study of Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsule Combined With Chemotherapy in Subjects With Squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Anlotinib hydrochloride is a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets angiogenesis-related kinases such as VEGFR1/2/3, FGFR1/2/3, and other tumor-associated kinases involved in cell proliferation such as PDGFRα/β, c-Kit, and Ret have significant inhibitory activities.
