Safety and Efficacy Study of a Dual PI3K Delta/Gamma Inhibitor in T-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, PK and efficacy of RP6530, a dual PI3K delta/gamma inhibitor in patients with relapsed and refractory T-cell Lymphoma.
Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral|Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous
DRUG: RP6530
Safety of RP6530, Number of participants with Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTACE v4.0, 28 days
Overall Response Rate (ORR) With RP6530, ORR is defined as sum of CR and PR rates, Response assessment for PTCL based on IWG criteria (Cheson 2007) and CTCL on mSWAT/Global assessment (ISCL/EORTC guideline)., 8 months|Duration of Response (DOR) With RP6530, The time period from the response achieved in patient until the disease progression., 24 months|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of RP6530, Day 1 of Cycle 1
Safety: Treatment-Emergent AE; Treatment-Related AE, SAE and Clinical significant AE; Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT). PK: Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Time of Maximum concentration observed (Tmax). Efficacy: Overall Response Rate (ORR), Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS) and Duration of Response.
