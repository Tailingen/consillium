A Phase II Clinical Study of Fruquintinib Combined With S-1 for Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Investigators conduct the clinical trial to further explore the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib combined with S-1 in treating recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after the failure of conventional treatments.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Fruquintinib in Combination with S-1
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first evidence of disease progression as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death from any cause., From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death (up to approximately 1 year)
Overall survival (OS), Baseline to measured date of death from any cause (up to approximately 1 year)|Objective response rate (ORR), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 6 weeks until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from treatment up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause up to 1 year|Disease control rate (DCR), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 6 weeks until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from treatment up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause up to 1 year
Esophageal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is the main pathological type of esophageal carcinoma in China. Among patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy, compared with placebo and chemotherapy, significantly improved overall survival and progression-free survival.Treatment of recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is usually poor. New treatments were needed. Fruquintinib is an orally antiangiogenic agents, which target VEGFR1/2/3. A combination of Fruquintinib and s-1 for advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma could be a novel therapy. Therefore, investigators initialize this phase II study to explore the safety of fruquintinib and S-1 combination treatment in ESCC patients with after failure in 1st-line immunotherapy.
