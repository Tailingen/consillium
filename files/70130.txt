Phase 2a Study of CAN-2409 With Standard Radiation Therapy for Malignant Glioma
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of CAN-2409 (also known / previously described as AdV-tk, GMCI) for malignant gliomas. The approach used an adenoviral vector (disabled virus) engineered to express the Herpes thymidine kinase gene (aglatimagene besadenovec, CAN-2409), followed by an antiherpetic prodrug, valacyclovir. CAN-2409 was injected into the resection bed after standard tumor surgery and valacyclovir pills were taken for 14 days. Standard radiation and chemotherapy were administered which have been shown to work cooperatively with CAN-2409 + prodrug to kill tumor cells. The hypothesis is that this combination therapy can be safely delivered and will lead to improvement in the clinical outcome for patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) and anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III).

Progression Free Survival, 24 months|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACT-Br), 24 months
Patients had resectable or partially resectable malignant glioma and received injection of CAN-2409 into remaining tumor or tumor bed after resection. Pathologic confirmation of malignant glioma must be made prior to CAN-2409 injection; if this was not possible, the injection was not performed and the subject was no longer eligible for the study. The oral prodrug, valacyclovir, started 1-3 days after CAN-2409 injection and continued for 14 days. Standard radiotherapy began on average 7 days after CAN-2409 injection for the up-front course. Patients received temozolomide as per standard of care after completion of prodrug.
