OS from start of 1st line treatment in metastatic ESCC, Median OS and OS rate at 12 months, 18 months and 24 months will be analysed based on Kaplan-Meier method and presented along with its 95% confidence interval., 2 years
PFS from start of 1st line treatment in metastatic ESCC, Median PFS and PFS rate at 6 months, 12months and 18 months will be analysed based on Kaplan-Meier method and presented along with its 95% confidence interval., 18 months|the role of radiotherapy for patients treated with 1st immunotherapy., Compare the median OS and PFS and the rates between the group of patients treated with or without radiotherapy., 2 years
This study is a multi-center, non-interventional study. Patients' background, treatment pattern, treatment outcome, efficacy will be collected in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients who were treated with ICIs as 1st line treatment at approximately 26 institutions. The patients should have received at least 1 cycle of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy with or without radiotherapy. Based on these data, overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) from start of 1st line treatment and the role and efficacy of radiotherapy for these patients will be assessed.
