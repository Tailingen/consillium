Enterade in Carcinoid/Non-Carcinoid Syndrome Neuroendocrine Tumor Patients With Quality of Life Limiting Bowel Frequency
This is an open-label phase II basket study evaluating the ability of enterade® to reduce bowel frequency in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients with carcinoid syndrome and non-carcinoid syndrome.
Neuroendocrine Tumor|Carcinoid Syndrome
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Enterade®|OTHER: Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy for Patients with Diarrhea (version 4.0)
Change in bowel movement frequency, Changes in number of average daily bowel movements from baseline, At 8 weeks
Health-Related Quality of Life: Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy for Patients with Diarrhea (FACIT-D) version 4.0, The FACIT-D is a questionnaire composed of 5 categories (physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and additional concerns). Each category has 6-11 questions which are scored on a 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) scale. Groups of categories are scored differently. For example in the additional concerns, emotional well-being and physical well-being categories, a higher score reflects poorer quality of life. In the family well-being and functional well-being categories, a higher score indicates better outcomes., At 8 weeks|Tolerability of enterade®: number of enterade® drinks consumed, Measured by the total number of enterade® drinks consumed, At 8 weeks|Incidents adverse events, NCI CTCAE version 5.0, At 8 weeks|Change in serum electrolytes (Sodium), The electrolyte sodium will be assessed for each patient before and after enterade® (measured in mmol/L), At 8 weeks|Change in serum electrolytes (Potassium), The electrolyte potassium will be assessed for each patient before and after enterade® (measured in mmol/L), At 8 weeks|Change in serum electrolytes (Chloride), The electrolyte chloride will be assessed for each patient before and after enterade® (measured in mmol/L), At 8 weeks|Change in serum electrolytes (Magnesium), The electrolyte magnesium will be assessed for each patient before and after enterade® (measured in mg/dL ), At 8 weeks|Change in serum electrolytes (Phosphorous), The electrolyte phosphorous will be assessed for each patient before and after enterade® (measured in mg/dL ), At 8 weeks|Differences in intravenous fluid requirements, Measured by the number of incidence requiring intravenous fluid before and after taking enterade®, At 8 weeks|Differences in use of standard-of-care anti-diarrhea medications, Measured by reported incidence of standard-of-care anti-diarrhea medications usage before and after taking enterade®, At 8 weeks|Differences in bloating, Measured by reported incidence of bloating before and after taking enterade®, At 8 weeks|Differences in flatulence, Measured by reported incidence of flatulence before and after taking enterade®, At 8 weeks|Changes in weight, Measured by fluctuation in weight before and after taking enterade®, At 8 weeks
Primary Objective:

- To assess the ability of enterade to reduce bowel movement frequency in NET patients with and without carcinoid syndrome.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess subject-reported health-related quality of life measures in subjects before and after compound administration.
* To characterize the side effect profile and tolerability of the compound as measured by the number of total 8-oz enterade® bottles consumed throughout the trial.
* To evaluate changes in serum electrolytes before and after administration of the compound.
* To assess differences in intravenous fluid requirement and/or hospitalizations for dehydration in patients between observation period and active enterade® period.
* To evaluate differences in utilization of standard-of-care anti-diarrheal medications in patients between observation period and enterade® period.
* To compare subjective bloating and flatulence in patients before and after administration of the compound.
* To evaluate changes in patient weight before and after administration of the compound.

Exploratory Objectives:

* To assess changes in serum and stool inflammatory markers before and after the study compound.
* To evaluate changes in fecal lactoferrin before and after study compound administration.
