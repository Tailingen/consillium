Preoperative Treatment of Breast Cancer With Two Different Sequential Treatment Regimens
An open-label randomized Phase II study in order to explore two different sequential anthracycline-based neoadjuvant treatment regimens in female patients with primary, operable breast cancer (T2-T4/N0-2/M0).
Breast Cancer
DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: doxorubicin|DRUG: docetaxel
Number of Participants With a Pathological Complete Response, pathological assessment of tissue removed during surgery to determine if tumor tissue is still present after chemotherapy, surgery after eight 21-day cycles of chemotherapy
Number of Participants With a Clinical Tumor Response After the First Sequence of Chemotherapy, The number of participants with a clinical tumor response based on measurement of tumor size after the first sequence of chemotherapy, without a second confirmatory tumor measurement, per protocol., Cycles 1-4 (21-day cycles)|Number of Participants With a Clinical Tumor Response After the Second Sequence of Chemotherapy, The number of participants with a clinical tumor response based on measurement of tumor size after the second sequence of chemotherapy, without a second confirmatory tumor measurement required, per protocol., Cycles 5-8 (21-day cycles)|Number of Patients With Histologically Negative Axillary Lymph Node Status at Surgery, Histologically negative is defined as no malignant cells present in the axillary lymph nodes during surgery., surgery after eight 21-day cycles of chemotherapy|Disease-free Survival, Disease-free survival is defined as the time from date of study enrollment (randomization) to first date of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. PD per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who do not have progressive disease, disease-free survival was censored at the last contact date., baseline through post surgery, follow-up for 3 years post-surgery (up to 5.2 years after randomization)
