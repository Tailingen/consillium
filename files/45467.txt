Unilateral Secondary Breast Reconstruction Using a Muscle-sparing Pedicled Dorsal Flap After Breast Cancer
The use of pedicled dorsal flaps sparing the latissimus dorsi muscle (TDAP and MSLD flap) is a well-described reconstruction method in breast reconstruction after breast cancer. However, little data exists regarding patient satisfaction after this surgery. The main objective of this study was to evaluate patient satisfaction after unilateral total secondary breast reconstruction using a TDAP or MSLD flap.
Patient Satisfaction
Patient satisfaction, patient satisfaction by using BREAST questionnaire (0 to 100, and 100 is the best score), 5 years
Patient characteristics, Post-operative complications (number of hematoma, number of infection, number of seroma, number of flap lost), duration of the reconstruction (number of days), nature of additional interventions (number of lipofilling, symmetrization (yes or no), prothesis (yes or no)), 5 years
