Real-world Evidence Prospective Study on the Effect of Nab-paclitaxel Treatment on the Clinical Outcomes and HRQoL in Patients With MBC in Greece
This non-interventional study aims at assessing the impact of nab-paclitaxel on the clinical outcomes and the health-related QoL (HRQoL) of this heavily burdened and difficult-to-treat population. Notably, the data generated in the context of this study will serve as complementary evidence to that of the tightly and strictly controlled pre-registration clinical trial setting, which is of essential importance especially in patient populations with diseases of complex and heterogeneous biology, such as breast cancer.

Evaluation of the best objective response to nab-paclitaxel treatment in eligible MBC patients as measured from the start of therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or termination of study participation, The proportion of objective responders \[patients with either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) as the best objective response\] as measured by routine assessments from the start of nab-paclitaxel therapy until disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or study participation termination whichever occurs sooner, as measured by routine assessments from the start of nab-paclitaxel therapy (at least 6 months post-treatment onset and up to 12 months) until disease progression, occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, or study participation termination
