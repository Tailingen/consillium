Study of NGR-hTNF in Combination With Doxorubicin in Patients Affected by Advanced or Metastatic Ovarian Cancer
The main objective of the trial is to document the response rate in patients affected by metastatic ovarian cancer, treated with NGR-hTNF plus doxorubicin. Safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment according to NCI-CTC criteria.
Ovarian Cancer Metastatic Recurrent
DRUG: NGR-hTNF|DRUG: doxorubicin
Antitumor activity defined as response rate, Evaluated according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), during the study
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS evaluated according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST), during the study|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death due to any cause or the last date the patient was known to be alive, from the date of randomization to the date of death, assessed up to 6 months|CA125 (U/mL) measurement, Tumor marker evaluation, from the randomization, every 6 weeks until the end of treatment|Safety according to NCI-CTCAE criteria (version 3), To evaluate safety profile related to NGR-hTNF, during the study
This is a phase II, open-label,single arm, non-randomized study that will be conducted in patients affected by metastatic ovarian cancer, that will be conducted using Simon's two-stage design method.
