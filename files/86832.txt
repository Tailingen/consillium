Venetoclax-Navitoclax With Cladribine-based Salvage Therapy in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is an open-label phase I study designed to evaluate the safety of venetoclax-navitoclax with cladribine-based salvage therapy.

The primary objective of the study is to determine a maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) combination of venetoclax-navitoclax with cladribine-based salvage therapy. Subjects will be entered sequentially to each dose level. For each dose level, if none of the first three subjects at that level experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), new subjects may be entered at the next higher dose level. If one of three subjects experience a DLT, up to three more subjects are to be treated at that same dose level. If none of the additional three subjects at that dose level experiences a DLT, new subjects may be entered at the next higher dose level. However, if one or more of the additional three subjects experience a DLT, then no further subjects are to be started at that dose level and either de-escalate one level or if the preceding dose is already completed then that dose is the MTD. The MTD will be defined as the highest dose level at which none of the first three treated subjects, or no more than one of the first six treated subjects, experiences a DLT.
