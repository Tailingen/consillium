Feasibility of the YATAC Programme
Young adult cancer survivors (YACS) aged 18-39 report physical and psychosocial late effects following cancer treatment, impairing quality of life and participation in everyday life. To address such multifactorial challenges complex or multicomponent rehabilitation interventions are needed. Based on this, the 'Young Adult Taking Action' (YATAC) programme was developed to increase participation in everyday life and improve health-related quality of life. The development of the intervention is guided by the British Medical Research Council's guidance (MRC) and the framework for the co-production and prototyping of public health interventions by Hawkins et al.

The present study will investigate the acceptability and fidelity of the intervention at the research clinic of REHPA, the Danish Knowledge Centre for Rehabilitation and Palliative Care in Nyborg, Denmark. A mixed method one-armed feasibility study will be conducted and the results of the study will be used to revise version 1.0 of the programme.
