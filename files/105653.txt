Ponatinib in Adult Ph+ ALL Patients With MRD Positivity or Hematological Relapse
This is a phase II interventional trial to evaluate if the use of ponatinib, with or without chemotherapy, can induce a molecular remission in MRD-positive patients, in patients in hematologic and extra-hematologic relapse and in the few patients who never achieved an hematologic remission after whatever prior treatment.
Philadelphia-Positive ALL|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, in Relapse
DRUG: Ponatinib
MRD negativity/reduction rate, Rate of patients who achieve a MRD negativity/MRD reduction following treatment with either Ponatinib alone or in combination with systemic chemotherapy, After 3 months of treatment
Duration of CMR, Duration of the CMR status after 3 months of ponatinib treatment, at 24 months|Hematologic remission rate, The achievement of an hematologic remission in patients treated for an hematologic and extra-hematoloigc relapse and for a refractory disease., at 24 months|Best molecular response, Best molecular response achieved during the follow-up, at 24 months|Rate of AE/SAEs, Safety profile in terms of incidence of grade \>3 CTC-NCI side effects and toxicities (AE/SAEs)., at 24 months|Mutational analysis, Mutational analysis in terms of occurrence, type and number of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations., at 24 months|Correlation between biological and MRD parameters, Correlation between the achievement and duration of CMR (or MRD reduction) with the type of fusion protein (e.g. p190 or p210) and the potential occurrence of mutations, as well as with additional genomic lesions., at 24 months|Disease free survival, Time interval between the achievement of CHR after three months of ponatinib and hematologic relapse of the disease or death in CHR; patients still alive, in CHR., 24 months|Overall survival, Time interval between treatment start and death for any cause., 24 months|Cumulative incidence of relapse, Time interval between achievement of CHR after three months of ponatinib until the date of first hematologic relapse of the disease., 24 months|Role of hematological profile on survival outcome, Identification of hematological profile on survival outcome, at 24 months
This is a phase II interventional multicenter study for adult patients with Ph+ALL who:

* Are MRD+ (i.e. BCR-ABL1/ABL1 \>0.01) (or loose their molecular response) after whichever kind of previous treatment. MRD positivity is indeed regarded as a relapse/resistance, since it represents the early recognition of cases who will eventually experience an hematologic recurrence of disease.
* Are in hematologic relapse after whichever kind of previous treatment.
* Have never achieved an hematologic remission at least after one month of treatment.

Patients will be treated with Ponatinib at a dose of 45 mg/die per os for 28 days for 3 cycles and - if in hematologic and extra-hematologic relapse/refractoriness, clinically fit and according to medical decision - with concurrent systemic chemotherapy. In case of CMR achievement, dosing will be reduced to 30 mg. In case of toxicity, Ponatinib will be reduced to 30 (or 15) mg daily.
