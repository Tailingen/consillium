MarginProbe® System U.S. Post-Approval Study
The study objective is to determine the MarginProbe® System's diagnostic accuracy at the margin level and impact on Positive Margin\* Presence originating from the Main ex-vivo lumpectomy specimen after the initial lumpectomy surgery.

\*A positive margin is defined in this study as a margin microscopically measured and reported in the histology report to have cancer within 1 mm or less of the inked surface
Breast Cancer

This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized (1:1), double arm, controlled study, in which subjects undergoing breast excision (lumpectomy) for carcinoma of the breast will be randomized to either standard of care with additional inspection ('SOC + Additional inspection' arm) or standard of care with MarginProbe as an adjunct ('SOC + Device' arm).

The MarginProbe is an adjunctive diagnostic tool for identification of cancerous tissue at the margins (≤ 1mm) of the main ex-vivo lumpectomy specimen following primary excision. It will be used by the surgeon during lumpectomy procedures only in patients randomized to the "Device+SOC" arm.

Randomization will take place following the excision of the main ex-vivo lumpectomy specimen.
