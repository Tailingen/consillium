The Clinical Study of CD19 UCAR-T Cells in Patients With B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)
This is a single arm, open-label, single center, exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD19 UCAR-T Cells in Patients With CD19+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).

This study did not set up a control group. The maximum dose was determined according to the dose escalation test. Based on the number of CART cells per kg body weight which was proved to be safe and effective, all the subjects were treated with one single dose of CD19 UCART cells per treatment course. The dose escalation test was designed to evaluate the three dose levels of CD19 UCART (1 × 10 \^ 6 cells/kg,3 × 10 \^ 6 cells/kg,5 × 10 \^ 6 cells/kg). Each CD19 UCART infusion will be carried out on day 0. Each subject was observed for at least 4 weeks after the last infusion. If there was no dose-limited toxicity (DLT), it is necessary to continue multiple treatment courses at this dose level. The detailed administration time and dose were decided by the researchers.
