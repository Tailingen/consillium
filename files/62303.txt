Phase II Study of Epirubicin, Cisplatin and Capecitabine (ECX) Versus Cisplatin and Capecitabine (CX) for Advanced Gastric Cancer (AGC)
Recently, 3-drug (ECX) and 2-drug (CX) combination chemotherapy involving capecitabine showed promising results in randomized clinical trials for advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and activity of ECX and CX combination chemotherapy given as first-line therapy for AGC.
