Enzalutamide Plus Everolimus in Men With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a novel combination of agents, enzalutamide and everolimus, for the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who have never received prior chemotherapy, or who have previously received docetaxel chemotherapy and have progressive disease.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Enzalutamide
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of everolimus plus enzalutamide., MTD will be determined by testing increasing doses of everolimus with standard dose enzalutamide in 3-patient dose escalation cohorts. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which ≤1 of 6 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during 1 cycle (28 days) of therapy, assessed according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0., 6-8 months|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, PSA response will be measured by the percent decreased from the reported baseline value. The proportion of patients with documented PSA decreases of 50% and 85% in PSA levels will be reported separately., every 8 weeks for up to 24 months|Number of patients with serious and non-serious adverse events., Evaluate the safety of the combination per CTCAE v4.0, every 4 weeks from date of first study treatment until the date of documented progression, up to 24 months., every 4 weeks up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetic sampling for everolimus, Levels of everolimus in blood samples will be collected from patients at selected timepoints prior to dosing during the first 3 cycles of treatment., Cycle 1, Day 1: prior to initial dose and 2hrs post-dose; Cycles 2 and 3, Day 1: prior to initial dose
Time to PSA progression, Defined as the time from date of first protocol treatment until date of PSA progression. PSA progression is defined as when patient has both a ≥25% increase above the nadir or baseline value and when the absolute increase is ≥2ng/mL., every 8 weeks up to 24 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Soft tissue response rate \[percentage of complete responders (CR) and partial responders (PR) per RECIST v1.1\], every 8 weeks up to 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Restaging will occur every 8 weeks from date of first treatment until date of first progression, or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first - up to 24 months., every 8 weeks up to 24 months
This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase I study with an expansion cohort, in patients with metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) who are chemotherapy-naive or have previously received docetaxel chemotherapy and have progressive disease at the time of study entry. The dose escalation phase of this study will establish the optimum daily dose of everolimus that can be delivered along with a standard daily dose of enzalutamide to patients with metastatic CRPC. Eligible patients must have evaluable (elevated PSA) or measurable disease (per RECIST v1.1). Following completion of the dose escalation phase, an additional cohort of patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to give preliminary information regarding the efficacy of this combination.
