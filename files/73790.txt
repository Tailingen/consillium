The Impact of Inflammatory Adhesion on the Prognosis of Colon Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of tumor-associated inflammatory adhesion on the prognosis of colon cancer patients.
Colon Cancer
OTHER: This was a retrospective study and no patient intervention was performed.
Overall survival time (OS), OS, defined as the time from the first diagnosis to death from any cause or the last follow-up for surviving patients, up to 10 years|Cancer-specific survival time (CSS), CSS refers to the duration from diagnosis of a tumor until the patient succumbs to the tumor, excluding deaths from other causes., up to 10 years|Recurrence free survival time (RFS), RFS is the time from the time a patient achieved R0 resection after surgery to the time of recurrence or the end of follow-up., up to 10 years
In some colon cancer patients, although adhesions between the tumor tissue and surrounding organs are found during surgery, postoperative pathology confirms that the tumor has not directly invaded the adhered organs; instead, the adhesions are caused by tumor-associated inflammation. This condition is defined as tumor-associated inflammatory adhesion.

Currently, the impact of tumor-associated inflammatory adhesion on patient prognosis is still unclear. This study aims to explore the impact of tumor-associated inflammatory adhesion on the prognosis of colon cancer patients through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Chinese multi-center databases.
