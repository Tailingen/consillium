Study of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) in Elderly Stage I NSCLC
This study aims to prospectively investigate the efficacy, toxicity and quality of life (QOF) of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) using a moderate fractionation of 72 Gy/6 Gy/12 F (BED10 = 115 Gy) in a single arm of elderly ( ≥ 70) patients with stage I (2009 UICC) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR)
Local regional progression free survival, Duration between radiotherapy commencement and local progression, regional progression, death of cancer or last date of follow up., 2 year
Objective response rate, Tumor response to radiotherapy evaluated by RECIST 1.1, 1 month after RT|Progression free survival, Duration between radiotherapy commencement and any progression, death of cancer or last date of follow up., 2 year|Overall survival, Duration between radiotherapy commencement and any cause of death or last date of follow up., 2 year|Grade ≥ 2 radiation induced normal tissue toxicity, Incidence of radiation induced toxicities on lung, oesophagus, rib or chest wall pain assessed by CTCAE v 4.0, 1 year|Questionnaire on quality of life, Physical and psychologic status assessed by specific questionnaire, 2 year
This study aims to prospectively investigate the local regional control, overall survival, treatment related toxicities and quality of life (QOF) of elderly stage I NSCLC patients receiving stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with a moderate fractionation of 72 Gy/6 Gy/12 F (BED10 = 115 Gy). Patients' general characteristics, treatment modality, dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters, toxicity profiling, quality of life, pattern of failure as well as survival time will be prospective recorded for the analysis.
