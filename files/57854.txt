Combination Adenovirus + Pembrolizumab to Trigger Immune Virus Effects
Glioblastoma (GBM) and gliosarcoma (GS) are the most common and aggressive forms of malignant brain tumor in adults and can be resistant to conventional therapies. The purpose of this Phase II study is to evaluate how well a recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma tumor responds to one injection of DNX-2401, a genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus, when delivered directly into the tumor followed by the administration of intravenous pembrolizumab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor) given every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or until disease progression.

In the initial phase of the study, up to 12 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in 3 dose cohorts to determine the best dose of DNX-2401, as follows:

* Cohort 1: Single dose DNX-2401 (5e8 vp) delivered intratumorally by cannula, followed by intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W)
* Cohort 2: Single dose DNX-2401(5e9 vp) delivered intratumorally by cannula, followed by intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W)
* Cohort 3: Single dose DNX-2401 (5e10 vp) delivered intratumorally by cannula, followed by intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W)

Following the initial phase, up to 36 additional subjects diagnosed with recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma will be enrolled to receive a single of DNX-2401 determined in the initial phase administered intratumorally followed by intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks.

All subjects will return to the clinic for study follow-up visits at regular intervals for safety monitoring, MRI scans and other assessments, for up to 2 years or until disease progression. All subjects will be followed closely for safety and survival.
