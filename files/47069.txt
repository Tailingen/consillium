A Study of Letrozole, Palbociclib, and Onapristone ER in People With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The researchers are doing this study to find out whether the study drug onapristone ER, combined with the standard treatment for your cancer (letrozole and palbociclib), is a safe treatment for people who have metastatic or unresectable ER+/PR+/HER2- breast cancer. The researchers will test different doses of the study drug to find the highest dose that causes few or mild side effects.
