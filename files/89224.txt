Phase II Study of Carboplatin and Bevacizumab (Avastin) for ER Neg, PR Neg, and HER2/Neu Neg Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the progression free survival (PFS) of metastatic ER, PR and HER2/neu negative breast cancers to the combination of carboplatin and bevacizumab (Avastin®) therapy.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: bevacizumab
Progression Free Survival, Progression is defined using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee \[JNCI 92(3):205-216, 2000\], as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Up to 5 years
Response Rate, Response is defined using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee \[JNCI 92(3):205-216, 2000\]: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions or disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; Partial Response (PR), At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Stable Disease (SD), Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started, or persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits., Up to 5 years|Duration of Response, Up to 5 years|Correlation of Response to BRCA1 Methylation Status, The methylation status of the tumor is defined using Methylation Specific polymerase chain reaction and/or pyrosequencing., Up to 5 years
