Folate and Protection Against Cervical Cancer
This is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial to see whether giving a low dose of the vitamins folic acid and riboflavin is beneficial to women who have very low grade abnormalities of the cervical cells.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Folic acid with riboflavin
Rate of regression of CIN1 to normal over a 12 month intervention
DNA strand breakage, in cervical cells|DNA hypomethylation, in cervical cells|Cervical cell folic acid|HPV persistence over 12 months of intervention
The overall aim of the study is to evaluate interactions between intakes of folic acid and riboflavin with a common polymorphism relevant to folate metabolism, in determining the risk of cervical cancer in women who carry high risk human papillomavirus.

We will test the following hypotheses:

Supplements of riboflavin and folic acid will increase the rate of regression of low grade cervical intra epithelial neoplasia (CIN1).

Effects of supplemental folic acid and riboflavin on CIN1 regression are modulated by a common polymorphism in the MTHFRC677T gene.

We will recruit women with biopsy-proven CIN1 and carrying high risk HPV infection, and randomise to a 12month intervention of 1.2mg folic acid and 5mg riboflavin or placebo. The primary outcome will be regression of biopsy-proven CIN1, and secondary outcomes will include measures of DNA stability.
