Three-dimensional Ultrasonography Thyroid Volume Measurement.
The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the accuracy of applying three-dimensional ultrasound on thyroid gland patients when determining a gland volume.

The method will be compared to conventional b-mode ultrasound where three axis measurements (length, width, and depth) are evaluated in the ellipsoid model.

The three dimensional (3D) method is utilizing optical tracking connected to the ultrasound image to form cross-sectional imaging. Patients enrolled in the study are set for complete thyroidectomies enabling a true volume of the gland by water displacement after excision.

The aim is to find if this 3D method is more accurate in volume estimation than the ellipsoid model.
