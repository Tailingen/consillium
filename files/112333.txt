Intravenous (IV) Iron vs. No Iron as the Treatment of Anemia in Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy and Erythropoietin Therapy
To assess the change in hemoglobin levels when iron sucrose was added to a regimen of weekly, fixed doses of erythropoietin in patients who had or had not responded to erythropoietin therapy alone.
Anemia
DRUG: iron sucrose injection USP|DRUG: stable erythropoietin therapy
Change From Baseline to the Maximum Hemoglobin Level During Stage 2 (Week 9 Through Week 21)., The hemoglobin baseline was defined as the average of the last 2 hemoglobin values during stage 1 (through week 8)., During Stage 2 (week 9 through week 21)
This was a two stage, randomized, controlled study of cancer patients undergoing or planning to undergo chemotherapy. After stage one, (where patients were exposed to an erythropoiesis stimulating agent), patients were randomized to receive either IV iron sucrose or no iron supplementation. Patients were then followed to safety and efficacy endpoints.
