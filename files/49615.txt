Urinary Proteomic Assessment of Ovarian Malignancy and Disease Progression
The goal of this observational study is to determine the urinary proteomic characteristics in women with and without ovarian cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. What is the difference in urinary protein composition between patients with ovarian cancer and those without it?
2. Can these differences in urinary protein composition aid in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer?
3. Are urinary protein markers associated with tumor burden in urine samples from patients with ovarian cancer?
4. Can urinary protein markers be used for disease surveillance in ovarian cancer patients?
Ovarian Cancer (OvCa)
Pathological diagnosis, The histological type of the disease is confirmed by surgery or biopsy, From enrollment to the end of surgery or biopsy at 1 weeks
Progression, Patients with ovarian cancer who have recurrent disease after initial treatment with serological or imaging evidence, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 6 months
