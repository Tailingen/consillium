A Study of Abemaciclib (LY2835219) in Combination With Other Anti-Cancer Treatments in Children and Young Adult Participants With Solid Tumors, Including Neuroblastoma
The study's purpose is to see if the drug, abemaciclib, is safe and effective when given with other drugs to kill cancer cells. The study is open to children and young adults with solid tumors, including neuroblastoma, that did not respond or grew during other anti-cancer treatment. For each participant, the study is estimated to last up to 2 years.
