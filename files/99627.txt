Digoxin Induced Dissolution of CTC Clusters
This single arm therapeutic exploratory study of digoxin in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer investigates whether cardiac glycosides are able to disrupt CTC clusters in breast cancer patients.

Change in mean CTC cluster size (in ng/ml), mean CTC cluster size (in patients with a digoxin serum level above 0.7 ng/ml) after treatment will be compared to mean CTC-cluster size before treatment, Blood samples drawn at Screening, on day 0 (2 hours after first oral intake of digoxin), on day 3, on day 7, on day 10, on day 14, on day 17 and on day 21 after first oral intake of digoxin
Change in mean CTC cluster number, number of CTC-clusters before and after treatment will be compared, Blood samples drawn at Screening, on day 0 (2 hours after first oral intake of digoxin), on day 3, on day 7, on day 10, on day 14, on day 17 and on day 21 after first oral intake of digoxin|Average time to dissolution of CTC Clusters (in days), average time to dissolution of CTC clusters, Blood samples drawn at Screening, on day 0 (2 hours after first oral intake of digoxin), on day 3, on day 7, on day 10, on day 14, on day 17 and on day 21 after first oral intake of digoxin
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are considered to be precursors of metastasis in various cancer types and are found in the blood of cancer patients as single CTCs and CTC clusters, with the latter featuring a higher ability to seed metastasis.

CTC cluster share several properties that commonly feature stem cell biology which drive metastases formation. Preclinical data shows that CTC clusters can be disaggregated into single cells by the treatment with cardiac glycosides such as digoxin. This single arm therapeutic exploratory study of digoxin in patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer investigates whether cardiac glycosides are able to disrupt CTC clusters in breast cancer patients.

Patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer in whom CTC clusters could be identified will receive an individualized daily maintenance dose of digoxin adapted to their kidney function. Blood samples for analyses of digoxin serum level and mean CTC cluster size will be drawn at specified time points.
