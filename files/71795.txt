Irinotecan With Docetaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining irinotecan and docetaxel in treating patients who have recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel|DRUG: irinotecan hydrochloride
response rate, Up to 5 years
overall survival, Up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the response rate of previously treated patients with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer after treatment with irinotecan and docetaxel. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the overall survival in this patient population.

OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes immediately followed by docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment is repeated every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years or until death.
