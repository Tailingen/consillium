Different Risk Stratification Models for Prediction of Lymph Node Involvement in Endometrial Carcinoma
Endometrial cancer is the most common malignant disease of the female genital tract and the seventh most common cause of cancer death in women in Western countries. Histological type, grade and depth of myometrial invasion are prognostic factors in early stage disease as well as risk factors for lymph node metastasis. Systematic lymphadenectomy has recently been questioned for stage I disease based on the results from two randomized trials
