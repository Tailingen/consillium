Exploratory Clinical Study of CD19-targeted CAR-T and CAR-DC in the Treatment of Relapsed and Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
This is an open, single-arm, prospective, dose-escalation clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and the preliminary efficacy of CD19-targeted CAR-T combined with CAR-DC in the treatment of relapsed and refractory B-cell lymphoma
Relapsed and Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD19 CAR-T and CD19 CAR-DC
DLT, To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and determine the recommended dosage of combined therapy of CD19 CAR-T and CD19 CAR-DC for Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Up to 28 days|MTD, MTD was the highest dose for DLT in ≤1/6 subjects, Up to 28 days|Incidence of abnormalities, Incidence of abnormalities in AE/SAE/AESI/laboratory tests/electrocardiograms/vital signs., Up to 28 days
Overall Response Rate, The proportion of CR or PR patients as assessed by investigators based on Lugano 2014 Response Assessment, Up to 2 years|Duration of Response, The time from the start of the first assessment of CR or PR to the first assessment as disease recurrence or progression or death, Up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival, The length of time that a participant's disease did not progress during or after CAR-T treatment., Up to 2 years
6-18 patients are planned to be enrolled in the dose-escalation trial. The dose of CD19-CAR-DC was according to the 3+3 dose-escalation principle (0.25×10\^6/kg, 0.5×10\^6/kg, 0.75×10\^6/kg ( ±20%) . CAR-T was 2×10\^6/kg . The primary endpoints are DLT, MTD, and the second endpionts are the overall response rates (CR and PR), overall survival, and progression-free survival. Based on the results in the dose-escalation trial, the recommended dose will be determined. Another 52 patients will be enrolled to continue estimating the safety and efficacy.
