This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Umbralisib as a treatment for any disease.

The FDA has approved Rituximab as a treatment option for this disease.

Umbralisib is an investigational drug which blocks a protein called PI3K. PI3K is a protein that plays a role in the way cells grow. In this type of cancer, PI3K is increased and more active than usual. This helps the cancer cells to grow and survive. Early clinical trials have shown that Umbralisib can kill cancer cells in some patients and cause their tumors to shrink.
