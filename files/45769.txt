A Clinical Research About CD70-targeted CAR-T in the Treatment of CD70-positive Advanced/Metastatic Gynecologic Cancer
This is a single-center, double-arm, open-label study. this study plans to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD70-targeting CAR-T cells in the treatment of CD70-positive advanced/metastatic Gynecologic Cancer, and obtain recommended doses and infusion patterns.

Incidence of Adverse events after CD70 CAR-T cells infusion [Safety and Tolerability], Therapy-related adverse events were recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0), 28 days|Obtain the maximum tolerated dose of CD70 CAR-T cells[Safety and Tolerability], Dose-limiting toxicity after cell infusion, 28 days
Disease control rate of CAR-T cell preparations in CD70 positive advanced malignancies [Effectiveness], Disease control rate: The proportion of subjects who achieved CR, PR, SD after CAR-T infusion accounted for all treated subjects (Assessed based on RECIST criteria)，the minimum value is 0%，maximum value is 100%, and higher scores mean a better outcome., 3 months|Objective response rate (ORR) of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], Objective response rate includes：The proportion of subjects who achieved CR, PR after CAR-T infusion accounted for all treated subjects (Assessed based on RECIST criteria)，the minimum value is 0%，maximum value is 100%, and higher scores mean a better outcome., 3 months|Duration of Response (DOR) of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/PR/SD to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause, 2 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], PFS will be assessed from the first CD70-CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression(Assessed based on RECIST criteria), 2 years|Overall survival(OS)of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], OS will be assessed from the first CD70-CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause (Assessed based on RECIST criteria), 2 years|AUCS of CD70 CAR-T cells [Cell dynamics], AUCS is defined as the area under the curve in 90 days, 3 months|CMAX of CD70 CAR-T cells [Cell dynamics], CMAX is defined as the highest concentration of CD70 CAR-T cells expanded in peripheral blood, 3 months|TMAX of CD70 CAR-T cells[Cell dynamics], TMAX is defined as the time to reach the highest concentration, 3 months|Pharmacodynamics of CD70 CAR-T cells[Cell dynamics], Concentration levels of CAR-T-related serum cytokines such as CRP, IL-6, ferritin at each time point，which measured by Chemiluminescence method, 3 months
The correlation between CD70 positive rate and safety, assessment the correlation between CD70 positive rate and the incidence of CRA and ICANS, 2 years|Correlation between CD70 positive rate and efficacy, assessment the correlation between CD70 positive rate and the disease control rate，Disease control rate: including CR, PR and SD, 2 years|Overall survival(OS)of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], OS will be assessed from the first CD70-CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause (Assessed by investigators based on IRECIST criteria), 2 years|Progress-free survival(PFS) of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], PFS will be assessed from the first CD70-CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause or the first assessment of progression (Assessed by investigators based on IRECIST criteria), 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) of CD70 CAR-T treatment in patients with CD70-positive advanced malignancies[Effectiveness], DOR will be assessed from the first assessment of CR/PR/SD to the first assessment of recurrence or progression of the disease or death from any cause (Assessed by investigators based on IRECIST criteria), 2 years
The research designs to follow 2 groups：Intravenous infusion group and Intraperitoneal injection group；each group sets up 2 phases,the first phase is dose discovery phase to obtain recommended doses,the second phase is dose expansion phase to verify the safety in the recommended doses. In the discovery phase,each group puts up 4 dose groups, adopting a dose-escalating 3+3 design, and plan to recruit about 12 subjects with CD70-positive advanced/metastatic solid tumors.In the dose expansion phase,each group will choose one or two dose groups to verify the safety and efficacy at this dose,and plan to recruit about 6 subjects in each dose group.
