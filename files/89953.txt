Curcumin Gel On Radiation Induced Oral Mucositis
The goal of this clinical study is to investigate the effect of a curcuma longa oral gel (curenext) on reducing radiation-induced oral mucositis severity in cancer patients and provide a context for understanding if there is a relationship between the curcumin clinical effect and production of EGFs and IL8.

Researchers will compare between curcumin group and standard treatment group.
