Effectiveness of Stereotactic RadioTherapy in Solid Primary Inoperable and Oligometastatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to development of more effective treatment tactics of the stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery alone and together with classic radiation therapy in primary inoperabel solid tumors and oligometastastatic cancer.
Radiotherapy
Relapse Rate (local and/or distant), clinical-instrumental or laboratory signs of local and/or distant recurrences of previously diagnosed oncological diaseases, 5 years|Number of Deaths Due to Any Cause, Deaths due to any complications or progression of previously diagnosed oncological diaseases, 5 years
Incidence of acute toxicity, Number of adverse effects of irradiation observed in the patients within 3 months from the begginning of the treatment, measured by CTCAE 4.03 and/or EORTC/RTOG scales., Up to 90 days after completion of radiation therapy|Incidence of late toxicity, Number of adverse effects of irradiation observed in the patients after 3 months from the begginning of the treatment, measured by LENT SOMA scale., Up to 2 years after completion of radiation therapy
Despite the fact that of many investigations in the world clinical researches, the SRT of primary-inoperabel and metastatic solid tumors combined with conventional and conformal radiation therapy methods the possibility of the sequences, the optimal fractions of the regimes and doses which determines normal tissues toxic manifestations, implementation of prevention, have not been solved yet.

The conducted research works to study quality of life for improving the social status of patients with primary-inoperable and metastatic solid tumors, is not fully resolved.

Thus, preparing of highly effective treatment tactics in primary-inoperable and metastatic solid tumors, is one of the most important problems of modern clinical oncology and this fact gives grounds to carry out the planned research work.
