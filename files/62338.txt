Vaccine Therapy With or Without Polysaccharide-K in Patients With Stage IV HER2 Positive Breast Cancer Receiving HER2-Targeted Monoclonal Antibody Therapy
This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects of vaccine therapy with or without polysaccharide-K and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IV human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer who are receiving HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy. Vaccines made from HER2 intracellular domain (ICD) peptide may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express HER2. Polysaccharide-K may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy works better when given with or without polysaccharide-K in treating breast cancer.

Induction of Interferon (IFN)-Gamma Production and Cluster of Differentiation (CD)107a Expression in NK Cells, Via Flow Cytometry, Augmentation of NK cell activity is defined by a 2-fold increase (at time of maximal change) in NK cell IFN-gamma production and CD107a expression

For the results we used CD56 which is the accepted phenotypic marker for natural killer (NK) cells and CD16 which is a receptor on NK cells that facilitates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). CD56dim are typically responsible for cytolytic activity and targets cell killing, whereas, CD56bright are the main source of cytokine production (i.e. IFN-gamma). CD56dim CD16bright NK cells represent at least 90% of all peripheral blood NK cells with a maximum of 10% as CD56bright NK cells

We compared the baseline expression of CD56brightCD16dim or CD56dimCD16bright (prior to start of study treatment) to the maximum expression of CD56brightCD16dim or CD56dimCD16bright at 1 of 4 timepoints after the start of the oral administration of study treatment (polysaccharide-K/placebo (either week 4, 8, 12 or 16)., Up to 16 weeks
Change in Intermolecular Epitope Spreading Assessed by IFN-gamma Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Spot Assay, IFN-Î³ ELISPOT assay will be used to evaluate T cell precursor frequency to specific breast tumor antigens. A positive immune response will be defined as a post-vaccination T cell precursor frequency \>1:20,000 antigen-specific PBMCs. In patients with a baseline precursor frequency \>1:20,000, a positive post-vaccination immune response will be defined as a 2-fold increase in antigen-specific PBMC. PBMC will be cryopreserved and subsequently be thawed at time of analysis., Baseline to 12 months after completion of treatment|Change in Pro-inflammatory Serum Cytokine and/or Chemokines Assessed by Luminex Analysis, Baseline to 24 hours after completion of treatment|Change in Serum TGF-beta Levels Assessed by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay, Baseline to 12 months after completion of treatment|OS, Up to 3 years|PFS, Up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the safety of polysaccharide-K (PSK) when given with HER2-directed immunotherapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the effect of PSK on natural killer (NK) cell functional activity when given with HER2-directed immunotherapy.

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To investigate the effect of PSK when given with HER2-directed immunotherapy on: serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine and/or chemokines; intermolecular epitope spreading; serum transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta levels; progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine intradermally (ID) once monthly for 3 months, trastuzumab (or trastuzumab and pertuzumab) per standard of care, and placebo orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4 months.

ARM II: Patients receive HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine ID and trastuzumab (or trastuzumab and pertuzumab) as in Arm I and polysaccharide-K PO BID for 4 months.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 9 months and then twice annually for 3 years.
