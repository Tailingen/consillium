A Phase 3 Study to Assess Efficacy and Safety of Tafasitamab Plus Lenalidomide and Rituximab Compared to Placebo Plus Lenalidomide and Rituximab in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Follicular Lymphoma or Marginal Zone Lymphoma.
This is a Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study designed to investigate whether tafasitamab and lenalidomide as an add-on to rituximab provides improved clinical benefit compared with lenalidomide as an add-on to rituximab in patients with R/R FL Grade 1 to 3a or R/R MZL.

These include 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role, cognitive functioning, emotional functioning, and social functioning), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), a global health status scale, and 6 single items (constipation, diarrhea, sleep, dyspnea, appetite, financial). All scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Therefore, a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning and a high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high QoL.

The 5 questions have 5 response levels: 1, no problems; 2, slight problems; 3, moderate problems; 4, severe problems; and 5, unable to/extreme problems., up to approximately 34 months|Overall Population: Health State EQ-5D-5L Scores at Baseline and End of Treatment, The EQ-5D-5L contains a participant-reported score regarding health state measured on a visual analog scale (scores range from 0 \[worst imaginable health state\] to 100 \[best imaginable health state\]), and 5 questions on mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.

Physical well-being (PWB) subscale: 7 items measured on 0- to 4-point scale; total score = 0-28. Social/family well-being (SWB) subscale: 7 items measured on 0- to 4-point scale; total score = 0-28. Emotional well-being (EWB) subscale: 6 items measured on 0- to 4-point scale; total score = 0-24. Functional well-being (FWB) subscale: 7 items measured on 0- to 4-point scale; total score = 0-28. Lymphoma (LymS) subscale includes 15 items; total score = 0-60. Three total scores can be derived by adding the subscales: FACT-Lymphoma Trial Outcome Index (TOI): (PWB score) + (FWB score) + (LymS score); total score = 0-116. FACT-G total score: (PWB score) + (SWB score) + (EWB score) + (FWB score); total score = 0-108. FACT-Lymphoma total score: (PWB score) + (SWB score) + (EWB score) + (FWB score) + (LymS score); total score = 0-168. The higher the score, the better the quality of life., up to approximately 34 months|Overall Population: FACT-Lym Scores at Baseline and End of Treatment, The FACT-Lymphoma (v4) is composed of 42 items with a 5-point Likert-type scale and 5 subscales.

This is a Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study designed to investigate whether tafasitamab and lenalidomide as an add-on to rituximab provides improved clinical benefit compared with lenalidomide as an add-on to rituximab in patients with R/R FL Grade 1 to 3a or R/R MZL.
