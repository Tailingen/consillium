About 4-10% of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have metastatic disease at diagnosis. The treatment recommendation of primary metastatic NPC is systemic chemotherapy. However, the optimal regimen is yet to determine due to lack of prospective randomized trial for this unique group of patients. Generally, GP regimen is used as the first-line treatment of primary metastatic NPC. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of Toripalimab Combined with GP Regimen Chemotherapy Versus GP Regimen Chemotherapy for Primary Metastatic NPC.
