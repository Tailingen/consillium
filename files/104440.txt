A Clinical Trial on Whole-brain Radiotherapy With Temozolomide Concurrent Chemotherapy or Avoidance of Hippocampus for Patients of Brain Metastases
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects on neurocognitive function of whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with/without TMZ concurrent chemotherapy or avoidance of hippocampus for patients of brain metastases, as well as the feasibility and risk of avoidance of hippocampus during whole-brain radiotherapy.
Brain Metastasis|Radiation Therapy Complication
DRUG: TMZ|RADIATION: WBRT with avoidance of hippocampus|RADIATION: WBRT without avoidance of hippocampus
Change of neurocognitive function between baseline and 4 months after radiotherapy, Neurocognitive function is evaluated by Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE), baseline; four months after radiotherapy
Effect on response rate, Response is evaluated on basis of RECIST, baseline; One, two, four, six, and twelve months after radiotherapy|The tolerance of radiotherapy with TMZ concurrent chemotherapy, Adverse effects are evaluated by CTCAE 4.0 criteria, baseline; once a week through during radiotherapy, up to 3 weeks
This is a phase II randomized clinical trial. It is reported that avoidance of hippocampus during whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) had benefits in preservation of memory for patients, and the use of concurrent TMZ in radiotherapy for patients with brain metastases benefited for treating outcome.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects on neurocognitive function of whole-brain radiotherapy with/without TMZ concurrent chemotherapy or avoidance of hippocampus for patients of brain metastases, as well as the feasibility and risk of avoidance of hippocampus during whole-brain radiotherapy.
