Use Of 3,4-Diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) In The Treatment Of Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome
Compassionate use of orphan drug 3,4-Diaminopyridine(DAP) in Treatment of Lambert Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS). 3,4-DAP is used to decrease the muscle weakness associated with LEMS and hopefully will decrease the need for prednisone and all other therapies that were previously required to control symptoms. How long a patient will take 3,4 DAP depends upon if he/she is seeing benefits from the medication or experiencing side effects that will prevent them from continuation in the study.

DRUG: 3,4 DAP
3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP) decreases symptoms of weakness in patients with LEMS, and therefore can be used to decrease the amount of immune modulation therapy needed to provide an equivalent degree of disease control.
