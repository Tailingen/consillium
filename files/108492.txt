Nadolol Versus Propranolol in Children With Infantile Hemangiomas
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of oral propranolol versus nadolol in patients with Infantile Hemangiomas (IH) in a randomized, controlled, double-blinded study.
Infantile Hemangioma
DRUG: Nadolol|DRUG: Propranolol
The change in the bulk (size/extent) and color of the infantile hemangioma (IH)at Week 24 compared to baseline using Visual Analog Scale (VAS)., A 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to quantify changes in the visible bulk (size/extent) and color of the lesion by comparing clinical photographs at 24 weeks versus baseline, 24 weeks
Percent change in IH bulk using VAS at 4, 12, 52 weeks, A 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to quantify changes in the visible bulk (size/extent) of the lesion by comparing clinical photographs at weeks 4, 12, and 52 versus baseline, 4, 12, 52 weeks|Time and dose to reach the 50%, 75% and 100% tumor shrinkage, Time frame since the baseline and study medication dose, when patient's IH decreased in size by 50%, 75% and 100%., 52 weeks|Inter-rater reliability of the VAS scores, Two raters will assess the changes in IH for each study patient ( each visit). We will compare these results to assess inter-rater reliability., 52 weeks|Percentage of patients achieving functional correction at Week 4, 12, 24, 52, Percentage of patients achieving functional correction at Week 4, 12, 24, 52, 4,12,24,52 weeks|Percent change in the volumetric changes of hemangioma, \[(Length + Width)/2\]3 X 0.07, 24 and 52 weeks|Percentage of patients with residual changes (telangiectasias, discoloration, fibro-fatty changes, anetoderma), Percentage of patients with residual changes, 52 weeks|Frequency of observed and reported adverse events, Frequency of observed and reported adverse events, 52 weeks
The study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral propranolol in comparison with oral nadolol in patients with IH. Patients will be randomly assigned to either propranolol or dose equivalent nadolol. The duration of the study will be 24 weeks, however, patient will be monitored for up to 1 year post study enrolment. Both efficacy and safety will be closely monitored and captured.
