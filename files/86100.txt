Disorders of Sexual Development and Gonadal Tumor Risk
Disorders of Sexual Development are rare and represent a spectrum of heterogeneous pathologies. The risk of developing a malignant gonadal germ cell tumor (MGCT) exists and varies according to the etiology.

The indication for prophylactic gonadectomy must be modulated and discussed for all patients. It is essential to assess each patient's individual risk.

The aim of our study is to assess gonadal tumor risk in patients with Disorders of Sexual Development according to etiology

The primary objective is to evaluate tumor risk and the indication for gonadectomy in cases of Disorders of Sexual Development according to etiology.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate the timing of gonadectomy, to monitor changes in practice over time, and to assess the contribution of imaging and/or biological tests to tumor detection.
Disorders of Sexual Development
OTHER: Not applicable . Non-interventional retrospective study, only on datas.
Presence or absence of gonadal tumor lesion after gonadectomy, in case of Disorders of sexual development (DSD) according to anatomo-pathological analysis., Datas about the gonadectomy surgical pieces performed between1990 and 2022 are reviewed for the study by Dr Frédérique Dijoud, anatomo-pathologist at the DEV-GEN CRMR in Lyon, to confirm the présence or absence of a gonadal tumor lesion, in order to avoid intra- and inter-reader interpretation bias., The outcome measure will be assessed and the datas reported for each patient will be collected, from birth until the study completion date, or by default until the date of death from any cause. Datas will be collected during the 10 months of the study
