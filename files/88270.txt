PLD-cyclophosphamide-Nab-P Continuously Combined With Dual HER2 Blockage for HER2-positive Breast Cancer
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (cT2-3/N0-1/M0) were treated with PldCHP (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 35mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2, trastuzumab 8 mg/kg loading, then 6 mg/kg, pertuzumab 840 mg loading, then 420 mg, iv, q3w) for 4 cycles followed by Nab-PHP (Nab-Paclitaxel 260mg/m2, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg, pertuzumab 420 mg, iv, q3w) for 4 cycles
Breast Cancer|HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) plus cyclophosphamide followed by Nab-paclitaxel (Nab-P) ,continuously combined with dual HER2 blockage
Rate of pathological complete response, absence of invasive carcinoma in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, while residual ductal carcinoma in situ was accepted (ypT0orTisypN0), At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 14 days)
adverse effects, Serious adverse effect occur within neoadjuvant chemotherapy, during the period of neadjuvant chemotherapy, an average of 14 days
Upon approval by the Medical Ethics Committee of Xijing Hospital, patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (cT2-3/N0-1/M0) receiving neoadjuvant therapy, were enrolled. The patients were treated with PldCHP (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 35mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2, trastuzumab 8 mg/kg loading, then 6 mg/kg, pertuzumab 840 mg loading, then 420 mg, iv, q3w) for 4 cycles followed by Nab-PHP (Nab-Paclitaxel 260mg/m2, trastuzumab 6 mg/kg, pertuzumab 420 mg, iv, q3w) for 4 cycles, with strict monitoring of cardiotoxicity. The primary endpoint was pCR rate, and secondary endpoints were cardiac safety during neoadjuvant therapy.
