Copanlisib and Combination Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma or Relapsed Grade 3b Follicular Lymphoma
This phase I trial studies the best dose of copanlisib when given together with combination chemotherapy (R-GCD) in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) or grade 3b follicular lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) after 1 prior line of therapy. Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, carboplatin, and dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving copanlisib together with R-GCD as second line therapy may improve the complete response rate for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or follicular lymphoma.

Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Will assess the presence of a DLT in the first cycle of treatment The dose that estimate of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be obtained using the continuous reassessment method (CRM). Moreover, the proportion of DLT at each dose level will be reported along with the final estimates of the probability of DLT at the MTD based on the CRM along with the 95% confidence interval., Up to 21 days
Complete response rate, Will be defined by the Lugano Criteria using positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). Will be calculated for patients assigned to the MTD and reported along with an exact binomial 95% confidence interval., Up to 1 year after 3 cycles of treatment (each cycle is 21 days)|Objective response rate, Will be defined by the Lugano Criteria using PET/CT. Will be calculated for patients assigned to the MTD and reported along with an exact binomial 95% confidence interval., Up to 1 year after 3 cycles of treatment (each cycle is 21 days)|Ability to mobilize an adequate number of CD34+ stem cells for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), For those who initially planned to consolidate treatment with an ASCT, will evaluate the proportion who are able to mobilize an adequate number of CD34+ stem cells for ASCT defined as \>= 2 x 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg., Up to 1 year post treatment|Ability to proceed with ASCT, Will also evaluate the proportion of patients who initially planned to consolidate treatment with ASCT that are actually able to do so., Up to 1 year post treatment|Progression free survival (PFS), Will also evaluate the 1-year PFS of this population., At 1 year|Overall survival (OS), Will also evaluate the 1-year OS of this population., At 1 year|Cell of origin (COO), Will stratify results based on COO as determined by Hans algorithm or gene expression profiling by nanostring., Up to 1 year post treatment|Incidence of adverse events, The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 will be used to classify and grade toxicities., Up to 28 days after cycle 3 day 1 (each cycle is 21 days)
OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of copanlisib.

Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) and gemcitabine IV on days 1 and 8, carboplatin IV and rituximab IV on day 1, and dexamethasone orally (PO) or IV 30-60 minutes prior to chemotherapy on day 1 or PO in the morning (AM) and 30-60 minutes prior to chemotherapy on days 2-4. Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 8 or 9. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 1 year.
