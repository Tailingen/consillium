A Pilot Study Assessing the Effect of Lymphaticovenous Micro-Anastomosis in the Treatment of Postmastectomy Lymphedema
This study will assess the impact of lymphaticovenous microanastomosis in volume reduction of postmastectomy upper extremity lymphedema. We hypothesize that multiple lymphaticovenous micro-anastomosis in the distal arm will result in the reduction of volume and improvement in quality of life of patients with post-mastectomy lymphedema
Lymphedema|Post Mastectomy
PROCEDURE: Lymphaticovenous Micro-Anastomosis
Changes Relative to Baseline in the Volume of the Affected Limb at 3 and 6 Months From Surgery, Lymphatic Volumetric Assessment. Evaluation of the volumetric change, relative to baseline measurement, in the volume of the affected limb at 3 and 6 months from the procedure., 3 and 6 months from surgery
