Investigating the Impact of Proactive Palliative Care
This study will test whether adding personalized supportive care to medical treatment on a clinical trial affects the study participants' ability and desire to discuss their symptoms, their concerns about the future, and their approach to coping with cancer. The effects of supportive care on participants' responses to questions about these topics will be compared with those of other study participants who are being treated for cancer in a clinical trial, but are not receiving personalized supportive care.
