Study of HPN217 in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma MK-4002 (MK-4002-001)
Researchers want to learn if MK-4002 (also known as HPN217) can treat relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The goals of this study are to learn about the safety of different doses of MK-4002 and how well people tolerate them. Researchers also want to learn what happens to different doses of MK-4002 in a person's body over time.
