Pembrolizumab and Vorinostat in Treating Patients With Recurrent Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer or Salivary Gland Cancer That Is Metastatic and/or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of pembrolizumab and vorinostat in treating patients with squamous cell head and neck cancer or salivary gland cancer that has come back, has spread to other places in the body and/or cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab together with vorinostat may be a better treatment for head and neck cancer or salivary gland cancer.

Incidence of Toxicity Graded According to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0, Toxicities will be summarized as the number and percentage of patients with each type of toxicity, per Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, Up to 30 days after the completion of study treatment
Objective Response Rate, Radiologic assessments of measurable disease will be performed using radiographic imaging. RECIST 1.1 and immune response criteria will be used to assess response to therapy. Responses will be summarized as frequencies and percentages., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival, The Kaplan Meier methods will be used to estimate overall survival., Up to 7 years 6 months|Progression Free Survival, The Kaplan Meier methods will be used to estimate progression free survival., Up to 2 years
OUTLINE:

Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) or via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on days 1-5 and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 8-12 weeks thereafter.
