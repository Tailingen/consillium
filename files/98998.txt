Study of Core Needle Biopsy and Cryoablation of an Enlarging Tumor in Patients With Metastatic Lung Cancer and Metastatic Melanoma Receiving Post-progression Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy
This research study is studying cryoablation (a treatment to kill cancer cells with extreme cold) combined with continued treatment with current immune checkpoint inhibitor as a possible treatment for lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Cryoablation|PROCEDURE: Biopsy
Cumulative Incidence of Treatment Related Serious Adverse Events, The safety and feasibility of the procedure will be determined based on observed adverse events. Cryoablation will be determined safe and feasible to implement in this study population if the cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) related to cryoablation is no higher than 20%. Adverse events are assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4)., 2 years|Radiologic Response Rate Of Cryoablation, The number of participants that achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) following cryoablation.

* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., 2 years
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved each aspect of this therapy, however this research study is unique because it combines them as a treatment option for the participant's disease. That has not been approved by the FDA.

In this research study, The investigators are...

* Continuing the participant on the participant's immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy even though the participant's doctor believes that the participant's cancer is growing. Since the participant's cancer is growing, there is only a small chance the participant will respond to continued drug therapy.
* Taking a biopsy of the participant's cancer to confirm there is cancer growing in the location to be treated.
* Performing cryoablation on an enlarging tumor. This involves passing a special needle into the participant's body (cryoprobe) to freeze tumor and kill a small part (not all) of the participant's cancer. Your immune system will respond to the damage caused by freezing part of the participant's tumor.
* The investigators are hoping to demonstrate that combining post-progression immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with cryoablation is safe, and may induce and/or restore an immune response to cancer in other places in the participant's body
