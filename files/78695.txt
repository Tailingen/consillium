Transbronchial Biopsy Assisted by Robot Guidance in the Evaluation of Tumors of the Lung
This study is designed to evaluate clinical safety and diagnostic accuracy of the robotic-assisted bronchoscopy with biopsy performed with the Monarch™ Endoscopy Platform in a broad range of patients with pulmonary lesions.

Despite technological advancements in guided bronchoscopy such as electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy and radial probe endobronchial ultrasound, successful biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions remains a challenge due to a number of factors, one of which may be the ability to gain access to peripheral lesions due to the size and maneuverability of conventional bronchoscopes. The diagnostic yield of conventional bronchoscopic approaches for peripheral lesions remains suboptimal.

A novel robotic assisted bronchoscopy procedure now exists for patients with lung nodules. This procedure is performed using the Monarch™ platform (Auris Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA). This study is expected to enroll up to 1200 patients at up to 30 investigative sites.
