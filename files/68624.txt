Breast Cancer PET/CT Imaging With 68Ga-pAKTi
Abnormal activation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in breast cancer patients is closely associated with tumor progression. Phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) serves as a key indicator of pathway activation. In this study, we utilize a novel probe, 68Ga-pAKTi, which enables precise targeting of tumor p-AKT expression levels to monitor PI3K-AKT pathway activation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-pAKTi PET/CT in detecting p-AKT expression in breast cancer and to compare its performance with that of 18F-FDG PET/CT.

A total of 20 patients with breast cancer will be enrolled. Screening will be conducted within 14 days prior to administration of 68Ga-pAKTi (from Day -14 to Day -1). Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will receive an intravenous injection of 68Ga-pAKTi on Day 0, followed by PET/CT imaging. Biopsy/pathological results and conventional imaging findings will be followed up to validate the diagnostic efficacy of 68Ga-pAKTi PET/CT in accurately detecting p-AKT expression in breast cancer.
