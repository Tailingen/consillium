Trial of Panitumumab/Cisplatin/Fluorouracil Combined With Radiation in Esophageal Cancer
The overall study objective is to evaluate the dose limiting toxicities and the recommended phase II dose of Panitumumab when combined with the standard of care treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil and radiation in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. The investigators will also be assessing the ability of PET (Positron Emission Tomography) imaging to predict the degree of pathologic response.

All patients will have a pre-study FDG (F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose) PET scan and will receive radiation therapy and chemotherapy over a 35 day period. 4-8 weeks post radiation and chemotherapy patients will be restaged with a PET/CT scan. It is anticipated that approximately 30 patients enrolled will undergo an esophagectomy which is considered standard of care post radiation and chemotherapy. The surgery will allow us to compare this study regimen to the historical standard of care (Cisplatin/fluorouracil chemotherapy with radiation therapy).
Cancer
DRUG: Panitumumab
MTD of Panitumumab in Combination With Cisplatin/Fluorouracil and Radiation for Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer Determined by Number of Participants Experiencing DLT, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be where 0 of 6 patients experienced Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) from start until 28 days after the completion of radiation. The investigator considered DLTs related to the treatment to be: grade 4 hematologic toxicity, grade 3 hematologic toxicity lasting \>7 days, any neutropenic fever, all grade 3 non-hematologic toxicities (excluding alopecia and nausea/vomiting/diarrhea if controlled with antiemetics or anti-diarrheal agents), grade 4 lab abnormality (whether symptomatic or asymptomatic), any treatment related to death, any toxicity associated with 1) any single interruption of radiation \>10 treatment days, 2) \>2 interruptions of radiation per course, 3) a delay in completion of radiation by \>14 days beyond planned treatment schedule, 4) inability to deliver \>80% of planned treatment doses, 5) any infield grade 4 toxicity, approximately 18 weeks
Pathologic Response, From therapy initiation through 30 days post surgery. 5.5 weeks of XRT/chemo, 4-8weeks post Radiation (XRT)/Chemo subjects to undergo a surgical resection, and study will be completed 4 weeks post surgery with surgical morbidity and mortality information, 20 weeks.
