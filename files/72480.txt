Prospective Evaluation of the Diagnostic Efficacy of a EUS Guided FNB Needle (AQUIRE®)
The present study investigates the efficacy of a new Endoultrasound guided fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) device (AquireTM Boston Scientific= AQUIRE®) for obtaining histological tissue cylinders in the diagnosis of solid pancreatic tumors, submucosal tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract (esophagus, stomach, duodenum) and lymph node disease..
Tumors of the Pancreas|Submucosal Tumor of Gastrointestinal Tract (Disorder)|Lymph Node Disease
DEVICE: Endoultrasound guided FNB
tissue yield, The primary outcome of the present study is to analyze the percentage in which a representative histological sample can be obtained by EUS-FNB (quality score 3 as defined by Payne et al.)., 12 month after FNB
The AquireTM FNB device uses a triple point tip that is designed to maximize tissue capture and minimize fragmentation.

The efficiency of the 22 Gauge needle is evaluated in a prospective single arm study. The material obtained will be collected for formalin fixation and analyzed by a pathologist blinded for the type of needle device.
