Randomised Study of Oral Azacitidine vs Placebo Maintenance in AML or MDS Patients After Allo-SCT
This study will evaluate a new maintenance therapy with the aim of improving the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS) after stem cell transplantation.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplasia
DRUG: Oral azacitidine|DRUG: Matched placebo
Relapse free survival (RFS), To determine RFS at one year from randomisation of oral azacitidine compared with placebo in patients undergoing allo-SCT for AML/MDS, 12 months
Overall survival (OS), OS at one and two years from randomisation of oral azacitidine compared with placebo, 12 and 24 months|Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), CIR at one and two years after treatment comparing oral azacitidine with placebo, 12 and 24 months|Non-relapse mortality (NRM), NRM at 100 days and 12 months after treatment comparing oral azacitidine with placebo, Day 100 and 12 months|Incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), Incidence of acute and chronic GVHD comparing oral azacitidine with placebo, 24 months|Time to early treatment discontinuation, Time to early treatment discontinuation comparing oral azacitidine with placebo, 24 months|Safety (adverse events), Number of patients with adverse events on oral azacitidine compared with placebo, 24 months|Quality of Life (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D), QoL will be measured to compare oral azacitidine with placebo, 24 months|GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS), GRFS defined as time from date of randomisation to date of first event or death, 12 and 24 months
This is a prospective, two arm, double-blind, phase III clinical trial in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS) who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) and are randomised to receive oral azacitidine or placebo upon engraftment for up to 12 months as maintenance therapy. Patients will be stratified by type of transplant (myeloablative/reduced intensity, age (\<60/â‰¥ 60 years) and donor type (sibling/unrelated)).
