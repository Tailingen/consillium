A Study of OL-101 Injection in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM)
This clinical trial aims to characterize the safety of OL-101 and establish the recommended dose for future research and to evaluate the efficacy of OL-101 (Dose expansion).
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: OL-101 infusion
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Adverse events will be assessed based on the CTCAE 5.0, Within 28 days post CAR-T infusion|Treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) incidence and severity, Adverse events will be assessed based on the CTCAE 5.0, From aphresis till 1 year after CAR-T infusion or start of a new anti-cancer therapy, whichever is earlier
Level of Immunogenicity, To assess the presence of antibodies to OL-101 (ADA), Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|Level of RCL, To determine whether Replication Competent Lentivirus (RCL) is present in patient that receive OL-101, Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|Overall response rate (ORR), Proportion of subjects with PR or above, Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate, Proportion of subjects with MRD negative status as defined by the IMWG response criteria, Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|Duration of response (DOR), The time from the initial response to therapy until the disease progression or relapse., Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from CAR-T cell infusion to the first assessment of disease progression or death from any cause., Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|Overall survival (OS), The time from CAR-T cell infusion to death from any cause., Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|Cmax of OL-101, The maximum concentration of the CAR-T cells will be measured to assess OL-101 in vivo expansion and persistence., Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|Tmax of OL-101, The time of the maximum concentration will be measured to assess OL-101 in vivo expansion and persistence., Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|AUC 0-28days of OL-101, Area under the curve will be measured to assess OL-101 in vivo expansion and persistence., Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|Serum cytokines, The levels of cytokines will be measured, such as IL-6 and ferritin., Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first|Serum soluble circulating BCMA (sBCMA), Serum soluble circulating BCMA will be measured to explore its potential relationship to response or resistance., Baseline until 2 years after CAR-T infusion or withdrawn from the study, whichever comes first
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of OL-101, a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy directed against B-Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) and G Protein-Coupled Receptor Class C Group 5 Member D (GPRC5D). This study is a single-arm, open-label, early exploratory clinical trial, conducted in two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion in adults with multiple myeloma. The trial begins with the dose-escalation phase that focus on safety and tolerability, with interval assessments for potential dose escalation or de-escalation. Recommended dose will be selected at the completion of the dose escalation stage in the dose expansion stage. The study aims to assess safety, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles, and efficacy.
