TAS-102 in ctDNA-defined Minimal Residual Disease in Colorectal Cancer After Completion of Adjuvant Chemotherapy
To measure the level of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of colorectal cancer patients after 6 months of receiving TAS-102 therapy. ctDNA is genetic material from tumor cells that can be found and measured in the blood.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: TAS-102
To determine the 6-month ctDNA clearance rate in colorectal cancer patients with minimal residual disease following 6 months of TAS-102 therapy., up to 6 months
Primary Objectives:

The primary objective is to determine the 6-month ctDNA clearance rate in colorectal cancer patients with minimal residual disease following 6 months of TAS-102 therapy.

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the 3-month ctDNA clearance rate in colorectal cancer patients with minimal residual disease.
* To determine the disease free survival (DFS) amongst colorectal cancer patients with minimal residual disease following 6 months of TAS-102 therapy.
* To determine the overall survival (OS) amongst colorectal cancer patients with minimal residual disease following 6 months of TAS-102 therapy.
* To determine the safety and tolerability of TAS-102 for the treatment of colorectal cancer patients with minimal residual disease.

Exploratory Objectives:

* To determine markers of response and resistance in archival tumor tissue including but not limited to immune profiles of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, expression of immune markers in tumor cells and microenvironment, and molecular markers (including but not limited to mutations, deletions, and/or amplifications or cancer molecular subtype)
* To determine changes in profiles of circulating lymphocytes and ctDNA with treatment
* To determine baseline characteristics in archival tumor and/or plasma that may predict clinical benefit
