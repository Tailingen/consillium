Study of Aranesp to Treat Anemia in Prostate Cancer Patients.
The purpose of this study is to see if darbepoetin alfa is an effective treatment for anemia in prostate cancer patients and, if so, what dose is most effective. Sometimes prostate cancer patients have low red blood cell counts (low hemoglobin) from various treatments they are receiving, such as chemotherapy. The red blood cells deliver oxygen to the tissue. This then helps give the patient more energy.

This study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Darbepoetin alfa, (also referred to as Aranesp or NESP), to assess what dose of NESP is required to treat anemia in prostate cancer patients, what the side effects of NESP are, and whether NESP will affect the patients' quality of life. NESP is approved by the FDA for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney failure and for the treatment of anemia in cancer patients who are receiving chemotherapy. It is considered experimental for the treatment of anemia in prostate cancer patients.
