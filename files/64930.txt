A Study in Participants With Acute Leukemia
This study is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, Phase 2 study of intravenous LY2090314 in participants with acute leukemia.
Leukemia
DRUG: LY2090314
Number of Participants With 1 or More Study Drug-Related Adverse Events (AEs) or Any Serious AEs (SAEs), Drug-related events were defined as treatment-emergent serious and other non-serious AEs that were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. A summary of serious and other non-serious AEs regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module., Baseline through study completion [Cycle 9 plus 30 days post last dose (21-day or 28 day cycles)]
Number of Participants With Best Response of Complete Response or Partial Response, The Revised International Working Group criteria were used to determine the response for participants with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Complete response, also known as complete remission (CR) included the following categories: Morphologic CR defined as \<5% blasts in an aspirate sample with marrow spicules and with a count of at least 200 nucleated cells, along with peripheral blood levels including platelets ≥100\*10\^9/Liter (L) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1\*10\^9/L, Morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), Cytogenetic CR, and Molecular CR. Partial response, also known as partial remission (PR) was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in blast count on the bone marrow aspirate. PR required all of the hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate., Baseline to progressive disease (up to Cycle 9, 21-day or 28 day cycles)|Percentage of Participants With Best Response of Complete Response or Partial Response, The Revised International Working Group criteria were used to determine the response for participants with AML. Complete response, also known as complete remission (CR) included the following categories: Morphologic CR defined as \<5% blasts in an aspirate sample with marrow spicules and with a count of at least 200 nucleated cells, along with peripheral blood levels including platelets ≥100\*10\^9/L and ANC ≥1\*10\^9/L, Morphologic CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), Cytogenetic CR, and Molecular CR. Partial response, also known as partial remission (PR) was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in blast count on the bone marrow aspirate. PR required all of the hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate. Percentage of participants=\[(number of participants with CR or PR)/(number of participants treated)\]\*100., Baseline to progressive disease (up to Cycle 9, 21-day or 28 day cycles)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to 8 Hours (h) Postdose [AUC(0-8)], AUC(0-8) was estimated from the plasma drug concentration time profile., Cycle 1: D1 and/or D9 and/or D15 [predose, 30 minutes (during infusion), up to 24 h after infusion started (1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 24 h)]|PK: AUC From Time 0 to Infinity [AUC(0-inf)], AUC(0-inf) was estimated from the plasma drug concentration time profile., Cycle 1: D1 and/or D9 and/or D15 [predose, 30 minutes (during infusion), up to 24 h after infusion started (1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 24 h)]|PK: Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Cmax is the maximum observed concentration estimated from the plasma drug concentration time profile., Cycle 1: D1 and/or D9 and/or D15 [predose, 30 minutes (during infusion), up to 24 h after infusion started (1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, and 24 h)]|Percent Change From Predose Beta (β)-Catenin Levels, Percent change=\[(β-catenin level postdose-predose level)/(predose β-catenin levels)\]\*100. Participants in Cohort 1 had β-catenin samples collected on Cycle 1: D1, D8, and D15, and Cycles 2 through 9: D1. Participants in Cohort 2 had β-catenin samples collected on Cycle 1: D1, D5, and D9 and Cycles 2 through 9: D1. Participants in Cohort 3 had β-catenin samples collected on Cycle 1: D1, D5, D9, and D12 and Cycles 2 through 9: D1., Cycle 1: D1 and D9 (predose, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 24 h after infusion started); Cycle 1: D5, D8, and D12 and C2 through C9: D1 (predose, 2 h after infusion started); Cycle 1: D15 (predose, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h after infusion started)|Number of Participants Who Died, The number of participants who died while on study treatment and the number of participants who died during the 30-day follow-up (30 days post last dose) are reported., Baseline through study completion [Cycle 9 plus 30 days post last dose (21-day or 28 day cycles)]
