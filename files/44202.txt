Correlation Between Preoperative Images of PPGL and Intraoperative Hemodynamics
This is a retrospective observational cohort study involving patients with suspected PPGLs who underwent 131I-MIBG scanning and surgical treatment between January 2020 and April 2023. The objective is to evaluate the correlation between MIBG imaging score and intraoperative hemodynamic fluctuations.

OTHER: Semiquantitative 131I-MIBG Scintigraphy Assessment
Difference of SBP ARV and MAP ARV in Different Groups, Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated with the formula: MAP=1/3\*SBP+2/3\*DBP. ARV, which was defined as the average of absolute difference between successive BP values, Intraoperative systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were recorded automatically in a 5 min interval from the beginning to the end of surgery.
