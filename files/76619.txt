Effects of Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy on Muscle Function
This is a pilot study designed to examine changes in muscle function after Aromatase Inhibitor (AI) therapy, at both the molecular and clinical level.
Breast Cancer|Breast Cancer Female
Changes in calstabin1 binding to RyR1 channels in skeletal muscle, Changes in calstabin1 binding to RyR1 channels in skeletal muscle of breast cancer patients pre and post exposure to adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy, through day 168 of aromatase inhibitor therapy
Changes in ryanodine receptor/calcium release channel (RyR1) oxidation in skeletal muscle, To estimate changes in RyR1 oxidation in skeletal muscle of breast cancer patients, pre- and post- exposure to adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy, through day 168 of aromatase inhibitor therapy|Relationship between changes in RyR1 biochemistry and measures of muscle function, To explore the relationship between changes in RyR1 biochemistry and measures of muscle function, including muscle power as measured by isokinetic dynamometry, through day 168 of aromatase inhibitor therapy|Relationship between markers of bone turnover and changes in RyR1 biochemistry, To explore the relationship between markers of bone turnover and changes in RyR1 biochemistry (calstabin binding to RyR1), through day 168 of aromatase inhibitor therapy|Relationship between markers of bone turnover and changes in muscle function, To explore the relationship between markers of bone turnover and changes in muscle function in terms of muscle power assessed by isokinetic dynamometry, through day 168 of aromatase inhibitor therapy|Characterize the timing of development of muscle dysfunction following initiation of aromatase inhibitor therapy, To better characterize the timing of development of muscle dysfunction following initiation of aromatase inhibitor therapy, in terms muscle power measured by isokinetic dynamometry, through day 168 of aromatase inhibitor therapy|Feasibility of repeated muscle biopsies in patients with early stage breast cancer initiating aromatase inhibitor therapy, 5.
