Measurement and Characterization of Circulating Endothelial Cells or Circulating Tumor Cells or Circulating DNA in Adult Patients With Metastatic Cancer
Monitoring of circulating endothelial cells (CEC and mature cells called progenitors called CEP) or circulating tumor cells (CTC) in adult patients with metastatic cancer, possibly treated with targeted therapy.
Metastatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: Blood samples
Measurement and characterization of CEC and CEP and circulaing DNA rate using flow cytometry, Measurement and characterization of initial CEC and CEP circulaing DNA and their evolution under treatment, up to 2 years
Monitoring of circulating endothelial cells (CEC and mature cells called progenitors called CEP) or circulating tumor cells (CTC) in adult patients with metastatic cancer, possibly treated with targeted therapy.
