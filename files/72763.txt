Molecular Detection of Advanced Neoplasia in Pancreatic Cysts
Researchers are trying to find out whether new tests ("biomarkers") of blood, stool, pancreas cyst fluid, or pancreas juice can be used to diagnose malignant or pre-malignant changes in pancreas cysts.
Pancreas Cyst
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood, stool, pancreatic juice and cyst fluid collection|PROCEDURE: Pancreatic Surgery|PROCEDURE: Endoscopy Exam
Biospecimen Acquisition, Number of biospecimens collected, 5 years|High grade dysplasia (HGD) or cancer diagnosis in Immediate Surgery group, To validate the diagnostic accuracy of cyst fluid methylated DNA marker (MDM) assays for detection of HGD and cancer in pancreatic cysts undergoing surgical resection, 5 years
High grade dysplasia (HGD) or cancer diagnosis in clinical follow up group, To evaluate the performance of cyst fluid MDM assays for predicting development of HGD or cancer during 3-year follow-up in study patients who are initially managed non-operatively, 5 years
Subjects with Fukuoka Worrisome (FW) or Fukuoka High Risk (FHR) pancreatic cysts will be enrolled and assigned to Immediate Surgery or Clinical Follow-up groups based on clinical management as determined by the treating physicians. Blood, stool, pancreas cyst fluid, and pancreas juice specimens will be collected from participants.
