Phase I Study MR-guided SBRT to PCa
1) investigate the feasibility, tolerance, and safety of dose escalation via MR-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy and simultaneous integrated boost to the dominant intraprostatic lesions (DILs), 2) to assess the feasibility of DIL visualization based on multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI), and 3) to characterize longitudinal changes in imaging characteristics and identify urinary biomarkers for treatment response prediction
Low or Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: MR guided Linear Accelerator
Determine the maximum tolerated dose to DILs until dose limiting toxicity (>=3 grade 3 GI/GU toxicity) is observed or if maximum dose level is reached, The study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility to employ a simultaneous integrated boost to MRI detected dominant intraprostatic lesion(s) during SBRT, 2 years
Quality of Life measures using the Epic questionnaire, Dose and volume data will be collected and correlated with treatment-related side effects and quality of life data., 2 years
