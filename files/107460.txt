Efficacy of Platinum-based Chemotherapy in Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer) (EPITOC)
This is a phase II/III randomized controlled trial to evaluate efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy vs conventionally prescribed non-platinum monochemotherapy in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer

Recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) is usually subdivided to platinum-sensitive (platinum-free interval \[PFI\] â‰¥6 mo.) and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer \[PROC\] (PFI \<6 mo.) subtypes. Prognosis for the latter group is dismal and current guidelines recommend treating these patients with non-platinum based chemotherapy. However, the evidence behind this is quite unconvincing and according to recent data patients with non-platinum refractory platinum-resistant ovarian cancer could derive benefit from platinum rechallenge. This trial is designed for head-to-head comparison of platinum and non-platinum therapy efficacy in treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
