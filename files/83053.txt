Single Incision Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery
Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is the further development of the concept of minimally invasive surgery for colorectal cancer,which rapidly developed in the field of colorectal surgery. Through the development of single hole laparoscopic colorectal cancer radical surgery and clinical study and follow up accordingly, evaluating the feasibility, surgical effectiveness and economy help to promote the popularization and application of single hole laparoscopic techniques in the field.
Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery
PROCEDURE: single incision laparoscopic surgery|PROCEDURE: conventional laparoscopic surgery
Early morbidity rate, morbidity rate 30 days after surgery, 30 days
Operative time, Operative time（minutes）, intraoperative|Intraoperative blood loss, Estimated blood loss（milliliters，ml）, intraoperative|Incision length, Incision length（centimeters，cm）, intraoperative|Lymph node detection, Lymph nodes harvested（numbers）, 14 days after surgery|Incisal margin, Length of proximal and distal margin （centimeters，cm）, 14 days after surgery|Tumor size, The diameter of tumors（centimeters，cm）, 14 days after surgery|Length of stay, Duration of hospital stay（days after surgery）, 1-14 days after surgery|Postoperative recovery course, Time to first ambulation, flatus, liquid diet and soft diet （hours after surgery）, 1-14 days after surgery|Pain score, Postoperative pain is recorded using the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score （0-10 points）tool on postoperative day 1, 2, 3 and the day of discharge, 1-3 days after surgery|3-year disease free survival rate, 3-year disease free survival rate, 36 months after surgery|5-year overall survival rate, 5-year overall survival rate, 60 months after surgery
The patients with colorectal cancer will randomly divided into single incision laparoscopic surgery group and conditional laparoscopic surgery group. The operation time, blood loss, the incidence of lymph node , the number of postoperative complications, the gastrointestinal function recovery time, postoperative hospital stay，the number of local recurrence and distant metastasis, survival rate and the total cost of hospitalization will be evaluated to confirm the feasibility of single incision laparoscopic surgery is effective and economical. It is worthy of clinical application.
