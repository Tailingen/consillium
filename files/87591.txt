Concurrent Cisplatin Chemoradiation With or Without Capecitabine as Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Local Advanced High Risk Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: Randomized Control Clinical Trial
This is an randomized controlled, multicenter clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate acute toxicity and efficacy of concurrent cisplatin chemoradiation with or without capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy in local advanced high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
