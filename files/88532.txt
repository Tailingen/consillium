Phase IIT Trial of SNA014
68Ga labeled Claudin 18.2 contrast agent combined with PET/CT for gastric or gastroesophageal junction
Adenocarcinoma of the Stomach|Adenocarcinoma of GE Junction|Pancreatic Cancer Stage
DRUG: [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-SNA014
Biological distribution characteristics, Evaluate the biological distribution characteristics of important organs in the subjects.

* Draw the Volume of Interest (VOI) of the subject's vital organs and calculate the Percentage of Injected Activity (IA) of the vital organs
* Using PMOD software, manually draw regions of interest (VOI) on PET/CT images of the liver, spleen, normal stomach, heart, bone marrow, kidneys, and other areas to obtain the cumulative radioactive activity of these regions. Divide the cumulative radioactive activity by the injection dose to obtain the percentage of injection activity (% IA)., 1week|Safety tolerance characteristics, AE/SAE/SUSAR, hrough study completion, an average of 1 year
Metabolic Dynamics Evaluation and Radiation Dose, Detect the radiation dose of whole blood and serum of the subjects, and calculate the absorbed dose of important organs, 1 day
Exploring the targeting ability of CLDN18.2, Correlation analysis between PET/CT imaging features of target lesions (SUVmax, SUV mean, target to body ratio, etc.) and CLDN18.2IHC expression level (if any), 1month
