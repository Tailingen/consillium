Psychoeducational Intervention for Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study aims to refine and pilot test HARMONY, a psychoeducational intervention for patients with newly diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Cirrhosis
BEHAVIORAL: HARMONY|OTHER: Enhanced usual care
Feasibility: enrollment rate, ≥50% enrollment among consecutive eligible patients, 12 weeks|Feasibility: retention rate, ≥50% retention over the 12-week study, 12 weeks
Acceptability, ≥75% of patients reporting Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 scores above the midpoint score of 20 on a scale from 8-32 (higher scores indicate higher satisfaction), 12 weeks
There are two parts of this study. Study Part 1 is an open pilot study to refine HARMONY prior to larger-scale testing in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) setting. Study Part 1 is purely descriptive, as the investigators will use the data to refine HARMONY before proceeding to Study Part 2.

Study Part 2 is a pilot RCT to assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a randomized trial of HARMONY versus enhanced usual care. Participants will complete a baseline survey and then be randomized to HARMONY versus enhanced usual care (a supportive care resource guide). This record reflects the clinical trial component (Study Part 2), as feasibility and acceptability outcomes will be collected for this phase only.
