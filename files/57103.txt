Liposomal Irinotecan Based FOLFIRI With Bevacizumab in First-line Treatment of Advanced Colorectal Cancer
The goal of this prospective clinical trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of irinotecan liposomes for first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. The primary endpoint is Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1. The secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR) and safety based on NCI-CTCAE 5.0
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFIRI+Bevacizumab
Objective Response Rate（ORR）, The proportion of participants in the analyzed population who developed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, up to 2.5 years
Overall Survival（OS）, From the time of patient admission to the time of subject's death, at the end of the study, if the subject is still alive, the last known date of subject's survival is the deletion date, up to 2.5 years|Progression Free Survival（PFS）, Time from patient admission to first radiographic disease progression (RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death (whichever occurs first), up to 2.5 years|Disease Control Rate（DCR）, The proportion of subjects in the analyzed population who achieved CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, up to 2.5 years
