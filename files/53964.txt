Trial Comparing Radical Radiotherapy to Prostate Only VS Prostate And Pelvic Lymph Nodes in Intermediate And High Risk Prostate Cancer
This phase II randomized controlled study aims to compare the treatment results of intermediate and high risk prostate cancer patients treated with hormonal therapy and radical radiotherapy with or without pelvic lymph nodes in NCI- Cairo University.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Prostate Only Radiation|RADIATION: Prostate and Pelvic Lymph Node Radiation
Acute toxicity, Compare Acute toxicity between the 2 arms using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) acute morbidity scoring criteria., 90 days post the end of radiation therapy|Local Control, Compare Local control (LC) with minimum follow up of 1 year in both groups, 1 year
Biochemical free survivals (BFS), Biochemical free survivals (BFS) with minimum follow up of 1 year in both groups., 1 year|Late toxicity, Compare Late toxicity (using RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Toxicity Scale), 1 year|Overall survival (OS), Compare overall survival in the study population, 1 year
Study Design :

Phase II prospective randomized trial with 2 arms • Prostate Only (Arm A)

Hypofractionated Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to the prostate only to dose of 60Gy/20fractions (3 Gy per fraction)

• Prostate \& Pelvic Lymph Nodes (Arm B)

Hypofractionated Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with elective pelvic nodes irradiation up to 44Gy/20 fractions (2.2 Gy per fraction) with a Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) to the prostate to dose of 60Gy/20fractions (3 Gy per fraction)
