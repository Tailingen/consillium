The Effect of Ganglion Sphenopalatine Block Versus Placebo on Persistent Headache Following COVID-19 Infection
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the ganglion sphenopalatine block (SPG block) on persistent headache following acute COVID-19 infection.
Headache|Covid19|Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block|Persistent Headache Following COVID-19
PROCEDURE: Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block with Local Anesthetic|PROCEDURE: Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block with Placebo (Isotone NaCl)|PROCEDURE: "Sham"-block with Placebo (Isotone NaCl)
Hyperactivity in the sphenopalatine ganglion assessed by pain intensity (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS) of the postdural headache in standing position in the group Ropivacine-Lidocaine and "sham"., Pain intensity will be measured as worst experienced pain after the patient has been standing for 30 seconds or the worst experienced pain while attempting to stand if the rating has to be interrupted., 30 minutes after block
Number of patients with pain rating below 30mm in standing position (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS), Pain intensity measured as worst experienced pain after the patient has been standing for 30 seconds or the worst experienced pain while attempting to stand if the rating has to be interrupted., 30 minutes and 1 week after block|Worst experienced pain in standing position (0-10 on a numercial rating scale, NRS), The worst experienced pain reported during the week following the block as registered by the patient., During study period until completion of 1 week follow up|Average pain intensity (0-10 on a numercial rating scale, NRS), The average pain intensity reported during the week following the block as registered by the patient., During study period until completion of 1 week follow up|Number of patients needing "rescue GSP-block", If the patient at the 1 week follow up still needs further treatment a "rescue SPG-block" defined as a new SPG-block with "open label" analgetics will be offered., At 1 week follow up|Hyperactivity in the sphenopalatine ganglion assessed by pain intensity (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS) of the postdural headache in standing position in all 3 groups., Pain intensity will be measured as worst experienced pain after the patient has been standing for 30 seconds or the worst experienced pain while attempting to stand if the rating has to be interrupted., 30 minutes after block
Analgesics used daily in the week following the SPG-block, The use of analgesics during the week following the block as registered by the patient and the patient file., During study period until completion of 1 week follow up
Adult patients with persistent headache following COVID-19 infection will be enrolled in the study. The patients will be randomised into three groups; bilateral SPG-block withto receive local anesthetic (lidocaine + ropivacaine), bilateral SPG-block with placebo (isotone NaCl) or bilateral "sham"-block with placebo (isotone NaCl).

Primary outcome is hyperactivity in the sphenopalatine ganglion assessed by pain intensity (0-100mm on a visual analogue scale, VAS) of the headache in standing position 30 minutes after block in the group Ropicavain-Lidocain and "sham".
