A Prospective Multi-center Study on Using Sonazoid Diagnose Early Stage Endometrial Cancer
Sonazoid as a new generation of ultrasound contrast agent.This study based on the features of Sonazoid specific angiography and higher mechanical index, the role of Sonazoid in the early diagnosis of Endometrial carcinoma was explored.
Endometrial Carcinoma Stage I
DRUG: Perflubutane Microspheres for Injection
Diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in endometrial cancer by Sonazoid., Pathology as a gold standard, to observe the diagnostic performance of Sonazoid in endometrial tumor:a prospective multicenter study based on quantitative and qualitative analysis., 10 months
Sonazoid is a second generation ultrasound contrast agent, which is composed of microbubbles containing chemically stable and insoluble Perfluorobutane (PFB) gas and a hard shell of phosphatidylserine sodium (2-3 Î¼ m in diameter) wrapped in the outer layer. These microbubbles can generate stable nonlinear oscillations in a low-power acoustic field and generate echoes at the second harmonic frequency of the transmitted pulse for enhanced contrast harmonic imaging.

Because Sonazoid has the advantages of ultra long time development and good stability, Sonazoid has significant clinical advantages in the diagnosis of not focal liver lesions(FLLs) but breast tumor and other organ. However, there is no study based on contrast enhanced ultrasound(CEUS) using Sonazoid in early detection of Endometrial carcinoma. Therefore, based on the advantages of the new ultrasound contrast agent, using qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis method to collect large samples, compared with diagnosis results of standard reference, which has important clinical significance for early diagnosis, early detection and improving the accuracy of diagnosis of Endometrial carcinoma.
