Immune Reconstitution After Allo-HSCT and Blinatumomab
The goal of this observation study is to test in relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R ALL) patients undergoing allogeneic hemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The main question it aims to answer is:

• Effect of post-transplant blinatumomab treatment on immune reconstitution after transplantation.

Participants will undergo immune repertoire sequencing(IR-SEQ) before blinatumomab treatment, 6 months and 1 year after transplantation.

Researchers will compare patients who don't receive blinatumomab treatment after transplantation to see if TCR or BCR expression differs.
