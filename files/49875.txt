OriCAR-017 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) Modified T Cells for the Treatment of R/RMM
An open label, dose exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of OriCAR-017 in R/RMM
Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: OriCAR-017
Maximum tolerated dose of OriCAR-017-P1, The MTD is defined as the highest dose with an observed incidence of DLT in no more than one out of six patients treated at a particular dose level., Up to 28 days|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), tolerability, Up to 28 days
Objective Response Rate, Objective response is defined as the participants with a partial response (PR) or better by the RECIST1.1 criteria., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause or withdraw, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 Years|Pharmacokinetics (the number of cell copies and cell persistence duration in peripheral blood), CAR-GPRC5D DNA in peripheral blood detected by q-PCR at each visit after infusion, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause or withdraw, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years|Antitumor efficacy-Progression-free survival (PFS), The period from the day when the subject receives the infusion of cells to the first recorded tumor progression, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years|Antitumor efficacy-Duration of response (DOR), The period from the first evaluation of sCR or CR or VGPR or PR or MR to the first evaluation of PD or death of any cause, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years|Long term survival follow up, The period from randomization until the date of death, From date of randomization until the date of first documented date of death from any cause, assessed up to 15 years
This is a Phase I and Phase II, open-label, multi-center study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of GPRC5D directed chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells injection (OriCAR-017) in n patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiplemyeloma (R/RMM).
