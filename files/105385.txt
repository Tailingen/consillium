HRSN screening reach (Part 1), Determining the perception of the proportion of patients at clinics who are screened for health related social needs (HRSN)., From study enrollment to approximately 4 and 16 weeks post initial study training|Barriers and facilitators influencing HRSN screening implementation, Synthesize themes to create a list of barriers and facilitators influencing HRSN screening implementation within high-implementation clinics, moderate-implementation clinics, and low-implementation clinics., From study enrollment to time completion of key informant interviews, approximately within 6 months|Generation of a tailored implementation plan for each participating clinic, Generation (defined for each clinic as completed or not completed) of a tailored implementation plan for each participating clinic in Part 3 that includes (1) adaptations to current HRSN screening and follow-up processes, and (2) potential implementation strategies to enhance HRSN screening implementation., Between time of clinic selection and co-design workshop completion, to be no more than 6 months
The primary objective of this study is to assess current processes around health related social needs (HRSN) screening among NCORP clinics and categorize clinics based on their implementation of HRSN screening. The primary endpoint will be a detailed understanding of current processes, with attention to variability by key clinic characteristics.

There are 3 parts of the study in which participants can participate in one or all parts (3 total).

Part 1: Participants attend training, complete clinic assessments and observations and may complete an interview on study.

Part 2: Identified clinic staff will be interviewed to discuss factors that influence HRSN screening at their clinic and help develop generalized guidance.

Part 3: Participants attend a co-design workshop and complete surveys on study feasibility.
