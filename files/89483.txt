Interactive Computer Program or Brochure in Increasing Colorectal Cancer Screening Among African Americans
RATIONALE: An interactive computer program may be more effective than a brochure in increasing colorectal cancer screening among African Americans.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying an interactive computer program to see how well it works compared with a brochure in increasing colorectal cancer screening among African Americans.
Colorectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Non-tailored CRC screening brochure|BEHAVIORAL: Interactive computer intervention
Self-reported colorectal cancer (CRC) screening adherence with medical record verification of screening test completion, 6 and 15 months post-intervention
Self-reported CRC discussion and screening test recommendation from provider on intervention/clinic visit date, Discussion of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT), colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy is assessed. Participants report on whether or not an FOBT kit was given to them during this visit. Additionally, participants report on whether or not someone in the doctor's office made an appointment for a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy., 1 week post-intervention|Provider documentation of CRC discussion and screening test recommendation on intervention/clinic visit date, Medical record documentation of discussion of FOBT, providing participant with an FOBT kit, discussion and/or ordering a colonoscopy, and discussion and/or ordering a sigmoidoscopy is assessed., 1 week post-intervention|Self-reported CRC health beliefs, Changes in perceived risk, benefits to screening, barriers to screening, and self-efficacy for CRC screening are assessed., Pre-intervention (baseline),1 week post-intervention, and 6 months post-intervention|Self-reported stage of CRC screening test adoption, For FOBT, colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy, stage of adoption measured as either precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, or maintenance., Pre-intervention (baseline),1 week post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention, and 15 months post-intervention
Patient characteristics as CRC screening predictors, Age, gender, marital status, education, health literacy, income, employment, insurance coverage, BMI, co-morbidities, family history of cancer, family or friend encouragement to have CRC screening, CRC knowledge, physician trust, fatalism views, and health temporal orientation are assessed., Pre-intervention (baseline), intervention date, 1 week post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention, and/or 15 months post-intervention|Clinic variables as CRC screening predictors, Clinic site, participant's reason for health care provider visit, and prior recommendation(s) to do CRC screening are assessed., Pre-intervention (baseline), 1 week post-intervention, 6 months post-intervention, and 15 months post-intervention
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare rates of participation in fecal occult blood testing and endoscopic screening (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) among African-Americans who receive an interactive computer intervention (ICI) versus a non-tailored colorectal cancer screening brochure.
* Examine mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness as depicted in the conceptual model.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Participants are stratified according to site, age (â‰¤ 65 years old vs \> 65 years old) and gender. Participants are randomized to one of two arms.

* Arm I (non-tailored colorectal cancer screening brochure): Participants undergo a baseline interview via telephone and receive a colorectal cancer screening brochure in the clinic prior to visit with healthcare provider. Participants then undergo telephone interviews at 1 week, 6 months, and 15 months.
* Arm II (interactive computer intervention \[ICI\]): Participants undergo a baseline interview via telephone and complete an ICI in the clinic prior to visit with healthcare provider. Participants then undergo telephone interviews at 1 week, 6 months, and 15 months.
