Expression of S100A2 and Trefoil Factor Family Members in Epstein-Barr Virus Related Gastric Cancer
The investigators hypothesize that aberrant hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes is an important mechanism for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) - related gastric carcinogenesis, the promoter hypermethylation status and the expression of S100A2 and TFF1 might be different between EBV-associated gastric cancer (GC) and non EBV-associated GC.
