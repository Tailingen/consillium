A Study to Evaluate Serum Testosterone Levels in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the serum testosterone levels in patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer on SoluMatrix™ Abiraterone Acetate as Compared to Abiraterone Acetate
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Zytiga® (Abiraterone Acetate)|DRUG: SoluMatrix™ (Abiraterone Acetate)
Testosterone Levels, Blood Sample tested for Serum Testosterone Levels, Average of Day 9 and 10
PSA Levels, All patients randomized to one of the two treatment groups, round about level of PSA.

These were assessed only at the said Outcome Measure Time Frame. No additional time points to the said endpoint, Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84|Percent of Subjects With PSA-50 Response, Proportion of patients with complete suppression of PSA-50 were reported by treatment and compared for between-group differences.

These were assessed only at the said Outcome Measure Time Frame. No additional time points to the said endpoint., Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84|Serum Testosterone Levels, These were assessed only at the said Outcome Measure Time Frame. No additional time points to the said endpoint., Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84|Steady State Trough Concentration of Arbiraterone, These were assessed only at the said Outcome Measure Time Frame. No additional time points to the said endpoint., Day 09, Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84|AUC (0-inf), Steady state systemic exposure parameters, 60 to 30 minutes prior to dosing and over 24 Hours post-dose|AUC (0-24 hr), Blood samples for pre-dose PK profiling were to be collected approximately 45 minutes before dosing, i.e., within 60 to 30 minutes prior to dosing. Post-dose blood samples were to be collected throughout the day at the times (15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hr, 1.5 hr, 2.0 hr 3 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, 9 hr, 24 hr)., 60 to 30 minutes prior to dosing and over 24 Hours post-dose|AUC (0-t), Blood samples for pre-dose PK profiling were to be collected approximately 45 minutes before dosing, i.e., within 60 to 30 minutes prior to dosing. Post-dose blood samples were to be collected throughout the day at the times (15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hr, 1.5 hr, 2.0 hr 3 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, 9 hr, 24 hr)., 60 to 30 minutes prior to dosing and over 24 Hours post-dose|Cmax, Blood samples for pre-dose PK profiling were to be collected approximately 45 minutes before dosing, i.e., within 60 to 30 minutes prior to dosing. Post-dose blood samples were to be collected throughout the day at the times (15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hr, 1.5 hr, 2.0 hr 3 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 8 hr, 9 hr, 24 hr)., 60 to 30 minutes prior to dosing and over 24 Hours post-dose
This was a 12-week, open-label study of abiraterone acetate in at least 50 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
