Study of Panobinostat in Combination With Sorafenib in Kidney, Soft Tissue or Lung Cancers
The purpose of this study is to determine if a new investigational drug called Panobinostat is safe, tolerable and to obtain an initial assessment of efficacy, when given in combination with Sorafenib for the treatment of certain types of lung cancer, kidney cancer and soft tissue sarcoma.
Renal Cancer|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)|Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Panobinostat (LBH589), Sorafenib
Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD)for LBH 589 in combination with Sorafenib and establish a recommended phase 2 dose for each drug combination, Point in time when no more than 1 of 6 patients has a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in cycle 1
Evaluate the safety profile of LGB589 in combination with sorafenib, including DLTs, During the first treatment period (i.e. 28 days) or toxicity similar to DLT after the initial 28-day treatment period|Observe evidence of anti-cancer efficacy estimates of the combination in the tarted expanded cohorts., Evaluation of disease & re-evaluation for response
