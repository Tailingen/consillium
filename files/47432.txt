A Study of Niraparib in Combination With Abemaciclib for Late Line Treatment of Ovarian Cancer (NICHOL TRIAL)
This is an interventional trial. The goal of this clinical trial is dose finding. There are two phases: phase Ib to determine the MTD and recommended phase II dose of niraparib in combination with abemaciclib in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.

Target population will be patients (woman, age \> 18 years) with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer treated with at least 2 lines of therapy.

dose finding, This is a dose-escalation study of niraparib plus abemaciclib followed by an efficacy study for late-line treatment of ovarian cancer, 18 months|dose finding, phase Ib clinical trial, Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of niraparib in combination with abemaciclib in patients with advanced ovarian cancer defined as the dose level immediately below the dose at which â‰¥ 33% of patients experience dose-limiting toxicity as defined by protocol according to CTCAE 5.0, From enrollment to the end of phase 1|PART II: Disease control rate at 16 weeks (DCR16wks):, proportion of patients whose disease shrinks (i.e. complete or partial response) or remains stable over 16 weeks after the start of niraparib + abemaciclib combination. Revised RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used to assess tumor response, From enrollment of first patient of part II to to the 16-week-radiologic assessment of last patient
