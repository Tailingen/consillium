Two Different Methods of Collecting Stem Cells For an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Treating Patients With Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma
RATIONALE: It is not yet known which method of stem cell collection is best for patients undergoing an autologous stem cell transplant.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing two different methods of collecting stem cells in patients undergoing stem cell transplant for diffuse large cell lymphoma.
Lymphoma
PROCEDURE: autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|PROCEDURE: leukapheresis
Median Progression-free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of infusion to disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause. Patients alive without disease progression or relapse were censored at their last disease evaluation or at their secondary primary cancer diagnosis, whichever occurred first. Criteria for Relapsed Disease: Appearance of any new lesion or increase by ≥50% in the size of previously involved sites, ≥50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously identified node \>1.0 cm in its short axis or in the sum of the products of diameters (SPD) of more than one node. Criteria for Progressive Disease: ≥50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node or ALC for partial remissions or non-responders, Appearance of any new lesion (≥ 2x2 cm). A log rank test was used to assess whether PFS differed with respect to apheresis collection method., Date of infusion to disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months post enrollment.
Progression-free Survival Rate at 1 Year, Progression-free survival rate (percentage) at one year is defined as 100 times the number of patients who have not progressed, relapsed and/or died divided by the total number of evaluable patients in each arm. Criteria for Relapsed Disease: Appearance of any new lesion or increase by ≥50% in the size of previously involved sites, ≥50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously identified node \>1.0 cm in its short axis or in the SPD of more than one node. Criteria for Progressive Disease: ≥50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node or ALC for partial remissions or non-responders, Appearance of any new lesion (≥ 2x2 cm)., Date of infusion to disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause, up to one year|Progression-free Survival Rate at 2 Years, Progression-free survival rate (percentage) at two years is defined as 100 times the number of patients who have not progressed, relapsed and/or died divided by the total number of evaluable patients in each arm. Criteria for Relapsed Disease: Appearance of any new lesion or increase by ≥50% in the size of previously involved sites, ≥50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously identified node \>1.0 cm in its short axis or in the SPD of more than one node. Criteria for Progressive Disease: ≥50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously identified abnormal node or ALC for partial remissions or non-responders, Appearance of any new lesion (≥ 2x2 cm)., Date of infusion to disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause, up to two years|One-year Overall Survival Rate, Overall survival (OS) was defined at the time from infusion to death from any cause. The one-year OS rate is defined as the percentage of patients who are still alive after one year. A log rank test was used to assess whether OS differed with respect to apheresis collection method., date of infusion to death from any cause, up to one year|Median Time to Absolute Lymphocyte Count Engraftment, The time to absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) engraftment will be evaluated and compared between the two arms, where time to ALC engraftment is defined as the time from transplant to the time they achieve ALC \> 500., Up to 30 days after autologous peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|Median Number of CD34 Cells/kg Infused, Five (5) to seven (7) days after patient received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and reached a peripheral CD34 count of 10 cells/microliter or greater, stem cell collection began. Apheresis collections were to be performed daily. At least 2 x 10\^6 CD34 cells/kg were to be collected. Additional collections were at the discretion of the transplantation team. The median number of CD34 cells/kg infused are reported for each arm below., 5 to 7 days after patient received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and reached a peripheral CD34 count of 10 cells/microliter or greater
Evaluation and Comparison of Immunologic Recovery Within and Between the Arms by Assessing the Quantitative and Functional Immune Effector Cells (T, B, or NK Cells) From the Apheresis Product, Evaluation and comparison of immunologic recovery within and between the arms by assessing the quantitative and functional immune effector cells (T, B, or NK cells) from the apheresis product, Baseline
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the therapeutic effect of instrument-driven lymphocyte enrichment of the autograft absolute lymphocyte count (A-ALC) compared to "standard autograft collection" as determined by progression-free survival post-transplantation.

Secondary

* Determine the profile of immune effector cells of the "lymphocyte enriched autograft" vs "standard autograft" and peripheral blood after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and their impact on post- ASCT immunological reconstitution and clinical endpoints.
* Perform quantitative and functional analysis of T, B, NK, and dendritic cells from the apheresis product and peripheral blood samples at multiple timepoints after transplantation.
* Determine and compare the proportion of patients who are progression-free and alive at 1 and 2 years.
* Determine the differences in overall survival between the two collection method arms.
* Evaluate and characterize differences in transplantation outcomes (e.g., time to ALC engraftment, incidence of infection, and the CD34 count) between the two collection method arms.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to baseline International Prognostic Factor (≥ 2 factors vs \< 2 factors) and PET scan findings prior to transplantation (positive vs negative). Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) alone or G-CSF and sargramostim (GM-CSF) daily for stem cell mobilization. Once the peripheral CD34-positive cell count reaches ≥ 10/μL, patients undergo stem cell collection. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms for standard autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).

* Immunologic autograft engineering: Patients' stem cells are collected according to modified Amicus settings (i.e., MNC OFFSET = 0.0 and RBC = 7.0). Patients undergo ASCT IV on the day of apheresis (lymphocyte enriched autograft).
* Standard autograft collection: Patients' stem cells are collected according to standard Amicus settings (i.e., MNC OFFSET = 1.5 and RBC OFFSET = 5.0). Patients undergo ASCT IV on the day of apheresis.

Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for immunological studies. Samples are analyzed for immunophenotyping of immune cell subsets via multicolor flow cytometry, immunoglobulin reconstitution, and functional T-cell immunity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at day 15 post ASCT and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
