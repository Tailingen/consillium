Prognostic Value of Circulating Tumor DNA Dosing in Patients in Neoadjuvant Breast Neoplasia
This is a cohort, single-center, prospective study that seeks to analyze the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients diagnosed with breast cancer, who will undergo neoadjuvant treatment.
Breast Neoplasm
OTHER: ctDNA level during neoadjuvant chemotherapy
The concentration of circulating DNA(ctDNA), Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels will be measured each 15 days until end of neoadjuvant therapy, through peripheral blood collection, From date of enrollment until the date of end of neoadjuvant treatment, assessed up to 6-7 months
Change from baseline ctDNA alterations to end of neoadjuvant treatment, The percentage of patients with ctDNA alterations will be provided over time of neoadjuvant treatment to characterize the biological evolution of the disease in each patient. The association of these alterations with clinical outcomes will also be provided., Up to approximately 7 months starting from Baseline until end of neoadjuvant treatment
Breast cancer is a major public health problem, being the most common cancer in women worldwide. Breast cancer can be diagnosed through multiple tests, including an imaging and tissue biopsy. However, accurate assessment and prediction of the response is a major challenge. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has shown promise in the detection of breast cancer and clinical and cancer outcomes.

This study aims to evaluate a possible correlations between ctDNA levels with the pathological complete response and detection of residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer.

In order to start ctDNA surveillance, patients will be asked to participate in blood draws, every 15 days, during neoadjuvant standard institutional treatment and allow study staff to review medical records.
