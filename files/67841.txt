Comparing Multicomponent and Aerobic Training: Impact on Fitness, Psychological and Quality of Life Parameters in Cancer Survivors Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate if a multicomponent training program (MCT), including aerobic and resistance exercises, or an aerobic training program (AT) can improve physiological, physical fitness, mental well-being, and quality of life in cancer survivors currently stabilized. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does MCT or AT improve physiological parameters, physical fitness, mental well-being, and overall quality of life compared to a waitlist control group (WLCG)? Does MCT provide superior physiological an psychological improvements compared to AT?

Researchers will compare:

MCT (a combination of aerobic, mobility, and resistance training exercises) AT (an aerobic-solo training) to see if these interventions improve fitness, health, psychological and quality of life outcomes compared to WLCG (participants not engaging in structured physical activity during the study), and if there will be significant differences between MCT and AT .

Participants will:

Complete assessments of anthropometric, physical fitness, and psychological parameters at baseline (T0) and after 24 weeks (T1).

Be randomly assigned to one of three groups (MCT, AT, or WLCG).

Engage in a 24-week structured training program (MCT or IMCT) supervised by exercise professionals, including:

Warm-up sessions (10 minutes, low-intensity walking). Main sessions (40 minutes): aerobic, mobility, resistance (MCT), only-aerobic (AT) exercises.

Cool-down sessions (10 minutes): breathing and stretching exercises.

This study will provide insights into the efficacy of tailored physical activity interventions for stabilized Cancer survivors.

OTHER: Multicomponent Training Protocol|OTHER: Aerobic Training Protocol
Change in Body body fat percentage, Body fat percentage assessed throught the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA):

Body fat percentage (in %)

The procedure involves sending a low-level electrical current through the body and measuring resistance.

Interpretation:

Higher body fat percentage indicates more fat., 24-weeks|Change in Body Water, Body water content assessed throught the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA):

Total body water (in %)

The procedure involves sending a low-level electrical current through the body and measuring resistance.

Interpretation:

Higher total body water suggests better hydration., 24-weeks|Change in Muscle Mass, muscle mass assessed throught the Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA):

Muscle mass (in kg)

The procedure involves sending a low-level electrical current through the body and measuring resistance.

Interpretation:

Higher muscle mass suggests better muscle development., 24-weeks|Change in lower body strength, 30-s chair stand (30CST) test: Sit-to-stand from a chair during 30 seconds (measured in seconds), 24-weeks|Change in functional mobility, Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test (measured in seconds), 24-weeks|Change in Handrigp Strength, Handgrip Strength (HGS) test: muscle strength measured with manual dynamometers (Kgf), 24-weeks|Change in aerobic capacity, 2-Minute Step Test (TMST): march in place for 2 minutes, lifting their knees to a height halfway between the iliac crest and the patella.The number of full knee lifts (repetitions) completed in 2 minutes is recorded., 24-weeks|Change in lower body flexibility, Chair Sit-and-Reach Test: measures lower body flexibility (hamstrings and lower back) in centimeters (cm). It involves sitting on a chair, extending one leg, and reaching toward the toes to assess mobility. The measurement is taken by recording the distance between the fingertips and the toes. Positive score (+): Fingertips go past the toes.Zero score (0): Fingertips touch the toes. Negative score (-): Fingertips fall short of the toes.

A ruler or tape measure is used to record the exact distance., 24-weeks|Change in upper body flexibility, Back Scratch Test: measures upper body flexibility, particularly shoulder mobility, in centimeters (cm). It involves reaching one hand over the shoulder and the other behind the back to touch or overlap fingers.

Positive score (+): Fingers overlap (measured as the overlap distance). Zero score (0): Fingers just touch. Negative score (-): Fingers do not touch (measured as the gap distance).

A ruler or tape measure is used to record the exact distance., 24-weeks|Change in psychological parameters (anxiety)., State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y): measures anxiety levels using a numerical score. It consists of 20 items assessing temporary (state) anxiety on a 4-point scale (1 = not at all to 4 = very much so).

Total score range: 20 to 80 (higher scores indicate greater anxiety).

Interpretation:

20-37: Low anxiety 38-44: Moderate anxiety 45-80: High anxiety

The final score is obtained by summing the responses., 24-weeks|Change in psychological parameters (depression)., Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): measures depression severity using a numerical score. It consists of 21 items, each rated on a 4-point scale (0 to 3) based on symptom severity.

Total score range: 0 to 63 (higher scores indicate more severe depression).

Interpretation:

0-13: Minimal depression 14-19: Mild depression 20-28: Moderate depression 29-63: Severe depression

The final score is obtained by summing the responses., 24-weeks|Change in psychological parameters (Fatigue)., Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS): measures the impact of fatigue on daily life using a numerical score. It consists of 9 items, each rated on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).

Total score range: 9 to 63 (higher scores indicate greater fatigue severity).

Interpretation:

* 36: Low to moderate fatigue \>36: High fatigue

The final score is the average of all 9 responses., 24-weeks|Change in psychological parameters (Quality of Life)., EORTC QLQ-C30: assesses the quality of life in cancer patients using a numerical score. It consists of 30 questions covering functional status, symptoms, and overall health, rated on a 4-point scale (1 = not at all to 4 = very much) or a 7-point scale (1 = very poor to 7 = excellent).

Scores range from 0 to 100 (higher scores indicate better functioning for global health/function scales and worse symptoms for symptom scales).

Interpretation:

Functional scales: Higher scores = better function. Symptom scales: Higher scores = more severe symptoms.

Scores are calculated and standardized based on EORTC guidelines., 24-weeks|Change in psychological parameters (Coping)., Brief COPE: assesses coping strategies using a numerical score. It consists of 28 items, grouped into 14 coping strategies, each rated on a 4-point scale (1 = I haven't been doing this at all to 4 = I've been doing this a lot).

Scores range from 2 to 8 per coping strategy (higher scores indicate greater use of that coping strategy).

Interpretation:

Higher scores in adaptive strategies (e.g., active coping, planning) suggest positive coping.

Higher scores in maladaptive strategies (e.g., denial, self-blame) may indicate ineffective coping.

Final scores are analyzed per strategy rather than as a total score., 24-weeks
