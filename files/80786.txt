Evaluation of Mucogyne速 Ovule in Vulvovaginal Dryness Management in Women Treated by Brachytherapy and/or Radiotherapy for Endometrial or Cervical Cancer.
Randomized, open-label, national (France), multicenter, prospective clinical study, to evaluate the superiority of Mucogyne速 ovules over the control group on vaginal health (including hydration) in women treated by brachytherapy and/or radiotherapy for endometrial or cervical cancer.
Vaginal Disease
DEVICE: Mucogyne速 ovule
Vaginal Health Index (VHI) change from inclusion to end of study, Each parameter is evaluated from 1 (worst) to 5 (best/normal):

* vaginal elasticity,
* vaginal secretion volume,
* vaginal pH,
* epithelial mucous membrane integrity,
* vaginal hydration/lubrication.

The sum of points for each parameter gives the VHI, from 5 (worst) to 25 (best/normal), 3 Months
Vaginal mucosa scarring evolution, Evolution of scarring of the vaginal mucosa by a composite score:

* visualization of the hysterectomy scar (not visible / visible) for endometrial cancer patients OR visualization of the cervix (not visible / visible) for cervical cancer patients,
* presence or absence of vaginal adhesions / cohalescences (walls and bottom of the vagina ),
* collapse of adhesions to touch (Y / N),
* edema / redness of vaginal mucosa (indicative of inflammation),
* pain caused by pressure (Y / N),
* bleeding caused by contact (none / moderate / severe), 3 Months|Time to additional local treatment administration, 3 Months|Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) on vaginal health, Auto-evaluation: score from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) on vaginal health related to the study intervention, 3 Months|Symptoms (pain, dyspareunia, vaginal pruritis, vulvovaginal dryness) evolution, Auto-evaluation of the symptoms: pain, dyspareunia, vaginal pruritis, vulvovaginal dryness on Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) of 10mm

Patient indicates where she locates the intensity of the symptom from 0mm (no symptom) to 10mm (worst intensity), 3 Months|VHI change at each visit, Each parameter is evaluated from 1 (worst) to 5 (best/normal):

* vaginal elasticity,
* vaginal secretion volume,
* vaginal pH,
* epithelial mucous membrane integrity,
* vaginal hydration/lubrication. The sum of points for each parameters gives the VHI, from 5 (worst) to 25 (best/normal), 3 Months|Vaginal flora composition (Nugent score) evolution, Measured on vaginal sample collected at inclusion, 1 month and 3 months, 3 Months|Complications and adverse events, Complications and adverse events related to study intervention, 3 Months|Patient satisfaction questionnaire at the end of study, All patients (both arms) will be asked about their satisfaction on the treatment of their vulvogainal symptoms during the study will be assessed using a 5-point Likert scale :

"At the end of this study, how would you rate your level of satisfaction with the treatment of your vulvovaginal symptoms? Very satisfactory / Satisfactory / Moderate / Poor / Very Poor", 3 Months
Randomized, open-label, national (France), multicenter, prospective clinical study, to evaluate the superiority of Mucogyne速 ovules over the control group on vaginal health (including hydration) in women treated by brachytherapy and/or radiotherapy for endometrial or cervical cancer.
