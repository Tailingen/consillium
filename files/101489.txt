Efficacy and Safety of Furmonertinib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC With EGFR Exon 20 Insertion
This is a Phase 2, Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Furmonertinib in Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Exon 20 Insertion Mutations.

The study plans to enroll approximately 100 patients from approximately 70 sites. Patients are locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertions who have progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Furmonertinib Mesilate will be treated 240 mg QD until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Primary endpoint is ORR. Secondary endpoints include DOR, DCR, DepOR, PFS, OS, CNS ORR, CNS DOR, CNS PFS, safety and the PK profile of Furmonertinib Mesilate and its metabolites (AST5902).
