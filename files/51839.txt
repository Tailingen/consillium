A Phase 1, Open-label, Multiple Dose Escalation Trial to Determine Safety and Tolerability of Once Daily OPB-111077 in Subjects With Advanced Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safe and tolerable dose level of OPB-111077 for patients with advanced cancer.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: OPB-111077
Safety and tolerability of OPB-111077, AEs, Vital signs,Body weight, ECGs, Laboratory tests, Performance status, 28 Days
To determine the pharmacokinetics of OPB-111077, The following PK parameters for Food-effect Sub-study (Cmax, AUCtau,AUCt, tmax, CLss/F and t1/2,z) will be determined using a non-compartmental approach for OPB-111077 and selected metabolites after single (Cycle 1, Day 1) and multiple daily doses (Cycle 2, Day 1)., 28 Days|Pharmacodynamic profile, Study drug effects on STAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-6 will be measured in PBMCs from subjects treated with OPB-111077., 28 Days|Antitumor effects, Subjects with measurable disease will be assessed by RECIST Assessments will be conducted at Screening, Cycle 3, every 2 cycles (+/- 1 week) thereafter, at the Final/Early Termination Visit, and at the 30-day Follow-up Visit., Assessments will be conducted at Screening, Cycle 3, every 2 cycles (+/- 1 week) thereafter, at the Final/Early Termination Visit, and at the 30-day Follow-up Visit.|To determine the MTD of OPB-111077, The highest dose at which fewer than 2 of 6 subjects experience DLT during the first 28 day cycle., Within the first cycle [28 days].|PET Sub-study (Part C), A sub-study of up to 24 patients with PET-avid tumors where additional PET scans are performed to explore intra-subject PET activity., 2 weeks|Food-effect Sub-study (Part B), An open-label, two-period crossover arm, for pre-selected study sites to determine the effect of food on the rate and extent of absorption (PK) following single dose 250mg OPB-111077., 11 days
The secondary objective of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of OPB-111077; the pharmacodynamic effects of OPB-111077; the antitumor activity of OPB-111077 as assessed by RECIST or IMWG Uniform Response Criteria; and to explore whether PET responses correlate with other measures of clinical response.
