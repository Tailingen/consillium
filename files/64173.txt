Local control rate., Key aspects of local tumor control include:

No Evidence of Tumor Growth:

The absence of measurable or observable increase in the size of the tumor at the primary site.

Tumor Response to Treatment:

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all signs of cancer at the primary site.

Partial Response (PR): Reduction in tumor size without complete disappearance.

Persistence of Stable Disease:

The tumor remains unchanged in size and does not spread locally beyond the treated area.

Time Frame: 5 years from treatment start.

Assessment Methods:

Clinical Examination: Evaluation of the treated site for physical signs of recurrence.

Imaging Techniques: CT, MRI, or PET scans to detect residual or recurrent disease.

Biopsy: When clinically indicated, to confirm recurrence if suspected., From the date of treatment initiation until local recurrence or last follow-up, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 60 months.|Regional tumor control rate, Key aspects of regional tumor control include:

Absence of Disease Progression:

No enlargement, growth, or new involvement of lymph nodes in the regional drainage area.

Response to Treatment:

Complete Response (CR): All detectable cancer in the regional lymph nodes has disappeared.

Partial Response (PR): A significant reduction in the size of affected lymph nodes or nodal masses.

Stable Disease:

The size and characteristics of the regional lymph nodes remain unchanged after treatment, without evidence of further spread.

Time Frame: 5 years

Assessment Methods:

Imaging: CT, MRI, or PET scans are used to assess lymph node involvement and detect residual or recurrent disease.

Physical Examination: Palpation or clinical inspection for lymph node abnormalities.

Biopsy or Fine Needle Aspiration: To confirm suspected recurrence or residual, From the date of treatment initiation until regional recurrence or last follow-up, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 60 months.
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is a clinical endpoint that refers to the length of time from the start of treatment (or diagnosis, depending on the study design) until death from any cause.

Key Aspects of Overall Survival:

Inclusion of All Causes of Death:

OS accounts for death from cancer, treatment-related complications, or any other unrelated causes (e.g., accidents or comorbid conditions).

Measurement:

OS as a median survival time (e.g., the time by which 50% of patients are still alive) and as a survival rate at specific time intervals (e.g., 1-year, 3 Year, 5-year OS rates).

Time Frame:

The starting point for measuring OS is the date of treatment initiation, The endpoint is the date of death or the last follow-up for patients who are still alive (censored data).

Assessment Methods:

OS is determined using survival analysis techniques, (Kaplan-Meier estimates), to calculate survival probabilities and generate survival curves., From the date of treatment initiation until death from any cause or last follow-up, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 60 months.|Disease-Specific Survival (DSS), Disease-Specific Survival (DSS) refers to the length of time from the start of treatment (or diagnosis, depending on the study design) until death specifically caused by the disease being studied, excluding deaths from other causes.

Key Aspects of Disease-Specific Survival:

Focus on Disease-Related Deaths:

Only deaths directly attributable to the disease (e.g., cancer progression, metastasis) are considered in DSS calculations.

Deaths from unrelated causes, such as accidents, other illnesses, or age-related factors, are excluded.

Measurement:

DSS is expressed as the time from treatment initiation to disease-specific death, or as a survival rate at specific intervals (e.g., 1,3,5-year DSS rate).

Time Frame:

The starting point for DSS measurement is the date of the start of treatment. The endpoint is the date of disease-specific death or last follow-up (for censored cases).

Assessment Methods:

DSS is determined using survival analysis techniques (Kaplan-Meier curves)., From the date of treatment initiation until disease-specific death or last follow-up, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 60 months.|Metastasis-Free Survival (MFS), MFS refers to the length of time from the start of treatment (or diagnosis, depending on the study design) until the first occurrence of distant metastasis (cancer spreading to distant organs or tissues) or death from any cause, whichever comes first. It is a commonly used endpoint in oncology studies to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in preventing the spread of cancer.

Inclusion Criteria:

Patients are considered metastasis-free as long as there is no evidence of cancer spreading beyond the primary site and regional lymph nodes.

Events Considered:

Development of distant metastases (e.g. cancer in the lungs, liver, bones, or other remote organs).

Death from any cause will be included in MFS, making it a composite endpoint.

Measurement:

MFS is expressed as the time from diagnosis or treatment initiation to the occurrence of distant metastasis or death. For patients who remain alive and free of metastases at the end of follow up the data are censored at the last FU., From the date of treatment initiation until the first occurrence of distant metastasis, death from any cause, or last follow-up, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 60 months.|Secondary malignancies, Incidence of secondary malignancies, From Enrollment to the 5 years after the end of treatment.|Toxicities, Acute and late therapy-related toxicities (CTC AE scale)., From the date of enrollment until the occurrence of acute or late therapy-related toxicities, death, or last follow-up, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 60 months.|General quality of life (EORTC QLQ-30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated tool comprising 30 items grouped into functional scales (e.g., physical, emotional, and social functioning), symptom scales (e.g., fatigue, nausea, and pain), and global health status/QoL. Scores for each scale range from 0 to 100. Higher scores on functional and global health/QoL scales indicate better outcomes, whereas higher scores on symptom scales represent worse outcomes., Enrollment, end of radiotherapy (week 7 from start), week 6-8 after the end of radiotherapy, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 Month after the end of radiotherapy or death from any cause, or last follow-up, whichever occurs first.|Organ specific quality of life (EORTC QLQ-H&N35), EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 quest, specifically tailored for head and neck cancer patients, captures detailed information on a wide range of symptoms and treatment-related toxicities, including but not limited to:

Higher scores on symptom scales indicate worse outcomes (e.g. more pain, worse swallowing), while higher scores on functional scales suggest better outcomes(e.g. improved ability to swallow or speak)., Enrollment, end of radiotherapy (week 7 from start), week 6-8 after the end of radiotherapy, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 Month after the end of radiotherapy or death from any cause, or last follow-up, whichever occurs first.|Factors Influencing Recurrence Patterns, Factors Influencing Recurrence Patterns:

Tumor-Specific Factors:

Tumor stage and size (T and N classification). Histological subtype and grade. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status: HPV-positive tumors typically have better local and regional control but can still metastasize.

Treatment-Related Factors:

Dose and technique of radiotherapy: Modern techniques like IMRT/VMAT with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) can reduce local recurrence by improving dose conformity.

Use of concurrent chemotherapy: Enhances radiosensitivity and reduces recurrence risk, especially in advanced-stage disease.

Adherence to treatment protocols.

Patient-Specific Factors:

Smoking and alcohol use post-treatment. Comorbidities that impact treatment tolerance and immune response. Nutritional and functional status., From treatment start until first evident recurrence. Censoring for all patients without recurrence at 5 Years.
This study is a prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional quality control registry focused on the application of simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (SIB-IMRT) in the primary and adjuvant treatment of head and neck cancers. The primary objectives are to evaluate local and regional control rates, overall survival, tumor-specific survival, and metastasis-free survival. The study also aims to document acute and late treatment-associated toxicities, patient-reported quality of life, and recurrence patterns in relation to delivered radiation doses.

Patients with histologically confirmed malignancies of the head and neck region (excluding basal cell carcinoma) who are indicated for definitive or adjuvant radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy will be included. Treatment planning involves individualized IMRT/VMAT-based approaches with SIB techniques designed to escalate doses to high-risk tumor regions while sparing surrounding healthy structures, thereby reducing toxicity. The treatment is provided in compliance with national guidelines and inter-disciplinary tumor board recommendations.

Evaluation of Adverse Events The study employs the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaires-QLQ-C30 and H\&N35-to systematically assess treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and their impact on quality of life. These standardized tools are administered at baseline, at the end of treatment, and during follow-up visits.

The EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 questionnaire, specifically tailored for head and neck cancer patients, captures detailed information on a wide range of symptoms and treatment-related toxicities, including but not limited to:

Swallowing and Oral Function:

Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) Speech problems (articulation and clarity) Xerostomia (dry mouth) Sticky saliva

Sensory Impairments:

Altered taste and smell Hearing loss

Pain and Discomfort:

Pain in the mouth, throat, or jaw Soreness or discomfort in the treated area

Respiratory Symptoms:

Breathing difficulties Nasal congestion or discharge

Nutritional Challenges:

Difficulty eating or maintaining weight Nutritional supplementation requirements

Emotional and Social Impact:

Body image concerns Social functioning and isolation Financial burden associated with treatment

Other Common Toxicities:

Skin reactions in the irradiated area Fatigue and general physical discomfort These adverse events are graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), enabling consistent reporting of the severity and frequency of toxicities.

Data Collection and Statistical Analysis The collected data will include baseline patient characteristics, treatment parameters, and longitudinal quality-of-life scores. Outcomes will be analyzed to identify correlations between reported toxicities, dosimetric parameters, and clinical outcomes, such as recurrence patterns and survival metrics.

The statistical methodology includes:

Descriptive statistics for baseline demographics and treatment variables. Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models to explore the influence of clinical and treatment-related factors on survival and recurrence.

Correlation analyses to assess the relationship between dosimetric variables and recurrence patterns.

Significance of the Study This study seeks to complement clinical trial data with real-world evidence on the implementation of SIB-IMRT in head and neck cancer treatment. By systematically capturing and analyzing treatment-related toxicities and quality-of-life metrics, the findings aim to refine therapeutic protocols, enhance patient outcomes, and inform strategies to mitigate adverse events. Moreover, the integration of recurrence pattern analysis and ontogenetic lymphatic mapping could offer valuable insights for future treatment planning.
