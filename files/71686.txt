A Safety And Efficacy Study Of HLA-G- Targeted CAR-T Cells IVS-3001 In Subjects With Previously Treated Advanced HLA-G-Positive Solid Tumors
The proposed clinical study is a Phase 1/2a trial to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of anti-HLA-G CAR-T cells IVS-3001 administered to subjects with previously treated, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors which are HLA-G positive (HLA-G+) - as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis on tumor biopsies using the 4H84 antibody.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Single Injection of IVS-3001- Anti - HLA-G CAR-T cells|DRUG: Fludarabine phosphate|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|PROCEDURE: leukapheresis
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion an average of 3 years.|. Objective Response Rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, through study completion an average of 3 years
Primary Objectives:

IVS-3001 is an autologous CAR-T cell therapy targeting human leukocyte antigen (HLA-G)

* Phase 1: To determine the safety, tolerability and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IVS-3001 in subjects with refractory or relapsed HLA-G+ solid tumors.
* Phase 2a: To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of IVS-3001 in selected HLA-G+ solid tumor types.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile of IVS-3001: persistence, expansion.
* To evaluate the clinical activity of IVS-3001 in selected HLA-G+ solid tumor types.
* To assess the long-term safety of IVS-3001.

Exploratory Objectives:

â€¢ To explore functionality of IVS-3001 as well as immune biomarkers linked with IVS-3001 and their relationship with clinical response
