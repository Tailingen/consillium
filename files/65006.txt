Characterization of Immunosuppressive Signing of Cervical Cancer
Infection with Human Papillomavirus high-risk Human (HR-HPV) is the main factor of risk of cancer of the cervix. Recent studies show that cancers linked to infection with HR-HPV are associated with immunosuppression and lack of T cell response Such mechanisms would promote progression to cancer and progression of it . Various factors such as an increase of regulatory T cells, the presence of myeloid cells and suppressor of defects in the signaling pathway Toll Like Receptor (TLR) may have a key role in these immunosuppression mechanisms. At this stage of knowledge, a better characterization of local and systemic immunosuppressive signing of cervical cancer is needed. The results should have a significant medical impact for the identification of new prognostic markers and new therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with cervical cancer.

The aim of this research project is to define the signing of immunosuppressive cancer cervix and analyze the different mechanisms involved in this immunosuppression.
