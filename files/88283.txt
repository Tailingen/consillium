This is a retrospective, non interventional, multi-centre, single arm, observational study designed to assess patients with newly diagnosed, therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) or acute myeloid leukaemia with myelodysplasia related changes (AML-MRC) who have been treated with Vyxeos liposomal (liposomal daunorubicin/cytarabine; CPX-351) in routine UK clinical practice and managed as per standard local practice.
