A Study to Learn About the Study Medicine (Called Maplirpacept (PF-07901801)) in Japanese With Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn about how safe and tolerable is the study medicine (called maplirpacept (PF-07901801)) when taken for the treatment of lymphoma or multiple myeloma (a type of cancer that affects your body's infection-fighting cells, lymphocytes or plasma cell).

This study is seeking participants who:

* are 18 years of age or older
* have worsening and difficult to manage type of lymphoma or multiple myeloma
* Have adequately functioning organs
* are not on long term use of steroids which are given either by mouth or as shots
* have no major heart related disease etc.

All participants in this study will receive maplirpacept (PF-07901801) as an IV infusion (given directly into a vein) at the study clinic every week.

Participants will continue to receive maplirpacept (PF-07901801) until their progress of cancer worsens or the participants do not wish to take the study medicine.

The experiences of the people receiving the study medicine will be collected. This will help to understand if the study medicine maplirpacept (PF-07901801), is safe and can be given to Japanese people.

CD47 is a cell-surface protein expressed on multiple normal cell types and often at high levels on many malignant tumor cells. Maplirpacept (PF-07901801) is a soluble recombinant fusion protein created by directly linking the sequences encoding the CD47 binding domain of human Signal Regulatory Protein alpha with the fragment crystallizable domain of human Immunoglobulin 4. maplirpacept (PF-07901801) functions as a soluble decoy receptor, preventing CD47 from delivering its antiphagocytic signal. Neutralization of the inhibitory CD47 signal enables macrophage activation and anti-tumor effects by pro-phagocytic signals present on the tumor cells.

The objective of this study is to confirm safety and tolerability of single agent maplirpacept (PF-07901801) at the recommended phase 3 dose in Japanese participants with relapsed or refractory lymphoma or multiple myeloma.
