Chidamide Plus Camrelizumab as Second-line Therapy for Advanced ESCC Treated With PD-1 Blockade
The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of chidamide plus camrelizumab as second-line therapy for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with PD-1 blockade

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been tested in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(ESCC) with demonstrated clinical efficacyï¼Œa significant number of patients who have an initial response will develop a secondary resistance and relapse. recent studies on the role of epigenetics in immune evasion have exposed a key role for epigenetic modulators in augmenting the tumour microenvironment and restoring immune recognition and immunogenicity. These discoveries have established a highly promising basis for studies using combined epigenetic and immunotherapeutic agents as anti-cancer therapies. Chidamide is a novel orally active benzamide-type histone deacetylase inhibitor that has shown in vitro activities against a wide array of neoplasms. Hence, the study of chidamide plus camrelizumab as second-line therapy for advanced ESCC treated with PD-1 blockade was performed.
