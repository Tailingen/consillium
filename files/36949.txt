Brain diseases are very difficult diseases to treat, and when developing related medical cures for saving lives, however, it is difficult to obtain examining samples, especially like normal brain tissue since it is necessary to preserve the brain tissue of patients to ensure its functionality. Among the numerous brain diseases, there are many diseases that combine surgery, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy in treatment. For example, for brain tumors, surgery is the most important treatment that can effectively prolong the survival time of patients. Numerous neurological functions, tumors generated in such important organs, require careful judgment of resection strategy in surgical treatment. In addition to achieving complete tumor resection, subsequent chemotherapy and immunotherapy are also important factors to improve prognosis. Traditionally, the neurosurgeon's experience and various preoperative examinations are used to judge the type and distribution of the disease, which may lead to inconsistent results due to different personal experiences. The current methods that can be used clinically to help improve the integrity of resection (such as intraoperative fluorochrome and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging) are relatively indirect methods of judgment, but it is hard to directly know the detailed information of the disease before surgery, and the assessment results of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) section through the standard operation of pathological procedures are used to formulate drug treatment strategies, which may greatly affect the prognosis of patients. According to the current intraoperative cryopathology, there are many brain tumors that cannot be classified easily by it. When searching the literature, there are also few related studies that try to solve this problem, but in addition to the insufficient sample size, it is also impossible to acquire appropriate conclusions due to the limited number of samples. Therefore, through this study, we want to implement optical microscopy and electrophysiological analysis system to capture images and electrophysiological signals of some remaining brain diseased tissues after surgical resection, and compare the acquired datas with the results obtained from human brain organoid tissues. Eventually, construct a large database of brain tissue can also verify whether human brain organoids can completely compare with real human brain samples can truly improve the medical operation.
