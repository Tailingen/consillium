A Predictive Model for Recurrence of Colorectal Cancer Based on Multi-omics of Portal Vein Blood
This multi-center study aims to develop a precise predictive model for colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence and metastasis based on multi-omics analysis of portal vein blood. Despite advances in surgical treatments, approximately 40% of CRC patients experience tumor recurrence or metastasis post-surgery, with 80-90% of metastases being unresectable. The study will include stage I-IV CRC patients and will be conducted in two phases: a nested case-control study and a bidirectional cohort study. Comprehensive multi-omics sequencing will be performed on samples from primary tumors, adjacent tissues, normal intestinal tissues, portal vein blood, and peripheral blood. The goal is to identify specific biomarkers in the portal vein and peripheral blood associated with CRC recurrence and metastasis, and to compare the predictive accuracy of models based on these biomarkers. The ultimate objective is to provide a more effective method for early prediction and intervention of CRC recurrence and metastasis, thereby improving patient outcomes.

Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal Cancer Recurrence or Metastasis, The primary outcome measure is the occurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence or metastasis within 24 months post-surgery. This will be monitored through clinical evaluations, imaging studies (CT, MRI), and blood tests (CEA levels). Recurrence or metastasis will be defined by persistent elevation in CEA, and/or detection of local recurrence or distant metastases through imaging and biopsy confirmation., 24 months post-surgery
Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) will be measured from the date of surgery to the date of death from any cause. This outcome will help determine the effectiveness of the predictive model and intervention strategies developed from the study. Survival status will be monitored through regular follow-up visits and patient records., 24 months post-surgery
1. Study Title A predictive model for recurrence of colorectal cancer based on multi-omics of portal vein blood: a multi-center study
2. Study Overview This multicenter study, led by Peking University Shougang Hospital, aims to develop a predictive model for the recurrence and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) through multi-omics analysis of portal vein blood. The study collaborates with several prominent institutions including Peking University First Hospital, Chinese PLA General Hospital First Medical Center, Peking University Third Hospital, and Beijing Tiantan Hospital. The objective is to identify specific biomarkers indicative of CRC recurrence and metastasis, integrating these with clinical and pathological data to create highly accurate predictive models.
3. Background and Rationale Colorectal cancer poses a significant health challenge in China, with high incidence and mortality rates. Despite advancements in surgical and adjuvant therapies, approximately 40% of patients undergoing radical surgery experience tumor recurrence or metachronous metastasis, with most metastatic lesions being unresectable. Predicting the risk of metachronous metastasis accurately is crucial for CRC management. This study employs advanced multi-omics techniques to analyze portal vein blood, hypothesizing that it provides comprehensive and early detection of tumor-specific genetic and epigenetic alterations compared to peripheral blood.

   Primary Objective:
   * Develop a predictive model for CRC recurrence and metastasis using biomarkers identified from multi-omics analysis of portal vein blood.

   Secondary Objectives:

   • Compare the predictive efficacy of portal vein blood versus peripheral venous blood.

   • Validate the predictive models in a large, multicenter cohort.

5. Study Design

The study comprises two phases:

1. Phase 1: Nested Case-Control Study

   * Participants: CRC patients (stages II-IV) post-radical surgery.
   * Sample Collection: Plasma from primary tumors, adjacent tissues, normal tissues, portal vein blood, and peripheral blood.
   * Methods: High-throughput sequencing and multi-omics analysis to identify specific biomarkers associated with recurrence and metastasis.
   * Analysis: Comparing patients with and without recurrence or metastasis to identify significant biomarkers.
2. Phase 2: Bidirectional Cohort Study

   o Participants: CRC patients (stages I-IV).

   o Sample Collection: Baseline data collection pre-surgery, including age, gender, tumor characteristics, and plasma samples.
   * Follow-up: Monitoring for recurrence and metastasis within 2 years post-surgery.
   * Methods: Integrating multi-omics data with clinical factors using machine learning to build predictive models.
   * Validation: Comparing the models\&#39; predictive efficacy in portal vein blood and peripheral blood.

     (6) Sample Collection and Handling

   Blood Sample Collection:
   * Timing: Blood samples are collected from the tumor region veins after ligation of the colorectal tumor\&#39;s arterial and venous supply but before tumor resection.
   * Method: A blood sampling needle is inserted into the tumor region veins for collection.
   * Volume: Each patient provides 10-20 ml of venous blood from the tumor region.
   * Post-Collection Processing: Blood samples are centrifuged and aliquoted within 30 minutes of collection and stored at -80°C.

   Veins for Blood Collection:
   * Right Hemicolon Tumors: Ileocolic vein
   * Transverse Colon Tumors: Middle colic vein
   * Left Hemicolon Tumors: Inferior mesenteric vein
   * Sigmoid Colon Tumors: Inferior mesenteric vein
   * Rectal Tumors: Inferior mesenteric vein

   * Each sample is 10 ml (using EDTA anticoagulant or coagulation-promoting tubes), stored at 4°C.
   * Samples are delivered to the biobank within 2 hours, processed for plasma and cell separation, and frozen at -80°C or in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.

   Processing Steps:
   * Blood Component Separation:

     o Centrifuge at 4°C, 3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate plasma.
