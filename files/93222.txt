Clinical And Translational Study Of MK-2206 In Patients With Metastatic KRAS-Wild-Type, PIK3CA-Mutated, Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test a new drug called MK-2206 for metastatic colorectal cancer. This drug is being tested in a subgroup of patients with colorectal cancer whose tumors have changes in certain genes that may make them more likely to respond to this new medication. As tumors develop, the cells within the tumor acquire mutations within genes, allowing them to grow more effectively. We will be testing your tumor for mutations involving two genes - KRAS and PIK3CA. Patients whose tumors have a normal copy of the KRAS gene and a mutation within the PIK3CA gene will be eligible to participate in this study.

This study is a phase 2 study. The goal of a phase 2 study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, a new treatment has against a certain type of cancer.

DRUG: MK-2206
Overall Objective Response Rate (ORR), in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with known PIK3CA mutations and wild type KRAS, to single agent MK-2206. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1), 1 year
