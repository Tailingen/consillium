Investigation of the Contents and Prognostic Values of Glucose Metabolism Molecules in Patients With Lung Adenocarcinoma
Detect the contents of glucose metabolism molecules in the tumor and adjacent normal samples of about 100 patients with lung adenocarcinoma using mass spectroscopy. Analyze the correlation between the contents and the clinicopathological characteristics and survival.
