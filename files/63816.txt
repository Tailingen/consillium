Effect of Pre-operative Virtual Visits on Patients With Head and Neck Cancer Undergoing Surgery
Patients with head and neck cancer often undergo complex surgeries requiring significant care post-operatively. This presents considerable psychosocial challenges in addition to their need to physically recover from a large surgery.

The study team will interview patients who have undergone virtual visits before their surgical procedures. The study aims to explore patients' experiences, satisfaction, and perceptions of virtual visits for informing and preparing them for surgery and their postoperative care needs.

The study team will also analyze the effects of the virtual visits on financial costs and patient outcomes such as length of hospital stay, delayed discharges due to social issues, and whether the virtual visits identified any significant medical concerns, etc. The study team will compare these to a randomly selected cohort of patients who also underwent surgical resection and reconstruction for head and neck cancer that did not get pre-operative virtual visits.
Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: Survey
Effectiveness of virtual visits as determined by satisfaction scores, To examine the satisfaction scores of patients who undergo pre-operative virtual visits. The satisfaction scale is graded on a modified Likert scale. The endpoint for this primary objective is the score given by the patient on the interview-based survey, at time of enrollment
Comparison in hospitalization between cohorts, To examine if patients who undergo pre-operative virtual visits have reduced hospital length of stay (i.e. number of days hospitalization post-operatively) compared to patients who did not undergo these visits., up to 60 days after the surgical resection|Comparison in post-operative communication, To examine if patients who undergo pre-operative virtual visits have reduced post-operative communication measured in portal messages and phone calls compared to patients who did not undergo these visits., up to 60 days after the surgical resection
