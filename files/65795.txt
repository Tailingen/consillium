Study Investigating the Association of NP137 With Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab Combination in First Line in Unresectable HCC
The study will assess the safety of the association of NP137 with the standard of care Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab in first line setting in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.The study drug which is tested is the NP137 in association with Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab to allow a better tumor response as well as better survival outcomes with an acceptable safety.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: NP137|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Percentage Proportion of patients experiencing adverse events, Percentage Proportion of patients experiencing adverse events (AEs) of any grade and grade 3/4 AEs as defined by the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v 5.0) throughout the study period., At 36 months
Best overall objective response rate (ORR), Best overall objective response rate (ORR) and ORR at 3 months, 6, 9, 12 months according to mRECIST and RECIST 1.1., At 3,6,9,12 months|Mechanism of EMT, To assess the mechanisms of EMT reversal by comparing different histological markers on pre-therapeutic and Cycle4-Cycle5 biopsies. Descriptive study in transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry of the evolution of EMT markers, Netrin-1 expression, and tumor microenvironment during treatment by comparing pre-therapeutic biopsies to Cycle4-Cycle5 biopsies, At 0, 12 and 15 month
Overall survival (OS), Median Overall survival (OS) and 12 months-OS rates. OS is defined as the time between inclusion and death (all causes). Patients alive will be censored at the date of last news., at 12 and 36 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and 12 months-PFS rates according to RECIST 1.1., at 12 and 36 months|Duration of response, Median Duration of response is defined as the time between first dose of treatment and progression according to RECIST 1.1. Patients alive without progression will be censored at the date of last news., at 36 months|Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response, AFP response will be defined as a percentage of patients with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline AFP level, at 3, 6, 12 months, At 3,6, and12 months|Quality of life (QoL), QoL will be studied by using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-HCC18 questionnaire (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire for Cancer) at baseline, 3, 6, 12 months. A 5-point decrease of QLQ-C30 score will be considered as the minimal clinically significant deterioration of QoL., At 3,6, and12 months|time to deterioration (TTD), TTD will be defined as the time from inclusion in the study to deterioration of EORTC QLQ-C30 score with a decrease ≥5 points at any time point after the baseline score., at 36 months|PK-PD evaluation, based on available PopPK modelisation and PK samples collected at the time of the response evaluation in this study, At 36 months
The study is a multicentric, prospective, single arm phase 1b trial. This study will enroll 43 to 52 patients and consists of 2 parts: Safety Lead-in Phase and Expansion Phase. Initially, 3 to 12 patients will be enrolled into a Safety Lead-in Phase based on a 3 + 3 design, with the possibility of dose de-escalation, to confirm the recommended dose of NP137 .The Expansion Phase will start after completion of Safety Lead-in Phase at the confirmed dose and will include 40 patients. Patients will be assigned to the experimental single arm (NP137+ Atezolizumab-Bevacizumab).
