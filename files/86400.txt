Safety and Efficacy of ThisCART19 in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed B Cell Malignancies
This is a study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of ThisCART19 (Allogeneic CAR-T targeting CD19) in patients with refractory or relapsed CD19 positive B cell malignancies.
B Cell Malignancy
BIOLOGICAL: ThisCART19 cells
Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities, To assess adverse events as dose limiting toxicities as defined by the protocol., From infusion to Day 28|Complete Remission, Proportion of patients in whom with morphologic complete remission (CR), At Day 28 after ThisCART19 infusion|TRM: Treatment Related Mortality, The mortality related with ThisCART19 infusion., Up to 2 years
Objective Response Rate, For Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Objective response rate(ORR) is the percentage of patients who achieve CR or chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CRi); for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lymphoma, ORR is the incidence of either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR)., Up to 1 year|Duration of Response, Duration of Response (DOR) defined as the duration (days) from initial response to disease relapse, progression, or death due to any course., Up to 1 year|Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Adverse events assessed according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, From inclusion up to 1 year|Overall Survival Rate of 2 Years, The rate of patients whom alive at year 2, At year 2
This is a single-center, nonrandomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of ThisCART19 in patients with refractory or relapsed CD19 positive B cell malignancies, such as acute or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma and etc. The dose range is 0.2-60 x 10\^6 cells per kg body weight.
