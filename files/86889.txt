A Study of Vismodegib in Men With Metastatic CRPC With Accessible Metastatic Lesions for Tumor Biopsy
This is a single-arm pharmacodynamic study with mandatory metastatic tumor biopsies in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.

The trial will evaluate the effect of vismodegib on tumor tissue in men with metastatic CRPC by obtaining tumor biopsies at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with vismodegib.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Vismodegib
The Proportion of mCRPC Patients Treated With Vismodegib Who Achieve a Pharmacodynamic (PD) Response in Tumor Biopsies, The primary endpoint is the proportion of mCRPC patients treated with vismodegib who achieve a pharmacodynamic (PD) response in tumor biopsies, defined as both a decrease in GLI1 mRNA greater than 1.2 times the standard deviation (SD) of the baseline values and a ≥50% (≥2-fold) reduction in GLI1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in metastatic tumor biopsies after 4 weeks of treatment when comparing post-treatment biopsy to pre-treatment biopsy in the same patient., Up to 1 year
GLI1 Expression, Suppression by vismodegib in tumor tissue of Hh-regulated transcripts and proteins was defined as the change from baseline in expression levels of GLI1 in situ tissue expression by mRNA in situ hybridization., Up to 1 Year|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria using RECIST 1.1 criteria for each patient. PFS is defined as the time of first dose (a) until prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression (by 25% increase in PSA from nadir) or death and (b) until any evidence of progression (by 25% increase in PSA from nadir, a new lesion on bone or CT scan, or physical examination) or death. PFS will be assigned to the earliest observed time., Up to 1 Year|AKT1 Expression in Tumor Biopsies, The tumor biopsies were evaluated for changes to Hh-regulated transcript, AKT1, between pre-treatment and post-treatment, Up to 1 Year|The Effect of Vismodegib on PSA Responses, The effect of vismodegib on PSA responses will be assessed as the number of patients with participants with ≥50% PSA reductions at any time point during study, Up to 1 Year
The study will enroll 10 evaluable patients. Patients will receive a 30-day supply of 150 mg of vismodegib on day one of each cycle daily by mouth, beginning on Day 1, and continuously until one of the following occurs: Disease progression, intolerable toxicity most probably attributable to vismodegib or withdrawal from the study.

Tumor biopsies (nodal or visceral), skin biopsies, and CTCs will be obtained at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. PSA evaluations will be conducted every 4 weeks, imaging assessments (CT and Bone scan) will be conducted every 12 weeks and routine labs (blood counts and chemistry panel) will be conducted every 4 weeks.

The investigator's intent is to examine the fold change in GLI1 expression in each man following exposure to drug (comparing pre-treatment and on-treatment core biopsy samples). As secondary endpoints, the investigator will also explore clinical response (PSA responses, progression-free survival \[PFS\], radiographic responses), safety, and will examine changes from baseline in Gli2, PTCH1, and AKT1 mRNA levels by qRT-PCR, in situ GLI1 expression in tissue sections by mRNA in situ hybridization, and GLI1 expression in isolated circulating tumor cells (CTCs).
