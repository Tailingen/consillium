A Study of TBI-1401(HF10) in Patients With Solid Tumors With Superficial Lesions
The purpose of this study is to determine whether TBI-1401(HF10), a spontaneously attenuated mutant of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1), is safe and tolerable in the treatment of solid tumors with superficial lesions.
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: TBI-1401(HF10)|BIOLOGICAL: TBI-1401(HF10)
Safety and tolerability (CTCAE version 4.0)., Adverse events will be evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0)., up to Week 16
Overall tumor response (modified World Health Organization response criteria), Overall tumor response will be evaluated by modified World Health Organization (mWHO) response criteria in the measurable target lesion(s) and unmeasurable/evaluable target lesion(s)., at Week 12|Levels of antibody to HSV-1, Anti-HSV-1 antibodies will be assessed in serum., up to Week 12
Change in cytokine profiles in serum, Evaluation of cytokine profiles in serum by immunoassay., up to Week 12|Change in antitumor T-cell reactivity in serum, Antitumor T-cell reactivity in serum will be evaluated by flow cytometry., up to Week 12|Change in regulatory T-cell (Treg) population in serum, Treg population in serum will be evaluated by flow cytometry., up to Week 12|Histopathological response with TBI-1401(HF10) administrated tumor, Core biopsies will be performed to evaluate the histopathological response with TBI-1401(HF10) administrated tumor., at Week 12
This is an open label, non-randomized, dose escalation Phase I study evaluating the repeated intratumoral administrations of the TBI-1401(HF10), a spontaneously attenuated mutant of HSV-1, in patients with solid tumors with superficial lesions (e.g., malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin).

The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated intratumoral administrations of TBI-1401(HF10) at dose levels of 1 x 10\^6 TCID50/dose (cohort 1) and 1 x 10\^7 TCID50/dose (cohort 2) in Japanese patients. Three patients will be enrolled in each cohort. Patients in the each cohort will receive a total of four intratumoral administrations in the same lesion.
