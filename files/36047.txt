A Clinical Study of PD-L1 Antibody ZKAB001 Combined With Capecitabine in Resected Biliary Tract Cancer
This is a Phase Ib, open-label,single-arm, clinical study, aiming to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ZKAB001 (a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the Programmed Death - Ligand 1 (PD-L1) membrane receptor ) combined with capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with biliary tract cancers after radical resection.After completing 8 courses of combined treatment ,ZKAB001 was continued to be administered separately once 3 weeks for a total of 16 cycles or 1 year.
Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: ZKAB001 5mg/kg|DRUG: Capecitabine
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Adverse events of level 3 or above related to the study drug occurring within 21 days after the first dose as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., 21 days after first dose|Recommended phase II dose (RP2D), DLT occurs in no more than 1/6 subjects, this dose is defined as RP2D., 21 days after first dose
AUC(0-t), Area under curve 0-t, 16 periods or 1 year|Cmax, Peak concentration, 16 periods or 1 year|Tmax, Peak time, 16 periods or 1 year|Disease-free Survival, Form date of randominzation until the date of the first tumor recurrence/ometastasis or death of the subject due to any reason, up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause or the date of last follow-up whichever came first, up to 24 months|the number of subjects presenting detectable anti drug antibodies (ADAs), To evaluated the number of subjects presenting detectable anti drug antibodies (ADAs), through study completion,an average of 1 year
This study includes two phases,the first phase is the dose exploration, 6 subjects were first included at the initial dose to confirm the dose safety. If the toxicity is not tolerated, the dose of the chemotherapeutic agent will be reduced depending on the toxicity(including hematological toxicity and non-hematological toxicity) for further exploration. If it can be tolerated, the recommended dose is determined and expanded on this dose. the second phase is the dose expansion, 4 subjects will be enrolled to further observe the safety and efficacy. The DLT(Dose limited toxicity) observation period is set as the first course of treatment(3 weeks). The end point is that the patient has been taking the drug for 16 cycles or 1 year, or the patient dies or develops intolerable toxicity or confirmed disease recurrence or distant metastasis or withdrawal of informed consent.
