Phase II Study of Regorafenib as Maintenance Therapy
Multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled randomized Phase II study comparing regorafenibÂ® to placebo, as maintenance therapy in metastatic soft-tissue non-adipocytic sarcomas experiencing stable disease or response after 6 cycles of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy as 1st line chemotherapy.
Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Regorafenib|DRUG: Placebo
To assess the efficacy of regorafenib compared to placebo, Progression-Free Survival will be measured from the date of randomization until the date of radiological progression (according to RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death (if death occurs before progression)., from the date of randomization to the date of first observed disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death from any cause, up to 12 months after the beginning of the treatment
To assess the efficacy of regorafenib compared to placebo, in terms of overall survival, from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause|To assess the efficacy of regorafenib compared to placebo, Best response according to RECIST 1.1 evaluated by central radiological review: Complete Response, CR, or Partial Response, PR, achieved during the maintenance therapy. CR and PR will be counted as objective response to estimate the objective response rate (ORR), from the date of randomization to the date of first observed disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, up to 12 months after the beginning of the treatment|To assess the efficacy of regorafenib compared to placebo, Time to start subsequent line of anticancer therapy defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of start subsequent line of anticancer therapy. Patient data will be censored at the date of last follow-up visit for patients alive at last follow-up visit without having started subsequent line of anticancer therapy. Death without having started subsequent line of anticancer therapy will be counted as a competing event., from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause, up to 12 months after the beginning of the treatment|To assess the safety of regorafenib, Compared to placebo - Toxicity according to NCI-CTC AE V5.0 over the whole treatment duration plus 30 days, excluding AE unequivocally related to the disease under study or its progression. Adverse events of grade 3 or more (grade 3+) will be counted as severe adverse events, Baseline, every 4 weeks, up to 12 months after the beginning of the treatment|To assess the relative benefit/risk ratio, using the Q-TWiST approach - Quality-adjusted time without symptoms of disease or toxicity computed from survival times (overall survival and progression-free survival) and adverse events data (date of occurrence of grade 3+ adverse event classified as drug-related), up to 12 months
assessment of the predictive value of SUMSCAN signature, genomic signature established on initial diagnostic biopsies or resection specimen and identifying sarcoma patients benefitting from anti-angiogenetic agents, up to 12 months
Patients will be randomized 1:1 using a centralized randomization software, assuring concealment, with a minimization program controlling for the following factors:

* Histological subgroups: leiomyosarcoma versus synovial sarcoma versus other histological subtype
* Response to doxorubicin-based chemotherapy: partial response versus stable disease
* Centers

The treatment will be administrated as long as it appears beneficial. Evaluations will be made every 8 weeks until 6 months and then every 3 months
