Evaluation of Enzastaurin in the Treatment of Persistent or Recurrent Ovarian or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
The purpose is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of the study agent, enzastaurin, in participants with recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Neoplasms|Carcinoma
DRUG: enzastaurin
Progression-free Survival for at Least 6 Months (PFS-6), Data presented are the percentage of participants without progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause 6 months after registration. PD was a 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions (or 2 largest lesions if too numerous) over the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease) or clear worsening of any evaluable disease, or appearance of any new lesion/site, or failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition (unless clearly unrelated to this cancer)., Baseline through 6 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Severe Adverse Events, Data presented are the number of participants who experienced 1 or more adverse events (AEs) (all causalities and drug-related) and serious AEs (SAEs). A summary of SAEs and other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events section of this record., Baseline through end of study (Up to 45 months)
Duration of Progression-Free Survival, PFS is defined as the rate of PFS from the date of diagnosis to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease (based on radiological assessment) or death from any cause. It is assumed that PFS follows an exponential distribution., Baseline to disease progression (Up to 38 months)|Prognostic Factors: Platinum Sensitivity, Participants who had disease progression within 6 months of ending their last regimen of platinum therapy were considered platinum resistant. Participants who had disease progression between 6 and 12 months of ending their last platinum regimen were considered platinum sensitive. Participants who had disease progression beyond 12 months of ending their last platinum regimen were also considered platinum sensitive., Baseline|Prognostic Factors: Performance Status, Performance Status 0 = Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction Performance Status 1 = Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of light or sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office work., Baseline|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) time is defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause. For participants who are still alive at the time of analysis, survival time will be censored at the last contact date., Baseline through end of study (Up to 45 months)
The purpose is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of the study agent, enzastaurin, in participants with recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer.
