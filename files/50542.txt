Shorter Radiation Schedule for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer
To improve the management of patients with early stage prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: 5250 cGy/20 fractions over 28 days|PROCEDURE: 6600 cGy/33 fractions over 45 days
time to PSA failure, 10 years
positive biopsy at two years post radiation, see above|disease free survival, 10 years|toxicity, 10 years|quality of life, 6 years|economic, 10 years
To compare the efficacy of a shorter radiation fractionation schedule to the prostate (5250 cGy/20 fractions over 28 days) with a conventional schedule (6600 cGy/33 fractions over 45 days) in men receiving radiotherapy for Stage T1a moderately or poorly differentiated, or T1b, T1c, or T2 prostate cancer. The primary outcome is local control in the prostate and secondary outcomes include toxicity, disease free survival, survival, quality of life and economics.
