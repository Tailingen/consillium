Efficacy Study of Comprehensive Rehabilitation Program in Postoperative NSCLC Patients
The investigators performed a multi-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective clinical trial on the effect of comprehensive rehabilitation program to improve quality of life(QOL) and long-term survival of postoperative patients with early lung cancer. The investigators plan to enroll 236 cases in 3 years (118 cases for rehabilitation training plus traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), 118 cases for rehabilitation education plus placebo), expecting that comprehensive rehabilitation program has a better efficacy on improving QOL and long-term survival.

Change from baseline in Quality of life (QOL), QOL is assessed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 43 (EORTC QLQ-LC43)., baseline, at 3 months
Residual capacity (RV), RV is measured in a test known as Lung valume(LV)spirometry,a type of pulmonary function test.RV is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after a maximal expiratory effort., after intervention at 2 weeks|Total lung capacity（TLC）, TLC is measured in a test known as Lung valume(LV)spirometry,a type of pulmonary function test.TLC equals the vital capacity plus the residual capacity., after intervention at 2 weeks|Forced vital capacity (FVC), FVC is the volume of air exhaled with maximum effort and speed after a full inspiration. FVC is measured in a test known as spirometry, a type of pulmonary function test., after intervention at 2 weeks|Forced expiratory volume in one second(FEV1), FEV1 is an individual test measure used to assess limitations in airflow, a type of pulmonary function test,which measures the amount of air exhaled in onesecond., after intervention at 2 weeks|Maximum mid expiratory flow(MMEF), MMEF is forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity,a type of pulmonary function test., after intervention at 2 weeks|Disease-free survival (DFS), Time from randomization to first recurrence or metastasis, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|TCM symptoms changes, TCM symptoms changes are according to the lung cancer symptom classification quantization table in "Guiding Principles for Clinical Research of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Lung Cancer (2002 Edition)", after intervention at 3 months|Tumor markers, Tumor markers include CEA, CA-125 and CYFRA21-1, after intervention at 3 months|Safety assessment evaluated according to Common Toxicity Criteria, Safety assessment is evaluated according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC 3.0), after intervention at 3 months
Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer（NSCLC）is one of the malignancies with high incidence and mortality. In recent years, surgery become the preferred treatment for early stage of NSCLC. Patients with stage IA-IIIA lung cancer can undergo radical surgery, but postoperative lung cancer patients also have shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, expectoration, upper limb dysfunction and other symptoms. The symptoms seriously affect the quality of life and follow-up treatment. Comprehensive rehabilitation program may alleviate the symptoms as an effective treatment which including rehabilitation training and TCM.

The investigators performed a multi-centered, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective clinical trial on the effect of comprehensive rehabilitation program to improve quality of life(QOL) and long-term survival of postoperative patients who are not recommended for postoperative chemotherapy at stage IA and IB. Patients are randomized into observational group (rehabilitation training plus TCM), and control group (rehabilitation education plus placebo). The treatment should be last three months and the patients will be followed up regularly. The primary efficacy assessments are: (1) QOL (QLQ-LC43 scale); (2) Pulmonary function test(PFTs): 1) Forced vital capacity (FVC); 2) Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1); 3) Forced expiratory flow rate from 25% to 50% (FEF25-50); 4) Residual volume (RV); 5) Total lung capacity (TLC). Secondary efficacy assessments are: (1) 2 years disease-free survival; (2) TCM symptoms changes; (3) Tumer markers (CEA, CA-125 and CYFRA21-1); (4) Exercise tolerance; (5) Toxicity, side effects and security of the treatments will be assessed at the same time. The investigators plan to enroll 236 cases in 3 years (118 cases for rehabilitation training plus TCM, 118 cases for rehabilitation education plus placebo), expecting that comprehensive rehabilitation program has a better efficacy on improving QOL and long-term survival.
