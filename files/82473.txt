Accuracy of the LiverVision® Semi-automated Liver Volumetry Software
The LiverVision® software was designed to provide three-dimensional (3D) visualisation of the liver using Computed Tomography (CT) scans. It provides semi-automated volumetry measurements, vascular structure and territory tools.

Liver volumetry has been widely used in liver surgery and living donor liver transplantation to estimate the future liver remnant or the required liver volume for the recipient, respectively.

Liver volumetry is typically performed using CT imaging with specially designed software. Such manual measurements are time consuming and there is an ongoing debate whether the they reflect the actual liver volume when performed by radiologists or surgeons as well as according to the different software currently available in the market.
