MRE Evaluation for Spinal Cord Tumor Surgery: Stiffness and Adhesion Assessment
In spinal cord tumors requiring surgical intervention, the resection difficulty is determined by two significant factors: tumor stiffness and adhesion to surrounding tissue.

The stiffness of the tumor dictates the complexity of removal, while strong adhesion presents additional challenges during the surgical procedure.

This clinical trial aims to assess the clinical utility of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), in evaluating the stiffness and adhesion of spinal cord tumors and guiding surgical planning to selecting the most appropriate surgical approach for patients with spinal cord tumors.

Surgical assessment of tumor stiffness, The surgeon will score the tumor stiffness in seven aspects, ranging from 1 to 5 points: Tumor size; Shape of tumor; Tumor texture; Stiffness of the tumor's capsule; Stiffness of the tumor's central region; Primary methods of tumor removal; Features of tumor's capsule., Baseline to 6 weeks|Surgical assessment of tumor adhesion, The surgeon will score the tumor's adhesion based on seven aspects, ranging from 1 to 4 points: Stripping instruments; Frequency of use of sharp instruments; Adhesion range; Degree of tumor resection; Cranial nerve anatomy preservation; Brain tissue anatomy preservation; Neurological function (compared with preoperative)., Baseline to 6 weeks
Spinal cord tumors are a common condition in neurosurgery, including neurofibroma, spinal meningioma, ependymoma, glioma, spinal lipoma, and so on.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the preoperative evaluation and planning of spinal cord tumor surgery. It provides detailed information about the tumor's location, size, and relationship to adjacent structures.

However, routine MRI may not always provide sufficient information about the tumor's stiffness or adhesion, which can impact surgical planning and postoperative outcomes. Magnetic resonance elastography and slip interface imaging can help measure the mechanical properties of tissues, including their stiffness or adhesion.

By combining the above methods, surgeons can identify areas of potential tumor adherence or invasion into surrounding structures, allowing for more precise surgical resection and minimizing the risk of damage to critical neural tissue.
