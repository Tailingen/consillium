Study of Tislelizumab Combined With DisitamabVedotin and Pyrotinib Maleate in HER2-positive or Mutated Advanced Colorectal Cancer Who Failed Standard Therapy
This study will explore the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab (PD1 inhibitor) combined with DisitamabVedotin (ADC) and pyrotinib maleate (TKI) in the treatment of HER2-positive or mutated advanced colorectal cancer who have failed standard therapy .
HER2-positive or Mutated Advanced Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Tislelizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), It is defined as the number of subjects with the best response effect as complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) during the period from the start of the subjects receiving the treatment regimen of this study to the progression of the subjects' disease in the total number of subjects in the analysis data set. percentage of the population（%）., Up to 24 months
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the number of subjects whose tumors shrank or remained stable for a certain period of time from receiving the treatment regimen of this study to the progression of the subject's disease, including complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) in the analysis data set percentage of the total population（%）., Up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from randomization to tumor progression in any aspect or death from any cause（Unit: month）.

Assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, analysis of this indicator included tumor evaluation results during study treatment and follow-up. If the patient has several indicators that can be judged as PD, the first indicator will be used for PFS analysis; recurrence, new lesions or death are considered to have reached the end of the study, and the patient is treated with other systemic or target-targeted anti-PD. Tumor treatment is also considered tumor progression., Up to 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause（Unit: month）., Up to 24 months|Drug-Related Safety Indicators, Exposure to the investigational drug and incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events, including serious adverse events（n，%）。, Up to 24 months|Study on the mechanism of drug resistance after progression, Changes in HER2 status, HER2 gene, and HER2-related signaling pathways before and after treatment.

Note: HER2 positive means that in the pathological detection/recheck of the primary or metastatic lesions performed by the pathology department, at least one tumor cell immunohistochemical staining intensity of 3+ or immunohistochemical staining intensity of 2+ and fluorescence in situ hybridization Technical \[FISH\] confirmed positive or NGS confirmed advanced colorectal cancer patients with HER2 gene amplification or mutation., Up to 24 months
