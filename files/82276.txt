Effect of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme and Sacubitril Valsartan in Patients After Bone Marrow Transplantation
The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of ACE inhibitors and the sacubitril-valsartan complex in bone marrow transplant patients by assessing cardiovascular and endothelial parameters in order to search for a potent protective role.
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|Cardiotoxicity
DRUG: ACE inhibitor, Sacubitril-Valsartan
Effect of treatment in Left Ventricular Function, Left Ventricular Function is assessed by calculating Ejection fraction by 3D echocardiography., 2 years|Effect of treatment in left ventricular function, Left Ventricular function is assessed by Global Longitudinal Strain by speckle tracking echocardiography, 2 years|Effect of treatment in arterial stiffness, Arterial Stiffness is evaluated by Pulse Wave Velocity, 2 years|Effect of treatment in glycocalyx thickness, Glycocalyx thickness is assessed by measuring perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (range 5-25 Âµm, 2 years
The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of ACE inhibitors and the sacubitril-valsartan complex in bone marrow transplant patients in preventing cardiotoxicity when administered immediately after transplantation.

The effect of medication will be studied in detail:

i) in global longitudinal strain of left ventricle (GLS), ii) in the volume change of the right and the left ventricle, through the cardiac cycle using 3D echocardiography, iii) in the Myocardial Work Index (MWI) of the left ventricle, with a strain -pressure curve study iv) in the 4D strain of the left atrium, v) in elastic properties of aorta (pulse wave velocity (PWV), central systolic pressure (CSBP-mmHg) and augmentation index (Aix%), vii) in permeability of glycocalyx and viii) in serum biomarker values, namely troponin I high sensitivity and atrial natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).
