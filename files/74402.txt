Study of Bafetinib (INNO-406) as Treatment for Patients With Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer
This is a Phase II open-label study evaluating the preliminary efficacy and safety of bafetinib administered as 240 mg orally twice daily in subjects with Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer.
Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Bafetinib
Objective Response Rate, The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy of administration of bafetinib in subjects with hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), as measured by the objective response rate (ORR), which is a combination of CR (PSA ≤0.12 ng/mL) and PR (≥50% reduction in PSA from baseline)., At six months.
Safety, The safety of bafetinib in this population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, and vital signs., At six months.|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment to first documentation of objective PSA or tumor progression, or to death due to any cause in the absence of previous documentation of objective tumor progression., At six months.|Objective tumor response, The total proportion of subjects who have an objective tumor reponse (CR + PR) using the RECIST criteria., At six months.
This is a Phase II open-label study evaluating the preliminary efficacy and safety of bafetinib administered as 240 mg orally twice daily in subjects with Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer.
