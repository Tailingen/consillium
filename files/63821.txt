Analysis of Oncogenes in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma or Mixed Hepatocellular-Cholangiocarcinoma in Tumor Tissue Samples
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the frequency of FGFR2 fusions in archived intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) or mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (HCC-CCA) tumor samples
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma|Mixed Hepatocellular Cholangiocarcinoma|Cholangiocarcinoma
Estimate the frequency of FGFR2 fusions in archived iCCA or mixed HCC-CCA tumor tissue samples, Archived tumor samples will be collected and analyzed using a Next Generation Sequencing panel., Archived tumor samples will be collected through study completion, up to 18 months
Determine the frequency of potential actionable mutations or genetic alterations in iCCA or mixed HCC-CCA, Archived tumor samples will be collected and analyzed using a Next Generation Sequencing panel., Archived tumor samples will be collected through study completion, up to 18 months|Formulate genetic screening recommendations for newly diagnosed patients with iCCA or mixed HCC-CCA, Archived tumor samples will be collected and analyzed using a Next Generation Sequencing panel., Archived tumor samples will be collected through study completion, up to 18 months
This is a non-interventional, observational study of archived human tissue samples; no surgical procedures will be required and no treatment will be provided as part of this study. Approximately 150 archived tissue samples obtained from patients with iCCA or mixed HCC-CCA will be analyzed for somatic alteration status and will include cholangiocarcinoma-specific FGFR2 fusion isoforms.
