Study of ADG206 in Subjects With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
ADG206 is an activatable prodrug form of a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass that specifically targets cluster of differentiation 137 (CD137) (also known as 4-1BB) as a co-stimulatory receptor agonist for the treatment of advanced malignancies.
Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: ADG206
Number of participants experiencing dose-limiting toxicities escalating dose levels, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of participants with adverse events (AE), At the end of 90 days post last dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Maximum administered dose (MAD) of ADG206, At the end of the last dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ADG 206, At the end of the last dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ADG206, At the end of the last dose (each cycle is 21 days)
The area under the curve (AUC) of plasma concentration of drug, At the end of the last dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Immunogenicity endpoints include antidrug antibodies (ADAs), At the end of the last dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Maximum concentration (Cmax), At the end of the last dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), At the end of the last dose (each cycle is 21 days)|Lowest plasma concentration (C[trough]), At the end of the last dose (each cycle is 21 days)
This is a FIH, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, sequential dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of ADG206 in subjects with advanced/metastatic malignancies.

Primary Objective of the study: To assess safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels of ADG206 in subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors who have exhausted their treatment alternatives.
