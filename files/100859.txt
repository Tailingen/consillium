Lapatinib Plus Chemotherapy Versus Trastuzumab Plus Chemotherapy in HER2-positive Breast Cancer
This is a prospective, open-label, real-word study evaluating the efficacy and safety of lapatinib in combination with chemotherapy versus trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy in women with HER2-positive and p95HER2-positive ,or PI3K mutation, or PTEN loss breast cancer . Eligible subjects will have newly diagnosed breast cancer (Stage II-III) ; not have received systemic or local treatment . The primary endpoint was the rate of pathological complete response (pCR). The secondary objectives are to evaluate overall survival, overall response rate, clinical benefit response rate and the safety as well as tolerability of lapatinib plus chemotherapy and trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.

Patients will receive lapatinib 1000 mg daily or trastuzumab 4 mg/kg intravenous (IV) load followed by 2 mg/kg IV weekly for a total of 12 weeks. After surgery, patients planned total duration of the anti-HER2 therapy will be one year.
