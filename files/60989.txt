Study to Evaluate Adverse Events, Change in Disease Activity, and How ABBV-706 Moves Through the Body When Intravenously (IV) Infused Alone or in Combination With IV Infused Budigalimab, Cisplatin, or Carboplatin in Adult Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
Cancer is a condition where cells in a specific part of body grow and reproduce uncontrollably. The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of ABBV-706 as a monotherapy and in combination with budigalimab, carboplatin, or cisplatin.

ABBV-706 is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), high-grade central nervous system (CNS) tumors and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). There are multiple treatment arms in this study. Participants will either receive ABBV-706 as a single agent or in combination with budigalimab (another investigational drug), carboplatin or cisplatin at different doses. Approximately 350 adult participants will be enrolled in the study across sites worldwide.

In part 1 (dose escalation), ABBV-706 will be intravenously infused in escalating doses as a monotherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined in participants with SCLC, high-grade CNS tumors, and high-grade NECs. In part 2, multiple doses will be selected from Part 1 and SCLC participants will be assigned to one of these doses in a randomized fashion to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose. In Part 3a, participants with SCLC or NECs will receive ABBV-706 in combination with budigalimab intravenously every 3 weeks. In Part 3b participants with SCLC or NECs will receive ABBV-706 in combination with either carboplatin or cisplatin intravenously. In Part 4a, participants with CNS tumors will receive ABBV-706 intravenously at a dose determined from Part 1. In Part 4b, participants with NECs will receive ABBV-706 intravenously at a dose selected from Part 1. The estimated duration of the study is up to 3 years.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic and may require frequent medical assessments, blood tests, and scans.
