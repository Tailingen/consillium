Assess the Efficacy of Pembrolizumab Plus Radiotherapy or Ablation in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients
The radiation therapy or ablation that the patient received as standard therapy treated only the tumors that were radiated or ablated. Radiation therapy or ablation plus pembrolizumab might lead to a stronger immune response that may control or destroy tumors that did not receive radiation therapy or ablation. The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, pembrolizumab has on the patient, and the cancer that did not receive radiation therapy or ablation.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency ablation
response rate, If at the end of the study â‰¥3 tumor responses per RECIST 1.1 are observed in a cohort, then further investigation of pembrolizumab plus RT and/or pembrolizumab plus ablation will be considered worthwhile., approximately 9 weeks
Toxicity, All recorded toxicity will be listed and tabulated by system organ class, preferred term and treatment. Any significant vital signs and clinical laboratory test results will be listed and summarized. Any significant physical examination findings, and clinical laboratory results will be listed. Will be recorded according to "Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events" V4.0 (CTCAE)., 2 years
