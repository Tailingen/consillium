Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Breast Cancer After Neoadjuvant Therapy
The aim of this study is to create clear indications for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) or Axillary Dissection (AD) in women with breast carcinoma after neoadjuvant therapy by studying the false negative rate of SLNB.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)|PROCEDURE: Axillary dissection
Clear indications for SLNB or axillary dissection, Clear indications for SLNB or axillary dissection (AD) in women with breast carcinoma after neoadjuvant therapy using false-negativity rate of SLNB. False-negativity rate of SLNB under 10% is acceptable for avoiding AD., 24 months
Morbidity, Morbidity after SLNB and AD will be assessed by check-ups provided by clinicians. The result will be the percentage of patients which suffer from some complications after SLNB or AD. Common morbidity rate after AD is 20%, after SLNB 1-2%., 24 months|Changes in the Quality of Life, Changes in the Quality of Life will be assessed using the standardised World Health Organisation Quality of Life (WHOQOL) questionnaire., 24 months|Overall Survival, The overall survival (in months, years) of the patients will be assessed., 24 months|Disease-free Survival, The disease-free survival (in months, years) of the patients will be assessed., 24 months|Progression-free Survival, The progression-free survival (in months, years) of the patients will be assessed., 24 months
The main object of the study is to evaluate, whether sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) at women with breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy is a method with a high false-negative rate. Patients will be classified into groups according to histological findings during SLNB, clinical and ultrasonography (USG) findings in the axilla. The aim of this study is to create clear indications for SLNB or axillary dissection (AD). In case of extension of SLNB indications, there will be a decrease in morbidity after surgical therapy when compared to AD, which will mean a profit for the patients.
