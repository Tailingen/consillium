MASCT-I Treatment for Advanced Solid Tumor
Multiple Target Antigen Stimulating Cell Therapy (MASCT-I) is a new immunotherapy that dendritic cells(DC) was induced from autologous peripheral blood. The DC can then be loaded with antigens and re-infused. In vitro, antigen-pulsed DC can stimulate autologous T-cell proliferation and induction of autologous specific cytotoxic T-cells(CTL)ï¼Œsimilarly re-infused. The previous research data showed that MASCT had the modest overall response and less adverse effects for Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients.

The study is aimed to evaluate the safety of MASCT-1 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: MASCT-I
Incidence of treatment-related adverse events, The incidence of treatment-related adverse events were graded with the use of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, versio4.0, up to 2 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), clinical response of treatment according to RESIST v1.1 criteria, up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate is defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) based on RESIST v1.1 criteria., up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The length of time from enrollment until the time of progression of disease, From enrollment to progression of disease. Estimated about 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), From enrollment to death of patients, up to 2 years
The relationship between clinical efficacy and antigen specific immune response, up to 2 years
This study is divided into two stages. The first stage is the safety study in small samples, and the second stage is the sample size expansion phase.

40-50 patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors who had failed after standard treatment will be recruited in this study.
