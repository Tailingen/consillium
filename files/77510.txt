Biomarker Study of in Men With PSA Progression on Abi for CR or CS PC (Bio-STAMP)
This is a multicenter, Phase II randomized biomarker-based therapeutic study in metastatic prostate cancer experiencing prostate specific antigen (PSA) only progression (without visceral, bone or lymph node progression) while on abiraterone therapy.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Dutasteride|DRUG: Abiraterone
Number of patients with radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) rate, Count the the number of patients with radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), 24 Weeks after study treatment
Determine overall survival (OS), The Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator will be used to estimate OS distribution, 24 months from start of treatment assignment|Number of patients with a PSA decline of â‰¥ 50%, Count the number of patients with serologic progression. It is defined as an increase in the PSA level of more than 50% above the nadir with two consecutive increases confirmed at least 2 weeks apart., 24 weeks of adding of adding high-dose dutasteride
