A Study of MK-4700 Alone or With Pembrolizumab in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors (MK-4700-001)
The goal of this study is to learn about the safety of different doses of MK-4700 and if people tolerate them. The study will also measure what happens in a person's body over time when MK-4700 is given alone or with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in order to find a dose that is safe, tolerated, and may work to treat certain types of cancer.
Malignant Neoplasm
BIOLOGICAL: MK-4700|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The occurrence of any of the following toxicities during Cycle 1 will be considered a DLT, if assessed by the investigator related to study intervention administration:

* Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity
* Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days, except thrombocytopenia
* Any nonhematologic AE ≥Grade 3 in severity, with exceptions
* Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 nonhematologic laboratory value, as with pre-specified exceptions
* Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, with the exceptions
* Febrile neutropenia Grade 3 or Grade 4
* Prolonged delay (\>2 weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to intervention-related toxicity
* Any study drug toxicity that causes the participant to discontinue study drug during Cycle 1
* Missing \>25% of MK-4700 doses as a result of drug-related AEs during the first cycle
* Grade 5 toxicity, Cycle 1 (up to 21 days)|Percentage of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to approximately 4.5 years|Percentage of Participants who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to approximately 4.5 years
Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve of MK-4700, AUC is defined as the area under the concentration versus time curve. Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified timepoints to determine AUC., Predose and at prespecified time points during Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 up to approximately 7 months (Cycle length is 21 days)|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of MK-4700, Cmax is defined as the maximum concentration of MK-4700 observed in plasma after its administration and just prior to administration of the next dose. Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified timepoints to determine Cmax., Predose and at prespecified time points during Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 up to approximately 7 months (Cycle length is 21 days)|Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of MK-4700, Cmin is defined as the minimum concentration of MK-4700 observed in plasma after its administration and just prior to administration of the next dose. Blood samples will be collected at pre-specified timepoints to determine Cmin., Predose and at prespecified time points during Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 up to approximately 7 months (Cycle length is 21 days)
