BEHAVIORAL: Breast Cancer Clinical Trials Education Program
Educational Post-Intervention Changes in Participants' Breast Cancer Clinical Trials-Using Standardized Personal Health Survey., The study administered standardized psychosocial measure (Personal Health Survey) at baseline.

Knowledge and participation in clinical trials is disproportionately low among minorities. The purpose of this study is to test a program designed to increase African American and Hispanic American women's scientific literacy, knowledge of clinical trials, and to facilitate breast cancer clinical trial participation.

A validation study was also conducted to validate several measures for the Hispanic American and African American populations.

The experimental group watched an education program concerning breast cancer clinical trials while the control group watched an education program on neighborhood safety.

To examine willingness to participate in research was assessed by a post-intervention invitation to complete a sleep diary.
