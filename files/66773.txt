This study is designed to evaluate the importance of the immune cells localization (distribution) between malignant tumor islets and surrounding stroma and to investigate the associations between these immune cells as well as cytokines and clinicopathological and prognostic factors of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
