T Cells Expressing a Bispecific CAR Targeting CS1 and BCMA in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the bispecific CAR T cells targeting CS1 and BCMA in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
CS1+ or BCMA+ Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: Conditioning chemotherapy followed by CAR T cell infusion
Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events, Therapy-related adverse events will be recorded and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0)., within 2 years after infusion
Overall response rate(ORR) and complete response rate(CRR) of administering T cells Expressing a bispecific CAR Targeting CS1 and BCMA in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma, OR and CRR will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 2 years after infusion|Overall survival(OS), duration of Response(DOR), progress-free survival(PFS) of administering T cells Expressing a bispecific CAR Targeting CS1 and BCMA in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma, OS, PFS and DOR will be assessed from CAR T cell infusion to death or last follow-up (censored)., 2 years after infusion
In vivo expansion and survival of CS1&BCMA bispecific CAR T cells, In vivo (bone marrow and peripheral blood) rate and quantity will be determined by using flow cytometry and qPCR., 2 years after infusion
* Multiple myeloma(MM) is one of the most common hematological malignancies with substantial morbidity and mortality.
* In recent years, several new therapies have prolonged survival of patients with MM, but it is still an incurable malignancy of plasma cells.
* B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is expressed by normal and malignant plasma cells and a small subset of B cells. This specific expression pattern makes BCMA an ideal target antigen for immunotherapies in MM.
* BCMA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have exhibited significant efficacy in MM, but relapse due to single-target escape or poor in vivo persistence has been reported.
* Dual-targets or sequential infusion have been proposed to reduce relapse and improve outcomes post BCMA-specific CAR T therapies.
* CS1 is expressed on pro-B cells and plasma cells especially malignant ones and some evidence suggests it plays a role in stromal cell interaction in the BM tumour microenvironment.
* We have constructed a bispecific CAR containing anti-CS1 single chain variable region (scFv) and an anti-BCMA scFv in 4-1BB-containing second-generation formats.
* The bispecific CAR T cells have exhibited potent cytotoxicity in various BCMA+ or/and CS1+ MM cells and can effectively eradicate MM cells in xenograft mice models.
* This study aims to evaluate prelimary safety and efficacy of the CS1\&BCMA CAR T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory MM.
