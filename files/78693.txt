Study to Assess Abivertinib in Combination With Abiraterone in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy of abivertinib with abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

6-month radiographic progression-free survival, 6-month radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) will be assessed as defined by percent of subjects alive and without progression by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 for measurable disease and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria for bone metastases., baseline through study completion at up to approximately 63 months
Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate (ORR) will be defined by percent of subjects alive and without progression by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., baseline through study completion at up to approximately 63 months|Duration of response, duration of response will be defined as the time from the first documented response in patients with measurable disease to the date of progression or death due to any cause., baseline through study completion at up to approximately 63 months|Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) progression, Change in PSA as compared to baseline as defined by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria, baseline through study completion at up to approximately 63 months|Safety and tolerability, Safety and tolerability of abivertinib with abiraterone using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 criteria., baseline through study completion at up to approximately 63 months|Time to occurrence of first skeletal event, Time to occurrence of first symptomatic skeletal event will be defined as the time from enrollment to the first symptomatic skeletal event defined as use of external beam radiotherapy to relieve skeletal symptoms or the occurrence of new symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral or non-vertebral) or the occurrence of spinal cord compression or a tumor related orthopedic surgical intervention., baseline through study completion at up to approximately 63 months|Time to first subsequent anti-cancer therapy, Time to first subsequent anti-cancer therapy will be defined as the time from treatment discontinuation for any reason to start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy or death., baseline through study completion at up to approximately 63 months|6-month radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), 6-month radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) will be defined as the time from enrollment to progression by by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 for measurable disease and and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria for bone metastases or death, whichever occurs first., baseline through study completion at up to approximately 63 months|Overall survival, Overall survival will be defined as the time from enrollment to death, baseline through study completion at up to approximately 63 months
This is a phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy of abivertinib with abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer via assessment of 6-month radiographic progression-free survival. The study will include two cohorts, abiraterone-naive and abiraterone-progressing.
