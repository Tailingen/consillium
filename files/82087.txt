To create a prospective cohort of subjects with increased probability of being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and identify pancreatic cancer in this cohort., We will prospectively identify patients with newly diagnosed diabetes and perform pancreatic imaging to identify pancreatic cancer, Follow subjects for 2 years.
Compared to the general population, subjects \>50 years of age with new-onset diabetes (DM) are 8-times more likely to have pancreatic cancer (PaC). The likelihood of PaC in new-onset DM is further increased in those who have weight loss or elevated CA19-9. In this study patients with newly diagnosed diabetes will be prospectively identified. Those with weight loss and/or elevated pancreatic cancer marker (CA 19-9) will undergo pancreatic imaging. All subjects will be followed up to 24 months. If successful in identifying surgically removable PaC, this study will fundamentally change our practice and will be a major breakthrough in PaC treatment and research.
