AZD0305 as Monotherapy or in Combination With Anticancer Agents in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase I/II, modular, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation, and dose expansion/optimization study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of AZD0305 in participants with RRMM.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: AZD0305
Occurrence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), as defined in the protocol (Phase Ia dose escalation only), A DLT is defined as any toxicity that occurs from the first dose of study treatment up to and including the planned end of Cycle 1 (the DLT assessment period) that is assessed as unrelated to the disease or disease-related processes under investigation and which includes, any death not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes, pre-defined haematological and non-haematological toxicities, From first dose of study treatment until the end of Cycle 1|Incidence and severity of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of patients with adverse events and serious adverse events by system organ class and preferred term, From time of Informed consent to 30 days post end of treatment

This is a Phase I/II, modular, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation, and dose expansion/optimization study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of AZD0305 in participants with RRMM. This study will follow a modular protocol design evaluating AZD0305 as monotherapy and in combination with other anticancer agents.

The study includes dose escalation and dose expansion phases. This study will enroll subjects with RRMM who received at least 3 prior lines of treatment including at least one proteasome inhibitor (PI), one immunomodulator (IMiD), and an anti-CD38 antibody.
