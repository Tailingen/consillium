Phase 2 Study of Nimotuzumab in Pediatric Recurrent Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma
This is a phase 2, single-arm, multi-center study, with a safety review component, designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab in approximately 44 patients with recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) following one previous regimen for their disease. Patients must be diagnosed with radiologically verified recurrent diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma that is measurable in at least two dimensions. Patients are eligible without histologic confirmation. Treatment regimen will consist of two phases-induction and consolidation.
Recurrent Diffuse Pontine Gliomas
BIOLOGICAL: nimotuzumab (anti EGFR humanized monoclonal antibody)
To determine the objective response rate, To determine response rate on week 18
To evaluate the safety profile of single agent nimotuzumab in this population, safety will be evaluated after each study drug administration
