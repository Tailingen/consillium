High Dose Icotinib With Sequential SRS For NSCLC Patients Harboring EGFR Mutation With Brain Metastases
This trail is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of high dose Iconitib combined with SRS for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutation with brain metastases.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Brain Metastases
DRUG: Icotinib|RADIATION: SRS
intracranial progression-free survival, from date of randomization until the date of first documented intracranial progression, assessed up to 12 months.
progress-free survival, from date of randomization until the date of extracranial progression, assessed up to 18 months.|overall survival, from date of randomization until the date of death, assessed up to 36 months.|objective response rate, from date of randomization until the date of progression, assessed up to 12 months.|disease control rate, from date of randomization until the date of progression, assessed up to 18 months.|Quality of life measured by FACT-L/LCS 4.0 and FACT-Br, from date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months.
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CJ-CAE3.0, from date of randomization until the date of death, assessed up to 2 months.
The long-term control of brain metastases becomes a clinical challenge. Whole brain radiotherapy, the standard treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases, can only bring a modest survival improvement around 3-6 months. EGFR-TKIs like icotinib with its proven activity in non-small cell lung cancer may provide clinical benefits to brain metastases patients.
