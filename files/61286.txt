Study of Camrelizumab Plus Apatinib and Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Participants With Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with apatinib and chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in participants with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Apatinib|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
pCR rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive tumor on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in all participants., Up to approximately 28 weeks
pCR rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis (i.e., absence of invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis) is defined as the percentage of participants without invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in all participants., Up to approximately 28 weeks|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as percentage of participants with best (confirmed) overall response (BOR) of either CR or PR. ORR was assessed by the investigator according to RECIST version 1.1 and is based on BOR, which is defined as best response recorded from start of study treatment until definitive surgery or disease progression., Up to approximately 28 weeks|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|Invasive Disease-Free Survival (iDFS), iDFS events are defined as follows: (1) Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence. (2) Ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence. (3) Ipsilateral second primary invasive breast cancer. (4) Contralateral invasive breast cancer. (5) Distant recurrence. (6) Death attributable to any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|Adverse events (AEs), AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.

In general, AEs are graded according to the following: Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE.

The type, grade and frequency of AEs will be reported., Up to approximately 37 weeks
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with apatinib and chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy in participants with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).
