FITBIT Study on Mobility and Readmissions After Radical Cystectomy
This is a two-arm randomized, controlled trial during the postoperative period after major abdominal surgery for cancer, including for example radical cystectomy, nephrectomy, colectomy, comparing a control group that uses a wearable device to track physical activity to an intervention group that uses the same wearable devices and receives a supportive social incentive-based gamification intervention to adhere to a step goal program.
Bladder Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: social incentive-based gamification
Change in Mean Daily Step Count From the Baseline Step Count During Two Days After the Surgery to the Hospital Discharge, Change in mean daily step count, From baseline step count after a two-day run-in period after the surgery to the time of hospital discharge postoperatively. As the time to discharge was variable, this time period was up to 60 days after surgery
Change in Mean Daily Step Count From the Postoperative Baseline to 3 Months After Discharge From the Hospital, Change in mean daily step count, From the postoperative baseline step count during 2 day run-in to 3 months after discharge from the hospital. This time was up to 3 months after discharge
Rate of Placement to Skilled Nursing Facility After Hospital Discharge, Rate of placement to skilled nursing facility postoperatively, 13 weeks after hospital discharge|Rate of 90 Day Hospital Readmission After Hospital Discharge, Rate of 90 day hospital readmission, 90 days after hospital discharge|Rate of Postoperative Complications, Rate of complications after the surgery, Immediately after the surgery to 3 months postoperatively|Rate of Postoperative Delirium, Rate of delirium after the surgery, Immediately after the surgery to 3 months postoperatively
We will conduct a two-arm randomized, controlled trial during the postoperative period after a radical cystectomy for bladder cancer, comparing a control group that uses a wearable device to track physical activity to an intervention group that uses the same wearable devices and receives a supportive social incentive-based gamification intervention to adhere to a step goal program. Patients will be enrolled after being diagnosed with bladder cancer and scheduled to undergo a radical cystectomy. The median length of stay after a radical cystectomy is 8 days, with 90% being discharged within two weeks. Postoperatively, the baseline step count will be averaged by taking the steps taken during the first two days outside of the intensive care unit. There will be two postoperative phases: Phase I will be while the patient is hospitalized postoperatively. Phase II will be when the patient is discharged for three months.
