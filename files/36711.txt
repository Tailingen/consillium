Effectiveness of a Rehabilitation Program in Improving Quality of Life in Patients With Esophageal Cancer
This study will investigate the effectiveness of a rehabilitation program in improving sleep quality, emotional distress, circadian rhythms, and quality of life in patients with esophageal cancer in Taiwan.

Hypothesis:

1. The quality of life in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and 36th month.
2. The quality of sleep in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and 36th month.
3. The emotional distress in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and 36th month.
4. The circadian rhythms in exercise group is significant improving than usual-care group at 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and 36th month.
