Surgery Followed by Risk-Directed Post-Operative Adjuvant Therapy for HPV-Related Oropharynx Squamous Cell Carcinoma: "The Minimalist Trial (MINT)"
The overarching goal of the MINT trial is to reduce treatment-related toxicity while maintaining efficacy. Patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) will undergo resection of the primary tumor site and involved/at risk regional neck nodes.
HPV Related Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Intensity modulated radiation therapy|RADIATION: Intensity modulated proton therapy|PROCEDURE: Surgery|OTHER: FACT-H&N|OTHER: MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory|OTHER: University of Michigan Xerostomia Index|OTHER: Scale of Subjective Total Taste Acuity|OTHER: Neck Dissection Impairment Index
Mean Percent Weight Change, * Weight in kilograms will be collected weekly during radiation
* The percent weight loss from the baseline is calculated at any post-baseline, Starting at Day 1 and ending on the last day of radiation therapy (approximately 4 weeks)
Proportion of PEG Tube Placements in Each Arm, -95% confidence intervals will be calculated assuming a binomial distribution, Through completion of follow-up (approximately 63 months)|Change in Serum Creatinine, Baseline to 6 weeks after POAmCRT (approximately 90 days)|Percentage of Participants Taking Narcotics, -95% confidence intervals will be calculated assuming a binomial distribution, 6 weeks after POAmCRT (approximately 90 days)|Disease Recurrence Rate, 24 months post-treatment (approximately 27 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Through completion of follow-up (approximately 63 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Through completion of follow-up (approximately 63 months)
Comparison of Quality of Life as Measured by the Neck Dissection Impairment Index, -10-item self-administered questionnaire, which was designed to assess "quality of life related to shoulder dysfunction" after neck dissection. A 5-point response option (1 to 5) is provided for each item, with 1 being the most disability and 5 the least disability. The responses for all 10 items are added together to produce a raw score, which is then transformed to a score of 100 maximum. Higher scores represent less disability.

--Captured at baseline, interim assessment (14-42 days post-surgery), Day 1 of radiation, Day 21 after start of radiation, Day 36 after start of radiation, and 6 weeks/4 months/6 months/12 months after completion of adjuvant therapy, From baseline through one year after completion of treatment (approximately 15 months)|Comparison of Quality of Life as Measured by the Scale of Subjective Total Taste Acuity, -Measures total taste acuity with the patient choosing the appropriate answer ranging from 0=same taste acuity as before treatment to 4=almost complete or complete loss of taste acuity, From baseline through one year after completion of treatment (approximately 15 months)|Comparison of Quality of Life as Measured by the University of Michigan Xerostomia Index, * Measures impact of salivary gland dysfunction \& xerostomia. Scale consists of 15 items covering 4 major domains of oral health-related quality of life: physical functioning, personal/psychological functioning, social functioning, \& pain/discomfort issues
* Patients answer the questions by checking the box that describes the best statement for the past 7 days (not at all, a little, somewhat, quite a bit, very much), 1-5 scale. Higher scores represent greater degree of symptoms. Physical functioning based upon responses to items 1, 6, 10, 12. Pain/discomfort issues based upon responses to items 2, 3, 7, 9. Personal/psychological functioning based upon responses to items 8, 13, 14, 15. Social functioning based upon responses to items 4, 5, 11
* Captured at baseline, interim assessment (14-42 days post-surgery), Day 1 of radiation, Day 21 after start of radiation, Day 36 after start of radiation, \& 6 weeks/4 months/6 months/12 months after completion of adjuvant therapy, From baseline through one year after completion of treatment (approximately 15 months)|Comparison of Quality of Life as Measured by the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory, * Consists of 20 items. Besides a global assessment (a single question), it comprises three subscales: the emotional subscale (8 items), the functional subscale (5 items), and the physical subscale (6 items). The global assessment refers to the individual's swallowing difficulty as it affects one's overall daily routine. The emotional, functional, and physical subscales refer to the individual's affective response to the swallowing disorder, the impact of the disorder on daily activities, and the self-perception of the swallowing difficulties, respectively. Using a five-point scale (1-5), the minimum total score is 20 and the maximum 100
* Captured at baseline, interim assessment (14-42 days post-surgery), Day 1 of radiation, Day 21 after start of radiation, Day 36 after start of radiation, and 6 weeks/4 months/6 months/12 months after completion of adjuvant therapy, From baseline through one year after completion of treatment (approximately 15 months)|Comparison of Quality of Life as Measured by the FACT-H&N, * Consists of 27 core items which assess patient function in four domains: Physical, Social/Family, Emotional, and Functional well-being, which is further supplemented by 12 site specific items to assess for head and neck related symptoms. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 Likert type scale, and then combined to produce subscale scores for each domain, as well as an global QoL score. Higher scores represent better QoL.
* Captured at baseline, interim assessment (14-42 days post-surgery), Day 1 of radiation, Day 21 after start of radiation, Day 36 after start of radiation, and 6 weeks/4 months/6 months/12 months after completion of adjuvant therapy, From baseline through one year after completion of treatment (approximately 15 months)
