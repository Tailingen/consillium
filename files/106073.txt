Role of Diet on the Microbiome of the Digestive System
This study is to learn more about how diet affects the microbiome (bacteria and microorganisms) of the digestive system. Researchers want to learn if this, in turn, has an effect on if and how people then develop colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Carcinoma
Dietary patterns, Will obtain estimates of dietary patterns from colonic mucosal biopsies in each group., Baseline|Microbiome composition, Will obtain estimates of microbiome composition from colonic mucosal biopsies in each group. Microbiome composition will be quantified using 16S profiling will be visualized across samples using stacked bar plots and principal coordinate analysis of the weighted Unifrac distances, and microbiome diversity within each sample will be quantified using the inverse-Simpson index., Baseline|Somatic mutation burden, Will obtain estimates of somatic mutation burden from colonic mucosal biopsies in each group., Baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the differences in dietary patterns among individuals reporting to be vegetarian and omnivorous.

II. To compare the difference in stool microbiome pattern in the above mentioned two groups of individuals.

III. To compare somatic mutations in colorectal epithelial cells in the above mentioned two groups of individuals.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To identify and characterize an association between diet, the microbiome and its genotoxic effect on the colorectal epithelial cells and predisposition to colorectal carcinogenesis.

OUTLINE:

Participants complete dietary questionnaire over 30-60 minutes and undergo collection of stool, blood, and tissue samples for analysis via sequencing and laser dissection.
