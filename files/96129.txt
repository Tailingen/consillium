To investigate whether the use of QOL questionnaires during the assessment and management of lung cancer patients results in improved quality of life
To investigate whether the use of EORTC QLQ-C30 + lung cancer module results in less patient contact with health care professionals during the 6 week study period for the 3 groups
Patients with lung cancer who have completed a course of treatment (or who are in-between treatment) at the Royal Marsden Hospital would be eligible for inclusion in the study. Participants will be randomised into 3 groups. Group 1 - this group will complete the QoL questionnaire and will receive targeted therapies by a doctor (and other members of the oncology team) during a clinic consultation. Group 2 - will complete the QoL questionnaire however the questionnaire will not be seen by the doctor during a clinic consultation. Group 3 - the control group will not complete the QoL questionnaire before a clinic consultation. All patients will complete a diary of all contact they have with health care professionals during the study. The study will last for 6 weeks and at the end of the study all patients will complete the QoL questionnaire.
