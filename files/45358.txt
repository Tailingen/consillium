Bortezomib, Rituximab and Dexamethasone (BORID) for Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) remains difficult to treat by standard treatment approaches. Novel drugs have shown promising results in early clinical evaluations. In the current trial, we investigate a combination of bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor), rituximab (a monoclonal antibody), and dexamethasone in patients with MCL, who have already been pretreated by standard chemotherapy and show again signs of disease progression. The study objectives include remission rates, safety of this drug combination, and survival time.
