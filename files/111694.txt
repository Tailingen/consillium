The observation period per patient was 24 months. All patients were treated with nilotinib in accordance to the clinical routine at the respective institution and the summary of product characteristics (SmPC).

The observation intervals (documentation at baseline and at about 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months) were not fixed and were aligned with the regular treatment schedule and the clinical symptoms of each patient. The medical decision about the schedule as well as therapeutic and diagnostic measures was made solely by the responsible physician. Patients who discontinued treatment within two years of the observation period were followed until starting a new TKI therapy line, however with a maximum time period of six months. All other patients that reached the official end of treatment after completion of the 24-month observation period were followed up for 28 days.
