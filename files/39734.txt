Sequencing Antibody Drug Conjugates in ER+/HER2 LOW MBC
The purpose of this research study is to see if the medication sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is effective at the currently approved dose and schedule in people who have previously received trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) for the treatment of metastatic, hormone receptor positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor 2 low (HER2 low) breast cancer. Although SG is approved to treat metastatic HR+/HER2 negative breast cancer, the aim of this study is to determine if SG is still effective specifically in people who have already received T-DXd.

Overall response rate (ORR), ORR will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who received at least one dose of SG and have achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by the local investigator., 24 months
Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 and is defined as the percentage of participants who received at least one dose of SG and have achieved CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) as assessed by the local investigator., 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from the date of first treatment until the date of the first radiological progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever comes first., 30 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration of time of first treatment until the date of death from any cause., 30 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the duration of time from the date of first response (CR or PR) until the date of the first radiological PD per RECIST 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever comes first., 30 months|Global Quality of Life, Global Quality of Life is measured by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), a 30-item instrument designed to measure quality of life in individuals with cancer. The items are related to how difficult activities of daily living are, how often treatment or cancer-related symptoms occur and how much they interfere in daily activities and relationships. Each item is scored on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores indicate worse quality of life., 24 months|Treatment-related Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Percent of participants who experienced a treatment-related AE or SAE while on study., 30 months|Laboratory and Vital Sign Abnormalities, Percent of participants who experienced a laboratory or vital sign abnormality that was considered clinically significant by the investigator while on study., 30 months|Growth Factor Support, Percent of participants who required the use of growth factor support (administered at the discretion of the investigator) while on study., 30 months
