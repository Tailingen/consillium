Icotinib Versus First-line Chemotherapy Plus Maintenance Treatment in EGFR Positive Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients
The purpose of this study is to compare icotinib with induction and maintenance chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutation.
NSCLC
DRUG: Icotinib|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression Free Survival, A duration from randomization date to disease progression(as defined by RECIST) or death. If a participant are known to have progressed, the time to progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of progression. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known not to be progressed., 12 months
Overall survival, Overall Survival is assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant is known to have died, the time to death is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known to be alive., 20 months|Objective response rate, Number of participants who achieve complete response or partial response. Either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) will be evaluated by RECIST, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response., 12 weeks
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotinib and pemetrexed-based first-line induction and maintenance chemotherapy in advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR-mutation，primary endpoint is progress-free survival，second endpoints include overall survival, time to progression, and so on.
