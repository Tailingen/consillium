PD-L1 ImagiNg to prediCt Durvalumab Treatment Response in HNSCC
Non-invasive imaging of tumor PD-L1 expression with 89Zr-labeled durvalumab PET/CT predicts response to durvalumab.
Head and Neck Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PD-L1 imaging|DRUG: Durvalumab
Tumor uptake of 89Zr-durvalumab, standardized uptake values (SUV) of 89Zr-durvalumab uptake in tumor lesions will be measured., 1 year
To assess the potential of PD-L1 PET imaging to predict disease control rate of patients with recurrent or advanced head and neck cancer treated with durvalumab q4w 1500mg iv, PD-L1 PET imaging performed with the optimal dose as assessed in part 1 of the study, 1-2 year|Correlation between tumor uptake of 89Zr-durvalumab and PD-L1 expression as determined immunohistochemically, PD-L1 expression performed by Ventana SP263, 1-2 years
The programmed death 1 (PD1)/ programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway plays an important role in regulating the T-cell anti tumor response. Blocking this interaction with the anti PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab has proven to be effective resulting in durable disease control rates. Currently, PD-L1 expression as determined by immune histochemistry (IH) is the best available biomarker for treatment response, but standardized scoring criteria are lacking and the risk for sampling errors exists. Molecular imaging using 89Zr-labeled antibodies may overcome these limitations, enabling the visualization of PD-L1 expression in primary and metastatic tumor lesions and providing information on the in vivo accessibility of the PD-L1 target following intravenous administration. Besides, a baseline FDG-PET scan will be performed.
