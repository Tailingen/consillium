CD19 & CD22 Bispecific CAR T Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory B Cell Hematologic Tumors
This study is a multi-center, open, prospective single-arm clinical study of patients with relapsed / refractory B cell hematological tumors to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD19 \& CD22 bispecific CAR-T cells in relapsed / refractory B cell hematological tumors while collecting pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics indicators of CAR-T cells.

Since 2010, CAR-T ( chimeric antigen receptor T cell) therapy has shown good results in tumor treatment and has achieved positive clinical therapeutic effects in hematological tumors. The structure of the dual-target CAR-T of CD19 \& CD22 is designed with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain and an antigenic recognition region with a tandem structural sequence to recognize CD22 or CD19 by a single structure. CD19 \& CD22 bispecific CAR-T cells can identify CD 19 or CD 22 with the advantage that the single target CAR-T does not have, reducing the possibility of target loss. The structure has been optimized to enhance the safety to treat B cell-derived hematological tumors (at least CD19 positive or CD22 positive).
