FusionVAC22_01: Fusion Transcript-based Peptide Vaccine Combined with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition
The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity along with safety and toxicity as well as first efficacy of a DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript-based peptide vaccine (Fusion-VAC-XS15) in combination with anti-programmed cell death-ligand 1 immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) by Atezolizumab (TecentriqTM) in patients with Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) or other cancer entities carrying the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript.
Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Fusion-VAC-XS15
To assess immunogenicity in terms of induction of peptide specific T-cell responses, The percentage of patients with an induction of T-cell response until 28 days after second vaccination will be the primary endpoint for efficacy. Peptide stimulated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) are analyzed by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT)., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability] of the peptide vaccine in combination with anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition, The safety and toxicity of the personalized multi-peptide vaccine in combination with the toll-like receptor1/2 ligand XS15 with anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) will be determined based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5.0) and assessed in a descriptive manner., through study completion, an average of 1 year
