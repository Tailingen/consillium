A Safety and Tolerability Study of Pemigatinib in Japanese Subjects With Advanced Malignancies - (FIGHT-102)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pemigatinib in Japanese subjects with advanced malignancies.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Pemigatinib
Safety and tolerability assessed by monitoring frequency, duration, and severity of adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, that occurs after a subject provides informed consent., Baseline through 30 days after end of treatment, up to approximately 16 months.
Overall response rate in subjects with measurable disease based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, Defined as proportion of subjects who meet the response criteria (complete response + partial response) as appropriate for the tumor type., Baseline and Day 15 of every third treatment cycle, up to approximately 6 months|Pharmacodynamics of pemigatinib assessed by changes in serum phosphorus level, Analyzed to look for differences that may be associated with response or safety as well as significant changes associated with treatment., Baseline and protocol-defined timepoints throughout the treatment period, up to approximately 6 months|Observed Plasma Concentration of pemigatinib, PK parameters will be calculated from the blood plasma concentrations of pemigatinib using standard noncompartmental (model independent) PK methods., During the first cycle, up to Day 16
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pemigatinib in Japanese subjects with advanced malignancies.
