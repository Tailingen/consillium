High Resolution Optical Imaging of Barrett's Esophagus Using Nvision Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy (VLE)
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the performance of the Nvision Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy (VLE) system to visualize subsurface tissue in subjects undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and to identify work-flow and training implications for introducing this new imaging modality.
Barrett's Esophagus
Primary Effectiveness Endpoint, The primary endpoint will be the number of subjects achieving completed VLE imaging studies at the time of EDG., The research participants will be followed and evaluated for the duration of their VLE procedure, an expected average of 10 additional minutes beyond the standard EDG procedure.
