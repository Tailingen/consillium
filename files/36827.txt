Docetaxel and Cetuximab in Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab may also stop the growth of prostate cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving docetaxel together with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving docetaxel together with cetuximab and to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

Progression-free survival (PFS), at 12 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), at 24 weeks
Adverse events, All AEs will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v3.0.|Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (30% and 50% PSA response), is defined as a decrease in PSA level of at least 50% (compared to baseline PSA) confirmed after 3-4 weeks (according to the PSA working group consensus criteria)|Tumor assessment of measurable disease according to RECIST criteria, after 12 weeks of treatment, or earlier if clinically indicated|Tumor assessment of bone lesions, at 12 weeks|Overall survival, calculated from registration until death.
OBJECTIVES:

* To assess the efficacy and safety of docetaxel and cetuximab in patients with docetaxel-resistant hormone-refractory prostate cancer

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive cetuximab IV once weekly and docetaxel IV on day 1 (3-week courses) or on days 1, 8, and 15 (4-week courses). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses or every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.
