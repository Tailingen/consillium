A Correlative Study for Predicting Response and Toxicity in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
The proposed trial provides a unique opportunity in that it combines genomic, proteomic, and pharmacogenomic assessments in patients receiving the most commonly used chemotherapies for advanced breast cancer. To date no other trial has analyzed gene and protein expression at the same time points in the same patient, combined with clinical outcome. Similar to previous attempts to predict response based on expression of a single gene or protein, the researchers expect that neither genomic or proteomic profiling alone will be sufficient to optimize therapy. Rather, the researchers expect an iterative process that combines information gleaned from both platforms, modified to avoid toxicity based on pharmacogenomics.
