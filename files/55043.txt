Thrombocytopenia is a relatively common adverse effect for cancer treatment. At present, for the secondary prevention of thrombocytopenia associated with tumor therapy, TPO-RA drugs have been included in the Level III recommendation of the "Thrombocytopenia Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Cancer Treatment (2022 Edition)".

Herombopag, a new generation of thrombopoietin receptor agonist, is a Class 1 innovative drug independently developed in China, which has been approved in June 2021 for the indication of chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia with poor response to previous treatments of glucocorticoids and immunoglobulins, as well as severe aplastic anemia with poor efficacy of immunosuppressive treatments. As an oral medication, this drug is more convenient and safer than traditional injectable preparations. However, this drug has not been formally approved for the treatment of therapy-related thrombocytopenia.

This study is planned to enroll cervical cancer patients with thrombocytopenia due to radiotherapy combined with a three-week regimen of chemotherapy, and to evaluate the efficacy of herombopag in preventing thrombocytopenia in this group of patients.
