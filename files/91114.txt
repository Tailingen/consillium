Interprofessional Mindfulness Practices Advancing Cancer Teamwork
The purpose of the research is to understand if mindfulness team training can improve the well-being and teamwork in caring for oncology patients. This study will enroll healthcare professionals in oncology teams, including clinic nurses, nurse managers, medical assistants, social workers, technicians, patient navigators, advanced practice providers, and physicians at UW Madison. Participants will be on study for up to approximately 6 months.

Change in Teamwork Measure, 4-item Edmondson's psychology safety scale is scored on a likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), where higher scores indicate higher psychology safety, baseline (pre-intervention), post-intervention (3 months), follow up (6 months)|Number of Participants Who Attend Each Session, Session 1 baseline, session 2 at 1 month, session 3 at 2 months, session 4 at 3 months, up to 3 months|Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), AIM is a 4-item survey scored on a 5 point likert scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree), where higher scores indicate greater acceptability., up to 3 months|Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), IAM is a 4-item survey scored on a 5 point likert scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree), where higher scores indicate greater appropriateness., up to 3 months|Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM), FIM is a 4-item survey scored on a 5 point likert scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree), where higher scores indicate greater feasibility., up to 3 months
Change in Stress measured by Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), PSS is a 10-item survey scored from 0 (never) to 4 (very often) for a total possible range of scores from 0-40 where higher scores indicate higher perceived stress., baseline (pre-intervention), post-intervention (3 months), follow up (6 months)|Change in Burnout measured by Maslach Burnout Inventory, This is a 2-item survey scored from 0-6 where higher scores indicate increased burnout., baseline (pre-intervention), post-intervention (3 months), follow up (6 months)|Change in Resilience measured by Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 2), CD-RISC 2 is a 2-item survey each scored on a 5 point likert scale from 0 (not true at all) to 4 (true nearly all of the time), higher scores indicate increased resilience., baseline (pre-intervention), post-intervention (3 months), follow up (6 months)|Change in Well-being measured by Flourishing Index, Flourishing measure is a 12-item survey that measure well being in each of 6 domains: happiness and life satisfaction; mental and physical health; meaning and purpose; character and virtue; close social relationships; financial and material stability. Each domain is scored from 0 - 10 where higher numbers are indicative of increased well being., baseline (pre-intervention), post-intervention (3 months), follow up (6 months)
Aim 1: Determine the effect of resilience training on team resilience and well-being. The investigators test the hypothesis that resilience training provided to interprofessional oncology care teams will improve team resilience and individual well-being.

Aim 2: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a resilience training on team resilience. The investigators test the hypothesis that resilience training is feasible and acceptable in interprofessional oncology care teams.
