PRT1419 as Monotherapy or in Combination With Azacitidine or Venetoclax in R/R Myeloid or B-cell Malignancies
This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of PRT1419, a myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) inhibitor, in participants with selected relapsed/refractory myeloid or B-cell malignancies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PRT1419 monotherapy and in combination with either azacitidine or venetoclax, describe any dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), define the dosing schedule, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of PRT1419, Dose limiting toxicities will be evaluated over the 28-day observation period, Baseline through Day 28|Safety and tolerability of PRT1419: AEs, SAEs, CTCAE assessments, Safety and tolerability will be assessed by recording adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and DLTs according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), Baseline through approximately 3 years|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of PRT1419, The MTD/RP2D will be established for further investigation in participants with advanced hematologic malignancies, Baseline through approximately 2 years
Pharmacokinetic profile of PRT1419 monotherapy and in combination with AZA or VEN: maximum observed plasma concentration, PRT1419 pharmacokinetics will be calculated by maximum observed plasma concentration, Baseline through approximately 3.5 years|Pharmacokinetic profile of PRT1419 monotherapy and in combination with AZA or VEN: Time to maximal plasma concentration, PRT1419 pharmacokinetics will be calculated by time to maximal plasma concentration (Tmax), Baseline through approximately 3.5 years|Pharmacokinetic profile of PRT1419 monotherapy and in combination with AZA or VEN: Area under the curve, PRT1419 pharmacokinetics will be calculated by area under the plasma concentration x time curve (AUC) from h 0 to the last measurable time point (AUC0-last), Baseline through approximately 3.5 years|Safety and tolerability of PRT1419 in combination with AZA and VEN: AEs, SAEs, CTCAE assessments, Safety and tolerability will be assessed by recording adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and DLTs according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), Baseline through approximately 3 years|Anti-tumor activity of PRT1419 monotherapy and in combination with AZA and VEN: Overall response rate (ORR), Anti-tumor activity of PRT1419 based on the measurement of objective response rate (ORR) according to the disease-specific response criteria for malignancies under study, Baseline through approximately 3.5 years|Anti-tumor activity of PRT1419 monotherapy and in combination with AZA and VEN: Progression-free survival (PFS)/event free survival (EFS), Duration from Day 1 to the earliest date of first disease progression, as assessed by the investigator according to the disease-specific response criteria for malignancies under study, or death due to any cause, Baseline through approximately 3.5 years|Anti-tumor activity of PRT1419 monotherapy and in combination with AZA and VEN: Duration of response (DOR), Duration from time of first observed response (CR or PR) to the earliest date of disease progression, as assessed by the investigator according to the disease-specific response criteria for malignancies under study, or death due to any cause, Baseline through approximately 3.5 years|Anti-tumor activity of PRT1419 monotherapy and in combination with AZA and VEN: Overall survival (OS), Duration from Day 1 until death due to any cause, Baseline through approximately 3.5 years
This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study of PRT1419, a MCL-1 inhibitor, evaluating participants with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap syndrome, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), and B-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) including marginal zone lymphoma, follicular lymphoma or mantle cell lymphoma. Participants in study will receive PRT1419 as monotherapy or in combination with either Azacitidine (AZA) or Venetoclax (VEN). The study includes multiple dose escalations and expansion cohorts for RP2D confirmation.
