With this increased understanding, an intervention, comprised of therapeutic interventions with the couple, will be conducted and assessed on how it affects the couple's general well-being and recovery of the sexual and intimate relationship.

The intervention consists of three therapeutic conversations, based on the Illness Beliefs model in family nursing, and an optional web-based evidence based information. The aim of the intervention is to support the facilitating beliefs of the couple in adapting to changes in intimacy and identify constraining beliefs. In the first session an emphasis is on creating an optimal context for changing beliefs by building good therapeutic relationship and to invite them to share their experience, giving them the opportunity to voice their own concerns and reflect on how their situation effects their intimate relationship. In the second session, the couple take a closer look at what they themselves deem important in adjusting to changes in their intimate relationship. In both sessions information about the possible sexual side effects of treatment will be offered as needed and evidence based, optional web-based information on practical solutions will be provided. In the booster-session, the couple will assess how they have been adjusting in their intimate relationship and any positive changes that have occurred will be accentuated.
