MRI in Renal Tumors
Diagnostic imaging for renal masses of unknown nature using conventional imaging modalities such as 3 phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is not always conclusive. After (partial) nephrectomy, 10-20 % of the resected tumors show benign histology which could not be identified on diagnostic imaging. With improved imaging techniques available, leading to improvements in characterisation of renal tumors, the number of unnecessary resections may be reduced. The objective of this study is to assess the ability to discriminate oncocytoma from RCC based on the ADC distribution parameters with addition of, tumor volume, and patient demographic characteristics.
