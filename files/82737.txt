Low Dose Liraglutide and Metformin vs. High Dose Liraglutide Alone in Treatment of Obesity
Weight reduction is the most important treatment target when polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is linked to obesity. Liraglutide (LIRA) in dose of 3 mg was recently approved as an anti-obesity drug. Metformin could enhance weight lowering potential of liraglutide.

We investigates short term interventions with low dose liraglutide in combination with metformin and high dose liraglutide alone influence on significant weight reduction in obese women with PCOS.
