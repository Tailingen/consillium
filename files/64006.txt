GP Vs PF As Induction Chemotherapy Combined with CCRT for Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to compare the survival and toxicity of GP (gemcitabine and cisplatin) vs. PF (cisplatin and fluorouracil) as induction chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma( NPC ) patients.

DRUG: gemcitabine and cisplatin|DRUG: cisplatin and fluorouracil|RADIATION: IMRT|DRUG: cisplatin
progress-free survival (PFS), Progress-free survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first progress at any site., 3 years
Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS), The DMFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first distant metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), The OS was defined as the duration from the date of random assignment to the date of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 3 years|Locoregional Relapse-Free Survival (LRRFS), The LRRFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 3 years|Number of participants with adverse events, Incidence of acute and late toxicity, up to 3 years
Patients presented with non-keratinizing NPC and stage T1-4N2-3/T4N0-1M0 are randomly assigned to receive GP (gemcitabine and cisplatin) or PF (cisplatin and fluorouracil) induction chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Patients in both arms receive radical radiotherapy, and cisplatin (100mg/m²) every three weeks for two cycles during radiotherapy. Patients in the investigational arm receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² d1,8) and cisplatin (80mg/m² d1) every 3 weeks for three cycles. Patients in the control arm receive fluorouracil (800mg/m² d1-5) and cisplatin (80mg/m² d1) every 3 weeks for three cycles. Our primary endpoint is progress-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points include distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), initial response rates after treatments, toxic effects and quality of life (QoL).
