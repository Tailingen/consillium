Tucatinib Plus Trastuzumab in Patients With HER2+ Colorectal Cancer
This trial studies how well the drug tucatinib works when given with trastuzumab and when given by itself. The participants in this trial have HER2-positive (HER2+) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). 'Metastatic' means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

In the first part of this study, participants enrolled into Cohort A and received both tucatinib and trastuzumab. In the second part of this study, participants are randomly assigned to either Cohort B or Cohort C. Participants in Cohort B will receive tucatinib and trastuzumab. Participants in Cohort C will receive tucatinib. Participants in Cohort C who do not respond to therapy may have an option to receive tucatinib plus trastuzumab.
