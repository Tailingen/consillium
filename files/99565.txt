Two-cohort Study of Niraparib and Dostarlimab Plus (Chemo)RadIotherapy in Locally-Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Multi-center, open-label, non-randomized, non-comparative two-cohort study for patients with locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma arising from the larynx, hypopharynx, oropharynx (Stage III, IVA and IVB according to 8th TNM/AJCC ed.) and oral cavity (unresectable, stage IVB according to 8th TNM/ American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) ed.) who are candidates for definitive radiotherapy plus cisplatin (Cohort A) or as single-modality (in cisplatin unfit patient population) (Cohort B) and will receive dostarlimab and niraparib in combination pre-, during and post- radiation.

Study has three parts:

1. Neoadjuvant phase (immune-conditioning phase): patients will receive 1 dose of dostarlimab + niraparib from day -14 prior to radiotherapy (up to 48h prior to radiotherapy (RT) in Cohort A and until RT in Cohort B).
2. Concurrent phase (radiosensitization): patients will receive definitive radiotherapy (70Gy in 35 fractions) with concurrent cisplatin (Cohort A) or with concurrent niraparib (Cohort B).
3. Maintenance: Following radiotherapy, patients will receive adjuvant dostarlimab plus niraparib until week 48 (37 cycles) in both cohorts.

DRUG: Dostarlimab|DRUG: Niraparib|DRUG: cisplatin plus radiotherapy|DRUG: Niraparib
1-year disease free survival, Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from the date of study treatment initiation to the date of first record of any of the following events:

Investigator determined:

Locoregional progression or recurrence. Distant metastasis. Neck dissection or surgery performed for clinical or radiological disease progression (RECIST 1.1) \> 20 weeks from the end of radiation therapy with tumor present on final pathology.

Death due to any cause. Patients not presenting any of the previous events will be censored at the date of last assessment., 1 year after the start of the study treatment
Disease control rate, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease by RECIST 1.1 at a certain time point. DCR will be evaluated at 12, 18 and 24 and 36 months., Throughout the study period, approximately 36 months|Locoregional control, Time to locoregional failure is defined as the time from the date of study treatment initiation to the date of the first record of appearance of local or regional progression/recurrence, to the date of neck dissection \> 20 weeks performed for clinical or radiological (RECIST 1.1) disease progression from the end of radiation therapy with tumor present, or to the date of surgery of primary tumor with tumor present performed for clinical or radiological (RECIST 1.1) disease progression, whichever comes first., Throughout the study period, approximately 36 months|Distant control, Time to distant metastasis is defined as the time from the date of study treatment initiation to the date of first record of appearance of distant metastasis. Locoregional failure or second cancers diagnosed before the distant metastases are not considered events of interest for this endpoint., Throughout the study period, approximately 36 months|Event-free survival, Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from the date of study treatment initiation to the date of first record of any of the following events:

Investigator determined:

Locoregional progression or recurrence. Distant metastasis.

Surgery:

Surgery for persistent or residual disease at the primary tumor site with tumor present on final pathology.

Neck dissection or surgery performed for clinical or radiological disease progression (RECIST 1.1) \> 20 weeks from the end of radiation therapy with tumor present on final pathology.

Death due to any cause. Patients not presenting any of the previous events will be censored at the date of last assessment., Throughout the study period, approximately 36 months|Overall survival, Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from the date of study treatment initiation to the date of first record of any of the following events:

Investigator determined:

Locoregional progression or recurrence. Distant metastasis.

Surgery:

Surgery for persistent or residual disease at the primary tumor site with tumor present on final pathology.

Neck dissection or surgery performed for clinical or radiological disease progression (RECIST 1.1) \> 20 weeks from the end of radiation therapy with tumor present on final pathology.

Death due to any cause. Patients not presenting any of the previous events will be censored at the date of last assessment., Throughout the study period, approximately 36 months|Frequency of treatment-related adverse events, Number of patient who experienced treatment-related adverse events (AEs), Throughout the study period, approximately 36 months
