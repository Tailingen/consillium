Lot Consistency Clinical Trial of Bivalent HPV Vaccine in 9 to 30 Years Old Healthy Females
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of three consecutive lots of bivalent HPV (Type 16,18) vaccine (Pichia pastoris) in healthy female subjects aged 9 - 30 years, and demonstrate the non-inferiority of the candidate HPV vaccine manufactured at commercial scale compared with a pilot scale.
HPV Infection
BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16, 18) Vaccine (Pichia pastoris)
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) for HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 at one month post 3rd dose, At Month 7|Percentage of participants who seroconvert to HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 at one month post 3rd dose, Seroconversion was defined as: For initially seronegative subjects \[antibody titer below (\<) 1:40 prior to vaccination\], antibody titer greater than or equal to (≥) 1:40 after vaccination; For initially seropositive subjects (antibody titer ≥ 1:40 prior to vaccination), antibody titer after vaccination ≥ 4 fold the pre-vaccination antibody titer., At Month 7
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) during 30 days after each dose, 0~30 days after each vaccination|Incidence of solicited adverse events (AEs) after vaccination, 0~7 days after each vaccination|Incidence of unsolicited AEs after vaccination, 0~30 days after each vaccination|Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), Month 0 to Month 7
