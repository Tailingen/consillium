Biomarkers in Samples From Young Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying bone marrow samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Leukemia
GENETIC: DNA analysis|GENETIC: mutation analysis|GENETIC: polymerase chain reaction|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Frequency of mutations|Relapse-free survival|Overall survival|Difference in telomere length
OBJECTIVES:

* To compare the frequency of germline telomerase mutations in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) demonstrating prolonged myelosuppression, defined as â‰¥ 1 episode \> 35 days of neutrophil count recovery after chemotherapy, to the pediatric patients with the expected myelosuppression, defined as consistently \< 35 days of neutrophil count recovery after chemotherapy.
* To assess association between telomerase mutations and incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis, relapse, and death.
* To compare germline (remission) telomere length in pediatric AML patients demonstrating delayed bone marrow recovery with the pediatric patients with consistently expected recovery.
* To assess whether a correlation between telomere length and incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis, relapse, and death exist.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Cryopreserved bone marrow samples are analyzed for DNA sequencing and mutation by Sanger-based sequencing methods, quantitative PCR, and SeqMan Pro (Lasergene from DNAStar). Results are then compared with previously published data and existing databases to determine the allele frequency in control populations.
