A Study of RC48-ADC Combination With Zimberelimab Injection Therapies at Least First-line Platinum-containing Standard Therapy Failed With Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy,safety of RC48-ADC in Combination with Zimberelimab Injection for the Treatment ,at least first-line platinum-containing standard therapy failed in HER2-expressing subject with Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Disitamab Vedotin|DRUG: Zimberelimab
Safety run-in ：Safety(adverse event), to evaluate safety including adverse event rate and adverse event grade., Up to approximately 2 years|Dose extension period ：Objective Response Rate (ORR), The objective response rate will be mainly analyzed by according to the RECIST 1.1 standard tumor evaluation by the investigator will be performed, Up to approximately 2 years
Objective Response Rate(ORR), The objective response rate will be mainly analyzed by according to the RECIST 1.1 standard tumor evaluation by the investigator will be performed, Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, Up to approximately 2 years|Disease Control Rate(DCR), Proportion of patients whose tumors shrank or stabilized for a certain period of time, Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), evaluated by the investigator, Progression-free survival (PFS) refers to the time from the date of first administration to the first researcher's evaluation of disease progression or death (calculated by the event that occurred first). The disease progression will be evaluated by the researchers according to the RECIST 1.1 standard., Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the date of first administration to the date of death of the subject., Up to approximately 2 years
This is a Phase II, Single-Arm ,multicenter, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of RC48-ADC in Combination with Zimberelimab Injection for the Treatment ,at least first-line platinum-containing standard therapy failed in HER2-expressing subject with Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer.The HER2-expressing is defined as: the HER2 IHC 3+ or 2+, or 1+.subjects with IHC 2+ require testing for FISH.
