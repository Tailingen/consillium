A Trial of ChAdOx1 and MVA Vaccines Against MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1
This clinical trial is looking at two new vaccines called ChAdOx1-MAGEA3-NYESO, MVA-MAGEA3 and MVA-NYESO given with patients' standard of care treatment (chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)|Esophageal Neoplasms|Neoplasms, Squamous Cell
BIOLOGICAL: ChAdOx1-MAGEA3-NYESO|BIOLOGICAL: MVA-MAGEA3|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Standard of care treatment|BIOLOGICAL: MVA-NYESO
To assess the safety and tolerability of the trial vaccines with standard of care (SoC) treatment (chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor)., Incidence of adverse events (AEs) (including injection site reactions and toxicity), including relatedness, seriousness and severity (graded according to the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5.0., From time of written consent to participate in the trial until the End of Treatment visit for each patient (max 34 weeks).
To determine the efficacy (Progression Free Survival [PFS]) of the trial vaccines when given with SoC treatment (chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor)., PFS (in months) will be assessed as time from Cycle 3 Day 1 of SoC treatment to the date of disease progression. using RECIST and immune RECIST (iRECIST)., Until end of efficacy and survival follow-up (Max 5 years)|To determine the efficacy (Overall Response Rate [ORR], in months) of the trial vaccines when given with SoC treatment (chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor)., ORR will be reported as the number of randomised patients who have achieved a complete response or partial response., Until end of efficacy and survival follow-up (Max 5 years)|To determine the efficacy (Overall Survival [OS]) of the trial vaccines when given with SoC treatment (chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor)., OS (in months) will be assessed as time from Cycle 3 Day 1 of SoC treatment to the date of death from any cause., Until end of efficacy and survival follow-up (Max 5 years)|To determine the immunogenicity (antigen-specific peripheral response) of the trial vaccines given with SoC treatment (chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor)., Percentage of patients showing peripheral immune response. Immunological response will be measured in patient blood by antigen-specific T cells by ex vivo ELISpot assay., Screening (prior to commencing SoC treatment, Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle is 21 days), Cycle 3 Day 15/2 weeks after ChAdOx1-MAGEA3-NYESO vaccination, Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 7/1 week after MVA vaccination and at end of treatment visit (max 40 weeks).
Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or squamous oesophageal cancer will be entered into the trial as these tumour types are commonly known to have MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1 proteins on their cancer cells. The vaccines contain harmless parts of these proteins allowing them to show these proteins to the immune system. It is expected the immune system will 'learn' that these proteins are foreign to the body. The immune system should then attack the proteins on the cancer cells, killing them. It is expected the vaccines will help the chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor to work better.

This is a first-in-human clinical trial which has two stages:

* A 'Safety Run In' stage where six evaluable patients will receive the trial vaccines with standard of care treatment to confirm they are safe before opening the next stage.
* A 'Rolling Recruitment' stage consisting of two cohorts:

  1. NSCLC Randomisation Cohort of approximately 80 patients with NSCLC will be randomly allocated by computer (randomised) to one of two groups (arms). Patients in Arm A will receive the vaccines with their standard of care treatment and patients in Arm B will continue with their standard of care treatment alone. There is a 1 in 2 chance patients will receive the vaccines.
  2. Squamous Oesophageal Cancer Cohort: Approximately 17 patients with squamous oesophageal cancer will be recruited to receive trial vaccines with their standard of care treatment.

The main aims of the trial are to find out:

* More about potential side effect of the vaccine and how they can be managed.
* Whether the vaccines with standard of care treatment are better at shrinking NSCLC than just the standard of care treatment alone.
* What happens to the vaccines inside the body.
