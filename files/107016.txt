Taiwan ACE Beads for Hepatoma Embolization Therapy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Radiopaque Microsphere (T-ACE Beads) interventional therapy for patients with liver cancer
Cancer of Liver
DEVICE: Taiwan ACE Beads
Patients Survival (Safety), Survival rate was evaluated since treatment day until the date of death or final observation., An average of 12 weeks.|Tumor Response (Efficacy), mRECIST criteria was used to evaluate tumor response in patients with hepatoma who received Taiwan ACE beads (T-ACE) microspheres embolization., Before treatment, one month and three month after T-ACE using CT scan and MRI
Serum Level of AFP, Serum Level of AFP \[Time Frame: Baseline serum AFP levels (168±383) compared with one or three months of serum levels of AFP (144±256) after Taiwan ACE Beads procedure\], Baseline serum AFP levels compared with one or three months of serum levels of AFP after Taiwan ACE Beads procedure
The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Taiwan ACE Beads used for chemoembolization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

The investigators will study the overall response rates of lesions with Taiwan ACE Beads. The procedure is similar with conventional TACE (transcatheter arterial chemoembolization). At the target vessels, radiologists will inject lipiodol with doxorubicin first, then Taiwan ACE Beads instead of Gelfoam or PVA (polyvinyl alcohol). The end point of injection is also similar with conventional TACE.

Determine the complication rates, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) following Taiwan ACE Beads embolization.
