Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy With Concomitant Boost in Breast Cancer
To assess feasibility of postoperative IMRT with concomitant boost in moderate-high risk breast cancer in terms of late toxicity and local control
Breast Cancer|Radiation Toxicity
RADIATION: IMRT with concomitant boost|RADIATION: 3D-RT with sequential boost
Incidence of treatment.related late adverse events, late toxicity (cutaneous and subcutaneous) is evaluated using RTOG/EORTC criteria in both groups of patients, 5 years
Local control, absence of locoregional relapse, 5 years
Patients treated conservatively with moderate-high risk breast cancer were treated with IMRT plus concomitant boost to surgical bed (up to a dose of 50 Gy to whole breast and 60 Gy to the tumor bed).

Aim of the study was to evaluate late toxicity and local control after this treatment compared with a historical control group (CG) of patients treated with 3D-conformal postoperative radiotherapy delivered with conventional fractionation.
