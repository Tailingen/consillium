EUS Guided Celiac Neurolysis
* Hypothesis:

  - Direct CGN enhances neurolytic drug delivery into celiac ganglia and increases the efficacy of neurolysis and subsequent pain control and survival in patients with pancreatic carcinoma.
* Rationale:

  * Standard CPN leads to inaccurate delivery of the injectate with rapid dispersal thereby only briefly remaining in contact with neural structures and limiting the degree of neurolysis. Poor targeting and delivery of a neurolytic agent may result in diminished neurolysis and decrease efficacy.
Pancreatic Cancer Pain
PROCEDURE: EUS
Pain assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10., pain response will be measured, Baseline to 6 months
