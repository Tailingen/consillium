Trial to Evaluate Acasunlimab and Pembrolizumab Combination Superiority Over Standard of Care Docetaxel in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (ABBIL1TY NSCLC-06)
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, international, Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acasunlimab in combination with pembrolizumab versus docetaxel (standard of care) in participants with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have been treated with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy, administered either in combination or sequentially in the metastatic setting.
PD-L1-positive Metastatic NSCLC
DRUG: Acasunlimab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Docetaxel
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 5 years|Confirmed Overall Response Rate (ORR), Confirmed ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the onset date of response to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause based on RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 5 years|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), From first dose until the end of the study (approximately 5 years)|Plasma Concentration of Acasunlimab, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints in Cycles 1-4, then every other cycle starting Cycle 5 (Cycle length=42 days)|Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Acasunlimab, Serum samples will be analyzed using validated, specific, and sensitive immunoassay method. Samples will be screened for ADAs binding to acasunlimab and the titer of confirmed positive/negative samples will be reported., Up to approximately 5 years|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Item GP5 (FACIT-GP5; Version 4) Score, Participant's global assessment of treatment tolerability will be assessed by FACIT-GP5. FACIT-GP5 asks participants to rate their agreement with the following statement, "I am bothered by side effects of treatment" in the past 7 days. Responses will be captured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4 indicating 0 as not at all to 4 as very much bothered by side effects., Up to approximately 2 years|Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), The PRO-CTCAE allows participants to report on the frequency, severity, and interference of patient-reported symptoms. For each AE, there are between one and three items to assess the frequency, severity, and/or interference with activities related to that AE. All PRO-CTCAE responses will be scored from 0 to 4 for frequency indicating (0= never to 4= almost constantly), severity (0= none to 4= very severe) and interference with usual or daily activities (0= not at all to 4= very much)., Up to approximately 2 years
The goal of this trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of acasunlimab (an experimental antibody also known as GEN1046 or DuoBody® PDL1x4-1BB) in combination with pembrolizumab (an antibody known as KEYTRUDA®) compared to that of docetaxel (a standard of care chemotherapy). During the trial, the participant's quality of life will also be evaluated using industry-standard scales of measurement. To be eligible, participants must have:

1. non-small cell lung cancer that has metastasized (spread)
2. tumors that are positive for the PD-L1 protein (a biomarker that may be predictive of response to therapy)
3. been previously treated with a PD-1/PD-L1-inhibitor and a platinum-containing cancer therapy administered in combination or sequentially (irrespective of the order).

Other eligibility criteria will also apply.

Participants will be assigned to 1 of 2 active therapies, also known as treatment arms, as follows:

* Acasunlimab (100 milligrams \[mg\]) and pembrolizumab (400 mg) once every 6 weeks (Q6W), or
* Docetaxel 75 milligrams per meter squared (mg/m\^2) once every 3 weeks (Q3W).

The estimated trial duration for a participant will vary but may be up to 5 years, consisting of:

* An optional 3-month pre-screening period
* A 28-day screening period
* Up to 2 years of treatment
* A 90-day safety follow-up period
* Post-treatment follow-up.
