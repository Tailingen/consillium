Multimodal Prehabilitation To Improve The Clinical Outcomes Of Frail Elderly Patients With Gastric Cancer
The GISSG+2201 study was launched by Shandong Gastrointestinal Surgery Study Group (GISSG). The intention is to establish a multimodal prehabilitation protocol in frail elderly patients who undergo gastric cancer radical surgery, explore the feasibility and effectiveness of the measures and evaluate the effect of program on short-term clinical outcome, recovery index and the long-term tumor-related outcome.

The incidence and severity of postoperative complications, Major postoperative complications of patients with Gastrointestinal malignancy included gastrointestinal complication, surgical site complication, respiratory complication, cardiovascular complication, thromboembolic complication, urinary complication and other complications. The severity of complications was recorded and classified according to Clavien-Dindo classification score., Postoperative (≤30 days after surgery)
Cardio-pulmonary function and physical capacity, The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) can be used to measure exercise capacity to reflect cardio-pulmonary function., Baseline (T0), Post-intervention (up to 2 weeks), and POD 30（30 days after surgery）|Quality of life (QoL)., QoL comprises patient-reported outcomes (PRO) of physical symptoms and psychosocial health status. Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C30 is sensitive tool for measuring individual performance status. Each index score ranges from 1 to 4, with higher scores indicating higher risk., Baseline (T0), Post-intervention (up to 2 weeks), and POD 30（30 days after surgery）|Detection of immune and inflammatory indicators, Interleukin, Tumor necrosis factor and C-reactive protein serum concentrations, Baseline (T0), Post-intervention (up to 2 weeks), and POD 30（30 days after surgery）|The postoperative other observation parameters, Postoperative pain severity, postoperative delirium severity and occurrence, first exhaust and defecation, ureteral catheter removal, abdominal drainage tubes removal, postoperative hospital stay, hospitalization costs, 30-day all-cause mortality and 30-day hospital readmission rate., Postoperative (≤30 days after surgery)|Oncological outcomes, 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate and 3-year overall survival (OS) rate., 3 years
