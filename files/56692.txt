PARP-inhibitor on Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer in Germline PALB2 Mutations Carriers
The study aims at exploring the potential benefit of a PARP-inhibitor, Niraparib, in metastatic breast cancer developing in germline-PALB2 mutations carriers. This study is designed as a multicentre one-arm two-stage phase 2 clinical trial
