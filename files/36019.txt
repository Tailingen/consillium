A Study of MRG002 in the Treatment of Patients With HER2-mutated Unresectable/Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
The objective of this study is to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of MRG002 in patients with HER2-mutated unresectable or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Non-small- Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: MRG002
Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Independent Review Committee (IRC), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) assessed by IRC according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (up to 12 months).
ORR by Investigator, ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR and PR assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline to study completion (up to 12 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) after treatment., Baseline to study completion (up to 12 months).|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the duration from the initial recording of objective disease response to the first onset of tumor progression, or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 12 months).|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 12 months).|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 12 months).|Adverse Events (AEs), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug., Baseline to 45 days after the last dose of study treatment.|PK parameters: concentration-time curve, Plot of drug concentration changing with time after drug administration., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.|Immunogenicity (ADA), The proportion of patients with positive ADA results., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.
The trial consists of two stages: efficacy exploration and efficacy verification.

At the first stage, at most 30 patients will be enrolled for each of the two cohorts as defined by HER2 mutation sites. If â‰¥8 patients achieved objective response, the second stage will be continued; otherwise the trial will be terminated. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled in the second stage.
