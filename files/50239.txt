Eat, Move, Live Program for the Reduction of Cancer and Chronic Disease Risk in Underserved Communities
This clinical trial tests the Eat, Move, Live (EML) Program in reducing the risk of chronic diseases among underserved communities by improving healthy lifestyle practices, increasing physical activity and encouraging healthy eating behaviors. EML is a series of free culturally and linguistically appropriate nutrition and physical activity sessions. The interactive education segment of the EML Program is culturally responsive, and based on the community EML program, and topics will include: nutrition guidelines, reading food labels, recipe modification and healthy food preparation, eating healthy on a budget, chronic diseases information and prevention strategies. The EML program may help reduce the risk of cancer and chronic diseases by encouraging more physical activity and healthy eating behaviors.
