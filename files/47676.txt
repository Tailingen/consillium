Adjuvant Chemotherapy Combined With Camrelizumab for ⅡA -ⅢA NSCLC Patients
Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy followed by immunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer has become a new treatment recommendation, but there are still many clinical problems to be solved in postoperative adjuvant immunotherapy. This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy in patients with stage IIA-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer after surgery. Patients who meet the protocol and sign the informed consent form received 4 cycles of chemotherapy combined with camrelizumab, followed by maintenance with camrelizumab until one year or the disease progressed or unacceptable toxicity.
