My Pathway: A Study Evaluating Herceptin/Perjeta, Tarceva, Zelboraf/Cotellic, Erivedge, Alecensa, and Tecentriq Treatment Targeted Against Certain Molecular Alterations in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This multicenter, non-randomized, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of six treatment regimens in participants with advanced solid tumors for whom therapies that will convey clinical benefit are not available and/or are not suitable options per the treating physician's judgment.

Percentage of Participants in All Tumor-Pathway Cohorts With Overall Response, as Assessed by the Investigator, The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients whose best response on or before the first occurrence of disease progression is a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Tumor responses were assessed by investigators using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 for all arms., From the date of first study treatment until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (72.1 months)|Percentage of Atezolizumab-Treated Participants With Tissue Tumor Mutational Burden (tTMB) â‰¥16 Mutations/Mb With Overall Response, as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients whose best response on or before the first occurrence of disease progression is a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Tumor responses were assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., From the date of first study treatment until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (68.9 months)
Percentage of Participants With Disease Control, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients whose best response is CR, PR or stable disease maintained more than 4 months (SD\>4 months). Tumor responses were assessed by investigators using RECIST version 1.1 for all arms., From the date of first study treatment until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (72.1 months)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression, or death, whichever occurs first. Tumor responses were assessed by investigators using RECIST version 1.1 for all arms., From the date of first study treatment until disease progression as assessed by the investigator, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (72.1 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS, months) is defined as the time from the date of the first study treatment (Day 1) to the date of death from any cause., 87.5 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) to date of first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., From the date of first documented response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) to the time of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (70.8 months)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Incidence, nature, and severity of Adverse Events (AE), per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (NCI CTCAE v4.03) for participants enrolled prior to Version 6 of the protocol. The NCI CTCAE (v5.0) grading scale was used for assessing AE severity for participants enrolled under Version 6 of the protocol and subsequent versions., From first study treatment administration to 30 days (45 days for vismodegib, 90 days for atezolizumab) after the last dose (up to approximately 6.3 years)
