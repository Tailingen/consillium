Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Antibodies Plus S-adenosyl-methionine Treatment in Patients With Advanced-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study is being done to analyze the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment using combination of SAM and anti-PD-1/PDL1 antibodies for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

This is a study of combination anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) for adult patients (â‰¥18) with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

SAM is a compound found naturally in the body and is available as a dietary supplement in the U.S. SAM is a prescription drug in China treating liver disease and advanced HCC with poor liver function under certain circumstances. Also, SAM has recently been shown to play a key role regulating cancer cell proliferation trough epigenetic pathway.

Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies (including pembrolizumab, nivolumab, sintilimab, toripalimab, camrelizumab, tislelizumab and atezolizumab etc.) are given intravenously at assigned dose. Treatment may continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.

This study is aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of SAM and PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in unresectable late-stage HCC patients.
