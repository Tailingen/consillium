Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Alobresib (Formerly GS-5829) in Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphomas and in Combination With Exemestane or Fulvestrant in Adults With Estrogen Receptor Positive Breast Cancer
The primary objectives of this study are to characterize the safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended dose for phase 2 study (RDP2) of alobresib as a monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas, and in combination with exemestane or fulvestrant in participants with advanced estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.
Solid Tumors and Lymphomas
DRUG: Alobresib|DRUG: Exemestane|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT was a toxicity, considered possibly related to alobresib, and which occurred during DLT assessment window (Day 1 through Cycle 1 Day 28) in each cohort: Grade ≥ 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\] \< 500/mm\^3); Grade ≥3 neutropenia (ANC\< 1000/mm\^3) with fever (a single temperature of \> 38.3°C or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38°C for more than 1 hour \[hr\]); Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia; Grade ≥ 2 bleeding; Grade ≥ 3 non hematologic toxicity, except Grade 3 nausea or emesis with maximum duration of 48 hrs on adequate medical therapy and Grade 3 diarrhea which persists for \< 72 hrs in absence of maximal medical therapy; Grade ≥ 2 non hematologic treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of potential clinical significance; treatment interruption ≥ 7 days due to unresolved toxicity; and any Grade 3 or 4 elevation in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) associated with a Grade 2 elevation in bilirubin that is at least possibly related to alobresib., Baseline (Day 1) up to 28 days
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Cmax of Alobresib, Cmax is defined as the maximum concentration of the drug., Cycle 1: Predose (0 hr), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hrs postdose on Days 1 and 8 (1 Cycle = 28 days)|PK Parameter: Ctau of Alobresib, Ctau is defined as the observed drug concentration at the end of the dosing interval., Cycle 1: Predose (0 hr), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hrs postdose on Day 8 (1 Cycle = 28 days)|PK Parameter: AUC0-24 of Alobresib, AUC0-24 is defined as the concentration of drug over time from time zero to time 24 hrs., Cycle 1: Predose (0 hr), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hrs postdose on Days 1 and 8 (1 Cycle = 28 days)|PK Parameter: AUCtau of Alobresib, AUCtau is defined as the concentration of drug over time (the area under the concentration verses time curve over the dosing interval)., Cycle 1: Predose (0 hr), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hrs postdose on Day 8 (1 Cycle = 28 days)|PK Parameter: Tmax of Alobresib, Tmax is defined as the time (observed time point) of Cmax., Cycle 1: Predose (0 hr), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hrs postdose on Days 1 and 8 (1 Cycle = 28 days)|PK Parameter: t1/2 of Alobresib, t1/2 is defined as the estimate of the terminal elimination half-life of the drug. Due to short sampling period of the terminal elimination phase in these cohorts t1/2 values should be interpreted with caution., Cycle 1: Predose (0 hr), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hrs postdose on Days 1 and 8 (1 Cycle = 28 days)
