Survival Significance of Molecular Pathology and Genetic Variation in Brain Gliomas
This study aims to collect clinical, radiological, pathological, molecular and genetic data including detailed clinical parameters, MR and histopathology images, molecular pathology and genetic data. This study seeks to find the prognostic and clinical significance based on molecular and genetic biomarkers/subgroups of gliomas.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Glioma groups based on molecular pathology or genetic variation
Overall Survival (OS), The length of time from enrollment until the time of death (OS, overall survival), From enrollment to death of patients. Estimated about 5 years.
Precise classification based on molecular and genetic biomarkers/subgroups for gliomas is challenging. This study aims to collect clinical, radiological, pathological, molecular and genetic data including detailed clinical parameters, MR and histopathology images, molecular pathology (1p/19q co-deletion, MGMT methylation, IDH and TERTp mutations, etc) and genetic data (Whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, proteomics, etc). This study seeks to find the prognostic and clinical significance based on molecular and genetic biomarkers/subgroups of gliomas.
