Anti-obesity Pharmacotherapy and Inflammation
This study evaluates the relationship between weight loss, circulating inflammatory markers and lipids from 24 patients before and after 6 months of pharmacotherapy as a standard of care for anti-obesity treatment

weight loss, Weight Loss Percentage (Pounds lost divided by starting weight (in pounds) multiplied by 100), baseline and 24 weeks|MDSC in peripheral blood, Changes in number of MDSC in blood, baseline and 24 weeks|Levels of lipids in circulation, Changes in concentration (mg/dL) of each type of lipids: LDL-Cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids, baseline and 24 weeks
Systemic inflammation measured by C-reactive protein levels, Changes in concentration (mg/L) of C-reactive protein in serum, baseline and 24 weeks|Systemic inflammation measured by adipokines levels in circulation, Changes in concentration (pg/mL) of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) and leptin in plasma, baseline and 24 weeks
This study aims to determine if weight loss by pharmacotherapy with liraglutide, semaglutide, or phentermine-topiramate promotes the reduction of pro-tumoral inflammatory cells Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), simultaneously to the improvement of lipid profile (LDL-Cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids) and concentration in the blood.

Liraglutide, semaglutide, and phentermine-topiramate are FDA-approved medications to treat obesity and obesity-associated comorbidities.

Twenty-four patients undergoing standard of care for anti-obesity treatment at VA Medical Center, and Tulane Center for Clinical Research (TCCR) will be recruited before initiation of pharmacotherapy as part of their standard of care and followed up to 6 months to compare the primary study variables.
