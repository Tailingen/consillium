Digital Remote Monitoring of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy Induced Toxicity: A Feasibility Study of the Vigilant App (Vigilant-2)
This study is being done to better understand patient experiences with using a mobile application, known as Vigilant, to monitor symptoms as outpatients and to gather preliminary data on the potential clinical benefit to remote monitoring of adverse events.
Malignant Skin Neoplasm|Melanoma
OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Incidence of grade 3-4 IR-adverse events, Will be assessed by the number of patients who experience at least one grade 3-4 Immune-Related Adverse Events (IR-AE) within 100 days of treatment with ipilimumab/nivolumab (IPI/NIVO). Events will be self-reported using the VIGILANT app, which is being developed to help manage adverse events after treatment., Up to 100 days following treatment with IPI/NIVO
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Optimize the patient (Aim 1) experience of the VIGILANT app workflow. II. Gather preliminary data on the number of patients who develop Grade 3 + 4 immune-related adverse event (irAE) or require ER visit within 100 days of registration and treatment with IPI/NIVO.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients undergo standard of care treatment with ipilimumab/nivolumab and answer questions and enter symptoms in the mobile Vigilant application. Patients wearing a compatible watch have their vital signs recorded at the same time symptoms are being entered. Based on the severity of symptoms, patients may be recommended to reach out to their healthcare team or to go to the emergency room. Additionally, patients complete a survey and may have their medical charts reviewed on study.
