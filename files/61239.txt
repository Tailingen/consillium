Comparison of CNB and Surgical Specimens for ER, PgR, HER2 Status and Ki67 Index in Invasive Breast Cancer.
* This is a prospective, single-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study.
* The estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 status and Ki67 index of CNB specimen are critical biomarkers for making neoadjuvant therapy strategy in invasive breast cancer. The concordance of these biomarkers between CNB and surgical specimen was varied in previous retrospective reports. The aim of this study is to determine the discordance of these biomarkers between CNB and surgical specimen and the influence of making treatment strategy by the discordance.
Invasive Breast Cancer
OTHER: immunohistochemistry and/or FISH
The accuracy of ER, PgR, Her-2 and Ki67 for core needle biopsy (CNB) using the surgical specimens as reference, respectively., The accuracy of ER, PgR, Her-2 and Ki67 for core needle biopsy (CNB) will be assessed by four parameters respectively, which are sensitivity, specificity, the negative predictive values and the positive predictive values, using the surgical specimens as reference., within 4 weeks after obtaining the post-surgery pathological results
Discordance of system therapy strategies between using biomarkers of CNB and surgical specimens., within 4 weeks after obtaining the post-surgery pathological results
