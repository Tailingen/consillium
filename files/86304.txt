Brightline-4: A Study to Test How Well Brigimadlin is Tolerated by People With a Type of Cancer Called Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma
This study is open to adults with a type of cancer called dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS). They can join the study if their tumours are positive for MDM2. The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called brigimadlin (BI 907828) is tolerated by and helps people with DDLPS. Brigimadlin is a so-called MDM2 inhibitor that is being developed to treat cancer.

Participants take brigimadlin as a tablet once every 3 weeks. Participants may continue to take brigimadlin as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. They visit the study site regularly. At the study site, doctors regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects. The doctors also regularly check tumour size.
