PFS will be assessed by BIRC per RANO for participants with HGG, INRC for participants with NB and RECIST 1.1 for participants with MB, MRT and RMS for participants in Phase I-Part B., Up to 42 months|Time to response (TTR) as assessed by BIRC (Phase I-Part B), TTR is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the first documented progression of either CR or PR. TTR will be assessed by BIRC per RANO for participants with HGG, INRC for participants with NB and RECIST 1.1 for participants with MB, MRT and RMS for participants in Phase I-Part B., Up to 42 months|Overall survival (Phase I-Part B), OS is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of death, due to any cause. OS will be assessed for participants in Phase I-Part B., Up to 42 months|Percentage of participants with dose interruptions and dose reductions (Phase I-Part A, Phase I-Part B, Phase II), Percentage of participants with dose interruptions and dose reductions for participants in Phase I-Part A, Phase I-Part B and Phase II, Up to 12 months|Duration of response (DOR) as assessed by BIRC (Phase II), Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of the first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression, or death due any cause. DOR will be assessed by BIRC per RECIST 1.1 for participants in Phase II., Up to 42 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by BIRC (Phase II), PFS is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the first documented progression or death due to any cause. PFS will be assessed by BIRC per INRC for participants in Phase II, Up to 42 months|Time to response (TTR) as assessed by BIRC (Phase II), TTR is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the first documented progression of either CR or PR. TTR will be assessed by BIRC per INRC for participants in Phase II, Up to 42 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR) as assessed by BIRC (Phase II), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of CR, PR or an overall response of stable disease lasting for a duration of at least 24 weeks. CBR will be assessed by BIRC per INRC for participants in Phase II, Up to 42 months|Overall survival (OS) (Phase II), OS is defined as the time from the date of start of treatment to the date of death, due to any cause. OS will be assessed for participants in Phase II, Up to 42 months|Change from baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) questionnaire (Phase II), PedsQL is a generic instrument used to measure health related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and youth aged 0-25 years. The generic core instrument is available for different age groups and consist of 23 items covering 4 dimensions of HRQOL: Physical functioning (8 items), Emotional Functioning (5 items), Social Functioning (5 items) and School Functioning (5 items). Items are scored on a 5 point Likert-type response scale: 0=never a problem; 1=almost never a problem; 2=sometimes a problem; 3=often a problem; and 4=almost always a problem). Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, where higher scores indicating better QoL. Change from baseline in PedsQL scores will be assessed for participants in Phase II., Up to 42 months
The study is structured into two parts: Phase I - Part A (dose finding) and Phase I - Part B (multiple expansion cohorts). Phase II may commence following the evaluation of Phase I data, which includes safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and biomarker data. Additionally, other emerging data that could influence the treatment landscape will be considered before initiating Phase II in patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma (NB) and/or other tumors studied in Phase I.

- Phase I - Part A (dose finding): This phase aims to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of ribociclib in combination with TOTEM.

Due to the early termination of the trial, Phase I - Part B (multiple expansion cohorts) and Phase II (double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled in relapsed or refractory NB) were not initiated.
