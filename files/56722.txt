The Effect of Pullsed Magnetic Field Induction on Improving the Forearm Tissue Muscle Performance
Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT) is a reparative technique most commonly used in the field of orthopedics for the treatment of non-union fractures. The aim is to test the effect of the magnetic induction on brute force of treated muscle in oncological patients. Oncology patients were chosen as we assume that the ipmrovement will be more noticable in oncology patients than in a non-oncology, healthy subjects.
