Melanoma
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Anlotinib|DRUG: nab-Paclitaxel
ORR, defined as the proportion of patients whose tumor volume has shrunk to a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum time limit. The sum of complete remission plus partial remission., 1 year
PFS, The time from the beginning of randomization to the onset of disease progression or the death of the patient., 1 year
