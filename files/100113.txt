First International Randomized Study in Malignant Progressive Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma
The FIRSTMAPPP study is a randomized, double-blind, phase II, international, multicenter study which aims to determine the efficacy of Sunitinib on the progression-free survival at 12 months in subjects with progressive malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma treated with sunitinib at a starting dose of 37.5 mg daily (continuous dosing).
Malignant Progressive Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (PPGL)
DRUG: Sunitinib|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-free survival at 12 months, Progression will be assessed by RECIST 1.1 performed every 3 months (centralized imaging), 12 months
Objective Response Rates (ORR), 12 months|Duration of response (DR), 12 months|Overall Time to Progression (TTP), 12 months|Overall survival (OS), 12 months|Number of Adverse Events assessed using NCI -CTC V4 criteria, Number and description of adverse events and number of patients with adverse events according to NCI -CTC V4 criteria, 12 months|Number of patients with cardiovascular toxicity tolerance assessed by specific organisation for blood pressure monitoring, Cardiovascular tolerance will be assessed by specific organisation for blood pressure monitoring, 12 months|Bone Pain evaluation on the Visual Analog Scale, 12 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

To determine the efficacy of Sunitinib on the progression-free survival at 12 months in subjects with progressive malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma treated with sunitinib at a starting dose of 37.5 mg daily (continuous dosing).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

* To determine overall survival and progression free survival.
* To determine time to progression.
* To determine objective response rate at one year.
* To determine time to and duration of tumor response.
* To assess safety profile including a dedicated cardiovascular management (home-blood pressure monitoring, ECG and echocardiography).

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

-Identification of predictors of response as well as surrogate markers of overall survival is anticipated
