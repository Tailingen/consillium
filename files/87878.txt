Diagnostic Accuracy of ERCP-guided Versus Cholangioscopy-guided Tissue Acquisition in Patients With Indeterminate Biliary Strictures Suspected to be Intrinsic .
Primary Objective: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of cholangioscopy-based assessment using SpyDS technology compared to cholangiography-based assessment using ERCP-guided biopsy and brushing in patients with indeterminate biliary strictures in the setting of cholangiocarcinoma.
Cholangiocarcinoma|Biliary Stricture
DEVICE: single operator cholangioscopy|DEVICE: ERCP guided brushing and biopsy
Diagnostic accuracy of cholangioscopy or cholangiography, Malignancy will be determined by cytology or histology on tissue sampling during the index procedure, or from other tissue acquisition or surgical specimen histopathology up to 6 months after the index procedure.The assessed strictures will be considered benign if there was no confirmation of malignancy by 6 months after the index procedure. â€¢ Overall diagnostic accuracy will be assessed for ERCP impression of malignancy, ERCP-guided brushing and biopsies separately and combined, SpyDS impression of malignancy and SpyBite biopsies, 6 Months
Occurrence and severity of procedure related serious adverse events, Occurrence and severity of procedure related serious adverse events from index procedure through 30 days after procedure., 30 days|Technical success of procedure, Technical success of procedure defined as ability to collect tissue deemed adequate for cytology or histology. Indeterminate or equivocal or atypical or non-conclusive cytology or histology will be considered failures to this endpoint, 30 days|Additional diagnostic accuracy metrics: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value., Additional diagnostic accuracy metrics: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value. The assessed strictures will be considered benign if there was no confirmation of malignancy by 6 months after the index procedure, 6 months|Impact of ERCP or cholangioscopy on patient management., Number of patients in whom management plan is altered based on ERCP or cholangioscopy will be determined, 6 months|Number of patients needed additional diagnostic procedures beyond the index procedure for final diagnosis, Need for additional diagnostic procedures beyond the index procedure will be noted, 6 months|Number of accessories used, The total number of accessories used during the procedure in both arms will be determined., At index procedure.|Duration of procedure from duodenoscope in to duodenoscope out, Duration of procedure is defined as time from duodenoscope in to duodenoscope out, At index procedure|Correlation between impression of malignancy and cytopathology in the ERCP arm compared to the cholangioscopy arm, Number of participants will be compared for outcome of visual impression ( benign/ malignant disease) on ERCP or cholangioscopy with final out come of cytopathology in both arms., 6 months
Study Design : Prospective,multi-center, randomized controlled, Post market Study (PMS)

Two groups:

* Control arm - ERCP arm: ERCP impression and ERCP-guided brushing and biopsy
* Study arm - Cholangioscopy arm: SpyDS impression and SpyDS-guided SpyBite biopsy Randomization 1:1 ratio. Primary Endpoint: Diagnostic accuracy of cholangioscopy or cholangiography assessed at 6 months after initial ERCP procedure
* Malignancy will be determined by cytology or histology on tissue sampling during the index procedure, or from other tissue acquisition or surgical specimen histopathology up to 6 months after the index procedure.
* Overall diagnostic accuracy.
* The assessed strictures will be considered benign if there was no confirmation of malignancy by 6 months after the index procedure.
* Overall diagnostic accuracy will be assessed for
* ERCP impression of malignancy
* ERCP-guided brushing and biopsies separately and combined\*
* SpyDS impression of malignancy
* SpyBite biopsies
* In case of discordant results, the following will be followed for the combined pathology/cytology measure:
* If at least one is malignancy, then combine metric is malignant
* If both are benign or one is benign and one is non-diagnostic, then combined metric is benign
* If both are non-diagnostic, then combined metric is non-diagnostic

Secondary Endpoints:

1. Occurrence and severity of procedure related serious adverse events from index procedure through 30 days after procedure. Hospitalization and ICU admissions
2. Technical success of procedure defined as ability to collect tissue deemed adequate for cytology or histology. Indeterminate or equivocal or atypical or non-conclusive cytology or histology will be considered failures to this endpoint.
3. Correlation between impression of malignancy and cytopathology in the ERCP arm compared to the Cholangioscopy arm.
4. Additional diagnostic accuracy metrics: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value. The assessed strictures will be considered benign if there was no confirmation of malignancy by 6 months after the index procedure.
5. Impact of ERCP or cholangioscopy on patient management.
6. Need for additional diagnostic procedures beyond the index procedure.
7. Procedural measures: Type and number of devices used,
8. Duration of procedure from duodenoscope in to duodenoscope out
