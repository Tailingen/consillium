Safety and Efficacy Study of Donor Natural Killer Cells Given After Haploidentical Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
The protocol treatment is to evaluate clinical effects of donor-derived natural killer cells that are given after HLA-mismatched hematopoietic cell transplantation.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: donor natural killer cell infusion
occurrence and severity of side effects of donor natural killer cell infusion, 1 year
anti-leukemia effect of donor natural killer cell infusion, 2 years
Those patients with acute leukemia, which is not responding to coventional chemotherapy, will be treated. The clinical effects will be evaulated in terms of safety (side effects) and anti-leukemia effect.
