Anlotinib Combined With TACE in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients at High Risk of Post Surgery Recurrence
A single-arm, open-label clinical trial to assess the effects and safety of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) patients at high risk of post surgery recurrence.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|TACE|Anlotinib
DRUG: Anlotinib Hydrochloride|PROCEDURE: TACE
Disease free survival, The period from resection surgery to recurrence of HCC, From randomization to recurrence of HCC or death (up to 1year)
1-year DFS Rate, One year ratio of DFS, From randomization to recurrence of HCC or death (up to 1year)|Time to recurrence, The period from resection surgery to recurrence of HCC, From randomization to recurrence of HCC(up to 1year)|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Safety and Tolerability, Any adverse effects occur during the use of anlotinib, Up to 30 day safety follow-up visit
Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world with high incidence and mortality. Recurrence of HCC is still a great challenge and threat to the patients after resection surgery. Anlotinib is a new, orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), and c-kit.

HCC patients who meet the eligibility criteria of this clinical trial will adopt postoperative TACE combined with anlotinib hydrochloride. At Day4 of TACE,anlotinib 12mg QD PO d1-14, 21 days per cycle until disease progresses or intolerant.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Disease free survival (DFS);Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 1-year DFS Rate and Time to recurrence (TTR)(According to RECIST Version 1.1).Safety will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 4.0.
