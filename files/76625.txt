TACE(Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization ) Associated With Systemic Chemotherapy Versus Systemic Chemotherapy Alone in Patients With Unresectable CRLM(Colorectal Liver Metastases)
To date no randomized controlled trials have been completed that demonstrated whether TACE(Transarterial chemoembolization) is an effective adjunct to systemic chemotherapy (target therapy) with respect to advantages in conversion resection rates and survival compared with chemotherapy (target therapy) alone for patients who failed with first-line chemotherapy.The primary objective of this trial is to determine conversion resection rates and survival for patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis are treated with TACE plus chemotherapy ± target therapy, compared to chemotherapy ± target therapy in the 2nd, and 3rd line.
