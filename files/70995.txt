Biological Therapy in Treating Women With Breast Cancer That Has Spread to the Liver
RATIONALE: Biological therapy using a gene-modified virus that can make interleukin-12 may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of a gene-modified virus that can make interleukin-12 in treating women with breast cancer that has spread to the liver.
Breast Cancer|Metastatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: adenovirus-mediated human interleukin-12
Toxicity, Serial monitoring of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) levels, up to 15 days
Tumor Response, Sequential assessment of tumor on CT or MRI, up to 2 months|IL12 level Immune response, Serum IL12 level, up to 2 months|IFNγ levels Immune response, IFNγ levels, up to 2 months|Immune response, Serum antibodies (titer) to adenovirus., up to 2 months
Direct intratumoral injection of metastatic hepatic tumors using an adenoviral vector expressing the human recombinant interleukin-12 gene (Adv.RSV-hIL12, also termed ADV-hIL-12).

OBJECTIVES:

* Study the toxicity of escalating doses of adenoviral vector expressing the human recombinant interleukin-12 gene, administered by percutaneous intratumoral injection, in women with liver metastasis secondary to breast cancer.
* Determine tumor responses produced by this regimen.
* Determine immune responses induced by this regimen.
