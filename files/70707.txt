Double Blind Placebo Controlled Controlled Study of Adjuvant MEDI4736 In Completely Resected NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to find out whether it is better to receive a new drug, MEDI4736, or better to receive no further treatment after surgery (and possibly chemotherapy) for lung cancer.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: MEDI4736|DRUG: Placebo
Compare Disease free survival (DFS) for patients with NSCLC that is PD-L1 expression TC ≥ 25% and patients without common activating EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements, 6.7 years
Disease-free survival in the remaining 5 patient sub-populations defined by PD-L1 expression levels and EGFR/ALK status, (PD-L1 TC ≥ 1% and patients without common activating EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements; all patients without common activating EGFR mutations or ALK gene rearrangements; all PD-L1 TC ≥ 25%; all PD-L1 TC ≥ 1%; all randomized patients), 8 years|Compare overall survival (OS) for patients in the six patient sub-populations defined by PD-L1 expression levels and EGFR/ALK status, 8 years|Compare Lung cancer specific survival for patients in the six patient sub-populations defined by PD-L1 expression levels and EGFR/ALK status, 8 years|Evaluate the nature, severity and frequency of adverse effects and tolerability of MEDI4736, All patients who receive at least one dose of MEDI4376/placebo will be included in the safety analysis. Descriptive summary tables will be presented on safety parameters by treatment arm. There will be safety monitoring by the CCTG Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) every 6 months, every 6 months|Evaluate the Quality of life in the six patient sub-populations defined by PD-L1 expression levels and EGFR/ALK status, The quality of life (QoL) of patients will be assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30 and the lung cancer module (QLQ-LC13) incorporated., 8 years|Determine survival benefits participants judge necessary to make adjuvant immunotherapy worthwhile, 8 years|Determine the incremental cost effectiveness and cost utility ratios for MEDI4736, 8 years|Evaluate the predictive/prognostic significance of PD-L1 expression, 8 years|Evaluation of changes in plasma/serum cytokines and other blood and tissue based biomarkers after treatment with MEDI4736 and at disease event, 8 years|Explore polymorphisms that may be associated with outcomes, Baseline only
