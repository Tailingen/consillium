[18F] Dihydro-testosterone Pet and MR Imaging In Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the ability of a new PET scan radiotracer, called FDHT (stands for \[18F\] Dihydro-Testosterone), to better find and monitor prostate cancer. Radiotracers are a type of drug that carries small amounts of radioactivity that can be seen by the PET scanner. FDHT is a radiotracer that looks for a protein which is present in almost all prostate cancer cells. The investigators want to find out if we can find and monitor changes in cancer using a FDHT PET scan.

increase in standardize uptake values (SUV) between the second and third FDHT scans, Enrolling 15 patients will provide 80% power to detect a 33% increase in the mean uptake (from 6 to 8) between the 2nd and the 3rd scans., 1 year
correlate AR expression to FDHT uptake, involves collecting formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue from pre-treatment biopsy specimens to correlate androgen receptor (AR) expression to FDHT uptake. AR expression will be measured using RNA-seq and correlated with FDHT SUV values separately for each scan using Spearman's rank correlation., 1 year
