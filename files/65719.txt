Phase 2 Trial for Chemo-Resistant Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasias With Pembrolizumab (CR-GTP)
Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) represents a group of rare tumors that accounts for less than 5% of gynecologic cancers which arising from malignant transformation of trophoblast, a cell originating from placenta. Placental expression of paternal antigens make placenta a target for maternal immune recognition during pregnancy, and PD-L1 expression maintains gestational tolerance. Also in GTN, PD-L1 is strongly expressed, suggesting the ligand is involved in tumor-immune evasion.

Most female patients with GTN cured with chemotherapy, however less than 5.0% of them die as a result of multi-drug resistance, necessitating novel approaches. Although there was limited data due to its rarity, the treatment response of avelumab and pembrolizumab in GTN is excellent (50% \~ 71.4% complete remission rate), as reported in the previous studies.

Therefore targeting of interaction PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition could be effective therapeutic strategy in chemoresistant GTN.

This study investigate clinical efficacy of patients with GTN resistant/refractory to multi-agent chemotherapy who treat with pembrolizumab.
