The tumor must be microsatellite stable (MSS), have a tumor mutational burden that is high (TMB-H) and be kras mutated. Patients must have been treated with available approved treatments already. In this study the investigators are testing a new type of immunotherapy, the potent IL-1 inhibitor isunakinra to be added to already approved immunotherapy (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor) in an attempt to get this treatment to work in this treatment resistant type of tumor.
