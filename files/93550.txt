Hormone Changes in Women With Stage IIIB or Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving Erlotinib
Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients receiving erlotinib may help doctors learn more about the effects of erlotinib on hormone levels.

This clinical trial is looking at hormone changes in women with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer receiving erlotinib.
Advanced Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer
Presence of hyperandrogenemia, We will determine if hyperandrogenemia is present in women with nonsmall cell lung cancer who are taking erlotinib., One approximate 30 minute visit
Dermatologic manifestations, We will describe the dermatologic manifestations of erlotinib in women, One approximate 30 minute visit|Changes in body habitus and patterns of hair loss, We will describe changes in body habitus and patterns of hair loss from women on erlotinib., One approximate 30 minute visit
Patients undergo a dermatology evaluation and complete the Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) research study questionnaire once. Blood samples are collected after an overnight fast. Samples are analyzed for circulating levels of total and bioavailable testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and sex hormone binding globulin. Serum luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, fasting glucose, and insulin levels are also assessed.
