Study of Sensitization of Non-M3 AML Blasts to ATRA by Epigenetic Treatment With Tranylcypromine (TCP)
The objective of the phase I part of the trial is the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TCP (Tranylcypromine) in combination with fixed-dose ATRA (all-trans-retinoic acid) and with fixed-dose AraC (Cytarabine) and to derive the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in patients with non-APL AML or MDS for whom no standard treatment is available or who failed azanucleoside treatment.

The objective of the phase II part of the trial is a first evaluation of the efficacy of TCP at the RP2D in combination with fixed-dose ATRA and with fixed-dose AraC as basis for further investigations of TCP
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: tranylcypromine|DRUG: all-trans retinoic acid|DRUG: cytarabine
MTD determination of TCP in combination with fixed-dose of ATRA and with fixed-dose Cytarabine;, MTD determination of TCP in combination with fixed-dose of ATRA and with fixed-dose Cytarabine;, first 28 days of treatment
Objective best response, (CR complete remission, CRi complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, PR partial remission), through study completion, an average of one year|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), 12 months
Study treatment: TCP + ATRA + AraC Four dose levels of TCP (20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg on days 1-28) will be examined in combination with fixed dose ATRA (45 mg/m2 on days 10-28) and fixed-dose AraC (40 mg on days 1-10) in the first cycle.

In further cycles patients will be treated in the same manner, except for ATRA which will be administered continuously with a nine-day interruption at the beginning of every fourth cycle.

Follow-up per patient: Until twelve months after registration of the last patient.

Duration of intervention per patient: Until relapse/progression, unacceptable toxicity or until twelve months after registration of the last patient, whatever occurs first
