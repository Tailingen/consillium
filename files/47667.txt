Treatment of Hyperuricemia With Rasburicase in Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia or High Grade Lymphoma
In this study the efficacy and tolerability of two approaches to treat and prevent hyperuricemia is tested in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or high-grade lymphoma with high risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Both arms are compared by randomisation. In one arm patients receive during pre-phase chemotherapy conventional prophylaxis with allopurinol whereas in the other arm Rasburicase is used.
