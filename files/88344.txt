Pilot Study of Meat-Borne Carcinogens and Pancreatic Cancer
Study Design:

This is a single institution pilot study to recruit 4 patients with operable pancreatic cancer scheduled for a pancreatectomy and 4 age/sex matched normal controls. Both groups will receive a single oral dose of radiolabeled MelQx followed by serial blood draws over an 8 hour period and urine collections over a 24 hour period. In addition, normal pancreatic tissue and normal small bowel tissue will be collected by Tissue Procurement from resected (waste) tissue at the time of pancreatectomy on the 4 pancreatic cancer patients.
Pancreatic Cancer
RADIATION: MeIQx|PROCEDURE: Pancreatectomy
Pharmacokinetic Metabolite Profile of Radiolabeled MeIQx in Blood, Metabolite levels will be expressed as the percent of total recovered radioactivity in plasma. Metabolite profiles will be qualitatively compared between cases and controls, which will include the mean, median, standard deviation, range and 90% confidence interval for the major detoxification metabolites., Pre MeIQx Administration, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 Hours Post MeIQx Administration|Pharmacokinetic Metabolite Profile of Radiolabeled MeIQx in Urine, Metabolite levels will be expressed as the percent of total recovered radioactivity in urine. Metabolite profiles will be qualitatively compared between cases and controls, which will include the mean, median, standard deviation, range and 90% confidence interval for the major detoxification metabolites., 0-4, 4-8 and 8-24 Hours Post MeIQx Administration
Quantify [14C]MeIQx-DNA adducts in human pancreas, In the pancreatic cancer patients, uninvolved/normal resected (waste) tissue from the surgery will be sent to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for DNA extraction following previously published methods. New \[14C\]MeIQx-DNA adducts formed at physiological concentrations will be detected and quantified in resected tissue with highly sensitive accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)., 4-8 Hours Post MeIQx Administration|Quantify ambient adducts in the human pancreas, DNA adducts already present in resected tissue will be quantified and characterized with a newly improved technique, electrospray capillary high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)., 4-8 Hours Post Administration
This is not a therapeutic trial. It is an etiologic investigation of meat-borne carcinogens and possible role in pancreatic cancer.
