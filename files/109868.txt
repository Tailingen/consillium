A Safety and Tolerability Study of Crenolanib in Combination With Chemotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients With FLT3 Mutations
This pilot study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral crenolanib besylate given sequentially during standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML with FLT3 activating mutations.
Newly Diagnosed AML With FLT3 Activating Mutations
DRUG: crenolanib|DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: daunorubicin|DRUG: idarubicin
Clinical Response to Crenolanib With Standard Induction Chemotherapy, To determine the response rate to crenolanib. Complete remission (CR) response criteria includes a post-baseline bone marrow (BM) biopsy or aspiration % blasts \<5%, the absence of Auer rods and extramedullary leukemia, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>1×10\^9/L and platelet count \>100×10\^9/L. Complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) response includes all CR criteria met, except participant do not achieve either platelet or ANC recovery. Composite Complete CR response includes all subjects who achieve a CR and CRi. Partial Response (PR) response includes all CR criteria met except a decrease of ≥50% in % blasts in the BM aspirate or biopsy from baseline but within 5-25% or bone marrow blasts \<5% with persistent Auer rods. Refractory Disease response includes subjects who do not satisfy the criteria for CR, CRi or PR., 2 years
3-Year Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of the first dose of treatment to the date of death from any cause or to the last date that the patient was known to be alive. OS at 3-years is presented., 3 years
