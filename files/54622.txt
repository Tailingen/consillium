A Study to Evaluate Tislelizumab Combined With Sitravatinib as Adjuvant Therapy in Participants With HCC at High Risk of Recurrence After Curative Resection
This is an open label, multi-center, single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab combined with sitravatinib as adjuvant therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who are at high risk of recurrence after curative resection.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with high morbidity and mortality. Surgical resection is the most important radical treatment. However, the recurrence rate is high especially in the patients with high risk of recurrence after curative resection. How to reduce postoperative recurrence and improve survival is currently a direction that is worth exploring.

Until now there is no standard postoperative adjuvant therapy. Various adjuvant treatment methods including immunotherapy, targeted therapy, TACE are being studied. This study is to explore the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab combined with sitravatinib as adjuvant therapy in HCC patients who are at high risk of recurrence after curative resection.
