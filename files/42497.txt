Vaccine Hesitancy in Patients with Solid Tumors: a Cross-sectional Single-center Survey
Cancer patients have a well-known and higher risk of vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) than the general population. VPD can cause serious complications due to compromised immune system, malnutrition and the same oncology treatments and represent a severe financial burden with a delay in treating the underlying cancer The main purpose of this survey is to analyse the perception of cancer patients on the topic vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases, the acceptability of vaccines and the evaluation of the determining factors associated with the choice of the patient to be vaccinated or not. This information will be used to improve the management of these issues.

assess the proportion of vaccinated subjects in our cohort of cancer patients undergoing active cancer treatment, The primary endpoint will be to assess the proportion of vaccinated subjects in the investigators cohort of cancer patients undergoing active cancer treatment (number of patients who received at least one vaccine/ total number of patients), 3 months
assess the proportion of vaccinated subjects with the anti flu vaccine in the investigators cohort of cancer patients undergoing active cancer treatment, 3 months|assess the proportion of vaccinated subjects with anti SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in the investigators cohort of cancer patients undergoing active cancer treatment, 3 months|assess the proportion of vaccinated subjects with anti pneumococccal vaccine in the investigators cohort of cancer patients undergoing active cancer treatment, 3 months|assess the proportion of vaccinated subjects with anti HZ vaccine in the investigators cohort of cancer patients undergoing active cancer treatment, 3 months|assess which variables (sex, age, degree of education, marital state, commodities, type of tumor, type of oncological treatment) are associated with not willingness to receive vaccines, 3 months
