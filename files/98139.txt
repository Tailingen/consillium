A Phase I Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of LCAR-M23, a CAR-T Cell Therapy Targeting MSLN in Patients With Relapsed and Refractory Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, single-dose dose finding and extension study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor efficacy profiles of the LCAR-M23 CAR-T cell therapy in subjects with relapsed and refractory epithelial ovarian cancer after prior adequate standard of care.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: LCAR-M23 cells
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and incidence, severity, and type of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) refers to a drug-related toxicity during treatment with the drug, the severity of which is clinically unacceptable, limiting the further escalation of drug dose. An adverse event refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product (investigational or non-investigational), which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment., 90 days post infusion|MTD/ RP2D regimen finding, Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), 90 days post infusion|Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) Positive Cell Concentration, Venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of CAR-T positive cellular concentration, 2 years post infusion
Disease control rate (DCR) after administration, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response, partial response and stable disease., 2 years post infusion|Objective Response Rate (ORR) after administration, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or PR after treatment via LCAR-M23 cell infusion, and the objective tumor response rate will be calculated for patients with measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1 criteria only., 2 years post infusion|Time to Response (TTR) after administration, Time to Response (TTR) is defined as the time interval from the date of first infusion of LCAR-M23 cell formulation to the date of the first response evaluation of the subject who has met all criteria for PR or better., 2 years post infusion|Duration of Response (DOR) after administration, Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of response (PR or better) to the first documentation of disease progression evidence (as per RECIST 1.1 criteria) of the responders (who achieve PR or better response)., 2 years post infusion|Progress Free Survival (PFS) after administration, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time interval from the date of first infusion of LCAR-M23 cell formulation to the first documentation of disease progression (as per RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first., 2 years post infusion|Overall Survival (OS) after administration, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time interval from the date of first infusion of LCAR-M23 cell formulation to death of the subject., 2 years post infusion
This study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, single-dose dose finding and extension study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-tumor efficacy profiles of the LCAR-M23 CAR-T cell therapy in subjects with relapsed and refractory epithelial ovarian cancer after prior adequate standard of care.
