Pharmacokinetic Drug-drug Interaction Study of Encorafenib and Binimetinib on Probe Drugs in Patients With BRAF V600-mutant Melanoma or Other Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, 3-arm, fixed-sequence study to evaluate the effect of single and multiple oral doses of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme probe substrates using a probe cocktail, on an organic anion-transporting polypeptide/breast cancer resistance protein (OATP/BCRP) substrate using rosuvastatin and on a CYP2B6 substrate using bupropion. The effect of multiple oral doses of the moderate cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitor modafinil on encorafenib in combination with binimetinib will also be assessed. The study will have 2 treatment phases, a drug-drug interaction (DDI) phase followed by a post-DDI phase.

TEAEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity between the first dose of encorafenib/binimetinib and up to 30 days after treatment discontinuation. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. SAEs were adjudicated according to the investigator's assessment. Treatment-related AEs and SAEs were determined by the investigator., After 1st dose of encorafenib/binimetinib on Day 1 and up to Day 28 visit in the DDI Phase|Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities in the DDI Phase, Laboratory parameters:hematology (hemoglobin,hematocrit,red blood cell \[RBC\],platelet,white blood cell count \[WBC\],neutrophils,eosinophils,monocytes, basophils, lymphocytes), chemistry (albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, amylase, aspartate aminotransferase, bicarbonate, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, chloride, creatine kinase, creatinine, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, lipase, magnesium, inorganic phosphate, potassium, total protein, sodium, uric acid), urinalysis (appearance, color, specific gravity, pH, ketones, protein, glucose, blood, nitrates, leukocyte esterase, and urine microscopy results including WBC, RBC, bacteria, epithelial cells, and casts), coagulation (activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio) and others. Clinically notable: worsening from baseline by at least 2 grades or to greater than or equal to (\>=) Grade 3, by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03., After 1st dose of encorafenib/binimetinib on Day 1 and up to Day 28 visit in the DDI Phase|Number of Participants With Notable Abnormalities in Vital Signs in the DDI Phase, Vital signs (temperature, pulse rate \[PR\]), systolic blood pressure \[SBP\]), and diastolic blood pressure \[DBP\]) were obtained with participants following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. Categorical criteria were defined as DBP\>=100 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)/less than or equal to (\<=) 50 mmHg with increase/decrease from baseline of \>=15 mmHg; SBP: \>=160 mmHg/\<=90 mmHg with increase/decrease from baseline of \>=20 mmHg; PR: \>=120 beats per minute (bpm)/\<=50 bpm with increase/decrease from baseline of \>=15 bpm; temperature for Arms 1 and 3: \>=37.5°C/\<=35°C; Arms 2: \>=37.5°C/\<=36°C., After 1st dose of encorafenib/binimetinib on Day 1 and up to Day 28 visit in the DDI Phase|Number of Participants With Notable Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings in the DDI Phase, Triplicate 12-lead ECG were performed after the participant had rested quietly for at least 10 minutes in a supine position. ECG parameters included RR interval, PR interval, QRS complex, QT interval, corrected QT (QTc) interval, Bazett's correction QT (QTcB) interval, Heart Rate and Fridericia's correction (QTcF) interval. The criterion included: QTcF \>450 - \<=480 mesc, \>480 - \<=500 msec, \>500 msec, increase from baseline \>30 - \<=60 msec and increase from baseline \>60 msec. QT interval \>450 - \<=480 msec, \>480 - \<=500 msec, \>500 msec, increase from baseline \>30 - \<=60 msec and increase from baseline \>60 msec. Heart rate increase from baseline \>25% and value \>100 bpm and decrease from baseline \>25% and value \<60 bpm. PR interval increase from baseline \>25% and value \>200 msec. QRS interval increase from baseline \>25% and value \>110 msec. Any new post-baseline notable ECG findings in the DDI phase was collected and reported in this outcome measure., After 1st dose of encorafenib/binimetinib on Day 1 and up to Day 28 visit in the DDI Phase|Number of Participants With Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) Abnormalities in the DDI Phase, LVEF abnormalities are defined according to CTCAE grade version 4.03. Participants was considered as having a LVEF abnormality if the worst post-baseline value was Grade 2, 3, or 4 according to the following classification: Grade 0: Non-missing value below Grade 2; Grade 2: LVEF between 40% and 50% or absolute change from baseline between -10% and \<-20%; Grade 3: LVEF between 20% and 39% or absolute change from baseline lower than or equal to -20%; Grade 4: LVEF lower than 20%., After 1st dose of encorafenib/binimetinib on Day 1 and up to Day 28 visit in the DDI Phase|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in the Post-DDI Phase, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. TEAEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity between the first dose of encorafenib/binimetinib and up to 30 days after treatment discontinuation. A SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. SAEs were adjudicated according to the investigator's assessment. Treatment-related AEs and SAEs were determined by the investigator. Any significant findings in the laboratory test, physical examinations, ophthalmic examinations, vital signs, ECG tests were captured as an AE., After 1st dose of encorafenib/binimetinib on Day 1 up to 30 days after the post-DDI Phase
This is an open-label, 3-arm, fixed-sequence study to evaluate the effect of single and multiple oral doses of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme probe substrates using a probe cocktail, on an organic anion-transporting polypeptide/breast cancer resistance protein (OATP/BCRP) substrate using rosuvastatin and on a CYP2B6 substrate using bupropion. The effect of multiple oral doses of the moderate cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitor modafinil on encorafenib in combination with binimetinib will also be assessed. The study will have 2 treatment phases, a drug-drug interaction (DDI) phase followed by a post-DDI phase.
