Molecular Imaging of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Colorectal Neoplasia Using Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy
The study aims to:

1. Achieve molecular imaging of EGFR in patients with colorectal neoplasia in vivo using confocal laser endomicroscopy.
2. Compare the results of in vivo EGFR-specific molecular imaging with CLE and ex vivo immunohistochemistry .
Colorectal Cancer|Colorectal Adenoma
Various kinds of tumor markers have been shown to be over-expressed in colorectal cancer, including epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR). The conventional detection method of EGFR expression in colorectal neoplasia is immunohistochemistry which is time-consuming, and the immunoreactivity can be affected by storage and fixation of tissues. Confocal laser endomicrosopy is a newly developed device which could identify the cellular and subcellular structures clearly with the magnification at×1000, making it possible to explore the physiological and pathological molecular mechanism of the gastrointestinal tract. So the study aims to achieve molecular imaging of EGFR in colorectal neoplasia in vivo using confocal laser endomicroscopy.
