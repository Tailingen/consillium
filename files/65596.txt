Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of JK500 Cell Injection in Relapsed/Refractory Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm exploratory clinical study, aiming to complete the preliminary clinical observation of 12 children with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia treated with JK500 cell injection to evaluate the safety of clinical infusion and the initial efficacy of JK500 cell injection in the treatment of children with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Childhood|Relapsed Leukemia|Refractory Leukemia
DRUG: JK500 cell injection，cyclophosphamide，Fludarabine
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT evaluation is defined as adverse events or laboratory abnormalities that occur within 4 weeks after investigational drug administration, are unrelated to external causes such as progressive disease, concomitant disease, and concomitant medications, including hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events (grade according to NCI CTCAE 5.0)., 28 days
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as complete response (CR)+ incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi) + partial response (PR). Treatment response will be assessed periodically until the end of treatment and up to 24 months after the first injection., 24 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), To observe the MRD status in bone marrow., 24 months
The Main components of JK500 cell injection are regenerative natural killer (NK) cells derived from human embryonic stem cells and 0.9% sodium chloride solution.
