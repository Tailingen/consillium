Intrathecal Chemotherapy Through Ommaya Reservoir Upon Her-2 Negative Breast Cancer With Leptomeningeal Metastasis
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label investigator-initiated clinical study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and quality of life of intrathecal chemotherapy through Ommaya reservoir in combination with systematic chemotherapy versus systemic chemotherapy alone in patients with Her-2 negative breast cancer with leptomeningeal metastasis.
HER2-negative Breast Cancer|Leptomeningeal Metastasis
DEVICE: Ommaya reservoir|DRUG: Systematic chemotherapy
Neural progression-free survival (NPFS), Clinical outcome of intrathecal chemotherapy through Ommaya reservoir in combination with systematic chemotherapy versus systematic chemotherapy Upon Her-2 negative breast cancer with leptomeningeal metastasis: Neural progression-free survival (NPFS) calculated from the randomized date until first observation of meningeal metastasis progression (LM-PD) or death (whichever occurs earlier). Neural progression, according to the RANO-LM criteria, is defined as: neurological examination/worsening of symptoms, or CSF cytological progression, or imaging progression., Six months after the last patient was enrolled
