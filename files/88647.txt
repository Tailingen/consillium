Safety and Activity Study of Intrathecally Administered Ziconotide for Neuropathic Pain in Patients With Cancer
Neuropathic pain is difficult to control because it is only partially sensitive to opioid analgesics, and requires the addition of other therapies such as antidepressants and epileptics. Ziconotide is a drug that is used to treat neuropathic pain in patients who have had inadequate pain control with prior combination of medicines.
