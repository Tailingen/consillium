A Study of LY2784544 in Participants With Myeloproliferative Neoplasms
The primary purpose of this study is to measure the response rate in participants with the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), or myelofibrosis (MF) when treated with LY2784544, including those who have demonstrated an intolerance to, failure of primary response to, or have demonstrated disease progression while on ruxolitinib.
