Study of Ibrutinib and Rituximab in Treatment Naïve Follicular Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of ibrutinib will result in prolongation of progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with rituximab alone in treatment naïve participants with follicular lymphoma.
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: ibrutinib|DRUG: placebo to match ibrutinib|DRUG: rituximab
Number of Participants with Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS, is assessed by the investigator, will be analyzed in the intent to treat (ITT) population, comparing the 2 treatment arms (Arm A and Arm B)., 2-5 years
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR of the two treatment arms will be compared using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors, under the hierarchical procedure., 2-5 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the date of the participant's death from any cause., 2-5 years|Infusion-Related Reaction Rate, Infusion-related reaction rate Arm A vs. Arm B., 2-5 years|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by Investigator, DOR is defined as the time from the date of the participant's documented disease progression or death due to the disease, whichever occurs first., 2-5 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., 2-5 years
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of ibrutinib will result in prolongation of progression-free survival (PFS) when compared with rituximab alone in treatment naïve participants with follicular lymphoma.
