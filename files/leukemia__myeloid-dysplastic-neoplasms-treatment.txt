General Information About Childhood Myelodysplastic Neoplasms (MDS)
The myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) represent between 5% and 10% of all myeloid malignancies in children. They are a heterogeneous group of disorders. MDS usually presents with cytopenias and is characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and increased cell death. MPN presents with increased peripheral white blood cell, red blood cell, or platelet counts, and it is associated with increased progenitor cell proliferation and survival.  Because both types of syndromes represent disorders of very primitive, multipotential hematopoietic stem cells, curative therapeutic approaches nearly always require allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
For information about therapy-related MDS, see the
Therapy-Related AML and Therapy-Related Myelodysplastic Neoplasms

Clinical Presentation
Patients with myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) often present with signs of cytopenias, including pallor, infection, or bruising.
The bone marrow is usually characterized by hypercellularity and dysplastic changes of 10% or more in one or more precursor lineages.  Clonal evolution can eventually lead to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The percentage of abnormal blasts is less than 20%, and they lack common AML recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g., t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), or
KMT2A
translocations).
The less common hypocellular MDS can be distinguished from aplastic anemia in part by its marked dysplasia, clonal nature, and higher percentage of CD34-positive precursors.[

Risk Factors
Patients with the following germline variants or inherited disorders have a significantly increased risk of developing myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS):
Fanconi anemia:
Caused by germline pathogenic variants in DNA repair genes.
Telomere biology disorders (e.g., dyskeratosis congenita):
Resulting from variants in genes that regulate telomere length. Genes altered in dyskeratosis congenita include
ACD
,
CTC1
,
DKC1
,
NHP2
,
NOP10
,
PARN
,
RTEL1
,
TERC
,
TERT

GATA1
variants have been linked to Diamond-Blackfan anemia and MDS predisposition.[

]
Severe congenital neutropenia:
Caused by variants in the gene encoding elastase. The 15-year cumulative risk of MDS in patients with severe congenital neutropenia, also known as Kostmann syndrome, has been estimated to be 15%, with an annual risk of MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of 2% to 3%. It is unclear how variants affecting this protein and how the chronic exposure of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor  (G-CSF) contribute to the development of MDS.[

Trisomy 21 syndrome:
GATA1
variants are nearly always present in the transient leukemia associated with Trisomy 21 and MDS in children younger than 3 years with Down syndrome.[

Congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT):
Inherited variants in the
RUNX1
or
CEPBA
genes are associated with CAMT.[

GATA2
variants:
Germline pathogenic variants in
GATA2
have been reported in patients with MDS/AML in conjunction with monocytopenia, B cell and natural killer cell deficiency, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and susceptibility to opportunistic infections.[

A retrospective analysis was performed on genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant for MDS and aplastic anemia. The analysis used a capture assay to target variants known to predispose individuals to bone marrow failure and MDS. Among the 46 children aged 18 years and younger with MDS, 10 patients (22%) harbored constitutional variants in hematologic predisposition genes (5
GATA2
, 1 each of
MPL
,
RTEL1
,
SBDS
,
TINF2
, and
TP53
). Only two of these patients were clinically suspected of having genetic variants before their transplants. Children in this study had a higher incidence of genetic variants (22%) than  adults aged 18 to 40 years (8%).[

Molecular features of myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS)
Molecular features of myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS)
Compared with MDS in adults, pediatric MDS is associated with a distinctive constellation of genetic alterations. In adults, MDS often evolves from clonal hematopoiesis and is characterized by variants in
TET2
,
DNMT3A
,
DDX41
and
TP53
. In contrast, variants in these genes are rare in pediatric MDS, while variants in
GATA2
,
SAMD9
,
SAMD9L
,
ETV6
,
SETBP1
,
ASXL1
, and RAS/MAPK pathway genes are observed in subsets of children with MDS.[
1
,
2
]
A report of the genomic landscape of pediatric MDS described the results of whole-exome sequencing for 32 pediatric patients with primary MDS and targeted sequencing for another 14 cases.[
1
] These 46 cases were equally divided between childhood MDS with low blasts (cMDS-LB) (previously called refractory cytopenia of childhood) and childhood MDS with  increased blasts (cMDS-IB) (previously called MDS with excess blasts [MDS-EB)]). The results from the report include the following:
Variants in RAS/MAPK pathway genes were observed in 43% of primary MDS cases, with variants most commonly involving the
PTPN11
and
NRAS
genes. However, variants were also observed in other RAS/MAPK pathway genes (e.g.,
BRAF
[non–
BRAF
V600E],
CBL
, and
KRAS
). RAS/MAPK variants were more common in patients with cMDS-IB (65%) than in patients with cMDS-LB (17%).
Germline pathogenic variants in
SAMD9
(n = 4) or
SAMD9L
(n = 4) were observed in 17% of patients with primary MDS, with seven  of eight variants occurring in patients with cMDS-LB. These cases all showed loss of material on chromosome 7. Approximately 40% of patients with deletions of part or all of chromosome 7 had germline
SAMD9
or
SAMD9L
variants.
GATA2
pathogenic variants were observed in three cases (7%), and all cases were confirmed or presumed to be germline.
Deletions involving chromosome 7 were the most common copy number alteration and were observed in 41% of cases. Loss of part or all of chromosome 7 was most commonly observed in
SAMD9
and
SAMD9L
cases (100%) and in cMDS-IB patients with a RAS/MAPK variant (71%).
In more than 1 of the 46 cases, other genes were altered (
SETBP1
,
ETV6
, and
TP53
).
A second report described the application of a targeted sequencing panel of 105 genes to 50 pediatric patients with MDS (cMDS-LB = 31 and cMDS-IB = 19) and was enriched for cases with monosomy 7 (48%).[
1
,
2
]
SAMD9
and
SAMD9L
were not included in the gene panel. The second report described the following results:
Germline
GATA2
pathogenic variants were observed in 30% of patients, and germline
RUNX1
pathogenic variants were observed in 6% of patients.
Somatic variants were observed in 34% of patients and were more common in patients with cMDS-IB than in patients with cMDS-LB (68% vs. 13%).
The most commonly altered gene was
SETBP1
(18%). Less commonly altered genes included
ASXL1
,
RUNX1
, and RAS/MAPK pathway genes (
PTPN11
,
NRAS
,
KRAS
,
NF1
). Twelve percent of cases had variants in RAS/MAPK pathway genes.
Patients with germline
GATA2
pathogenic variants, in addition to MDS, show a wide range of hematopoietic and immune defects as well as nonhematopoietic manifestations.[
3
] The former defects include monocytopenia with susceptibility to atypical mycobacterial infection and DCML deficiency (loss of dendritic cells, monocytes, and B and natural killer lymphoid cells). The resulting immunodeficiency leads to increased susceptibility to warts, severe viral infections, mycobacterial infections, fungal infections, and human papillomavirus–related cancers. The nonhematopoietic manifestations include deafness and lymphedema.
Germline
GATA2
pathogenic variants were studied in 426 pediatric patients with primary MDS and 82 cases with secondary MDS who were enrolled in consecutive studies of the European Working Group of MDS in Childhood (EWOG-MDS).[
4
] The study had the following results:
Germline
GATA2
pathogenic variants were identified in 7% of pediatric patients with primary MDS. While the median age of patients presenting with
GATA2
variants was 12.3 years in the EWOG-MDS pediatric population, most cases of germline
GATA2
-related myeloid neoplasms occur during adulthood.[
5
]
GATA2
variants were more common in patients with cMDS-IB (15%) than in patients with cMDS-LB (4%).
Among patients with
GATA2
variants, 46% presented with cMDS-IB, and 70% showed monosomy 7.
Familial MDS/acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was identified in 12 of 53 patients with
GATA2
variants for whom detailed family histories were available.
Nonhematologic phenotypes of
GATA2
deficiency were present in 51% of patients with MDS who had
GATA2
variants and included deafness (9%), lymphedema/hydrocele (23%), and immunodeficiency (39%).
SAMD9
and
SAMD9L
germline pathogenic variants are both associated with pediatric MDS cases in which there is an additional loss of all or part of chromosome 7.[
6
,
7
]
In 2016,
SAMD9
was identified as the cause of the MIRAGE syndrome (myelodysplasia, infection, restriction of growth, adrenal hypoplasia, genital phenotypes, and enteropathy), which is associated with early-onset MDS with monosomy 7.[
8
] Subsequently, variants in
SAMD9L
were identified in patients with ataxia pancytopenia syndrome (ATXPC;
OMIM 159550
).
SAMD9
and
SAMD9L
variants were also identified as the cause of the myelodysplasia and leukemia syndrome with monosomy 7 (MLSM7;
OMIM 252270
),[
9
]  a syndrome first identified in phenotypically normal siblings who developed MDS or AML associated with monosomy 7 during childhood.[
10
]
Causative variants in both
SAMD9
and
SAMD9L
are gain-of-function variants and enhance the growth-suppressing activity of
SAMD9
and
SAMD9L
.[
8
,
10
]
Both
SAMD9
and
SAMD9L
are located at chromosome 7q21.2. Cases of MDS in patients with
SAMD9
or
SAMD9L
variants often show monosomy 7, with the remaining chromosome 7 having wild-type
SAMD9
and
SAMD9L
. This results in the loss of the enhanced growth-suppressing activity of the altered gene.
Phenotypically normal patients with
SAMD9
or
SAMD9L
variants and monosomy 7 may progress to develop MDS or AML or, alternatively, may show loss of their monosomy 7 with a return of normal hematopoiesis.[
10
] The former outcome is associated with the acquisition of variants in genes associated with MDS/AML (e.g.,
ETV6
or
SETBP1
). The latter outcome is associated with genetic alterations (e.g., revertant variants or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity with retention of the wild-type allele) that result in normalization of
SAMD9
or
SAMD9L
activity. These observations suggest that monitoring patients with
SAMD9
- or
SAMD9L
-related monosomy 7, using clinical sequencing for acquired somatic variants in genes associated with progression to AML, may identify those at high risk of leukemic transformation. Such patients may benefit most from hematopoietic stem cell transplant.[
10
]
The presence of an isolated monosomy 7 is the most common cytogenetic abnormality, although it does not appear to portend a poor prognosis, compared with its presence in overt AML.  However, the presence of monosomy 7 in combination with other cytogenetic abnormalities is associated with a poor prognosis.[
11
,
12
]  The relatively common abnormalities of -Y, 20q-, and 5q- in adults with MDS are rare in childhood MDS. The presence of cytogenetic abnormalities that are found in AML (t(8;21)(q22;q22.1), inv(16)(p13.1;q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22), and APL with
PML
::
RARA
gene fusions) defines disease that should be treated as AML and not MDS, regardless of blast percentage.  The World Health Organization (WHO) notes that whether this should also apply to other recurring genetic abnormalities remains controversial.[

World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Bone Marrow and Peripheral Blood Findings for MDS
Pediatric myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) can be grouped into several general categories, each with distinctive clinical and biological characteristics, as follows:[
1
]
MDS arising from an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome, such as Fanconi anemia, severe congenital neutropenia, and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, or a germline predisposition syndrome that confers higher risk of myeloid malignancy.
MDS arising from severe aplastic anemia.
Secondary MDS arising from cytotoxic exposures, such as high-dose alkylating chemotherapy.
Primary MDS includes cases of MDS beyond those listed above, acknowledging that some of the cases characterized as primary MDS are also associated with predisposition syndromes.
Distinguishing MDS from similar-appearing, reactive causes of dysplasia and/or cytopenias can be difficult.  In general, the finding of ≥10% dysplasia in a cell lineage is a diagnostic criterion for MDS. However, the 2016 WHO guidelines caution that reactive etiologies, rather than clonal ones, may have ≥10% dysplasia and should be excluded, especially when dysplasia is subtle and/or restricted to a single lineage.[
2
]
The French-American-British (FAB) classification of MDS was not completely applicable to children.[
3
,
4
] Traditionally, MDS classification systems have been divided into several distinct categories based on the presence of the following:[
4
-
7
]
Myelodysplasia.
Types of cytopenia.
Specific chromosomal abnormalities.
Percentage of myeloblasts.
A modified classification schema for MDS and myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) that included subsections on pediatric MDS and MPD was initially proposed in 2003 [
8
] and then published by the WHO in 2008.[
9
] A 2016 revision to the WHO classification removed focus on the specific lineage (anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia) and distinguished cases with dysplasia in single versus multiple lineages.
The 5th edition of the WHO Classification of Hematolymphoid Tumors includes a separate category for childhood MDS because MDS in children (aged <18 years) are biologically distinct from those in adults.[

By definition, ≤25% bone marrow cellularity, age adjusted.
Childhood MDS with low blasts (cMDS-LB) includes cases with less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow and less than 2% blasts in the peripheral blood. This group replaces  the prior category of refractory cytopenia of childhood. Patients with cMDS-LB can be further categorized as hypocellular (80% of childhood cases; defined as <25% cellularity, adjusted for age) or not otherwise specified (20% of childhood cases).[
12
,
13
]
As in the 2016 WHO guidelines, reactive etiologies, rather than clonal ones, may have more than 10% dysplasia and should be excluded. Childhood MDS with increased blasts (cMDS-IB) includes the patients with 5% to 19% blasts in the bone marrow or 2% to 19% blasts in the peripheral blood. When children present with dysplasia and blast count <20% but genetic testing reveals recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities that are usually associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a diagnosis of AML is made, and patients are treated accordingly.
A third classification system, the International Consensus Classification (ICC) of Myeloid Neoplasms and Acute Leukemias, has been published and is primarily used as a tool for clinical trial development instead of clinical use. It further incorporates the growing number of discovered germline predisposition syndromes in children with myeloid neoplasms. For more information, see the sections on
Risk Factors
and
Molecular Abnormalities
.[

The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) is used to determine the risk of progression to AML and the outcome in adult patients with MDS.  When this system was applied to children with MDS or juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), only a blast count of less than 5% and a platelet count of more than 100 × 10
9
/L were associated with a better survival in MDS, and  a platelet count  of more than 40 × 10
9
/L predicted a better outcome in JMML.[
16
] These results suggest that MDS and JMML in children may be significantly different disorders than adult-type MDS.
The median survival for children with high-risk MDS remains substantially better than for adults, and the presence of monosomy 7 in children has not had the same adverse prognostic impact as in adults with MDS.[
17
] However, the presence of monosomy 7 in combination with other cytogenetic abnormalities is associated with a poor prognosis.[
18
,
19
]  In one retrospective analysis, only the revised IPSS (R-IPSS)  very poor–risk subgroup, defined as having complex cytogenetics (i.e., >3 abnormalities), was found to have a significant adverse prognostic impact on overall survival and relapse risk after transplant.[
20
] The relatively common abnormalities of -Y, 20q-, and 5q- in adults with MDS are rare in childhood MDS. Patients with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities that are found in AML should be treated for AML and not MDS, regardless of blast percentage.
The R-IPSS prognostic groups and associated cytogenetic abnormalities include the following:[
20
]
Very good prognostic group:
-Y; del(11q).
Good	prognostic group:
Normal; del(5q); del(20q); del(12p); double	including del(5q).

The IPSS can help to distinguish low-risk from high-risk MDS. However, its utility in children with MDS is more limited than in adults because many characteristics differ between children and adults.[

Genomic characterization of pediatric primary MDS has identified specific subsets defined by alterations in selected genes. For example, germline pathogenic variants in either
GATA2
,[
22
]
SAMD9
, or
SAMD9L
[

,
23
,
24
] are especially common in children with deletions of all or part of chromosome 7.  Spontaneous remission of MDS in young children with
SAMD9
or
SAMD9L
variants led to the discovery that somatic genetic rescue can lead to phenotypic correction.[
25
] Genomic characterization has also shown that primary MDS in children differs from adult MDS at the molecular level.[

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.[
2
]  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
3
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy.  Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website

Treatment of Childhood MDS
In This Section
HSCT
Other Therapies
Treatment options for children with myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) include the following:
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
with or without chemotherapy.
Other therapies
.
HSCT
MDS and associated disorders usually involve a primitive hematopoietic stem cell.  Thus, allogeneic HSCT is considered the optimal approach to treatment for pediatric patients with MDS.  Although matched sibling donor transplant is preferred, similar survival has been noted with well-matched, unrelated cord blood and haploidentical approaches.[
1
-
5
]
Because survival after HSCT is improved in children with early forms of MDS (refractory anemia), transplant before progression to late MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) should be considered. HSCT should especially be considered when transfusions or other treatments are required, as is usually the case in patients with severe symptomatic cytopenias.[
4
,
6
] The 8-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates for children with various stages of MDS has been reported to be 65% for those treated with HLA matched donor transplants and 40% for those treated with mismatched unrelated donor transplants.[
6
][
Level of evidence C2
]  A 3-year DFS rate of 50% was reported with the use of unrelated cord blood donor transplants for children with MDS when the transplants were done after the year 2001.[
7
][
Level of evidence C2
]
When making treatment decisions, certain data should be considered, including the question of whether chemotherapy should be used in high-risk MDS.  For example, survival rates as high as 80% have been reported for patients with early-stage MDS who proceeded to transplant within a few months of diagnosis. Additionally, early transplant and no pretransplant chemotherapy have been associated with improved survival in children with MDS.[
8
][
Level of evidence C1
]; [
9
] A retrospective analysis suggested that azacitidine and venetoclax may have a role in the cytoreduction of disease before HSCT in children with MDS. To date, reports of patients with advanced MDS who received venetoclax-based therapy are anecdotal.[
10
] While results differ in published series, this regimen might prove to be an effective bridge to HSCT. Azacitidine and venetoclax are being prospectively studied as treatment options for children with MDS.
DFS rates have been estimated to be 50% to 70% for pediatric patients with advanced MDS using myeloablative transplant preparative regimens.[

11
-
13
]  While nonmyeloablative preparative transplant regimens are being tested in patients with MDS and AML, such regimens are still investigational for children with these disorders. However, these regimens may be reasonable in the setting of a clinical trial or when a patient’s organ function is compromised in such a way that a myeloablative regimen would be intolerable.[

Evidence (HSCT):
The Children's Cancer Group 2891 trial accrued patients between 1989 and 1995, including children with
MDS.[
11
]  There were 77 patients enrolled, including patients with refractory anemia (n = 2), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) (n = 33),
refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) (n = 26), or AML with antecedent MDS (n = 16). Patients were randomly assigned
to receive either standard or intensively timed induction. Subsequently, patients were allocated to
allogeneic HSCT if there was a suitable family donor or
randomly assigned to either autologous HSCT or chemotherapy.
Patients with
refractory anemia or RAEB had a lower remission rate (45%). Patients with RAEB-T (69%) or AML
with a history of MDS (81%) had similar remission rates compared with those with de novo AML (77%).
The 6-year survival rates were lower for those with refractory anemia or RAEB (28%) and RAEB-T (30%).
Patients with AML and
antecedent MDS had a similar outcome to those with de novo AML (survival rates, 50% vs.
45%, respectively).
Allogeneic HSCT appeared to improve survival (
P
= .08).
Based on the results of the EWOG-MDS 98 study, HSCT was verified as an important  therapeutic approach necessary to achieve prolonged survival. For many patients, HSCT is the sole therapy received.[
19
] Children with RAEB (n = 53), RAEB-T (n = 29), and myelodysplasia-related AML (n = 15) were treated with an HSCT from various sources (related and unrelated) using the preparative regimen of busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan. Among this group, 73 were treated without the use of intensive therapy before the HSCT preparative regimen.
Children with a diagnosis of RAEB and RAEB-T had equivalent event-free survival (EFS) rates of 63% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49%–77%) and 64% (95% CI, 46%–82%), respectively.
For those with a morphological marrow blast percentage before HSCT of less than 5%, 5% to 20%, or 20% or higher, the EFS rates were 62% (95% CI, 41%–83%), 65% (95% CI, 50%–80%) and 45% (95% CI, 23%–67%), respectively.
In the entire cohort (n = 97), patients who received low-dose therapy or no therapy before the preparative regimen (n = 73) had similar EFS rates compared with those who received prior intensive chemotherapy (58% [95% CI, 46%–70%] vs. 62% [95% CI, 42%–82%]).
The outcomes of patients who received unrelated donor cells were like the outcomes of patients who received matched-family donor cells.
A single-institution retrospective analysis reported on 37 consecutive children with various types of MDS who underwent HSCT using various donor types. Some patients were treated with pre-HSCT chemotherapy (n = 7).[
8
]
In multivariate analysis, improved DFS was associated with avoiding pre-HSCT chemotherapy (relative risk [RR], 0.30;
P
= .03) and a shorter interval (<140 days) between diagnosis and HSCT (RR, 0.27;
P
= .02).
In the 16 children who did not receive pre-HSCT chemotherapy and underwent transplant fewer than 140 days from diagnosis, the 3-year overall survival (OS) and DFS rates were both 80% (95% CI, 51%–93%).
When analyzing these results, it is important to consider that the subtype RAEB-T is likely to represent patients with overt AML, while refractory anemia and RAEB represents MDS. The World Health Organization classification has omitted the category of RAEB-T, concluding that it is essentially AML.
Because MDS in children is often associated with inherited predisposition syndromes, reports of transplant in small numbers of patients with these disorders have been documented.  For example, in patients with Fanconi anemia and AML or advanced MDS, the 5-year OS rate has been reported to be 33% to 55%.[
20
,
21
][
Level of evidence C1
]
While some patients with inherited predisposition syndromes require significant modification of their transplant approaches because of excess toxicity (e.g., Fanconi anemia), other syndromes have no detectable excessive toxicity associated with the transplant process.  Inherited
GATA2
deficiency is a good example of the latter.  One study compared HSCT outcomes of 65 children with
GATA2
germline pathogenic variants and MDS with the outcomes of 404 children with MDS and wild-type germline
GATA2
.  Rates of DFS, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality were similar in the two populations.[
22
]
Second transplants have also been used in pediatric patients with MDS/myeloproliferative disorders who experience relapse or graft failure.  The 3-year OS rates were 33% for those who underwent a second transplant after relapse and 57% for those who underwent a second transplant after initial graft failure.[
23
][
Level of evidence C1
]
For patients with clinically significant cytopenias, supportive care that includes transfusions and prophylactic antibiotics are considered the standard of care.  The use of hematopoietic growth factors can improve the hematopoietic status, but there are concerns that such treatment could accelerate conversion to AML.[
24
]
Other Therapies
In general, the primary aim for children with newly diagnosed MDS is to rule out AML-associated somatic variants, which would indicate the need to treat according to AML guidelines. Thereafter, the objective should be to provide supportive care while looking for an appropriate donor for HSCT. During this time, close monitoring for the emergence of AML is imperative.[
25
] Therapies used in adult MDS have not been shown to be beneficial in childhood MDS, likely owing to differences in underlying variant etiologies.
Other therapies for MDS that have been studied and may be applicable include the following:
Agents such as lenalidomide, an analogue of thalidomide, have been tested based on findings that demonstrated increased activity in the bone marrow of patients with MDS.  Lenalidomide has shown the most efficacy in patients with 5q- syndrome, especially those with thrombocytosis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lenalidomide for use in adults with this finding.[
