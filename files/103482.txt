Hemithoracic Arc Radiotherapy Post Pleural Decortication
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma is an aggressive and refractory disease , the most aggressive treatment plan offered to these patients include trimodalitiy approach with chemotherapy as the mainstay of treatment . the rationale of post operative Radiotherapy is to sterilize the post operative volume to reduce local failure meanwhile minimizing toxicities in this trial we are going to assess the safety and efficacy of Radiotherapy in Mesothelioma patients poat Pleural decortication
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
RADIATION: hemithoracic Volumetric Arc Radiotherapy post Pleural decortication
Acute Radiation Toxicity, Questionnaire based Follow up about acute Radiation toxicity according to RTOG including dysnea , cough , chest pain , dysnea on effort from grade 1-5, weekly assessment during radiation course and monthly follow up for the first 6 months|late radiation toxicity, follow up of patients using both Questionnaire and performing pulmonary function tests and Echo , focusing on DLCO \& FEV1, Bi-monthly fashion of minimum 6 months post radiation course
This study will include malignant Pleural Mesothelioma patients treated by trimodalitiy approach starting with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery in the form of Pleural decortication then all patients will receive post operative hemithoracic radiation
