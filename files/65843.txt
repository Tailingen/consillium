Reduced-intensity Conditioning Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT followed by prophylactic dose-escalating DLIs in patients with higher risk MDS.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
relapse incidence,duration of remission, The efficacy of the treatment will be measured in terms of relapse incidence and duration of remission (the primary endpoints). The hematopoietic cell donors in the study will include HLA-matched sibling, HLA-matched unrelated donors, and HLA-mismatched familial donors., 4years
engraftment, donor chimerism, secondary graft failure,GVHD, â€¢This study will evaluate engraftment, donor chimerism, secondary graft failure, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), immune recovery, infections, non-relapse mortality, progression-free survival (PFS), and OS., 4 years
Conditioning therapy

* Busulfan 3.2 mg/kg/d on d-7 to -6
* Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on d-7 to -2

Infuse G-PBMCs on d 0 to d+1.

* Donor G-PBMC infusion

GVHD prophylaxis

* Cyclosporine 1.5 mg/kg i.v. q 12 hrs beginning on d-1 and changed to oral dosing (with twice the i.v. dose) when oral intake is possible. Tapered beginning between d+30 and d+60.
* Methotrexate 15 mg/m2 i.v. on d+2, and 10 mg/m2 i.v. on d+4 and d+7

Prophylactic dose-escalating DLIs

* Begin at d+120 or at least 2 wks after IST discontinuation.
* No evidence of recurrence or GVHD CD3+ cell dose increment q 4 wks 4Three dose levels
