Ramucirumab Plus FOLFIRI Versus Ramucirumab Plus Paclitaxel in Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer, Who Failed One Prior Line of Palliative Chemotherapy
This clinical trial will evaluate whether it is beneficial in terms of prolongation of survival to combine FOLFIRI (standard treatment) with ramucirumab compared to the standard treatment of ramucirumab plus paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer after failure of one prior line of palliative chemotherapy. This trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI (investigational arm A) compared to paclitaxel plus ramucirumab (control arm B).
Advanced Gastric or EGJ Cancer
DRUG: FOLFIRI|DRUG: Ramucirumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
OS Rate at 6 months primary endpoint for phase II, OS Rate at 6 months is defined at the proportion of patients being known to be alive at 6 months after randomisation, 6 months after randomization|overall survival (OS) co-primary endpoint for phase III, duration from date of randomization to death, from date of randomization to 1 year after end of treatment|Objective Overall Response Rate (ORR) co-primary endpoint for phase III, proportion of patients with complete or partial response (CR + PR) according to RECIST 1.1, from randomization for the time of treatment with a maximum of 1 year
Progression-free survival, duration from the first study drug administration to the first documented evidence of disease progression or death, from date of first study drug administration to up to 1 year after study completion|Overall response rate (CR + PR) - endpoint for phase II, proportion of patients with complete or partial response (CR + PR) according to RECIST 1.1, from randomization for the time of treatment with a maximum of 1 year|Disease control rate (CR + PR + SD), proportion of patients with complete or partial response or stable disease (CR + PR + SD) according to RECIST 1.1, from randomization for the time of treatment with a maximum of 1 year|incidence and severity of adverse events according to CTC criteria, incidence and severity of adverse events according to CTC criteria, from randomization until 30 days after the last dose of study drug|Patient reported outcomes: quality of life according to questionnaire EORTC-QLQ-C30, quality of life scores according to validated questionnaire EORTC-QLQ-C30, from randomization until 30 days after the last dose of study drug
