A Head-to-head Comparison of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI and [68Ga]Ga-TATE PET/CT in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: a Single-center, Prospective Study
Both fibroblast activation protein (FAP)-targeted imaging and somatostatin receptors (SSTR)-targeted imaging were the promising imaging modalities for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This prospective study is going to investigate to compare the diagnostic efficacy of 68Ga-FAPI and 68Ga-DOTATATE in detecting primary and metastatic NPC lesions, thereby obtaining a more accurate examination method of NPC.

Patients with newly diagnosed or previously treated NPC will be recruited in this study.

Each patient received an intravenous injection of 68Ga-DOTATATE (2-4mCi) on the first day and 68Ga-FAPI (2-4mCi) on the second day. Whole-body PET/CT scans were performed at 40-60 min after injection on the same scanner. Physiologic normal-organ uptake, lesion numbers, and lesion uptake were compared.
