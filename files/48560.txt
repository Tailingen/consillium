Neoadjuvant Therapy for Ovarian Cancer
This study is to determine the feasibility of administering neoadjuvant carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab without excessive dose modification or cycle delay in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer. This study will also investigate the rate of optimal cytoreduction, response rate and progression free and overall survival, and to assess the quality of life for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube cancer treated with neoadjuvant carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab.

DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Number of Protocol Defined Adverse Events in Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, and Bevacizumab, This is to assess the feasibility of delivering multiple cycles of the study treatment without excessive dose modification or cycle delays. The regimen would be considered unfeasible for further study if there were 5 or more of the following events within the first 15 patients, 7 or more of these events within the first 30 patients, or 8 or more of these events within the first 45 patients:

* Delay of day 1 of therapy \> 3 weeks from the expected day 1 of that cycle
* Febrile neutropenia requiring hospitalization
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia
* Grade 1-5 gastrointestinal perforation
* Grade 3-4 hemorrhagic toxicity
* Grade 3-4 arterial thromboembolic complications
* Grade 4 hypertension
* Grade 4 proteinuria
* Fascial dehiscence, Up to 30 days after completion of 9 cycles of treatment and/or early discontinuation (approximately up to 12 months)
Response Rate, The percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks or disappears after treatment. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Cycle 3, Cycle 6, Cycle 9 and 3 years post-treatment|Quality of Life (QOL) Score, The FACT Quality of Life (QOL) Score questionnaire is designed to assess the effects of cancer and its treatment on the quality of life, by measuring aspects of an individual's sense of well-being and ability to carry out various activities. When calculating the total QOL score, the score scale of functional well-being was reversed in order to keep consistent with other three domains. The lower the total score, the better the quality of life. The five-point scale ranges from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Scoring the FACT-G is performed through a simple sum of item scores. Each subscale is scored, and a total score for the FACT-G is obtained by adding each of the subscale scores. With a total possible score greater than 100, additional scoring methods have been used to simplify interpretation. Modifications of scoring include normalizing the total score on a scale of 0-100 through mathematical transformations, as well as the use of a Trial Outcome Index (TOI)., Baseline, Cycle 3, Cycle 6, Cycle 9|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The length of time during and after the treatment of cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., Up to 3 years
Initial treatment for ovarian cancer is usually surgical cytoreduction followed by adjuvant platinum and taxane chemotherapy. At the time of diagnosis over 75% of patients present with stage III or IV disease that has spread into the peritoneal cavity or distally. Despite a number of new chemotherapeutic regimens survival has improved only modestly over the preceding two decades. While overall 5-year survival has improved from 30% to 50%, 5-year survival remains only 25% for women with advanced stage disease. Given these findings it is clear that improved strategies for the delivery of cytotoxic and biologic agents are needed for women with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer.

A newer drug, called bevacizumab, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in combination with chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer, lung cancer, and some types of breast cancer that have spread to distant sites in the body. A critical question which will need to be answered is whether or not it is feasible to administer a combination of bevacizumab with standard cytotoxic therapy using a neo-adjuvant approach for patients with epithelial cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneum.
