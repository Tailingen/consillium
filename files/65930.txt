Phase I/II Study of Treg/Tcon Addback to Partially Matched Related Donor Stem Cells With Myeloablative Conditioning and Post-transplant Cyclophosphamide for High Risk Hematologic Malignancies
Open label, dose finding trial to assess the efficacy of Treg/Tcon addback to partially matched related donor stem cells. The maximum tolerated dose will be established using 3 subjects per dose level, with an expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose.
