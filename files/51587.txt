Immunogenicity and Clinical Efficacy of 20-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV20) in Lymphoma Survivors After Treatment With Anti-CD20 Therapy
To compare the effects of a pneumococcal vaccine called PCV20 when given as a single dose versus a boosted regimen to patients who previously received anti-CD20 therapy as treatment for B cell lymphoma.
Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: PCV20
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

--Compare the humoral responses in terms of difference in IgG titers at 1 month from routine single dose PCV20 or a boosted PCV20 regimen in B cell lymphoma survivors who previously received treatment with anti-CD20 therapy.

Secondary Objectives:

* Compare the humoral responses in terms of difference in IgG titers at 3, 6 and12 from routine single dose PCV20 or a boosted PCV20 regimen in B cell lymphoma survivors who previously received treatment with anti-CD20 therapy.
* Estimate the rate of pneumonia (all bacterial pneumonia including pneumococcal pneumonia) within a year from routine single dose PCV20 or a boosted PCV20 regimen in lymphoma survivors who previously received treatment with anti-CD 20 therapy.
* Correlate humoral responses to development of bacterial pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia and with severity of this infection in lymphoma survivors within a year of vaccination.
