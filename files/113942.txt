The Present Study Aims to Compare Patients Who Receive the Investigational Product (177Lu-DOTA-rosopatamab) Plus Standard of Care, in Comparison to Standard of Care Only
This multinational, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, open label Phase 3 study is designed to investigate and confirm the benefits and risks associated with the PSMA-targeted antibody, 177Lu DOTA rosopatamab administered together with Standard of Care (SoC), as compared to the best SoC alone. The phase 3 will be conducted in patients with metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) that expresses PSMA and has progressed despite prior treatment with a novel androgen axis drug (NAAD).

This multinational, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled, open label Phase 3 study is designed to investigate and confirm the benefits and risks associated with 177Lu DOTA rosopatamab administered together with SoC, as compared to the best SoC alone, in patients with PSMA-positive, metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) that has progressed despite prior treatment with a novel androgen axis drug (NAAD).

PSMA positivity will be defined by gallium-68 labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) as at least one site of metastatic disease with intensity significantly greater than normal liver (i.e., standardized uptake value \[SUV\] max at least 1.5 times SUV of normal liver.

Approximately 392 eligible adult male will be part of this study. 387 patients will be randomized to one of two groups in a 2:1 ratio to receive one of the treatments below. 5 participants in New Zealand will be enrolled into a sub-study.

* Group A: Two single intravenous (IV) injections of 76 mCi each (equivalent to a 45 mCi/m2 dose in a standard 1.7m2 individual) of 177Lu-DOTA- rosopatamab, given 14 days apart, plus best SoC
* Group B: Best SoC.

In parallel to this, 5 participants in New Zealand site, will be enrolled into a sub-study to investigate the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and dosimetry of 177Lu-DOTA-TLX591(m17). Participants will receive two doses of 177Lu-DOTA-TLX591(m17), 14 days apart.

Screening procedures will take up to 28 days prior to enrollment and randomization. Only patients with PSMA-positive metastatic PC and meeting all other inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to Group A or B OR allocated to Sub-study in New Zealand.

Participants in Group A or B will participate in the study for up to 5 years. During this period the participants will undergo imaging procedures approximately every 6-8 weeks until progression.

Participants in the sub-study will participate in the study up to 23 days. During this period participants will receive two doses of 177Lu-DOTA-TLX591(m17), 14 days apart, and undergo SPECT/CT imaging and blood collection for Pharmacokinetics at days 1,2,5,8, 13 and 15.

For all patients, the best SoC will be determined by the Principal Investigator (PI) and the medication will be provided until progression.
