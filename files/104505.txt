Nimotuzumab Concurrent With Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer Patients
Elderly or malnourished patients diagnosed with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) had poor prognosis. Radiotherpy was an important and effective treatment in treating ESCC. The present study is a one-arm trial that seeks to evaluate the efficacy in patients with unresectable ESCC. The study objectives include R0 resection rate, complete pathological response and treatment toxicity, etc.

Nimotuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against EGFR. Its efficacy and safety in patients with esophageal cancer have been confirmed by many studies.

The current prospective phase II study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination regimen comprising chemotherapy with nimotuzumab with a dose of 800mg per week and S-1 and concurrent radiotherapy for patients who are elderly or malnourished.
