The Importance of Muscle Function in Patients With Disseminated Bladder Cancer
This study investigates if reduced muscle mass and muscle function predispose to poor completion of oncological treatment in patients with bladder cancer (including cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter and urethra) and if muscle mass and muscle function change during oncological treatment in these patients. It also evaluates biomarkers for sarcopenia.
