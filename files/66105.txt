Study of the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of KPT-8602 in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Cancer Indications
This is a first-in-human, multi-center, open-label clinical study with separate dose escalation (Phase 1) and expansion (Phase 2) stages to assess preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the second generation oral XPO1 inhibitor KPT-8602 in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM), metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HRMDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and newly diagnosed intermediate/high-risk MDS.

Dose escalation and dose expansion may be included for all parts of the study as determined by ongoing study results.
