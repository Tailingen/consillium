Evaluation of the Humoral and Tumoral Molecular Alteration Profile of Brain Metastases
The purpose of the study is to determine in brain metastases and according to feasibility in liquid biopsies:

* Molecular alterations including in particular mutations, amplifications, Copy number gene variants and fusion transcripts identified by high-throughput sequencing;
* The rate of variation either in gain or in loss of expression of the different messenger Ribonucleic Acids by analysis of the transcriptome;
* Epigenetic alterations by methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid clusters by methylome chips.
Brain Metastases
PROCEDURE: biological samples (blood test and lumbar puncture)
molecular alteration profile of liquid biopsies, Compare the molecular alteration profile of liquid biopsies (blood and CSF) to that of brain metastases.

Will be determined in brain metastases and according to feasibility in liquid biopsies (blood and CSF):

* Molecular alterations including in particular mutations, amplifications, Copy number gene variants and fusion transcripts identified by high-throughput sequencing ;
* The rate of variation either in gain or in loss of expression of the different messenger Ribonucleic Acids by analysis of the transcriptome ;
* Epigenetic alterations by methylation of deoxyribonucleic acid clusters by methylome chips., 1 day
This is a single-center, prospective, interventional, exploratory study aimed at comparing the molecular alteration profile of liquid biopsies (blood and lumbar puncture) to that of brain metastases.

The population eligible for the study will consist of any patient with cerebral metastases from a solid cancer, at least one of which is accessible to surgical excision.

The study consists of comparing, between brain metastases and liquid biopsies (blood and lumbar puncture), the profiles of genomic, post-genomic and epigenetic alterations as well as the mutational load. To do this, the study only requires a lumbar puncture and a blood test.
