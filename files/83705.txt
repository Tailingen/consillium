Intracranial Injection of NK-92/5.28.z Cells in Combination With Intravenous Ezabenlimab in Patients With Recurrent HER2-positive Glioblastoma
The main objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NK-92/5.28.z and to determine the maximum tolerated dose or maximum feasible dose (MFD). Recommended phase 2 doses both for intraoperative injections only (RP2Diio) and repetitive injections (RP2Dri) will be determined. Frequent side effects and target organs of toxicity and their severity, duration and reversibility will be determined. Furthermore, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will be examined. In addition, potential signs of anti-tumor activity of NK-92/5.28.z cells will be analyzed. In the separate "CAR2BRAIN-Check" cohort, combination therapy of NK-92/5.28.z with the anti-PD-1 antibody Ezabenlimab (BI 754091) will be tested.
