BI 6727 (Volasertib) Monotherapy Phase I Trial in Japanese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This open-label phase I dose escalation trial, 1230.15, is the first trial with Volasertib in Japanese advanced cancer patients. The trial will investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of this specific polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) inhibitor in advanced cancer patients.

Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in Process for the Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)., The following drug-related adverse events (AE) were defined as DLT;

1. Haematological toxicities: CTCAE(Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade 4 neutropenia persisted for 7 or more days, CTCAE grade 4 thrombocytopenia or CTCAE grade 3 thrombocytopenia requiring blood transfusion.
2. Non-haematological toxicities: CTCAE grade ≥3 non-haematological toxicities. The following toxicity with neutropenia was defined as DLT.- CTCAE grade 3 febrile neutropenia persisted for over 2 days, Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities of CTCAE grade ≥3 persisted for over 3 days. The following laboratory abnormalities should be defined as DLT. - Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT): \>5.0 × ULN persisted for 7 days or longer - Creatinine: \>3.0 × upper limit of normal(ULN) (if the creatinine abnormality was observed even once) - Persistent electrolyte abnormality assessed by the investigator., 21 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Volasertib, Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of volasertib was the highest dose tested at which DLT was developed in not more than 1 of 6 patients in the course 1., 21 days
