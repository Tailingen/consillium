A Trial of AK112 (PD-1/VEGF Bispecific Antibody) in Patients With NSCLC
This trial is a Phase Ib/II study. All patients are stage IIIB/C or IV non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK112 in subjects with advanced NSCLC whose tumors have a programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) greater than or equal to 1%.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
