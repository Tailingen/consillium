ctDNA-Guided Sunitinib And Regorafenib Therapy for GIST
The purpose of this research is to test if mutations (changes in DNA) in exons (segment of DNA or RNA containing information that has the instructions for making proteins) in the KIT gene can be used to predict the body's response to standard of care treatment.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Sunitinib|DRUG: Regorafenib
Number of Participants Achieving Overall Response, The overall response rate (ORR) will be defined as the number of evaluable patients whose best overall response to study treatment is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). ORR will be assessed using Choi criteria by treating physician., Up to 12 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time elapsed from the start of treatment to the date of documented progression or death, whichever comes first. For surviving patients without progression who begin alternative treatment, PFS will be censored at the last date of documented progression-free status prior to starting alternative treatment. Similarly, losses to follow up will be censored at the last date of documented progression-free status., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the time elapsed from the start of treatment until death. For surviving patients, follow-up will be censored at the date of last contact., Up to 3 years|Number of Participants Achieving Clinical Benefit, The clinical benefit rate (CBR) will be defined as the number of evaluable patients whose best overall response to study treatment is complete response (CR), or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD), for 6 months or more and will be assessed using Choi criteria by treating physician., Up to 12 months|Incidence of Treatment-Related Toxicity and Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability of assigned Sunitinib and Regorafenib treatment will be reported as the incidence of treatment-related toxicity, including serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs), in study participants using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, per physician discretion., Up to 13 months
