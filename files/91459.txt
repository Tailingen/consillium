The Relationship of Defeverscence and Itraconazole Plasma Level Study in Immunocompromised Participants
The purpose of this observational study is to investigate whether a sufficient concentration of itraconazole can influence disappearance of a fever (defeverscence) when intravenous (into the vein) itraconazole is administered for resolving unknown neutropenic fever of participants who are given itraconazole oral solution as a prophylaxis under general treatment conditions.
Hematologic Neoplasms|Neutropenia|Fever
DRUG: Itraconazole
Percentage of Participants Achieving Plasma Level of Itraconazole at 1000 Nanogram Per Milliliter (ng/mL) or Higher After Administration of Study Treatment, Percentage of participants who achieved more than or equal to 1000 ng/ml level after administration of study treatment were reported. Plasma level of itraconazole was defined as the sum of itraconazole concentration (IC) and hydroxyitraconazole concentration (HIC)., Day 5
Percentage of Participants With Deferevescence After Administration of Study Treatment, Defervescence was defined as fall of the body temperature below 38.0 degree Celsius (C) at least once after starting to receive the study treatment., Day 0 up to Day 14|Mean Time to Defervescence in Participants Who Received the Study Treatment, The mean time to defervescence was reported in participants who received the study treatment. Defervescence was defined as fall of the body temperature below 38.0 degree C at least once after starting to receive the study treatment., Day 0 up to Day 14|Duration of Neutropenia, The duration of neutropenia was reported. Neutropenia was defined as neutrophil count less than or equal to (\<=) 500 cells per cubic millimeter (cells/mm\^3), or neutrophil count \<=1000 cells/mm\^3 and anticipated to decrease to \<=500 cells/mm\^3 within several days., Day 0 up to Day 14|Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC), The mean values for ANC based on blood tests performed on Day 0 (before starting the study treatment) constitute a Baseline measure for ANC., Baseline (Day 0)|Percentage of Participants With Defervescence by Plasma Level of Itraconazole, Defervescence was defined as fall of the body temperature below 38.0 degree C at least once after starting to receive the study treatment. Plasma level of itraconazole was defined as the sum of IC and HIC., Day 5|Plasma Concentration of Itraconazole by Overall Success Rate (OSR) in Participants Who Received the Study Treatment, Plasma level of itraconazole was defined as the sum of IC and HIC. The OSR was defined based on satisfaction of the following criteria: (1) participants if treated for baseline fungal infection, there was either eradication (removal of fungus in culture), or presumed eradication; no evidence in culture but appeared to be treated clinically, (2) absence of breakthrough fungal infection during the treatment and for 7 days after completing the treatment, (3) survival for 7 days after completing the treatment, (4) absence of early withdrawal due to adverse events or lack of efficacy, and (5) defervescence. The presence and absence of OS was reported., Day 5|Percentage of Participants With Baseline Fungal Infection, Blood cultures (a laboratory test on a sample of blood) were assessed to identify fungus. Percentage of participants with presence or absence of fungus before starting the study drug were calculated., Baseline (Day 0)|Plasma Concentration of Itraconazole by Breakthrough Fungal Infection, Plasma level of itraconazole was defined as the sum of IC and HIC. A breakthrough fungal infection was defined as any fungal infection that was diagnosed more than (\>) 3 days on or during therapy or within 7 days after completion of therapy. Blood cultures were assessed to identify fungus., Day 5
This is a prospective (study following patients forward in time), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (conducted in more than one center) observational study to examine the correlation between a sufficient blood concentration of itraconazole and disappearance of a fever (defeverscence) when itraconazole injection is administered for resolving unknown neutropenic fever of participants who are given itraconazole oral solution as a prophylaxis under general treatment conditions. The recommended dose of the drug will be 200 milligram (mg), which will be administered intravenously, twice daily for 2 days (a total of 4 doses) and then 200 mg once daily for 12 days. After the administration for a total of 14 days, itraconazole oral solution 200 mg (which is equivalent to 20 ml) twice daily will be continued for a total of 14 days until clinically significant neutropenia is resolved.
