Initial Attack on Latent Metastasis Using TAS-102 for ct DNA Identified Colorectal Cancer Patients After Curative Resection
This trial is a randomized, double-blind, multinational Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preemptive treatment with FTD/TPI compared with administration of placebo as follow-up, which is the standard of care, in patients who underwent curative resection of colorectal cancer and then tested positive for ctDNA.
Colorectal Neoplasms|Trifluridine and Tipiracil|Circulating Tumor DNA
DRUG: trifluridine and tipiracil|DRUG: Placebo
Disease-free survival 1 (DFS1), The time from the date of enrollment to any of the following events, whichever occurs first: a relapse, development of a secondary colorectal cancer lesion other than a relapse and death from any cause., Up to 3 years
Rate of Conversion to Negative ctDNA, This rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who became negative for ctDNA at the test immediately after completion of study treatment., Up to 2 years|Disease-free survival 2 (DFS2), The time from the date of enrollment to any of the following events, whichever occurs first: a relapse, development of a cancer lesion other than a relapse (secondary cancer), and death from any cause. In surviving subjects who have not been judged to have a relapse, the last date of survival with confirmation of no relapse be treated as the end of this period., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival (OS), The time from the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause. In surviving subjects, the last date of confirmation of survival will be treated as the end of this period. In subjects lost to follow-up, the last date of confirmation of survival before loss to follow-up will be treated as the end of this period., Up to 3 years|Incidence of Adverse Events, For each of the AEs due to the following study treatment, the frequency of cases with the worst grade in all courses according to CTCAE v5.0 will be calculated using all treated patients as the denominator., Up to 3 years|Treatment Completion Rate, This rate will be calculated for each eligible subject in accordance with the following equation. Treatment completion rate (%) = number of treatment courses completed/6 Ã— 100, Up to 3 years
