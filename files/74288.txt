Neoadjuvant Trial of Capecitabine for Axillary Lymph Node Positive Operable Breast Cancer
This randomized phase II trial compared pathologic response rates (pCR) of early breast cancer following neoadjuvant fluorouracil-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide(FEC) and capecitabine-epirubicin-cyclophosphamide (XEC).
Stage II Breast Cancer|Stage III Breast Cancer
DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: capecitabine|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Epirubicin
pathologic response rates (pCR), The absence of invasive tumor in the final surgical breast sample (stage yT0 or ypTis), The breast sample will be evaluaed on the day of surgery during the cycle 4, an expected average of 12 weeks.
DFS(Disease free survial), Time from randmization to breast-cancer recurrence, or a second primay cancer(ecluding contralateral ducal carcinoma in situ), or death from any cause, whichever comes first, Participants will be evaluated on Day 1 of each cycle during chemotherapy, and Day 1 every 3 months after completion of chemotherapy. The expected average of 5 years.|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Adverse events are classified accoding NCI CTC criteria., Hematologic, renal, and hepatic funcion will be assessed after each cycle and at the end of therapy, an expected average of 3 weeks.
