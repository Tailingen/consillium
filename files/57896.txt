Toxicity Genetic Determinants and Response to Azacitidine and Venetoclax in AML
The purpose of this research is to see how certain genetic variations relate to side effects and outcomes experienced while receiving treatment with azacitidine and venetoclax.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
OTHER: Biospecimen samples
Toxicity side effect, Defined as a binary variable indicating whether a participant experienced a Grade 3 or higher of specific side effects (including infections, anemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, nausea, diarrhea), From initiation of venetoclax through 30 days after last dose
Dose Modification, A binary variable indicating whether a participant experienced a dose modification, including delay or reduction, Approximately 6 months or until last dose of Venetoclax, whichever came first|Disease Response, For participants diagnosed with AML, response will be defined as a binary variable indicating if they had a Complete Remission (CR), Complete Remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), Complete Remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), Morphologic Leukemia-free state (MLFS), or partial response (PR) to induction therapy using the European LeukemiaNet (ELN 2022) criteria. Otherwise they will be considered a non-responder, Up to 3 years|Venetoclax levels, Will be defined as the maximum concentration of Venetoclax and is measured at 6 months if the participant is still receiving venetoclax, Approx 6 months|Overall survival, Duration of time from date of enrollment to death. Participants who are alive or lost to follow-up at the time of the analysis will be censored at the last known date they were alive, Approx 3 years|Dose modification due to nausea or diarrhea, A binary variable indicating whether a participant experienced a dose modification, including delay or reduction due to nausea or diarrhea, Approximately 6 months or until last dose of Venetoclax, whichever came first|Metabolizer status checklist, A categorical variable indicating whether a participant is a high, normal or low metabolizer based on pharmacogenomics analysis of SNP data, Approximately 6 months or until last dose of Venetoclax, whichever came first
This is a prospective pilot study of the association of SNPs and venetoclax levels with toxicity and response to azacitidine plus venetoclax (Aza/Ven) as well as pharmacogenomics and venetoclax levels in patients with newly diagnosed AML determined to be unfit for intensive induction. Newly diagnosed AML patients over 18 years old who receive Aza/Ven as standard of care will be eligible for this study. Buccal swabs for SNPs and pharmacogenomic analysis will be collected at baseline. Venetoclax peak and trough levels will be obtained during SOC Aza/Ven treatments. Participants will be recruited initially at AHWFBCCC locations.
