Microvascular Invasion for Guiding Treatment of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage B Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The goal of this observational study is to explore the role of prediction of microvascular invasion by radiomics based on pre-treatment magnetic resonance imaging for guiding treatment of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B hepatocellular carcinoma.
Radiomics|Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)|Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization (TACE)|Microvascular Invasion (MVI)|Multi-kinase Inhibitors (MKI)
DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the interval from the date of enrollment to the date of death due to any cause or last follow-up., From the date of enrollment to the date of death due to any cause or last follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the interval from the date of enrollment to the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause or last follow-up, whichever occurred first., From the date of enrollment to the date of disease progression or the date of death due to any cause or last follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months
Tumor response, Assessed by enhanced CT or MR at baseline, every 6 weeks after treatment initiation, using RECIST 1.1 The assessment of tumor response was performed independently by two experienced radiologists who were blinded to the patient's clinical information, and any inconsistent assessment results were resolved by further consensus., From the date of enrollment to the date of death due to any cause or last follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months|Adverse events, The severity of adverse events will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0) ., From the date of enrollment to the date of death due to any cause or last follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months
