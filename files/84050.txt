Anti-mesothelin CAR T Cells for Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Malignant Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label, one center, dose escalation clinical study, to determine the safety and efficacy of infusion of autologous T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptor targeting mesothelin in adult patients with mesothelin positive, recurrent or metastatic malignant tumors.
Mesothelin Positive Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: anti-mesothelin CAR T cells
safety of infusion of autologous anti-mesothelin CAR T cells as assessed by the incidents of treatment related adverse events per NCI CTCAE V4.0, incidents of treatment related adverse events per NCI CTCAE V4.0, 2 years
treatment response rate of anti-mesothelin CAR T cells, Defined as the overall response rate (ORR), the proportion of patients who achieved complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) based on the response evaluation criteria in solid tumor version 1.1 (RECIST1.1)., 4 weeks|progression free survival, 6 months|overall survival, 2 years|proliferation of anti-mesothelin CAR T cells in patients, measured by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry, 6 months|activation of anti-mesothelin CAR T cells in patients, measured by blood cytokine levels after CAR T cell infusion, 6 months|persistence of anti-mesothelin CAR T cells in patients, measured by quantitative PCR and flow cytometry, 1 year
