CBM588 Reduces Colorectal Polyp Recurrence
The goal of this randomized crossover clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 (CBM588) in reducing colorectal adenomatous polyp recurrence in adult patients with a history of colorectal polyps.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does CBM588 reduce the recurrence of colorectal adenomatous polyps?
* Does CBM588 lead to a sustained decrease in polyp burden over time? Researchers will compare a group receiving CBM588 in the first year to a group receiving CBM588 in the second year (after a washout period) to determine whether CBM588 effectively lowers polyp recurrence rates and adenoma prevalence.
Colorectal Polyp
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588
Colorectal polyp recurrence rate (%), The percentage of participants with at least one recurrent colorectal polyp detected during follow-up colonoscopy. Recurrence is defined as the presence of new polyps (adenomatous or non-adenomatous) identified on annual surveillance colonoscopy., 1 year and 2.25 years after baseline colonoscopy
Adenomatous polyp recurrence rate (%), The percentage of participants with at least one recurrent adenomatous polyp detected during follow-up colonoscopy., 1 year and 2.25 years after baseline colonoscopy|Mean number of recurrent polyps, The average number of polyps detected per participant during follow-up colonoscopy., 1 year and 2.25 years after baseline colonoscopy|Polyp location distribution, The proportion of recurrent polyps found in different segments of the colon (right colon, left colon, rectum)., 1 year and 2.25 years after baseline colonoscopy
This randomized crossover clinical trial evaluates the effect of Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 (CBM588), a butyrate-producing probiotic, on colorectal adenomatous polyp recurrence. Participants who had undergone complete polypectomy were randomly assigned into two groups:

* Group A: Received CBM588 for one year, followed by a washout period and no treatment in the second year.
* Group B: Did not receive CBM588 in the first year but received it in the second year after a washout period.

Annual colonoscopy assessments were conducted to evaluate polyp count, type, and location. The primary outcome measure is adenoma recurrence. This study was conducted at a tertiary medical center and received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval (KMUHIRB-F(I)-20170010). All participants provided informed consent.
