Efficacy Study of CYT997 in Combination With Carboplatin in Glioblastoma
This study seeks to (i) determine the safe dose of CYT997 when given in combination with carboplatin in patients with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (glioma) and (ii) to determine whether the combination of CYT997 with carboplatin is a useful treatment for glioma.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: CYT997|DRUG: Carboplatin
Safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CYT997 when given in combination with standard carboplatin therapy (Phase Ib component), Ongoing throughout therapy up until 30 days after last dose of CYT997|Progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) utilising the dose of CYT997 identified in the Phase Ib component of this study (Phase II component), 6 months after initiation of therapy
Objective response rate (ORR), Response is measured every second cycle of therapy|Overall survival, Baseline to study completion|Safety and tolerability, Measured continuously from study commencement through to 30 days after last dose of CYT997|Effects on pharmacodynamic markers of vascular disruption and tumour apoptosis, Measured during first cycle of therapy|Pharmacokinetic analysis of carboplatin and CYT997 in combination, Assessed during first cycle of therapy
