Cemiplimab in High-risk or Locally Advanced Luminal and Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study that will enroll 36 subjects, who have pathologically proven diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, clinical stage tumor 1-3 (cT1-T3), node 0-3 (cN0-N3), metastasis 0 (cM0), hormone receptor positive (HR+) (estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) and/or progesterone-receptor-positive (PR+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative or hormone receptor-negative (HR-) (estrogen-receptor-negative (ER-) and progesterone-receptor-negative (PR-) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative/triple-negative breast cancer.
Invasive Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cemiplimab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin (not mandatory)|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Number of subjects with pathological complete response., This is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy., 27 weeks from start of treatment
Hypothesis: The addition of cemiplimab (PD-1 inhibitor) to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced HR+ HER2 negative or triple-negative (TN) breast cancer having positive PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 tumor expression will be associated with an increase in pathologic complete response of at least 20%.

Primary Objectives:

Assess pathologic responses in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and cemiplimab.
