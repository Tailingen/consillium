This study includes 2 parts: Phase 1 (dose escalation) and Phase 2 (dose expansion). In Phase 1, participants will enroll using 3+3 dose escalation design. The starting dose of nemtabrutinib in oral tablet form was 5mg/day continuously. Dose escalation will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and dosing schedule is reached based on protocol-defined dose limiting toxicity (DLT). After the determination of the RP2D, 9 expansion cohorts will be initiated to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of nemtabrutinib at RP2D in participants with specifically defined disease.
