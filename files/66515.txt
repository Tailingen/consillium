Radiation Therapy, Arsenic Trioxide, and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Glioma
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Arsenic trioxide and temozolomide may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving radiation therapy together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of arsenic trioxide when given together with temozolomide and radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma.

DRUG: arsenic trioxide|DRUG: temozolomide|PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy|RADIATION: intensity-modulated radiation therapy|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Maximum tolerated dose of arsenic trioxide|Dose-limiting toxicities as measured by CTCAE version 3.0
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of arsenic trioxide when administered sequentially with temozolomide during radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
* Determine the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of arsenic trioxide.

Patients undergo radiotherapy (may be intensity-modulated) on days 1-5. Patients also receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-5, and oral temozolomide on days 1-7. Treatment with radiotherapy, arsenic trioxide, and temozolomide repeats every week for up to 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients may then receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
