Lapatinib With Temozolomide and Regional Radiation Therapy for Patients With Newly-Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effects of a combination of a study drug, Lapatinib, plus the administration of standard radiation therapy and an FDA approved drug Temozolomide (chemotherapy agent) in patients with newly diagnozed glioblastoma Multiforme.Currently, only radiation therapy and Temozolomide chemotherapy are standard treatment for brain cancer.Lapatinib has not been FDA approved for use in brain tumors treatment. It has been approved to be used as a daily treatment with other chemotherapies by the FDA for the treatment of advanced breast cancer.

The purpose of this study is to find the answers to the following research questions:

1. Is Lapatinib given twice a week at higher dosages, with radiation therapy and Temozolomide, safe when given to patients with brain tumor?
2. What are the side effects of Lapatinib given twice a week at higher dosages when given with radiation therapy and Temozolomide and how often do they occur?
3. Can Lapatinib, radiation, and Temozolomide be effective in shrinking tumors when given to patients with brain tumors?
4. To determine whether the presence of genetic alterations specific proteins in the tumor samples can predict whether this study drug is effective on the tumor.
Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
OTHER: Lapatinib/Temozolomide/radiation
Overall survival, The primary objective is to estimate the overall survival in subjects with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma treated with lapatinib/temozolomide/radiation followed by lapatinib/temozolomide for 2 years or until progression is detected. If no progression is seen at 2 years, then single-agent lapatinib will be continued until progression., 2 years
