Influence of Anesthesia Methods on CTCs in TURBT Patients
Multiple lines of evidence have shown that anesthesia method is associated with long-term outcomes in patients undergoing surgery due to cancers, including lung, breast, prostate, and bladder cancer, etc. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been validated as prognostic biomarkers of a number of cancers. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of anesthesia methods on the number of CTCs in patients receiving transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). The difference of anesthesia method is achieved by using general anesthesia in one group and spinal anesthesia in the other group.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: General Anesthesia|PROCEDURE: Spinal Anesthesia
the number of Circulating Tumor Cells, The number of circulating tumor cells will be measured by collecting 5 ml of venous blood sample., on the Day 7~10 after surgery
Surgeon Satisfaction, The surgeon satisfaction will be measured with the Likert scale, which ranges from 0 to 50, with a higher score indicating higher satisfaction., immediately after surgery|Patient Satisfaction, The patient satisfaction will be measured with the Modified Bauer Scale, which ranges from 0 to 50, with a higher score indicating higher satisfaction., within 24 hours after surgery|Visual Analogue Scale, Pain intensity will be assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale, which ranges from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating greater pain intensity at 24 hours after surgery., at 24 hours after surgery|Nausea Score, Nausea score will be assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale, which ranges from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating greater nausea ou score at 24 hours after surgery., at 24 hours after surgery|Hospitalization Days, The length of hospital stay will be recorded., up to 30 days
