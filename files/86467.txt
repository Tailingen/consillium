Dendritic Cell Vaccine Study (DC/PC3) for Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and activity of DC/PC3, a dendritic cell vaccine used as immunotherapy for prostate cancer. The vaccine is made with each participants' own immune cells obtained through blood donation. Dendritic cells are known to activate other immune cells such as T cells, that are able to mount an attack against cancer cells. The dendritic cell vaccine will be administered as injections every 2 weeks over a course of 2 months.

BIOLOGICAL: autologous dendritic cell vaccine (DC/PC3)
Toxicity, adverse events, through week 29
Immunogenicity, The Tritiated thymidine proliferation assay is used to assess samples collected pre-treatment and those collected post-treatment; the outcome measure is the change in counts per minute (post-treatment counts minus pre-treatment counts)., pre and post treatment|Clinical Response, Post treatment
