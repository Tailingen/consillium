Sorafenib Plus Hepatic Arterial Infusion Versus Sorafenib for HCC with Major Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis
According to the Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging treatment guideline, sorafenib is recommended for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) with Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis (PVTT), but HCC with major PVTT (in the main trunk or 1st-order branches of the portal vein) did not benefit much from sorafenib in previous studies. There is no established standard treatment for HCC patients with major PVTT, the investigators conducted a randomized, phase 2 study to investigate the survival benefit of sorafenib plus Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with Oxaliplatin and Fluorouracil versus sorafenib for Hepatocellular Carcinoma with Major Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis.
