Trial Targeting Gut Bacterial Androgen Production to Reverse Therapeutic Resistance to Abiraterone in Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer
To determine if dexamethasone or dexamethasone plus metronidazole restore sensitivity to abiraterone for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer (Adenocarcinoma)|Metastatic Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Metronidazole
Number of participants with PSA30 response, Number of participants with castration resistant prostate cancer who have a ≥ 30% decline in PSA from baseline until 24 weeks., 24 weeks
Number of participants with PSA50 response, Number of participants with castration resistant prostate cancer who have a ≥ 50% decline in PSA from baseline until 12 weeks., 12 weeks|PSA Progression Free Survival, Number of participants with PSA progression according to PCWG3 (25% rise in PSA from nadir and increase of at least 2ng/mL), 12 weeks|Number of participants with progression, progression is defined as:

* Progression of soft tissue lesions according to RECIST 1.1 Criteria.
* Progression of bone lesions detected with bone scan according to PCWG3 criteria.

To test whether giving dexamethasone with or without metronidazole in combination with abiraterone could help reverse resistance to abiraterone for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Abiraterone and prednisone (AA/P) is a second-line therapy for mCRPC given when first-line androgen deprivation therapy fails. However, resistance to AA/P can develop. The investigators do not know exactly how cancer becomes resistant, but there is evidence that suggests it could be due to androgen production by the bacteria in your gut (gut microbiome). This study is focused on the gut microbiome as a source of androgen production that could cause AA/P resistance in mCRPC.
