Novel Lung Functional Imaging for Personalized Radiotherapy
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of personalized radiotherapy with four-dimensional (4D) computed tomography (CT)-based pulmonary ventilation imaging, which selectively avoids irradiating highly-functional lung regions.
Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Ventilation image-guided radiotherapy
Grade ≥3 AEs Defined as Definitely, Probably, or Possibly Related to 4D CT Ventilation Image-guided Personalized Radiotherapy, Number of subjects experiencing Grade ≥3 AEs, i.e., Grade ≥3 radiation pneumonitis, grade ≥3 esophagitis, or other grade ≥3 AEs, defined as definitely, probably, or possibly related to 4D CT ventilation image-guided personalized radiotherapy., 12 months
Radiation Pneumonitis Graded by CTCAE v4.0, Number of participants with Grade ≥ 2 radiation pneumonitis adverse event graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0., 2 years|Post-treatment Change in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1), The median absolute change from baseline in FEV1 (% predicted) at 6 months after treatment., Baseline and 6 months|Post-treatment Change in Diffusing Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO), The median absolute change from baseline in DLCO (% predicted) at 6 months after treatment., Baseline and 6 months
In this clinical trial, the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of 4D CT ventilation image-guided personalized radiotherapy. The investigators will deliver personalized radiotherapy treatments that selectively avoid irradiating highly-functional lung regions for lung cancer patients, and follow up patients to assess the safety and feasibility. The primary hypothesis to be tested is: 4D CT ventilation image-guided personalized radiotherapy can be delivered safely for lung cancer.
