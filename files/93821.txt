Clinical Trial to Assess the Importance of Nephrectomy
The study compare the standard treatment with nephrectomy + sunitinib to treatment with sunitinib alone without nephrectomy. This study will be the first trial on this competitive context
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Nephrectomy|OTHER: Sunitinib alone
The primary endpoint is overall survival., starting at 4 months
Objective Response (complete or partial) is evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, Starting at 4 months|Clinical benefit (complete response, partial or stable for at least 12 weeks)., Starting at 4 months|Progression-Free Survival, Starting at 4 months|Non-compliance to Sunitinib treatment is evaluated in arm A (nephrectomy + sunitinib) as the percentage of patients not starting sunitinib treatment within 6 weeks after nephrectomy, Starting at 4 months|Non-compliance to sunitinib treatment is evaluated in arm B (sunitinib alone) as the percentage of patients needing nephrectomy, Starting at 4 months|Post operative morbidity is evaluated as the percentage of deaths within 30 days following nephrectomy, Starting at 4 months
The 2 previous studies on the impact of nephrectomy (EORTC, SWOG) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma have justified recommendation to initial nephrectomy for patients presenting with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. But these studies were performed at the time of immunotherapy.

The objective is Evaluation of the importance of nephrectomy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with sunitinib (AA) Arm A : Nephrectomy followed by Sunitinib Arm B : Sunitinib alone Sunitinib will be administrated orally daily for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week rest( schedule 4/2), 6 weeks are considered as a cycle The starting dose will be 50 mg daily with provision for dose reduction based on tolerability Patient will be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurrence or withdraw.
