Observational Copenhagen Pancreatic Cancer Study
The primary objective of the Copenhagen Pancreatic Cancer (COPAN) study is to describe the real-world population of patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). Larger sample of longitudinal real-world data provides a unique opportunity for comprehensive exploration of the diagnostic and treatment journey for individuals diagnosed with PC and allows to investigate treatment outcomes and associated prognostic factors. Furthermore, the study aims to identify determinants of treatment management and treatment outcomes, including patient-reported outcomes.

Overall survival, 3 years
The study objective is to describe the real-world population of patients with pancreatic cancer by collecting longitudinal data that facilitates a more rigorous understanding of the PC. This research project will catalog different elements of a patient's diagnostic and treatment journey and identify unmet needs of patients with PC.

The study aims to:

1. To compile detailed demographic information of patients with PC.
2. To document and analyze the clinical and disease characteristics at the time of diagnosis and beyond.
3. To track various treatment modalities employed, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.
4. To assess short-term and long-term outcomes, including survival rates, complications, and quality of life.
5. To identify prognostic and predictive factors within the real-world cohort.

8. To investigate the impact of PC and treatment on patients' quality of life.

4 Study Design This study of patients with PC will employ both a prospective, observational design and retrospective design to capture real-world data relating to health status and/or the delivery of health care routinely collected from a variety of sources. Data will be collected longitudinally, allowing for a dynamic analysis of the disease trajectory.
