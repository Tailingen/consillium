Carbon Black Tattoo in Colon Cancer
The study is designed to elucidate whether carbon black suspension endoscopic tattoo enhances visibility of lymph nodes or tumor tissue on dissection of colonic surgical specimen, thereby making improvement in staging defined as better pTNM stage via better visualisation of carbon marked metastatic or sentinel lymph nodes or marked primary tumor or adjacent tissues.
Endoscopic Tattoo of Suspected Colon Cancer
DEVICE: carbon black suspension colonic tattoo injection
Number of tumors visualised from peritoneal cavity/number of tattoos visualised form peritoneal cavity, Distance in cm from tumor wich far carbon injection marked mucosa and adjacent tissues Number of inflammatory cells per field of view in injection site vs. non-injected mucosa Number of dissected total/normal/metastatic/carbon colored lymph nodes, 1 year
Other objectives are:

* to assess intraoperative visibility of carbon black tattoo in the tumor region and surrounding tissues
* to assess microscopic distribution of carbon ink in the layers of the colonic wall and adjacent tissues
* to assess complications related to carbon black tattoo procedure like microscopic fibrosis, micro- or macroscopic scarring, inflammatory reactions
* to assess long-term effects of ink injections on control endoscopies at 6 and 12 months
* to assess dissection time in tattooed-non tattooed lymphatic tissues
