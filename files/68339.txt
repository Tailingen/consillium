Search for a Link Between Response to Treatment and Circulating Leucocytes in High Grade Glioma Patients
Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is an antiangiogenic treatment currently proposed to recurrent high grade glioma patients. Unfortunately some patients fail to respond to this treatment and finding biological factors allowing the discrimination between potential responders and non responders would be very helpful. As the immune system plays a key role in angiogenesis induction and maintenance in cancer, it could serve as a surrogate marker of angiogenesis in cancer patients.

The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of bevacizumab treatment on circulating immune cells in high grade glioma patients and to search for a link between the variation of these cells and the response to treatment.
Glioblastoma|Glioma
DRUG: Bevacizumab standard of care
blood cells populations, Analysis of blood cells populations variation during treatment with bevacizumab. Last sampling planned before the 7th cycle of bevacizumab., up to 4 months
Cells variation and RMI response, Relationship between variation of blood cells and RMI response after 6 weeks of treatment, 6 weeks|Survival, Link between variation of analyzed cellular population and survival., Patients will be followed up from the date of randomization up to their death, assessed up to 100 months
The following leucocyte subsets will be analyzed in whole blood before treatment and before cycles 3, 5 and 7:

* Classical, intermediate, nonclassical and Tie2 expressing monocytes.
* Regulatory T cells (Treg).
* Myeloid Derived Suppressor cells (MDSCs) The variation of the absolute numbers (or relative percentages) of the cells in the blood of patients will be correlated to the response to treatment assessed according to the RANO criteria.
