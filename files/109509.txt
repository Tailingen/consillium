Role of Low Inferior Mesenteric Artery Ligation During Laparoscopic Surgery for Rectosigmoid Cancer
During sigmoid or rectal cancer surgery, dissection of lymphnodes at the origin of inferior mesenteric artery is mandatory. Nevertheless, ligation of the origin of IMA should compromise blood supply to left colon and affect anastomosis. The aim of this retrospective evaluation is to compare high and low IMA ligation with preservation of LCA, with or without skeletonization of the origin of IMA in laparoscopic colorectal resection.
