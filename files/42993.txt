A Phase I/II Study of Golidocitinib Combined with Pomalidomide in R/R PTCL
This is a phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Golidocitinib combined with Pomalidomide for relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (R/R PTCL)
DRUG: Golicitinib combined with Pomadomide
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) in Phase I, Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities during the first cycle of treatment and determination of the maximum tolerated dose of pomalidomide in combination with golidocitinib., Up to approximately 1 month|Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Phase II, The proportion of patients achieving either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per the 2014 Lugano criteria., Up to approximately 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR) after 4 cycles (Lugano 2014), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Up to approximately 2 years|Complete Response Rate (CRR) after 4 cycles (Lugano 2014), CRR is calculated as the percentage of the sum of the number of patients in complete remission (CR) and complete remission without confirmation (CRu) to the total number of patients in the full analysis set., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of confirmed response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of investigational products until documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first dose of investigational products until death due to any cause., Up to approximately 2 years|Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), The incidence and severity of AEs are assessed to evaluate the safety profile of golidocitinib combined with pomalidomide., Up to approximately 2 years
This clinical trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of Golidocitinib combined with Pomalidomide in treating relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (R/R PTCL). The study is a prospective, open-label, phase I/II clinical trial initiated by investigators. It plans to enroll approximately 26-33 patients who have not previously received Golidocitinib or Pomalidomide. The primary endpoint for phase I is to assess the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of Pomalidomide in combination with Golidocitinib, estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D). For phase II, the primary endpoint is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of the combination therapy. Secondary endpoints include duration of response (DOR), complete response rate (CR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to response (TTR), and safety indicators. The study will provide valuable data on the potential benefits and risks of this novel combination therapy for R/R PTCL patients.
