An Open-label Study Comparing Lutetium (177Lu) Vipivotide Tetraxetan Versus Observation in PSMA Positive OMPC.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan (AAA617) in participants with oligometastatic prostate cancer (OMPC) progressing after definitive therapy to their primary tumor. The data generated from this study will provide evidence for the treatment of AAA617 in early-stage prostate cancer patients to control recurrent tumor from progressing to fatal metastatic disease while preserving quality of life by delaying treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

It is a combination of the FACT- General + the Prostate Cancer Subscale (PCS). The FACTGeneral (FACT-G) is a 27 item Quality of Life (QoL) measure that provides a total score as well as subscale scores: Physical (0-28), Functional (0-28), Social (0-28), and Emotional Well-being (0-24). The total score range is between 1-108, higher scores indicates better for total score and subscale scores. PCS is a 12-item prostate cancer subscale that asks about symptoms and problems specific to prostate cancer (Range 0-48, higher scores better). The FACT-P total score is the sum of all 5 subscale scores of the FACT-P questionnaire and ranges from 0-156. Higher scores indicate higher degree of functioning and better quality of life., From date of randomization up till 42 day safety Follow-up, assessed up to approximately 74 months|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Radionuclide Therapy (FACT-RNT) Questionnaire, The FACT-RNT (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Radionuclide Therapy) is a Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) new measure developed using FACIT specific questions (items), selected from FACIT item bank, to assess treatment-related symptoms of special interest associated with radioligand therapies.

The FACT-RNT contains items assessing dry mouth, dry eyes, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite, fatigue, impact of fatigue, bone pain, and isolation due to illness or treatment. FACT-RNT score range 0 to 60, with higher score indicating better quality of life., From date of randomization up till 42 day safety Follow-up, assessed up to approximately 74 months|Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) Questionnaire, The BPI-SF is a publicly available instrument to assess the pain and includes severity and interference scores. BPI-SF is an 11-item selfreport questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions of a participant. Pain severity score is a mean value for BPI-SF questions 3, 4, 5 and 6 (questions inquiring about the extent of pain, where the extent is ranked from 0 \[no pain\] to 10 \[pain as bad as you can imagine\]).

All participants will be assessed for eligibility and will undergo baseline disease assessments including a mandatory gallium (68Ga) gozetotide (also known as \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11) or piflufolastat (18F) ( also known as\[18F\]DCFPyL) PET/CT scan and conventional imaging (i.e., CT/MRI and bone scans).

Piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT scan will be performed in countries where it is approved.

Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) will be administered to all metastatic Prostate Cancer (PC) lesions after randomization and before the start of treatment with AAA617 or observation.

* The duration of SBRT procedures is approximately 3 weeks.
* For participants randomized to the investigational arm (AAA617), the treatment duration will be up to 4 cycles of AAA617. For participants randomized to the control arm (observation) the treatment duration will end at the last fraction of SBRT administration.
* The visit frequency will be every week 1 and 3 of each of the 4 cycles and every 16 weeks thereafter (for both arms) until first event of disease progression (RECIST 1.1)
* The study duration is approximately 6.5 years.
