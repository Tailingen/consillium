Phase 1 Study of CEP-37250/KHK2804 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a two-part, Phase 1 open label, multi-center, dose escalation study of CEP-37250/KHK2804 as monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors who no longer respond to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available.
Solid Tumour|Adenocarcinoma of the Colorectal|Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
DRUG: CEP-37250/KHK2804
Adverse Event collection and assessment will be done for all 74 potentially treated subjects., The safety of CEP-37250/KHK2804 will be determined by reported adverse events (AEs), changes in the physical examinations, vital laboratory evaluations, and treatment discontinuations due to toxicity., at least 30 days or up to 12 weeks
To assess PK parameters which include: area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), peak plasma concentration (Cmax), t 1/2 and CL of CEP-37250/KHK2804., Participating subjects will have serial blood samples taken to determine the PK profile of study drug., at least 30 days or up to 12 weeks|To screen for the development of antibodies against CEP-37250/KHK2804 (immunogenicity), Subjects will have serial blood samples to check for the developments of anti-CEP-37250/KHK2804 antibodies., at least 30 days or up to 12 weeks|To evaluate preliminary efficacy (overall response (Objective response rate(ORR; Complete Response(CR)+Partial Response(PR) and clinical benefit rate(CR+PR+stable disease(SD))., Tumor measurements and disease response assessments will be performed on all participating subjects., up to 30 days or up to 12 weeks
The study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, a standard 3+3 designed dose escalation phase, subjects will receive CEP-37250/KHK2804, administered iv, once every week. A treatment cycle will consists of total of four doses per cycle. Part 2 of the study will enroll subjects with either colon cancer or pancreatic cancer to receive CEP-37250/KHK2804 at a dose to be determined following completion of Part 1.

All subjects will receive study therapy until disease progression, the development of unacceptable toxicity, noncompliance or withdrawal of consent by the subject, or Investigator decision, up to a maximum of six cycles (approximately six months). After six cycles of CEP-37250/KHK2804 therapy, the subject may continue to receive CEP-37250/KHK2804 after discussion with the Sponsor and determination that the subject is experiencing a best response of at least stable disease (SD) and is not experiencing any unacceptable toxicities or dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).
