A Prospective, Randomized, Open, Phase II Clinical Study of Chidamide in Combination with Camrelizumab and Apatinib for Advanced Esophageal Cancer
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination treatment of chidamide, camrelizumab, and apatinib in patients with advanced esophageal cancer. This open-label, phase II clinical trial will involve randomly assigning participants to receive either the combination of these drugs or a standard treatment. The primary endpoints is ORR and the second endpoints include progression-free survival and overall survival, while safety will also be assessed.
