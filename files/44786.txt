PET Study of PIPE-791 in Healthy Volunteers and Volunteers With PrMS and IPF
This is a study of PIPE-791, an investigational study drug to treat progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The purpose of this study is to find out how much of the study drug gets into the brain and lung, and what the side effects and blood levels of the study drug are in healthy volunteers and patients.

Participants will:

* Take a single dose of the study drug
* Give many samples of blood and urine
* Have multiple PET scans
