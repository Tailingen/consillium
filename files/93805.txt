In Vitro Organoid Drug Sensitivity-Guided Treatment for Metastatic Pancreatic and Gastric Cancer
The goal of this study is to evaluate the consistency between in vitro tumor organoid drug sensitivity and the therapeutic efficacy of in vivo drug treatment.

Participants are required to provide one of fresh tumor tissues (including ascites, pleural effusion, biopsy tissues, palliative surgery specimens, etc.) for the purpose of culturing tumor organoids.

PROCEDURE: Biopsy of tumor tissue for organoid culture
PFS (Progressive free survival), The time from initiation of treatment to the occurrence of disease progression or death., 6 months
DCR (Disease control rate), The percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention., 6 months
