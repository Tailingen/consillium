Camrelizumab Plus Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy vs Camrelizumab Alone For Oligometastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
We intend to compare the efficacy and safety of immunotherapy plus stereotactic body radiotherapy at oligometastatic lesions and immunotherapy alone among patients with oligometastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma whose primary lesion has been well controlled after radical local-regional treatment through this multicenter randomized phase 3 trial.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: camrelizumab|RADIATION: stereotactic body radiotherapy
Median progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death of any cause or the first progress at any site, censored on the last date of tumor evaluation if no progress has happened., 2 years
Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate is the rate of patients achieving complete response or partial response for a certain period of time after intervention., 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate is the rate of patients achieving complete response, partial response or stable disease for at least 4 weeks after intervention., 2 years|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), Clinical benefit rate is the rate of patients achieving complete response, partial response or stable disease for at least 6 months after intervention., 2 years|Median overall survival (OS), Overall survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of death of any cause, censored on the last date of known survival if no death has happened., 2 years|Adverse events, NCI-CTC5.0 and RTOG standards are adopted, and acute subjective toxicity, acute objective toxicity and late subjective toxicity are included., 2 year|Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 (V3.0), Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 (V3.0) before treatment, during treatment, after treatment., 2 years|Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck (The QLQ-H&N35), Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck (The QLQ-H\&N35) before treatment, during treatment, after treatment., 2 years.
We intend to apply camrelizumab plus stereotactic body radiotherapy at oligometastatic lesions to patients with oligometastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma whose primary lesion has been well controlled after radical treatment through this multicenter randomized phase 3 trial to investigate whether stereotactic body radiotherapy at oligometastatic lesions on the basis of immunotherapy can achieve clinical cure among a part of patients with distant metastasis and improve their overall survival.
