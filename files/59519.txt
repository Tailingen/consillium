Spontaneous Regression in Metastatic Melanoma and Renal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to collect blood and clinical data from patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cell cancer who have experienced spontaneous regression for studies of immune response and other factors that may influence these occurrences.
Melanoma; Renal Cell Carcinoma
OTHER: Blood collection for laboratory studies|OTHER: Data collection from medical record
Number of blood samples collected, samples collected from metastatic melanoma and renal cell cancer patients, 1 year
Spontaneous regression in patients with metastatic cancer is an incredibly rare event. It has been described after infection in cancer patients and also rarely in patients with renal cell cancer (usually after resection of the renal primary) and, less commonly, in patients with metastatic melanoma.

Primary Objective To collect peripheral blood from patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cell cancer and spontaneous regression for studies of immune response and other studies.

Secondary Objective To collect clinical data from subjects registered to this study. Clinical data collection will include demographics and cancer characteristics, history and treatment.
