Colorectal Cancer Screening Validation Study
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the gene expression patterns from colorectal mucosal cells collected through the use of a standard anoscope and cytology brush. Patients will include those scheduled for routine colonoscopy procedures and those with confirmed colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer Screening
- To select a threshold for Mahalanobis distance to determine the best operating characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) in subjects with cancer and subjects without cancer. - To explore other empirical metrics based on previous exploratory data, Mai 2009
- To obtain data to estimate sensitivity, specificity, and the ROC curve for a test based on M-distance. - To determine the variability of sensitivity and specificity estimates, Mai 2009
