A Study to Evaluate ERAS-801 in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma (THUNDERBBOLT-1)
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of ERAS-801 in study participants with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
* To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Dose (RD) of ERAS-801.
* To evaluate the antitumor activity of ERAS-801.
* To evaluate the PK profile of ERAS-801.

DRUG: ERAS-801
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Based on adverse events observed during dose escalation, Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Based on adverse events observed during dose escalation, Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Recommended Dose (RD), Based on adverse events observed during dose escalation, Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Adverse Events, Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent AEs and serious AEs, Assessed up to 24 months from time of first dose
Plasma concentration (Cmax), Maximum plasma or serum concentration of ERAS-801, Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Time to achieve Cmax (Tmax), Time to achieve maximum plasma or serum concentration of ERAS-801, Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Area under the curve, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve of ERAS-801, Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Half-life, Half-life of ERAS-801, Study Day 1 up to Day 29|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Based on assessment of radiographic imaging per modified RANO response assessment, Assessed up to 24 months from time of first dose|Duration of Response (DOR), Based on assessment of radiographic imaging per modified RANO response assessment, Assessed up to 24 months from time of first dose|Time to Response (TTR), Based on assessment of radiographic imaging per modified RANO response assessment, Assessed up to 24 months from time of first dose
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter clinical study evaluating ERAS-801 as a monotherapy. The study will initially commence with dose escalation of ERAS-801 in study participants with recurrent GBM. Once the MTD and/or RD has been determined from dose escalation, then dose expansion of ERAS-801 may commence in study participants with recurrent GBM harboring alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
