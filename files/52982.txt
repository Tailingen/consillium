A Study of Obinutuzumab Evaluating Efficacy, Safety and Cost of Disease Management in Participants With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Comorbidities
This multicenter, single arm, non-interventional, observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of obinutuzumab in daily clinical practice in participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The study will also assess cost of disease management. The total length of the study is 42 months.
