Study of Chemoradiotherapy With or Without Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) For The Treatment of Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer (MK-3475-A18/KEYNOTE-A18/ENGOT-cx11/GOG-3047)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy compared to placebo plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy in participants with locally advanced cervical cancer.

The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy is superior to placebo plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy with respect to progression-free survival and overall survival.

Once the study objectives have been met or the study has ended, participants will be discontinued from this study and will be enrolled in an extension study to continue protocol-defined assessments and treatment.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by the Investigator, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, or by histopathologic confirmation of suspected disease progression, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. Unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered PD., Up to approximately 38 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 46 months
