Laser and Microdermabrasion Before Photodynamic Therapy for Actinic Keratoses in Field-cancerized Skin
Comparison of treatment efficacy and safety of pretreatment with ablative fractional laser versus microdermabrasion combined with large-area photodynamic therapy with methyl aminolevulinate for actinic keratoses
Actinic Keratosis|Sun Damaged Skin|Solar Keratosis|Solar Skin Damage
DEVICE: Ablative Fractional Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Laser|DEVICE: Microdermabrasion
Complete Clearance (%) of Actinic Keratoses (AKs), Percentage clearance of baseline actinic keratoses (AKs), determined by the ratio of AK lesions that are clinically resolved 12-15 weeks after treatment compared to the AK number at baseline., 12-15 weeks post-treatment
New Actinic Keratoses (AKs), Number of new actinic keratoses (AKs) identified clinically 12-15 weeks after treatment and that were not present at the baseline evaluation., 12-15 weeks post-treatment|Severity of Local Skin Reactions (LSRs), Local skin reactions scale (min:0; better and max: 3; worse) used to grade each of the following parameters: erythema, edema, crusting, pustules, ulceration and scabbing, scaling.

The severity of each evaluated clinically on a 4-point scale where 0 = none, 1= mild, 2= moderate and 3= severe.

With 7 parameters the sum of all scores will produce a maximum composite score of 21., Day 3-6 post treatment|Degree of Sun Damage, Sun damage is evaluated clinically on a 4 point scale where 0 = none, 1= mild, 2= moderate and 3= severe sun damage., 12-15 weeks post-treatment|Treatment-related Pain, Patient-reported pain during treatments is evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) where 0= no pain and 10= worst imaginable pain., during treatment (day 0)|Treatment-related Side Effects, Side effects are evaluated over the course 12-15 weeks following treatment. In addition to unforeseen adverse events, specific side effects including the clinical presence of infection, scarring, hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation are recorded., up to 12-15 weeks post-treatment|Investigator-reported Cosmesis (Clinical Evaluation), Cosmetic appearance of treated areas is evaluated by investigators clinically (scores on a scale) using a 4-point scale where 0 = none, 1= acceptable, 2= good and 3= excellent outcome., 12-15 weeks post-treatment|Patient-reported Cosmesis, Cosmetic appearance is evaluated by patients at the end of the study (scores on a scale) using a 4 point scale where 0 = none, 1= acceptable, 2= good and 3= excellent, 12-15 weeks post-treatment|Patient Pretreatment Preference, Patients were asked to report which pretreatment they preferred: Laser, microdermabrasion, or no preference, 12-15 weeks post-treatment
For each study participant, two test areas (A and B) are demarcated in the same anatomical region, with each area containing no less than 5 actinic keratoses (AKs). Test areas are randomized to receive skin pretreatment of EITHER ablative fractional laser OR microdermabrasion prior to photodynamic therapy using methyl aminolevulinate.

Efficacy, local skin reactions and safety of both test areas are evaluated over a 12-15 week follow up period.
