A Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Chi-BEAM With BEAM Regimen Combined With ASCT for the Treatment of ND PTCL
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare Chi-BEAM With BEAM Regimen Combined With ASCT for the Treatment of ND PTCL.

The main question it aims to answer are:

•Whether Chi-BEAM improves patient survival compared to BEAM group Participants will be given BEAM or Chi-BEAM before ASCT. Researchers will compare the efficacy and safety of the two groups.
Newly Diagnosed Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: C-BEAM Regimen|DRUG: BEAM Regimen
2-y PFS, 2-year PFS, 2 years
2-year OS, 2 years|CR rate at 3 months post-transplant evalutation, 2 years|hematopoietic reconstitution time, 2 years|Non-recurrent mortality, 2 years
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled, open trial. The primary endpoint was 2-year PFS The secondary endpoint was： 2-year overall survival (OS). CR rate at 3 months post-transplant evaluation Hematopoietic reconstitution time Non-recurrent mortality (NRM)
