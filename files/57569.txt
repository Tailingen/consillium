A Study Evaluating APG-115 as a Single Agent or in Combination With APG-2575 in Subjects With R/R T-PLL and NHL
The goal of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and efficacy of APG-115 as a single agent or in combination with APG-2575 in patients with T-PLL and NHL.
T-Prolymphocytic Leukemia|Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma
DRUG: APG-115|DRUG: APG-2575
Maximum tolerated dose of APG-115, To evaluate the safety of APG-115 as a single agent, 21 days|Maximum tolerated dose of APG-115+APG-2575, To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose of APG-115 and APG-2575 in combination, 21 days
This is a phase IIa, open-label, multi-center, clinical trial of interfering the binding of MDM2 oncoprotein with the tumor suppressor P53 protein, leads to increased P53 and P21 protein expression and activates P53-mediated apoptosis. The hypothesis is that APG-115 monotherapy and in combination with APG-2575 will shows good safety and efficacy in patients with R/R T-PLL and NHL
