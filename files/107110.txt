Study SC-101 in Subjects With Advanced Malignancies
This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and anti-cancer efficacy of SC-101 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

This study is the first-in-human (FIH), multi-center, open-label trial of SC-101, including the dose escalation and expansion phases.

The dose escalation study is primarily designed to assess the safety and tolerability of SC-101 and to determine the recommended dose(s) for the dose expansion study. The dose expansion study is designed with the primary objective of evaluating the clinical activity of SC-101 in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma or other solid tumors that express Nectin-4.
