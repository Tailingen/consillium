Breast Cancer Survivorship Biorepository
This study collects blood samples as well as clinical and self-report data from stage I-III breast cancer survivors to create a biorepository for future use. The creation of this biorepository will allow for future research into links between individual, molecular, and genomic signatures and cancer outcomes.

Biorepository, Number of biological samples collected and stored (blood), 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To create an annotated biorepository with prospectively collected blood samples from breast cancer survivors.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To collect comprehensive data on social determinants of health (e.g., race/ethnicity, acculturation, socioeconomic status, and access to care), environmental exposures (based on zip codes/geocoding), lifestyle (e.g., diet, tobacco use), clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment history, follow-up and current disease status, survivorship-related issues.

II. To establish an efficient process for researchers to utilize the biorepository for breast cancer and survivorship-related studies.

OUTLINE:

Patients complete surveys, undergo collection of blood samples, and review of medical records on study.
