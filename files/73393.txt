Single Dose Intravesical Apaziquone Postoperative in Patients Undergoing TURBT for Noninvasive Bladder Cancer (SPI-612)
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 2-Year Recurrence Rate of bladder cancer in randomized patients with tumor histology Ta, G1-G2 who received TransUrethral Resection of Bladder Tumor (TURBT) plus apaziquone versus those who received TURBT plus placebo.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Apaziquone|DRUG: Placebo|PROCEDURE: TURBT
Recurrence Rate at 2 Years, The percentage of participants with histologically confirmed recurrence of the bladder tumor at any time after randomization and on or before year 2., 2 years
Time to Recurrence, The number of months from randomization to histologically confirmed recurrence of the patient's bladder tumor., 2 years|Progression Rate at 2 Years, The percentage of participants that progress to either a higher stage or grade from the histologically confirmed stage and grade at time of randomization., 2 years|Time to Progression, The number of months from randomization to progression to either a higher stage or grade of the patient's bladder tumor., 2 years|Number of Recurrences Per Patient, The number of histologically confirmed recurrences during the course of the study., 2 years|Disease-Free Interval, The number of months from randomization to histologically confirmed progression of the patient's bladder tumor or death from any cause, 2 years|Disease-Free Survival, The number of months from randomization to histologically confirmed recurrence of the patient's bladder tumor or death from any cause, 2 years|Overall Survival, The number of months from randomization to death from any cause., 2 years
This was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Within 14 days of Screening, eligible patients underwent a TURBT during Visit 1 (Day 0) following which they were immediately randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or 4 mg apaziquone, instilled in a volume of 40 mL into the bladder within 6 hours from the end of the TURBT procedure. After a 60-minute retention period, study drug was drained from the bladder.

A postoperative follow-up examination and review of the local pathology report were performed at Visit 2, which occurred 21 days (Â±10 days) after the TURBT (Week 3).

* If the histology of the patient's tumor was confirmed as Ta, G1-G2 (ie, low grade according to World Health Organization \[WHO\]/International Society of Urologic Pathology \[ISUP\] classification), no further treatment was given and the patient was observed cystoscopically every 3 months through Year 2 for tumor recurrence (Visit 3 through Visit 10).
* If the histology of the patient's tumor was other than Ta, G1 or G2 (low grade \[WHO/ISUP classification\]), further treatment was given in accordance with current treatment guidelines, and the patient was followed up cystoscopically every 3 months through Year 2 for tumor recurrence (Visit 3 through Visit 10).

All patients were to be followed for 2 years.
