Almonertinib as First-line Treatment in Patients With EGFR Mutations Positive in Advanced NSCLC With Brain Metastases
This is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, single-arm clinical trial
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Almonertinib
PFS, The PFS time is defined as time from enrollment to locoregional or systemic recurrence, second malignancy or death due to any cause; censored observations will be the last date of : "death", "last tumor assessment", "last follow up date" or "last date in drug log", 26 months
iPFS, iPFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first recording of the progress of intracranial disease or death from any cause., 26 months|iORR, The proportion of subjects whose intracranial lesions achieve Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) by the best response from the first dose of almonertinib to the end of study, 26 months|iDoR, Number of days from the date that measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first subsequent date that progressive intracranial disease or death is documented., 26 months|iDCR, Intracranial disease control rate (iDCR) defined as the percentage of participants with Intracranial Disease Control best overall response (complete response, partial response or stable disease)., 26 months|ORR, The proportion of subjects who achieve Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) by the best response from the first dose of almonertinib to the end of study., 26 months|OS, OS was defined as time from date of enrollment to date of death due to any cause. For participants still alive at the time of analysis, OS time was censored on last date that participants were known to be alive., Start of study drug to Survival Endpoint through study completion, an average of 4 years|DoR, Number of days from the date that measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first subsequent date that progressive disease or death is documented., 26 months|DCR, Disease Control Rate (DCR) defined as the percentage of participants with Disease Control best overall response (complete response, partial response or stable disease)., 26 months|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To evaluate the security of high-dose almonertinib treatment in patients with EGFR mutations positive in advanced NSCLC with brain metastases, 26 months
Explore gene mapping before and after the treatment., Collect blood/cerebrospinal fluid before and after treatment to explore gene mapping before and after the treatment by next generation sequencing., 26 months
This is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, single-arm clinical trial aimed at patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with asymptomatic brain metastases with epidermal growth factor receptor sensitive mutations (EGFRm+) who have not received any systemic treatment To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of high-dose almonertinib mesylate.Eligible patients were included in the high-dose almonertinib treatment group and received oral almonertinib 165 mg once a day.
