Non-Inferiority Study on MRNA-lncRNA Model in Low-Risk Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Patients
To compare the efficacy and safety of different adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for low-risk triple-negative breast cancer patients predicted by mRNA-lncRNA model
Triple-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Epirubicin, cyclophosphamide plus paclitaxel
invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), Invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) is the time after initial cancer treatment during which a patient remains free from invasive cancer recurrence. It's an important measure in clinical trials to assess how well treatments prevent the return of cancer or the development of new invasive cancers after the primary treatment has been completed., Five years
Distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS), Distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS): This refers to the length of time after primary cancer treatment during which a patient does not experience cancer recurrence in distant organs or sites. DRFS is commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in preventing metastasis or the spread of cancer to distant parts of the body., Five years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS): OS is the time from the start of treatment or diagnosis until death from any cause. It is the most direct and important endpoint in clinical trials, measuring the effectiveness of a treatment in extending a patient's life., Five years|Safety according to CTCAE v5.0 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0), Safety according to CTCAE v5.0: This refers to the assessment of adverse events or side effects of treatment based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. It provides a standardized way to evaluate and report the severity and frequency of treatment-related toxicities to ensure patient safety., Five years
