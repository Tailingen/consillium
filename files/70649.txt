A Trial of Camrelizumab Combined With Famitinib Malate in Treatment Naïve Subjects With PD-L1-Positive Recurrent or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy, and safety of camrelizumab combined with famitinib malate vs. pembrolizumab in treatment naïve subjects with programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1)-positive recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
