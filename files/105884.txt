Compare the Efficacy of Cinacalcet vs Traditional Vitamin D for Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) Among Subjects Undergoing Hemodialysis
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of treatment with cinacalcet to manage plasma parathyroid levels as to compared traditional vitamin D therapy, whether given orally or intravenously, among hemodialysis subjects with secondary hyperparathyroidism when the doses are adjusted appropriately to maintain serum calcium and phosphorous levels with currently recommended ranges.
Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary
DRUG: Traditional Vitamin D Therapy|DRUG: Cinacalcet
Percent Change From Baseline in Mean PTH During Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), Mean PTH during EAP is defined as the mean of values at study weeks 40, 44, 48 and 52, Baseline to week 40-52
Treatment Comparison of >=30% Reduction From Baseline in Mean PTH During the Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), Number of participants achieving a \>=30% Reduction From Baseline in Mean PTH During Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), Baseline to week 40-52|Treatment Comparison of Plasma PTH < 300 pg/mL During Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), Number of participants achieving Plasma PTH \< 300 pg/mL During Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), week 40-52
