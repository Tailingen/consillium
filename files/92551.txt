Phase â…¡ Study of HAIC of FOLFOX vs. Sorafenib in HCC Refractory to TACE
To evaluate safety and efficacy of combined hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) of oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin and sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) refractory to transarterial chemoembolization(TACE)
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: HAIC of FOLFOX|DRUG: Sorafenib
Progression-free survival, The period from the date of the start of HAIC or sorafenib until the date of the confirmation of tumor progression or death, 12 months
Overall survival, The period from the date of the start of HAIC or sorafenib until the date of the confirmation of tumor progression or death, 12 months|Adverse Events, Postoperative adverse events were graded based on CTCAE v4.03, 30 Days after HAIC and TACE|Objective response rate, Best response based on mRECIST, 12 months
In most current guidelines, sorafenib is considered as the second-line treatment for patients with transarterial chemoembolization(TACE) failure or refractoriness.However,the median overall survival of those treated with sorafenib monotherapy was 16.4 to 24.7 months.

Whether combining sorafenib with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy(HAIC) of oxaliplatin,5-fluorouracil and leucovorin is safe, well tolerated, and efficacious remains unknown, with no prospective clinical data currently available.The investigators therefore conducted a prospective and randomized phase II trial to compare the safety and efficacy of HAIC with sorafenib in patients refractory to TACE
