Cardiac Rehabilitation for Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy for Thoracic Cancers
Other than optimizing medical management of cardiac risk factors, and reducing radiotherapy (RT) dose to the heart, there currently exist no interventions to mitigate or reverse the adverse cardiac effects of RT. Aerobic exercise has been demonstrated to improve patient quality of life, cardiac outcomes, and cardiorespiratory fitness in patients with cancer receiving cardiotoxic systemic therapies, but the effects of aerobic exercise on patients at high risk for radiation induced heart disease (RIHD) is unknown. In addition, home-based cardiac rehabilitation has not been tested in patients with thoracic cancers.

PROCEDURE: Home-based cardiac rehabilitation
Feasibility of completing home-based CR after definitive radiation therapy in patients with thoracic cancer who have started the CR program, Feasibility of completion is defined as 75% of patients who start their first session of cardiac rehabilitation participating in at least 75% of prescribed home-based CR exercise sessions., Through completion of cardiac rehabilitation for all patients enrolled (estimated to be 36 months)
Feasibility of home-based cardiac rehabiliation in all enrolled patients after definitive radiation therapy in patients with thoracic cancer., Feasibility is defined as 75% of all enrolled patients of cardiac rehabilitation participating in at least 75% of prescribed home-based CR sessions., Through completion of cardiac rehabilitation for all patients enrolled (estimated to be 36 months)
