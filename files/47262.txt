A Study of AC682 In Chinese Patients With ER+/HER2- Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This clinical trial is evaluating AC682 in participants with estrogen receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (ER+/HER2-) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The main goals of this study are to:

1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of AC682
2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic of AC682
3. To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of AC682
