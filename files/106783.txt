Assessment of the Safety and Tolerability of ex Vivo Next-generation Neoantigen-selected Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) Therapy in Advanced Epithelial Tumors and Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) Resistant Solid Tumors
Background:

The presence of T-lymphocytes in resected tumor samples derived from long-term survival patients and the fact that reinvigoration of their functionality through the administration of specific immune-therapies can lead to remarkable antitumor responses supports that lymphocytes play a critical role in cancer immunity.

Adoptive cell therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes product (TIL-ACT) is a well-established combination therapy currently under study in several world reference centers, using an autologous cell product without genetic modifications. This cell product consists of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), which are collected from the patient and expanded in the lab under specific conditions to enhance its antitumoral efficacy before reinfusion in the same patient. However, this cell product alone does not achieve adequate efficacy, and a combination of both previous non-myeloablative lymphodepleting (NMA-LD) chemotherapy and subsequent cytokine therapy (specifically IL-2) is needed to support the expansion of the infused cells.

The investigators hypothesize that TILs enriched for neoantigen recognition are superior to unselected TILs at mediating tumor regression in patients with epithelial tumors and even other solid tumors where immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is approved and used as part of standard therapy. The investigators propose to manufacture a T-cell product composed of TILs that are selected based on their ability to recognize patient-specific neoantigens and to use these to treat patients with metastatic, refractory, epithelial cancers, as well as ICB-resistant solid tumors. Furthermore, it also proposed to study the tumor and T cells at baseline and after treatment to investigate whether specific phenotypic and functional traits may be associated with clinical outcome.

Primary objective:

To evaluate the safety and the tolerability of ex vivo next generation neoantigen-selected Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) in patients with metastatic or unresectable epithelial tumors and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) resistant solid tumors.

Secondary objectives:

* To determine the success in producing active specific TILs from our target patients.
* To evaluate the initial clinical activity of the NEXTGEN-TIL products in our target patients.

Methods:

This study is a first-in-human, open-label, non-controlled, single-centre, phase I trial to assess the safety and tolerability of NEXTGEN-TIL-ACT. Given the exploratory nature of the study, there is no formal hypothesis testing and no formal sample size calculation was carried out.

A sample size of 10 patients has been selected to provide information about the frequency of treatment-limiting toxicity (TLT).

Study treatment:

The main study therapy is the Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocyte (NEXTGEN-TIL) product, which is preceded by a preparative non-myeloablative lymphodepleting (NMA-DL) regimen and followed by IL-2 infusion.

NEXTGEN-TIL product is a cellular investigational product comprising a live cell suspension of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes derived from the patient's own tumor.
