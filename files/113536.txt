Long-term Follow-up Study for Patients Treated With CLBR001 CAR-T
This study is designed as a long-term follow-up study of participants who have receive genetically modified autologous CLBR001 CAR-T cells

Patients will be enrolled following either the completion or early termination/discontinuation from Study NCT04450069 or any protocol in which patients were administered CLBR001. Patients will begin the long-term follow-up period regardless of whether they responded to treatment or progressed on treatment. Patients will be followed for up to 15 years post CLBR001 infusion and will continue to be monitored for safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy.
