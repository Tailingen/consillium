Study of MGY825 in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Study of MGY825 single agent in adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: MGY825
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Assessment of safety of study drug as a single agent, 28 months|Frequency of dose interruptions and reductions, Assessment of tolerability of study drug as a single agent, 28 months|Dose intensity, Dose intensity is defined as the ratio of actual cumulative dose received and actual duration of exposure., 28 months|Incidence and nature of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 28 days of treatment with the study drug, A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade â‰¥3 assessed as not primarily related to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness or concomitant medications that occurs during the first 28 days of treatment with the study drug. Other clinically significant toxicities may be considered to be DLTs, even if not CTCAE grade 3 or higher., 28 days
Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters will be determined by non-compartmental methods using the PK profile of the study drug., 20 months|Peak concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters will be determined by non-compartmental methods using the PK profile of the study drug., 20 months|Time to reach maximum drug concentrations in systemic circulation (Tmax), Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters will be determined by non-compartmental methods using the PK profile of the study drug., 20 months|Overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, Evaluation of preliminary anti-tumor activity of study drug as single agent, 28 months|Progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, Evaluation of preliminary anti-tumor activity of study drug as single agent, 28 months|Duration of response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1, Evaluation of preliminary anti-tumor activity of study drug as single agent, 28 months
First in human, phase I, multicenter, open-label study of MGY825 single agent with a dose escalation and a dose expansion in adult patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The dose escalation part will investigate the safety and tolerability of MGY825 in adult patients with advanced NSCLC harboring NFE2L2, or KEAP1 or CUL3 (NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3) mutations. Patient enrollment will be based on locally available test results of mutation status.

An exploratory assessment on the effect of food may be investigated during the dose escalation part.

The dose expansion part will assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity and further assess the safety and tolerability of MGY825 in adult patients with advanced NSCLC divided in two patient groups.

Group 1: Patients with advanced NSCLC harboring NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3 mutations enrolled based on locally available test results of mutation status.

Group 2: Patients with advanced NSCLC irrespective of prior knowledge of NFE2L2/KEAP1/CUL3 mutational status.
