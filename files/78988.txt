This study aims to propose a perioperative comprehensive intervention based on health behavior model to improve cardiopulmonary function and quality of life among lung cancer patients following:

1. understanding multi-dimensional factors affecting cardiopulmonary function and quality of life
2. development of multidisciplinary comprehensive intervention
3. evaluation the effects of comprehensive intervention using cluster design
