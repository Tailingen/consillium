A Study of BGB-24714 as Monotherapy and With Combination Therapies in Participants With Solid Tumors
This study aims to understand how safe and well-tolerated a drug called BGB-24714 is when used alone, or in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, for people with advanced or spreading solid tumors. The main objective is to identify the highest tolerable dose or the highest administered dose of BGB-24714. Additionally, the study aims to identify the most suitable doses for further investigation in larger groups of participants.
