Endometrial Cell Collection With the PadKit
All patients will be provided with a Preprogen Pad to be worn for 4-6 hours to collect cells shed by the endometrium. After the kit is returned to the Preprogen laboratory, a brief survey will be completed. Analysis will be conducted to determine if the PadKit™ can collect a sample of endometrial cells sufficient to differentiate between normal and atypical hyperplasia/malignant cells in blinded samples provided to the laboratory for analysis.
Neoplasms
DEVICE: PadKit™ from Preprogen
Observation of the presence of endometrial cells captured by the pad., Direct observation of the absence or presence of endometrial cells on the pad by the pathologist, Within 7 days after receipt of the pad from patients|Association of the presence/absence of cells and morphology, Analysis for the presence of abnormal histology and morphological classification as normal, hyperplastic, or malignant., Within 7 days after receipt of the pad from patients
Patient preferences - Comfort, To determine patient preferences for using the interlabial PadKit™ vs current standard of care diagnostic tools including transvaginal ultrasound, endometrial biopsy, CT scan, and/or Dilation \& Curettage (D\&C).

Patient preferences regarding comfort of wearing the pad are captured using a 1-3 Likert scale with 1 being not comfortable and 3 being comfortable., Within the same day and after wearing the pad for 4-6 hours|Patient preferences - Simplicity of using the pad, To determine patient preferences for using the interlabial PadKit™ vs current standard of care diagnostic tools including transvaginal ultrasound, endometrial biopsy, CT scan, and/or Dilation \& Curettage (D\&C).

Patient preferences regarding simplicity of using the pad are captured using a 4 Likert scale with 1 being not easy and 4 being very easy., Within the same day and after wearing the pad for 4-6 hours
