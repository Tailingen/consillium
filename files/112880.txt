Clinical Study of GPA33-specific PET/CT for the Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer
In this study, we will first investigate the imaging safety and feasibility of \[68Ga\]Ga-NOTA-WWH347 and \[18F\]F-H3RESCA-WWH347 PET/CT in patients with primary and/or metastatic colorectal cancers. The second goal of the study is to preliminarily investigate the diagnostic efficacy (e.g., sensitivity and specificity) of \[68Ga\]Ga-NOTA-WWH347 and \[18F\]F-H3RESCA-WWH347 PET/CT in patients with primary and/or metastatic colorectal cancers. This study will provide a new method for the noninvasive target-specific diagnosis of colorectal cancer, and provide an intuitive and clear imaging basis for clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment.
