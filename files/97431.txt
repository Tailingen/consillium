A Pilot Dose Escalation Trial of a Densified Chemotherapy Association of Docetaxel and Epirubicin Driven by Mathematical Modeling in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients: The MODEL1 Study
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of a densified regimen of the association of docetaxel (DTX) and epirubicin (EPI), supported by the concomitant administration of hematopoietic growth factors in patients with metastatic breast cancer in first-line, optimizing in each patient the administration schedule using a formal procedure based on mathematical models in order to manage the severity of induced neutropenia.

The models used in this project allow:

* an optimal administration schedule of the planned total dose per cycle (number of infusions and calculating their rates and durations)
* an individualization of the administration schedule from the second cycle (based on observations from the first cycle), and
* an assessment of the risk of a dose-limiting toxicity event combining several severe non-hematological toxicities (conditioning the decision for dose escalation).

Using formal mathematical models the investigators expect controlling the hematological and non-hematological toxicities in order to realize the full series of six cycles of densified DTX+EPI chemotherapy (2 weeks per cycle) for each patient. For each patient, chemotherapy is considered feasible if it is possible, in the absence of tumor progression, to consider 6 cycles of treatment without observing any serious adverse events and without:

* patient death that may be related to the treatments;
* decision of the patient to interrupt treatment for physical or psychological tolerance reasons;
* decision of the investigator to discontinue treatment, in the absence of disease progression.
