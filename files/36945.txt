Exercise and Nutrition Intervention in Ovarian Cancer
The objective of this multicenter randomized controlled trial is to compare a 6-month exercise and nutrition intervention (intervention group, IG) aimed at maintaining or improving physical functioning and quality of life with usual care (control group, CG) in ovarian cancer patients.

The main question it aims to answer is:

• Can an exercise and nutrition program improve physical performance during and after active treatment for ovarian cancer?

Participants of the IG will undergo:

* Weeks 1-18: approximately 15-30 minutes of daily exercise (cardio, resistance, and balance exercises); nutritional counseling focusing on malnutrition (protein-energy malnutrition).
* Weeks 19-25: More intense daily training; nutritional counseling focusing on the Mediterranean diet.

The study design includes 3 survey time points:

* Baseline: After surgery and before starting chemotherapy
* T1: After chemotherapy (week 19)
* T2: After intervention (week 26)

The primary outcome is:

• 6-minute walk test, 6 months after enrollment (T2)

In electrophysiological terms, resistance (per unit volume) correlates negatively with the amount of body fluid (body water and fat-free mass (FFM)) through which the current flows, while reactance correlates positively with the mass of body cells. The magnitude of Xc in relation to R is expressed as the phase angle (PA). From the measured R and Xc values and other subject data, additional indicators of body composition (e.g., total body water, fat-free mass, and fat mass) can be estimated using specific prediction equations based on modeling assumptions that are generally population-, age-, sex-, fat-, and disease-specific., Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|Grip force dynamometer, Hand gripping force (kg), Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|Polyneuropathy; item derived from EORTC CIPN20 (Item 9), Problems standing or walking, because can't longer feel the ground under feet, Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Depression screening, Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|Generalized Anxiety Disorder using GAD-2, Anxiety, Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|Adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MEDAS), Adherence to a Mediterranean diet is assessed using the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS)., Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|EORTC QLQ-C30, Quality of life (multidimensional) across 10 subscales, Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|EORTC OV-28, Quality of life (multidimensional) focusing on ovarian cancer across 7 subscales, Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|EORT FA-12, Quality of life (multidimensional) focusing on fatigue, Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS 2002), Malnutrition risk, Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|Brief Social Support Scale (BS6), Social support (tangible support, emotional-informational support), Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))|Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13), Patient Activation Measure, Baseline, T1: After chemotherapy (week 19), T2: (6 months after enrollment) to baseline which is after intervention (week 26))
