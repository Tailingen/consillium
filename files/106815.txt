A Trial of Adalimumab Combined to Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy in Patients With Anaplastic Thyroid Cancers
The hypothesis is that the particular richness of ATC's microenvironment in TAMs creates a unique opportunity for using Tumor Necrosis Factor blockade during chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to counteract tumor resistance to therapy.
