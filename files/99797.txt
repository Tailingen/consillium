OptiMATe: De-escalated Induction Treatment in Primary CNS Lymphoma
This phase III study investigates if a de-escalated induction treatment in newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma is superior to the standard MATRix protocol in terms of event free survival.
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
DRUG: Experimental Treatment: one course Rituximab/HD-Methotrexate, two courses of MATRix|DRUG: Control intervention: four courses of MATRix
Event-free survival (EFS), time from randomization to premature end of treatment due to any reason, lymphoma progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to 24 months after end of treatment
Overall survival (OS), time from randomization to death of any course, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Progression free survival (PFS), time from randomization until disease progression, relapse or death from any cause, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Remission rate prior to consolidation therapy, Remission prior to consolidation therapy will be determined at RA II and will be divided in CR, uCR, PR, CD, PD according to IPCG criteria, assesed at RA II (Arm B: day 18-20 of cycle 2, each cycle is 21 days. Arm A: day 18-20 of cycle 4, each cycle is 21 days)|Remission rate after consolidation therapy, Remission after consolidation therapy will be determined on day 30 after ASCT and will be divided in CR, uCR, PR, SD, PD according to IPCG criteria, 30 days after ASCT|rate of patients reaching consolidation therapy, defined as obtaining at least the first dose of consolidation therapy, will be determined after the response assessment II (following 4 cycles of MATRix in the control arm and following 1 cycle of R/HD-MTX and 2 cycles of MATRix in the experimental arm), determined up to 4 weeks after response assessment II|Quality of life (QOL), EORTC QLQ-C30,, EORTC (European Organization for research and cancer treatment) QLQ-C30, measured during screening, at response assessment II, and with beginning of RA III every 12 months until end of follow-up, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Quality of life (QOL), QLQ-BN20, EORTC (European Organization for research and cancer treatment) QLQ-BN20; measured during screening, at response assessment II, and with beginning of RA III every 12 months until end of follow-up, up to 24 months after end of treatment
Comparison of de-escalated regimen to standard induction therapy regarding safety, incidence of (Serious) adverse events, laboratory parameters:WBC \<2.500/µl and platelets \<80.000/μl , vital signs: blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (bpm), up to 60 days after ASCT|Comparison of de-escalated regimen to standard induction therapy regarding neurotoxicity, MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assesment) performed at screening, EOT and every 12 months until end of follow-up, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Comparison of de-escalated regimen to standard induction therapy regarding neurotoxicity, WAIS III (Wechsler Adult Intelligence scale) counting test performed at screening, EOT and every 12 months until end of follow-up, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Comparison of de-escalated regimen to standard induction therapy regarding neurotoxicity, WAIS III (Wechsler Adult Intelligence scale) subtest similarities and verbal fluency test performed at screening, EOT and every 12 months until end of follow-up, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Comparison of de-escalated regimen to standard induction therapy regarding neurotoxicity, Trail Making Test A and B, performed at screening, EOT and every 12 months until end of follow-up, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Comparison of de-escalated regimen to standard induction therapy regarding neurotoxicity, Brief Test of Attention performed at screening, EOT and every 12 months until end of follow-up, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Comparison of de-escalated regimen to standard induction therapy regarding neurotoxicity, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test performed at screening, EOT and every 12 months until end of follow-up, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Comparison of de-escalated regimen to standard induction therapy regarding neurotoxicity, Grooved Pegboard Test, performed at screening, EOT and every 12 months until end of follow-up, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Comparison of de-escalated regimen to standard induction therapy regarding neurotoxicity, Rey-Osterrieth-Complex-Figure-Test performed at screening, EOT and every 12 months until end of follow-up, up to 24 months after end of treatment|Unplanned hospital admissions, Defined as in-patient hospitalization from randomization until 6 months after EOT visit (excluding those for study therapy and/or assessments, placement of an indwelling catheter, social/convenience admissions, respite care, elective or pre-planned treatment/surgery), up to 6 months after EOT visit|Length of hospital stays, Measured as number of nights in hospital from randomization and until 6 months after EOT. Hospitalization must be in relation to the disease or the administered treatment or due to toxicity, up to 6 months after EOT visit
This phase III study investigates if a de-escalated induction treatment in newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma is superior to the standard MATRix protocol in terms of event free survival. Two arms are compared, in the experimental treatment group, participants receive one course of R/HD-MTX, followed by two courses of MATRix and autologous stem cell transplantation. In the control treatment, participants receive four coourses of MATRix followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.
