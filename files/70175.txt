A Study of Carboplatin + Paclitaxel and MK0683 in Patients With Chemotherapy-naive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)(0683-066)
The clinical study will evaluate safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of MK0683 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in chemotherapy-naive NSCLC patients.
Neoplasms
DRUG: MK0683, vorinostat
Number of Participants With a Dose Limited Toxicity at First Cycle, Dose Limited Toxicity = Drug-related side effects that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment., 25 Days (first cycle)
Area Under the Curve (AUC(0-24 hr)) at Day 4, Area Under the Curve (AUC (0-24 hr)) = Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to 24 hour., Day 4|Area Under the Curve (AUC(0-24 hr)) at Day 5, Area Under the Curve (AUC (0-24 hr)) = Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to 24 hour., Day 5|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) at Day 4, Maximum Concentration (Cmax) = the maximum plasma concentration of the drug, Day 4|Maximum Concentration (Cmax) at Day 5, Maximum Concentration (Cmax) = the maximum plasma concentration of the drug, Day 5
The clinical study will evaluate safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of MK0683 in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in chemotherapy-naive NSCLC patients.
