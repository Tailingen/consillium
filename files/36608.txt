High Dose Rate Interstitial Brachytherapy With Three Dimensional Printing Template for Recurrent Gynecologic Tumors
This is a single-center study.Eligible patients will have histologically proven pelvic recurrence of cervical cancer after radiotherapy .
Cervical Cancer
Local Progression Free Survival, Local progression free survival was defined as the time from the implantation of the treatment to the treatment of local tumor progression., 2 years|Tumor Response Rate, Tumor size changes were monitored using CT. According to the solid tumor treatment efficacy evaluation standard RECIST, evaluation results including complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progression disease.Tumor response rate was complete response rate plus partial response rate., three months
Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the implantation of the treatment to the death of any cause., 2 years|Safety and Tolerability, Number of participants with treatment-related acute adverse events were evaluated according to RTOG acute radiation injury grading standards; Number of participants with treatment-related late adverse events were evaluated according to RTOG/ EORTC advanced radiation injury grading schemes., 2 years
The results of treatment, examination and follow-up of patients with recurrent cervical cancer after radiotherapy who recieved imaging guided three dimensional printing personalized template assisted with 192Ir high dose rate interorganizational braided therapy were statistically analyzed .
