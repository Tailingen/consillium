Significance of the High-risk Hpv Viral Load
The aim of this study is to evaluate the significance of an elevated high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) viral load.
HPV Infections
OTHER: 2 cervical takings and 2 sampling of blood|OTHER: 2 cervical takings and 2 sampling of blood|OTHER: 2 cervical takings and 2 sampling of blood
Estimate the meaning of a viral load raised in HPV oncogenic, 36 months
To estimate the correlation enters the vorale load of the HPV oncogenic and the severity of the cervical hurt, 36 months|Estimate the correlation between the viral load of the HPV oncogenic and the level of transcription of the genes coding for oncoproteines E6 and E7, 36 months|Estimate the correlation between the viral load in HPV oncogenic and the integration of the viral genome in that of the infected cells, 36 months|Estimate the correlation between a viral load raised in HPV oncogenic and a presence of HPV in the circulating blood of the infected patients, 36 months
We will particularly evaluate if the HR-HPV viral load:

* Is correlated to the transcription of the genes of the oncoproteins E6 and E7
* Is predictive of the integration of the virus in infected cells
* Is predictive of the presence of HPV in patients' blood
* Influences the local and systemic immunologic response
