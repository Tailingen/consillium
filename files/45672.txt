Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Women With Advanced Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Antineoplastons are naturally-occurring substances that may also be made in the laboratory. Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating women with stage IV breast cancer that has not responded to standard therapy.
Stage IV Breast Cancer|Recurrent Breast Cancer
DRUG: antineoplaston A10|DRUG: antineoplaston AS2-1|PROCEDURE: alternative product therapy|PROCEDURE: biological therapy|PROCEDURE: biologically based therapies|PROCEDURE: cancer prevention intervention|PROCEDURE: complementary and alternative therapy|PROCEDURE: differentiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the antitumor activity of antineoplastons A10 and AS2-1 capsules in patients with advanced breast cancer by determining the proportion of women who experience an objective tumor response.
* Evaluate the adverse effects of and tolerance to this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Patients receive oral antineoplaston A10 and antineoplaston AS2-1 6 to 7 times per day.

Treatment continues for at least 6 weeks. Patients achieving complete or partial response may continue on therapy until disease progression or toxic effects occur.

Patients are followed for survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
