Comparison of Intra-operative Radiotherapy With Post-operative Radiotherapy for Women With Ductal Carcinoma in Situ
Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving radiation during surgery followed by external-beam radiation to the entire breast may kill more tumor cells.The clinical trial is conducting to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy during surgery and whole-breast radiation therapy in treating women who have undergone breast-conversing surgery for Intermediate or high grade ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasms
RADIATION: Intraoperative Radiotherapy|RADIATION: Whole breast radiation
ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate after surgery within five years, Within 5 years after surgery,we should evaluate ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence and Disease free survival as the most important outcome measure, Within 5 years after surgery|Disease free survival after surgery within five years, Within 5 years after adjuvant chemotherapy,we should evaluateDisease free survival(DFS) rates as thet important outcome measure., Within 5 years after surgery
Overall survival after surgery within ten years, After surgery,we should evaluate overall survival (OR)rates as the secondary important outcome measure., Within ten years after surgery
