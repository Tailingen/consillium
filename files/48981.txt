Study of VGX-100 Administered Alone and Co-administered With Bevacizumab in Adult Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a non-randomized, multi-dose, first-in-human, multicenter, two arm (Arm A: VGX-100 alone; Arm B: VGX-100 co-administered with bevacizumab), open label, dose escalation study in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study is aimed at evaluating the safety and establishing the recommended dose of the VEGF-C human monoclonal antibody VGX-100 when administered alone or in combination with bevacizumab.
