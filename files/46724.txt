Combined Training on Body Composition of Postmenopausal Women Undergoing Treatment for Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease affecting women, and one of the treatments for its healing and survival is hormone therapy. Aromatase inhibitors are third-generation drugs that promote lower chance of metastasis, but their side effects include the loss of bone mineral density and increased fat percentage. In this way, the Combined Training (combined resistance and endurance training) may be an interesting strategy to minimize the side effects of aromatase inhibitors, providing better quality of life, survival and changes in body composition.
