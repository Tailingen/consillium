Hypofractionated vs. Conventionally Fractionated Concurrent CRT for Unresectable Stage III NSCLC
This protocol is a phase III randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy of hypofractionated vs. conventionally fractionated concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer

Hypofractionated radiotherapy (RT) delivers higher doses of RT over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and may have fewer side effects. Dose escalation in unresectable stage III NSCLC has been safely achieved up to LEVEL 3 (PTV-G60.5Gy/22Fx, 2.75Gy/Fx; PTV-C 49.5Gy/22Fx, 2.25Gy/Fx). Acute toxicities were well tolerable. Further stage II clinical study has found that hypofractionated RT can significantly improve the efficacy of patients with a low toxicity profile. The aim of this study is to compared with hypofractionated and conventionally fractionated concurrent chemotherapy , and evaluate whether hypofractionated RT can improve local control and overall survival in unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
