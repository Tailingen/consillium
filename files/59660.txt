Outcomes Following Omission of Daily Routine Chest Radiographs Following Pulmonary Resection
Currently, it is the standard of care practice to perform daily routine CXR when a chest tube is in situ following pulmonary resection. However, previous research as well as experience of thoracic surgeons suggested this kind of management has poor diagnostic and therapeutic value. Eliminating daily routine CXR for adult patients having undergone pulmonary surgery might decrease the frequency of radiation exposure and hospitalization costs per patient without increasing reintervention rates, length of hospital stays, readmission rates or any adverse events.
