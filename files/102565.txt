Mindful Waiting Room
This will be a single-site, five-arm, parallel group randomized control trial involving patients seeking integrative healthcare. Four different styles of 5-minute, audio-recoded mindfulness practices delivered in the clinic waiting room will be compared with a 5-minute audio-recording about integrative healthcare.

A secondary sub-analysis will investigate the most effective mindfulness practice style for patients presenting at the clinic with elevated anxiety, depression, or pain.
