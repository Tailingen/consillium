Combined Therapy Using Gemcitabine and Cisplatin Chemotherapy, Lenvatinib and Adebrelimab for Patients With Advanced and Unresectable Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
In this phase 2 study, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined therapy using gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy, Lenvatinib and Adebrelimab for patients with advanced and unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: combined therapy using gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy, Lenvatinib and Adebrelimab
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination (up to approximately 3 years
The disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at the time of data cutoff as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose of study drug until disease progression, stable disease, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination (up to approximately 3 years)|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From the first documentation of CR or PR to the first date of documentation of disease progression or death whichever occurs first (up to approximately 3 years)|The median progression free survival time (mPFS), The progression free survival time (mPFS) defined as the time from the first study dose date to the date of first documentation of disease progression as assessed by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documentation of disease progression (up to approximately 3 years)|The median overall survival time (mOS), OS is measured from the start date of the Treatment Phase (date of first study dose) until date of death from any cause. Participants who are lost to follow-up and the participants who are alive at the date of data cutoff will be censored at the date the participant was last known alive or the cut-off date, whichever comes earlier., From the start date of the Treatment Phase until date of death from any cause (up to approximately 3 years)|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Safety will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0. All observations pertinent to the safety of the study medication will be recorded on the CRF and included in the final report., From the start date of the Treatment Phase until date of death from any cause (up to approximately 3 years)
Most intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients are often accompanied by local or distant metastases and lose the opportunity for surgical resection. For patients with unresectable ICC who have been in stages IIIb and IV (AJCC/UICC, V2, 2018), the survival time is less than 4 months, and there is currently no standard treatment. TheGC chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) has been used in the treatment of advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, but the efficacy is still unsatisfactory. Lenvatinib is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor, the main targets including VEGFR1-3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1-4, PDGFRÎ±, RET(ret proto-oncogene ), KIT(KIT proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase), have anti-angiogenic effects, have been proven effective in hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, immunological checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown remarkable therapeutic effects in the treatment of various solid tumors. Combined with other therapies such as chemotherapy and targeted drugs is an important direction to improve the therapeutic effect of immunological checkpoint inhibitors. In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GC chemotherapy combined with Lenvatinib and immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 antibody Adebrelimab for patients with advanced and unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
