Liquid Biopsy Evaluation and Repository Development at Princess Margaret
The objective of this protocol is to develop an institution-wide liquid biopsy protocol that will establish a common process for collecting blood and corresponding archived tumor specimens for future research studies at the University Health Network's Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNA), including cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cell-free RNA (cfRNA), are non-invasive, real-time biomarkers that can provide diagnostic and prognostic information before cancer diagnosis, during cancer treatment, and at disease progression. Cancer research scientists and clinicians at the Princess Margaret are interested in incorporating the collection of peripheral blood samples ("liquid biopsies") into research protocols as a means of non-invasively assessing tumor progression and response to treatment at multiple time points during a patient's course of disease.

Collection and annotation of biospecimens, Facilitate and streamline the collection, banking, and annotation of biospecimens (especially liquid biopsy specimens and optionally corresponding archived tumor specimens) for research studies across the University Health Network institution, Through study completion, up to 5 years
Electronic Consenting, Implement an electronic informed consent process for clinical research at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Through study completion, up to 5 years|Correlative Studies Questionnaire, Collect observational/epidemiological data using a Correlative Studies Questionnaire for clinical annotation of specimens and future research use. Data collected involves demographics such as family history, medical history, smoking history, and lifestyle., Through study completion, up to 5 years
