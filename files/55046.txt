Clinical Evaluation of [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 for Targeting of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen
The study should evaluate the biological distribution of \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 in patients with prostate cancer.

The objective are:

1. To evaluate the content of \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 in the blood of patients with prostate cancer at different time points after a single intravenous administration.
2. To assess the distribution of \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 in normal tissues and tumors at different time points.
3. To evaluate dosimetry of \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876.
4. To study the safety and tolerability of the drug \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 after a single injection.

[177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 blood —Ålearance, Measurement of \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 activity in patient blood samples at various time points: after 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 90 minutes, 2, 3, 24, 48 hours., 48 hours|Gamma camera-based whole-body [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876, Whole-body \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 uptake coinciding with normal organs and tissues will be assessed using gamma camera and calculated as percentage (%) of the injected dose of the radiopharmaceutical at 1, 4, 24, 48, 72, 120 hours after single injection., 120 hours|SPECT/CT-based [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 uptake in tumor lesions (SUVmean), \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 uptake (SUVmean) with tumor lesions will be assessed using single-photon emission computed tomography and measured in SUVmean after 4, 48, 72 and 120 hours after single injection of radiopharmaceutical., 120 hours
Percent of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline [Safety and Tolerability], The safety attributable to \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 injections will be evaluated based on the assessments of physical examination, vital signs, and ECG (percent of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 48 hours|Percent of participants with abnormal laboratory values that are related to [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 injection [Safety and Tolerability], The safety attributable to \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 injections will be evaluated based on the blood and urine laboratory tests (percent of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 48 hours|Percent of participants with adverse events that are related to [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 injection [Safety and Tolerability], The safety attributable to \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 injections will be evaluated based on the rate of adverse events(percent of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 48 hours|Percent of participants requiring administration of medication due to side effects that are related to [177Lu]Lu-BQ7876 injection [Safety and Tolerability], The safety attributable to \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 injections will be evaluated based on the rate of administration of concomitant medication (percent of cases with abnormal findings relative to baseline), 48 hours
The overall goal is to study the effectiveness of prostate-specific membrane antigen targeting using Lutetium-177 - labeled BQ7876.

Phase I of the study:

Biodistribution, dosimetry, safety and tolerability of \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 in patients with prostate cancer.

The main objectives of the study:

1. To evaluate the content of \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 in the blood of patients with prostate cancer at different time points after a single intravenous administration.
2. To evaluate the distribution of \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 in normal tissues and tumors in patients with prostate cancer at different time points after a single intravenous administration.
3. To evaluate dosimetry of \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 based on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug after a single intravenous administration.
4. To study the safety of use and tolerability of the drug \[177Lu\]Lu-BQ7876 after a single intravenous administration in a diagnostic dosage.

Methodology:

Open-label, exploratory, single centre study. The subjects will receive a single injection of the labeled tracer.
