Antibody CC-1 in Men With Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer
This trial is a phase I open-label, single center study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the bispecific prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and cluster of differentiation protein 3 (CD3) antibody CC-1 in men with biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer (PC). The PSMA binder in CC-1 reacts with tumor cells and also binds to tumor vessels, thereby allowing for a dual mode of anti-cancer action. CC-1 was developed in a novel format, which not only prolongs serum half-life, but most importantly reduces off-target T-cell activation with accordingly reduced side effects. The study entails a part I (dose escalation part) to identify the maximally tolerated dose of CC-1, which then will be further evaluated in part II of the study (dose expansion part). After application of two low doses as safety steps in the first cycle, CC-1 will be applied twice weekly for three consecutive weeks within 4 week cycles as a short-term intravenous infusion (3 hours). The planned trial ultimately shall define the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of CC-1 in the disease setting of BCR of PC.
Prostate Cancer Recurrent
DRUG: CC-1 Infusion
Dose escalation part: To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-1 as 3 hours infusion, Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) and Sponsor meeting about determination of the MTD for each cohort and the dose expansion phase, during the procedure|Dose expansion part: To define the recommended phase-II dose of CC-1, Data Safety and Monitoring Board and Sponsor meeting about determination of the recommended phase II dose of CC-1 for potential phase II trials., up to 1 month after procedure
To evaluate safety and tolerability of CC-1, Number of participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and with abnormal laboratory test results, during the procedure|To assess efficacy in terms of Prostata-Specific-Antigen (PSA) response and no PSA progression after CC-1 treatment, PSA response will be defined as â‰¥50% PSA decrease. In addition, "No PSA doubling", defined as PSA measured at visits C1-6, End Of Treatment (EOT), End Of Safety follow up (EOSf) and Follow-up (FU)1-5 divided by PSA measured at baseline, will be assessed as further efficacy endpoint. Furthermore, percentage of patients with no clinical relapse, no salvage and no subsequent antineoplastic therapy will be assessed, during the procedure and through study completion, an average of 6 months|To assess clinical outcome in terms of progression-free survival, treatment-free survival, overall survival, Overall and progression free survival status as percentage of patients alive at EOSf and each follow-up assessment, through study completion, an average of 6 months|To assess CC-1 serum concentrations, CC-1 serum concentrations assessed prior to and after start of infusion on each treatment day in the first cycle (each cycle is 28 days)., during the procedure prior to and after start of infusion on each treatment day in the first cycle (each cycle is 28 days).|To assess quality of life, Quality of life is defined as overall quality of life scores European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)., through study completion, an average of 1 year
To identify predictive biomarkers of response and resistance, Samples for human anti-human antibody (HAHA) analysis, during the procedure|To evaluate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CC-1 using Cytokine levels, Cytokine levels in serum as assessed at baseline and after therapy using a commercially available, flow cytometry-based assay that allows parallel determination of different cytokines in one serum sample., baseline and immediately after procedure
