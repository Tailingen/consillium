Vincristine, Dactinomycin, and Cyclophosphamide With or Without Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide together with or without radiation therapy works in treating patients with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.

OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the progression-free survival rate in patients with low-risk embryonal rhadomyosarcoma treated with a shortened treatment schedule of vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide with or without radiotherapy.

OUTLINE: Patients receive vincristine IV, dactinomycin IV, and cyclophosphamide IV. Patients may also undergo radiotherapy. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 8 courses (total of 24 weeks) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
