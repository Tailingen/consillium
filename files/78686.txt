Effect of HFR-SUPRA in the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma-related Acute Kidney Injury
In patients with multiple myeloma-related acute kidney injury, compare the renal outcome of chemotherapy combined with HFR-SUPRA to chemotherapy combined with hemodialysis.
Multiple Myeloma|Acute Kidney Injury|Hemodiafiltration With Ultrafiltrate Regeneration (HFR)
PROCEDURE: HFR-SUPRA|PROCEDURE: hemodialysis|DRUG: Chemotherapy
independence from dialysis at 90 days from allocation to groups, independence from dialysis at 90 days from allocation to groups, 90 days after allocation to groups
independence from dialysis at 6 months from allocation to groups, independence from dialysis at 6 months from allocation to groups, 6 months after allocation to groups|complete renal recovery at 90 days from allocation to groups, serum creatinine elevation≤ 0.2 mg/dl from baseline or serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dl if baseline level is unknown, 90 days after allocation to groups|decline of free light chain at 21 days from allocation to groups, decline of free light chain from baseline level, 21 days after allocation to groups|hematological remission at 90 days from allocation to groups, hematological remission at 90 days from allocation to groups, 90 days after allocation to groups|hematological remission at 6 months from allocation to groups, hematological remission at 6 months from allocation to groups, 6 months after allocation to groups|time to independence from dialysis, time to independence from dialysis, from allocation to groups to the last time of Hemodialysis or HFR-SUPRA|survival at 12 months, survival at 12 months, 12 months after allocation to groups|adverse events, adverse events, within the 3 months after allocation to groups
In patients with multiple myeloma-related severe acute kidney injury, compare the renal outcome between patients receiving HFR-SUPRA and patients receiving hemodialysis. Both groups of patients receive chemotherapy.
