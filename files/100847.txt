Effect of High Doses of Radiation on Bone Structure and Metabolism
This study is designed to characterize the effects of high energy radiation on bone breakdown, with a specific interest in reducing the rate of sacral fractures. Although radiation is very important in managing tumors, it is related to complications such as bone fractures. In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine changes in blood markers, bone density, and bone structure following radiation and to better understand the reason for these changes.

Participants in the Surgical Arm of the study will be treated according to the schedule outlined in protocol for a combined treatment with surgery and adjuvant high dose radiotherapy. Patients in the non surgical arm of the the study will be treated according to the protocol being treated with radiotherapy alone.
