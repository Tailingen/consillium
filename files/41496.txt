Balloon Assisted Transarterial Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To prove the treatment concept of the use of balloon assistance in transarterial therapy for HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: The balloon catheter is placed at the various arterial feeders of the tumor
The change in hemodynamics of arterial blood supply to HCC tumors, The change in number of feeding arteries, immediately after completion of procedure|The change in the perfusion pattern of HCC tumors, The change in perfusion pressure., immediately after completion of procedure
Tumor response, Tumor response by CT such as complete response according to European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) necrosis guidelines., 3 months
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been playing an important role in the treatment algorithm for patients with multifocal or large intrahepatic lesions of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not eligible for surgical resection, transplantation, or local ablative therapy. The use of balloon assisted TACE has been proposed recently and it could be one of the possible ways to improve the effectiveness of drug delivery to the target tumor and therefore leading to improved treatment outcome.
