Cerebral Prophylactic Irradiation With Saving Hippocampus and Amygdala
Hippocampus and amygdala are parts of the brain involved in the recognition of emotions, memories, memory, language ... It is therefore very important to protect them during irradiation of the brain.

The aim of this study is to evaluate cerebral irradiation with saving hippocampus and amygdala protects these brain functions in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) Radiotherapy of the brain
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Irradiation prophyllactique cérébrale
