Uveal Melanoma|Liver Metastases
BIOLOGICAL: CVA21|BIOLOGICAL: Ipilimumab
Incidence of treatment-related adverse events as assessed using the current NCI-CTCAE., Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that start on or after the first day of study treatment and within 30 days of the last administration of study treatment. The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized based on the number and percentage of subjects who experience events classified by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term., 30 days from the last administration of study treatment
Overall Response Rate, Objective responses will be assessed according to immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST) criteria, 2 years
This is an open-label Phase 1b clinical study of ipilimumab in combination with intravenous CVA21 in subjects who have uveal melanoma metastatic to liver. Subjects will receive up to 8 cycles of CVA21 at a planned dose of 1 x 10e9 TCID50 per infusion, with the first cycle being a 28-day cycle consisting of an intravenous infusion on Days 1, 3, 5 and 8 and subsequent cycles every 21 days from Day 8.
