Study of RAD001 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma That Has Progressed After High-dose Chemotherapy and Autologous Stem Cell Transplant and/or After Gemcitabine- or Vinorelbine- or Vinblastine-based Treatment.
This study will assess RAD001 in patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma that has progressed after high-dose chemotherapy and Autologous Stem cell transplant and/or after gemcitabine- or vinorelbine- or vinblastine-based treatment.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Everolimus (RAD001)
Overall Response Rate (ORR) Based on the Assessments by Investigator, ORR: % of patients whose overall disease response was a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) in 8 cycles CR: Complete normalization of all index nodal \& extranodal lesions: Radiological regression to normal size of all lymph nodes \& nodal masses \& complete disappearance of all lesions PR: At least a 50% decrease in the SPD of all index nodal \& extranodal lesions FDG-avid or PET positive prior to therapy: one or more PET positive at previously involved site.At least a 50% increase in the SPD of all index nodal \& extranodal lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the product of the diameters of all index lesions recorded at or after baseline . Lesions PET positive if FDG-avid lymphoma or PET positive prior to therapy. Unknown (UNK): Progression not documented \& one or more of the index lesions not assessed or assessed using a different method than baseline at the time of radiologic evaluation. Each cycle was 28 days., at screening and every threee months beginning at cycle 3 until end of treatment due to progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study for any other reason
Time to Overall Response (TTR) Per Kaplan-Meier Estimate, Time to overall response was defined as the time from the first date of treatment to the date of first documented response of CR or PR. Time to overall response is applied to patients whose best overall response is CR or PR. Patients who drop-out or did not have a response (CR or PR) will be treated as censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment., Every three months beginning at Cycle 3 until end of treatment due to progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study for any other reason|Duration of Overall Response (DoR), The duration of overall response was calculated from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause or start of a new antineoplastic therapy. This only applies to patients whose best overall response is CR or PR., Every three months beginning at Cycle 3 until end of treatment due to progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study for any other reason|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The disease control rate was defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD)., Every three months beginning at Cycle 3 until end of treatment due to progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study for any other reason|Duration of Disease Control, The duration of overall response (CR/PR) was applied only to patients whose best overall response was CR or PR. Duration of overall response was calculated from the date of the first documented response of CR or PR to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause or start of a new antineoplastic therapy., Every three months beginning at Cycle 3 until end of treatment due to progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study for any other reason|Progression Free Survival (PFS) by Kaplan-Meier Estimate, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the first date of treatment to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause or start of a new antineoplastic therapy. An event for PFS was defined as a documented disease progression or death due to any cause or start of a new antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurred first. Cycle = 28 days., Every three months beginning at Cycle 3 until end of treatment due to progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study for any other reason
