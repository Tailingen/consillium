68Ga-PSMA-Dual-Contrast PET/MRI or PET/CT for Early Detection of Liver Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI or PET/CT works in early detection of liver cancer. 68Gallium-PSMA is a radioactive tracer designed to circulate through the body and attach itself to the prostate- specific membrane antigen (PSMA) protein on liver cancer cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a scan that uses magnetic and radio waves to produce detailed structural information of the organs, tissues, and structures within the body. Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging test that helps to measure the information about functions of tissues and organs within the body. A PET scan uses a radioactive drug (tracer) to show this activity. Computed tomography (CT) scan uses X-rays to create images of the bones and internal organs within your body. Combining a PET scan with an MRI or CT scan may help make the images easier to interpret. This trial may help determine if 68Ga- PSMA PET/MRI or PET/CT can improve upon the diagnosis and management of liver cancer in the future.

Diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA-dual contrast, Using surgical histopathology of resected or biopsied lesions and routine imaging surveillance (for lesions that cannot be resected or biopsied) as the gold standard, we will estimate the diagnostic performance (lesion-level sensitivity, specificity measures, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals) of PET/MRI for hepatic lesions and extra-hepatic metastases, and compare it with standard-of-care (SOC) imaging (MRI and CT) to identify the incremental benefit of PET/MRI., Up to 6 weeks|Correlate biomarkers derived from PET/MRI with PSMA immuno-histochemical (IHC) grading, PSMA stained sections will be evaluated by light microscopy for PSMA localization and the entire section reviewed to determine percentage area of PSMA immunostaining as follows: 0 = no staining, 1 = \< 5% staining, 2= 5 to 30% staining, 3 = 31 to 60% staining, and 4 = 61-100% staining. Grades 0-2 will be grouped as 'low PSMA expression' and grades 3 and 4 will be grouped as 'high PSMA expression', Up to 6 weeks|Correlate biomarkers derived from PET/MRI with PSMA immuno-histochemical (IHC) grading, Intensity of PSMA uptake in hepatic lesions on PET will be graded as follows: grade 1: uptake \< normal liver; grade 2: uptake = normal liver; grade 3: uptake \> normal liver; grade 4: uptake \> spleen or kidneys. For correlation with PSMA IHC scoring, grades 1 and 2 on PET/MRI will be grouped as 'low PSMA expression'. Conversely, grades 3 and 4 will be grouped as 'high PSMA expression'., Up to 6 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic performance of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide (68Ga PSMA)-dual contrast PET/MRI for detection and staging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to compare it with standard-of-care (SOC) imaging.

II. To identify the biologic correlates of biomarkers derived from 68Ga PSMA-dual contrast PET/MRI with histopathology features and PSMA immunostaining of HCC.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes. Patients then undergo PET/MRI over 60 minutes or PET/CT over 30 minutes.
