Treatment of Hematologic Malignancies With Single-Unit or Double-Unit Cord Blood Transplantation
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of neutrophil engraftment after transplantation of one or two cord blood units meeting a predetermined total minimum cell dose of 2.0 x 10 to the seventh total nucleated cell (TNC)/kg.

PROCEDURE: Cord Blood Transplant
Evaluate the incidence of neutrophil engraftment after transplantation of one or two cord blood units
Evaluate safety as measured by day 100 treatment related mortality|Evaluate incidence of platelet engraftment|Evaluate incidences of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)|Evaluate efficacy as measured by survival at 1 and 2 years after transplant|Evaluate chimerism from double cord transplants to determine source of long term engraftment
This is a non-randomized, phase II protocol to evaluate engraftment of cord blood after treatment with myeloablative conditioning of fludarabine, total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide. All patients will receive tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil as prophylaxis for graft-vs-host disease.

Conditioning Regimen:

* Days -10 to -7: Fludarabine 30mg/m2/day IV
* Days -7 to -4: TBI 165 centigray BID
* Days -3 to -2: Cyclophosphamide 40mg/kg/day IV

Day 0: Infusion of Cord Blood Cells

Graft-vs-Host Disease Prophylaxis

* Day -1: Start tacrolimus 0.03mg/kg/day IV
* Day 0: Start MMF 7.5mg/kg IV BID
