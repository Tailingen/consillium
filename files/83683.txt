CAR-T Following ASCT for Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (R/R B-NHL) With High-Risk Prognostic Factors
Clinical trial for the safety and efficacy of CD19 CAR-T following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (R/R B-NHL) with High-Risk Prognostic Factors
B-cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
OTHER: autologous stem-cell transplantation|DRUG: Relmacabtagene autoleucel (relma-cel)
Best Complete Response (CR) Rate in 3 months, Best Complete Response rate in 3 months is defined as the incidence of subjects achieving complete remission (CR) within 3 months after CAR-T infusion according to the Lugano Classification (Cheson et al, 2014), as determined by study investigators., 3months post CAR-T infusion
Objective remission rate (ORR) in 3months, ORR in 3 moths is defined as the incidence of either a CR or a partial response (PR) within 3 months after CAR-T infusion per the Lugano Classification as determined by study investigators., 3months post CAR-T infusion|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined only for participants who experience an objective response after CAR-T infusion and is the time from the first objective response to disease progression or death from any cause, 2 years post CAR-T infusion|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the CAR-T infusion date to the date of disease progression or death from any cause., 2 years post CAR-T infusion|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from CAR-T infusion to the date of death from any cause., 2 years post CAR-T infusion|Adverse Events rate as assessed by CTCAE version 5.0, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., 2 years post CAR-T infusion
This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label, prospective clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Relmacabtagene autoleucel (relma-cel) infusion following high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation (HDT/ASCT) in relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients with high-risk prognostic factors (extranodal involvement/bulky mass ≥5 cm in diameter/TP53 alterations). Relma-cel will be infused on day +3 (±1d) with a fixed dose of 100X10\^6. The study will assess the safety and efficacy of this combinational therapy, including the investigators assessed the best complete response rate (BCR) in 3 months (primary endpoint), objective response rates, survivals, incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), hematological, and other non-hematological toxicities of the subjects.
