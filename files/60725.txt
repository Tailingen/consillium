A Study of DC05F01 in Chinese Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This trial employs a non-randomized, open-label, dose-escalation design to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, and preliminary efficacy of DC05F01 in Chinese patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Subjects in each dose cohort will first undergo a single-dose study to assess safety, tolerability, and PK. PK sample collection for the single dose will be conducted over 96 hours. If safety is deemed acceptable after a 5-day observation period (Cycle 0 to Cycle 1 Day 1), subjects will proceed to the multiple-dosing study. The multiple-dosing study will consist of 4-week treatment cycles (daily dosing for 4 weeks, with blood sampling up to 96 hours after the last dose in Cycle 1) (Cycle 1 to Cycle N). The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period will cover the single-dose period and the first cycle of multiple dosing (Cycle 0 + Cycle 1, Day 1 to Day 28). Following this period, subjects will continue with 4-week dosing cycles (Cycle 2 to Cycle N) until they complete six treatment cycles, experience disease progression, develop intolerable toxicity, initiate new anti-tumor therapy, withdraw consent, voluntarily withdraw, die, are lost to follow-up, or encounter other protocol-specified reasons for treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs first. The dose escalation will follow the standard "3+3" design, proceeding from the low-dose group to the high-dose group.
