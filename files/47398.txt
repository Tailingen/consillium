A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Novel Treatment Combinations in Participants With Ovarian Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of niraparib and novel treatment combinations of niraparib as described within each cohort-specific supplement in participants with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Cohort A (single arm) includes participants with recurrent ovarian cancer. Cohort B will not be initiated. Cohort C (randomized-2 arms) includes participants with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer.
