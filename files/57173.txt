Study Evaluating the Addition of Amifostine (Ethyol®) to Idarubicin and Cytosine Arabinoside in Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The primary objectives of this study are:

1. To evaluate whether the addition of amifostine will allow for the safe administration of idarubicin at a dose of 21 mg/m² in combination with standard-dose ara-C in older patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and
2. To estimate the complete remission rate of induction therapy with amifostine, idarubicin (21 mg/m²), plus ara-C or induction therapy with idarubicin (12 mg/m²) plus ara-C in this patient population.
Leukemia|Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Idarubincin and Amufostine (Ethyol)|DRUG: Idarubincin
Clinically significant hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities associated with idarubicin administration, 30 days after last dose|Incidence rate of amifostine-associated hypotension results in amifostine dose reduction, discontinuation of amifostine, or causes the development of serious cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events will be estimated, 30 days after last dose
Duration of Complete Remission, Estimated by analysis cohort using Kaplan-Mier Method|Overall Survival, 19 mos. after last patient entered or randomized (whichever was earlier).
