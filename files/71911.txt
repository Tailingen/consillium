Combination of TURP and Standard Systemic Therapy for MPCa
This is a Phase II, open-label, prospective, single-arm clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) with standard systemic therapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). All participants will undergo TURP to relieve urinary obstruction and reduce tumor burden, followed by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and second-generation anti-androgen agents, such as abiraterone or enzalutamide. The primary outcome is radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), with secondary outcomes including overall survival (OS), biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), PSA response rates at 3 and 6 months, and quality of life assessments. The trial will enroll 200 newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer patients, with regular follow-up for monitoring disease progression and treatment safety. The study will be conducted at Fudan University Cancer Hospital.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: TURP|DRUG: Standard Medical Therapy
Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS), Defined as the time from the start of treatment to radiographic evidence of disease progression, assessed by imaging techniques such as PSMA PET-CT, MRI, or CT scans, following RECIST 1.1 criteria. The primary objective is to evaluate how long patients remain free from disease progression after receiving the combination of TURP and standard systemic therapy., 2 years|Urinary Symptom Relief Rate, Urinary symptom relief will be assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and objective measures like urine flow rate. The goal is to evaluate the extent to which TURP alleviates urinary obstruction and related symptoms in patients with metastatic prostate cancer., 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the start of treatment until death from any cause. For patients who are still alive, the time will be censored at the last follow-up. This secondary outcome measure aims to assess the overall survival rate of patients receiving the combination of TURP and standard systemic therapy for metastatic prostate cancer, comparing survival outcomes over the course of the study., 2 years|Biochemical Progression-Free Survival (bPFS), Defined as the time from the start of treatment to biochemical progression, according to the criteria set by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the American Urological Association (AUA). Biochemical progression is typically defined as an increase in PSA (Prostate-Specific Antigen) level by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir (lowest point). This measure will assess how long patients maintain PSA control after receiving the combination of TURP and standard systemic therapy., 2 years|3-, 6-Months PSA Response Rate, The proportion of patients whose Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels decrease by more than 50% from baseline will be measured at 3 months and 6 months post-treatment. The PSA response rate will be assessed at both time points to evaluate the effectiveness of the combined TURP and standard systemic therapy in reducing PSA levels, which is a key marker of prostate cancer activity., 3 and 6 months|Quality of Life Assessment, This outcome will evaluate changes in patients' quality of life using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. It assesses physical, emotional, and social well-being during and after treatment. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life., Baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months
