A Multi-Center Study of Ibrutinib in Combination With MEDI4736 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1b/2, multi-center study to assess the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) in participants with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Durvalumab
Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Ibrutinib and Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and to Find the Recommended Phase II Dose., From the date of first study treatment until DLT or disease progression per RECIST 1.1.|Phase 2: Efficacy of Ibrutinib in Combination With Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors by Assessing the ORR Per RECIST 1.1., From the date of first study treatment until progressive disease per RECIST 1.1 or unacceptable toxicity.
Phase 1b/2: Pharmacokinetics (Cmax) of Ibrutinib, Cmax = the peak (maximum) plasma concentration of ibrutinib during the dosing interval on Cycle 3 Day 1., 0hr, 1hr, 2hr, and 4hr post-dose|Phase 1b/2: Pharmacokinetics (AUC0-24h) of Ibrutinib, AUC0-24 = the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of ibrutinib during the dosing interval on Cycle 3 Day 1, 0hr, 1hr, 2hr, and 4hr post-dose|Phase 1b/2: Pharmacokinetics (Cmax) of Durvalumab (MEDI4736), Cmax = the peak (maximum) plasma concentration of durvalumab (MEDI4736) after administration on Cycle 6 Day 1., 60 minutes post-dose (dose administered as an infusion over a 1 hour period)|Phase 1b/2: Pharmacokinetics (Ctrough) of Durvalumab (MEDI4736), Ctrough = the trough plasma concentration of durvalumab (MEDI4736) after administration on Cycle 6 Day 1, Pre-dose|Phase 1b: Pharmacodynamics, BTK occupancy, From the date of first study treatment until DLT or disease progression per RECIST 1.1.|Phase 2: Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Ibrutinib and Durvalumab (MEDI4736), From the date of first study treatment until DLT or disease progression per RECIST 1.1.|Phase 2: Pharmacodynamics, BTK binding site occupancy of ibrutinib was measured from peripheral blood samples collected from participants during Cycle 3 Day 1., Pre-dose
