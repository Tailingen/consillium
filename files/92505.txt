Toripalimab Combined With Radiotherapy and S-1 for Older Patients With Esophageal Cancer
This trial aims to assess efficacy and safety of toripalimab combined with radiotherapy and S-1 followed by adjuvant toripalimab maintenance therapy for older patients with stage II-III esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Carcinoma
DRUG: toripalimab
Assessment of objective remission rate (ORR) in elderly esophageal cancer patients treated with toripalimab in combination with S-1 and radiotherapy., Objective tumor remission is assessed by the investigator using the Solid Tumor Remission Assessment Criteria (RECIST 1.1 criteria). Objective remission rate (ORR): defined as the proportion of subjects whose tumor volume shrinks to a pre-specified value and can be maintained for the minimum time frame required, incorporating cases in complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR)., 2022/10/1-2026/4/30|Assessment of disease control rate (DCR) in elderly esophageal cancer patients treated with toripalimab in combination with S-1 and radiotherapy., Objective tumor remission is assessed by the investigator using the Solid Tumor Remission Assessment Criteria (RECIST 1.1 criteria). Disease control rate (DCR): the proportion of patients whose tumors shrank or were stable and remained so for a certain period of time, including complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) and stable disease (SD)., 2022/10/1-2026/4/30|Assessment of duration of remission (DOR) in elderly esophageal cancer patients treated with toripalimab in combination with S-1 and radiotherapy., Objective tumor remission is assessed by the investigator using the Solid Tumor Remission Assessment Criteria (RECIST 1.1 criteria). Duration of remission (DOR): refers to the time between the start of the first assessment of the tumor as complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) and the first assessment of PD or death from any cause., 2022/10/1-2026/4/30|Assessment of the incidence of treatment-related adverse events Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events., Adverse events are observed during the course of the study and assessed according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE V5.0)., 2022/10/1-2026/4/30
Assessment of overall survival (OS) in elderly esophageal cancer patients treated with toripalimab in combination with S-1 and radiotherapy., Objective tumor remission is assessed by the investigator using the Solid Tumor Remission Assessment Criteria (RECIST 1.1 criteria). OS is defined as the time from the start of enrollment to death from any cause., 2022/10/1-2026/4/30|Assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) in elderly esophageal cancer patients treated with toripalimab in combination with S-1 and radiotherapy., Objective tumor remission is assessed by the investigator using the Solid Tumor Remission Assessment Criteria (RECIST 1.1 criteria). PFS is defined as the time from the start of enrollment until tumor progression or death from any cause., 2022/10/1-2026/4/30
With the aging of the population, the number of elderly esophageal cancer patients is gradually increasing. For non-metastatic esophageal cancer patients, surgery is the first choice of treatment, but elderly esophageal cancer patients are often unable to tolerate surgical treatment due to more comorbidities and poor physical condition, etc. The results of previous studies have shown that the effect of radiotherapy treatment is also unsatisfactory, and the 5-year survival rate of esophageal cancer patients treated with radiotherapy is only 15-25%, which makes the clinical treatment of elderly patients even more difficult due to their poor physical tolerance. A multicentre randomised phase III clinical trial (NCT02813967) demonstrated that concurrent radiotherapy and S-1 treatment in elderly patients with esophageal cancer was tolerable and provided significant benefit compared with radiotherapy alone. In recent years, tumor immunotherapy has shown some efficacy in the field of cancer treatment by activating the body's own immune system to fight tumors. Therefore, this trial aims to assess efficacy and safety of toripalimab combined with radiotherapy and S-1 followed by adjuvant toripalimab maintenance therapy for older patients with stage II-III esophageal cancer. The primary study endpoints are objective remission rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of remission (DOR) and safety. Secondary study endpoints are overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).
