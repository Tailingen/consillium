The Detection of Barrett's Esophagus by Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Prevents Esophageal Carcinoma in Morbid Obese After Sleeve Gastrectomy
Severe Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) leading to a chronic aggression of esophagus mucosa, called Barrett's esophagus is a main complication of Sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity. Barrett's esophagus is considered as a early stage of neoplastic transformation to adenocarcinoma. Since this last years, six european bariatric centers have adopted the policy to realize endoscopy before and five years or more after sleeve gastrectomy. Investigators worked out a database comprizing the Endoscopic features and patient characteristics. Refleeve projet aim to analyse the long term follow-up datas of 100 patients, evaluate the prevalence of Barret's esophagus and investigate the advantage of the systemetic detection to prevent esophagus adenocarcinomas.
