Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy and Transanal Endoscopic Microsurgery Versus Total Mesorectal Excision in T2-T3s N0, M0 Rectal Cancer
The standard treatment of rectal adenocarcinoma is total mesorectal excision (TME). The technique involves a low anterior rectal or colo-anal resection, very often associated with a protective stoma or abdominal-perineal resection with permanent colostomy. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) allows access to tumors up to 20 cm from the anal margin, with minimal postoperative morbidity and mortality. Recent studies of T1 rectal adenocarcinomas consider TEM to be the technique of choice. However the treatment of T2 rectal cancers remains controversial. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CT/RT) has achieved a concomitant reduction in local recurrence and an increase in survival.

Hypothesis: Patients with rectal adenocarcinoma less than 10 cm from the anal margin and up to 4 cm in size, staged after endorectal ultrasound and MRI as T2 or superficial T3 N0-M0-N0-M0, who underwent surgery after preoperative local chemoradiotherapy (TEM), achieve effective results in terms of local recurrence similar to radical surgery (TME).

OBJECTIVES:

Primary: To compare the results of local recurrence at 2 years in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and TEM and in patients treated with conventional radical surgery (TME).

Secondary: To analyse the 3-year survival results in patients treated with CT/RT.

Methodology: Multicenter clinical trial in a calculated sample of 173 patients.
