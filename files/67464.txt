Comparison of Multiparametric Prostate MRI and Ga-68 PSMA PET Imaging in Prostate Cancer Staging
In this study, it is aimed to compare the lesion location, lesion size, local and distant metastases detection rates of Ga68 PSMA PET and Multiparametric Prostate MR imaging tests used in staging in patients diagnosed with prostate cancer.

The pathologies of the patients who were decided to undergo radical prostatectomy as a treatment will also be compared with the staging tests.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Cancer Stage
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Multiparametric Prostate MRI
Lesion location, Both MRI and PET results will be compared. Lesion location will be defined as "left", "right", "apical", "basal", "midline"., Between prostate biopsy and curative treatment decision , usually 2 month|Lesion Size, Both MRI and PET results will be compared, Lesion size will be stated in milimeters., Between prostate biopsy and curative treatment decision , usually 2 month|Lymph node involvement, Both MRI and PET results will be compared. Involvement will be stated as "exist", "non-exist"., Between prostate biopsy and curative treatment decision , usually 2 month|Extraprostatic involvement, Both MRI and PET results will be compared. Involvement will be stated as "exist" , "non-exist"., Between prostate biopsy and curative treatment decision , usually 2 month|Local and distant metastasis, Both MRI and PET results will be compared. Metastasis will be stated as "exist" , "non-exist"., Between prostate biopsy and curative treatment decision , usually 2 month
