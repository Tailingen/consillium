Association Between Confocal Laser Endomicroscopic (CLE) Features and Gastric Mucosal Microbiome
There might be a correlation between gastric mucosal microbiome and mucosal pattern visualized by confocal laser endomicroscope.

OTHER: endomicroscopy, targeted biopsy and 16s rRNA gene sequencing

The diagnostic accuracy of endomicroscopy compared to pathology., 6 months
The gastric mucosal microbiome plays a pivotal role in a series of diseases, such as the H.pylori infection. We hypothesized that mucosal patterns, here visualized by confocal endomicroscopy, may constitute specific microbiome niches.
