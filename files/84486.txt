To Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of TQB3616 in Combination With Fulvestrant Versus Placebo in Combination With Fulvestrant in Previously Untreated Hormone-receptor (HR)-Positive, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer
A randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, multicenter trial design was used in this study. Subjects who meet the criteria will be randomly divided into 2:1 groups to receive TBQ3616 capsule combined with Fulvestrant injection (experimental group) or placebo capsule combined with fulvestrant (control group). A total of 428 subjects were required.
