Study of Clinical Efficacy and Safety of Tosedostat in MDS
Study WCMC IST-CTI-MDS evaluates the safety and tolerability of tosedostat in adult patients with pathologically confirmed MDS (\< 20% blasts in bone marrow, peripheral blood, or both) by World Health Organization (WHO) classification after failure of hypomethylating agent-based therapy.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: Tosedostat
Over All Survival, Survival following treatment to the date of death, assessed up to a period of 3-4 years., from start of treatment until death, assessed up to a period of 3-4 years.
Overall Response, Overall response according to IWG 2006 criteira, Approximately 3 years|One Year and Two Year Survival, from start of treatment to 1 year and 2 years post treatment initiation
This is a single-center, open label, two-arm phase II study of clinical activity of tosedostat in adult patients with MDS who have failed prior hypomethylating agent-based therapy. Arm A is defined as Revised International Prognostic Scoring Systems (IPSS-R) very low, low, and intermediate disease. Arm B is defined as IPSS-R high or very high risk disease. The two arms are separate and will enroll simultaneously. The dose of tosedostat will be 120 mg once a day continuously for each 28 day treatment cycle. Patients will be assessed for disease response, on average, every two cycles as defined in the protocol. If patient has no response as defined by the protocol after two cycles, azacitidine 75 mg/m2 SC or IV for 5 days may be combined with tosedostat, at the investigator's discretion.The primary endpoint the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tosedostat in two groups of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome who have relapsed after or are refractory or intolerant to azacitidine or decitabine. The primary endpoint for patients with IPSS-R very low, low and intermediate disease is transfusion independence and the primary endpoint for patients with high or very high risk disease is overall survival.
