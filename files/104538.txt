Study in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Pemetrexed and Carboplatin Plus or Minus Sorafenib
The majority of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with standard platinum based chemotherapy regimens ultimately develop disease progression. Active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed in this setting. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the toxicity profile and to determine the effect on progression free survival and time to progression in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with sorafenib in addition to carboplatin and pemetrexed.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: pemetrexed, carboplatin, sorafenib|DRUG: pemetrexed, carboplatin, placebo
Ph.1: Identify the recommended phase II dose of sorafenib for combination therapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed, July 2008|Ph.2: Compare the PFS of carboplatin/pemetrexed + sorafenib or carboplatin/pemetrexed + placebo in patients with stage IIIb or IV non-small cell lung cancer, May 2009
Ph.1: Determine dose limiting toxicity, July 2008|Ph 1: Determine the safety profile of the combination treatment, July 2008|Ph 1: descriptive analysis of efficacy, July 2008|Ph.2: Compare PFS of carboplatin/pemetrexed + sorafenib or carboplatin/pemetrexed + placebo in patients with stage IIIb or IV NSCLC, May 2009|Ph 2: Assess time to progression in patients treated with either regimen, May 2009|Ph 2: Determine the overall survival in patients treated with either regimen, May 2009|Ph 2: Determine the objective response rate (CR, PR), disease control rate (CR,PR,SD), time to response and duration of response, May 2009|Ph 2: Identify surrogate markers from the tumor biopsy or resection specimen from the time of diagnosis that predict response, May 2009|Ph 2: Assess Quality of Life of patients treated with either regimen, May 2009|Ph 2: Assess feasibility and toxicity profile of this regimen, May 2009
