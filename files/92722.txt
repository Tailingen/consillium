Opioid Free Anesthesia in Breast Cancer Surgery
A comparison of incidences of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) , postoperative pain severity and recovery parameters in breast cancer patients receiving opioid or opioid-free general anesthesia.
Opioid Free Anesthesia
PROCEDURE: paravertebral block|DRUG: opioid free anesthesia|PROCEDURE: sham block|PROCEDURE: opioid general anesthesia
quality of recovery, 15-item 15-item 15-item quality of recovery questionnaire, 24 hours after surgery
health related quality of life, evaluated using EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire, up to 3 months after surgery|postoperative pain, Numeric Rating Scale pain scores, pain questionnaires, up to 3 months after surgery|cancer recurrence and metastasis, diagnosed by breast cancer specialist, up to 12 months after surgery
Breast cancer is one of the most common oncologic diagnosis in women. Surgery is traditionally performed under general anesthesia with opioid-based analgesia. It is associated with higher incidences of PONV, more severe acute postoperative pain and increased incidences of chronic pain. The possibility of higher risk of metastasis has also been reported.

The purpose of our study is to compare the opioid-free general anesthesia with the opioid-based general anesthesia with respect to the quality of recovery, postoperative pain and cancer recurrence and metastasis.
