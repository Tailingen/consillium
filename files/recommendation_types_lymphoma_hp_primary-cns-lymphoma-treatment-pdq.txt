Prognosis and Prognostic Factors
Go to Patient Version
Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is lymphoma limited to
the cranial-spinal axis, including the brain, spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid (leptomeningeal space), and vitreoretinal space (ocular space), without systemic disease (stage IE).[
1
]  This disease has increasingly been seen among immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV.  Immunosuppression-related primary CNS lymphomas are almost always associated with the Epstein-Barr virus.  
Histology
Almost all primary CNS lymphomas are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of the activated B-cell nongerminal center subtype with additional pathogenic variants in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, especially MYD88 and CD79B variants.[
1
] However, patients with immunosuppression-related disease almost never have an activated B-cell phenotype.[
2
]
More than 95% of patients with primary CNS lymphoma have B-cell phenoptype. However, in a retrospective series with data collected from 12 cancer centers, the 45 patients with CNS lymphoma of T-cell phenotype showed no difference in presentation or outcome.[
3
] 
Anecdotal cases of primary CNS Hodgkin lymphoma have also been reported.[
4
]
Diagnostic Evaluation
Computed tomography (CT) scans are used to diagnose primary CNS lymphoma. These scans may show ring enhancement in 50% of patients with HIV, while homogenous enhancement is almost always seen in patients without HIV.[
5
]
Positron emission tomography (PET)–CT scans are used to exclude occult systemic disease of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. A bone marrow biopsy may be excluded with a clear PET-CT scan.[
6
] All compartments of the CNS should be evaluated, even if asymptomatic, including the vitreoretinal compartment and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) when feasible.
In one prospective case series of 282 patients with primary CNS lymphoma, 17% of patients were found to have meningeal dissemination by cytomorphology, polymerase chain reaction of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes, or meningeal enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging.[
7
] 
Prognosis and Prognostic Factors
Primary CNS lymphoma is usually aggressive, and the median overall survival in published trials generally ranges from 2 to 5 years.[
8
,
9
] However, a retrospective case series of 40 patients with low-grade primary CNS lymphoma, derived from 18 cancer centers in five countries, reported a better long-term outcome (median survival, 7 years).[
10
][
Level of evidence C3
]  
Poor prognostic factors for primary CNS lymphoma include:[
11
]
Age older than 60 years.
HIV positivity.
Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level.
Elevated CSF protein concentration.
Involvement of nonhemispheric areas of the brain (periventricular, basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum).
Intraocular disease and concomitant brain involvement.[
12
]   When tumor progression occurs, it is usually confined to the CNS
and/or the eye.[
1
]
Older age and HIV positivity are the most clinically relevant poor prognostic factors. However, the prognosis for patients with HIV-associated primary CNS lymphoma has improved with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy.[
13
] These patients are treated with the same paradigm as  patients who do not have HIV or immunosuppression.

Current Clinical Trials
Treatment Options for Primary Central Nervous System (CNS) Lymphoma 
Treatment options for primary CNS lymphoma include:
Induction therapy
.
Consolidation after induction therapy
.
Induction therapy
Trials using chemotherapy alone were justified because of the unsatisfactory results of using whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) alone [
1
,
2
] and significant neurological toxicity using high-dose methotrexate or other chemotherapeutic agents that cross the blood-brain barrier in combination with WBRT.[
3
-
5
]
Severe, delayed, neurological toxic effects were rarely seen in chemotherapy-only trials in the absence of subsequent radiation therapy. However, salvage radiation can be given for relapsed or refractory disease, sometimes at reduced dosage.[
6
,
7
]
Numerous phase I and phase II studies over two decades established the following active drugs for induction therapy or for treatment of relapsing disease. The following drugs have been used as single agents and in combinations:
High-dose methotrexate.[
8
-
13
] Outside of clinical trials, high-dose methotrexate is the most frequently used standard induction therapy.[
14
] However, it is given to inpatients, and it is too toxic for patients with a creatinine clearance under 35 cc/min or for most patients older than 75 years.
Lenalidomide with rituximab.[
15
] When high-dose chemotherapy is not feasible, this is the most frequently used combination. Lenalidomide can be initiated at low doses (e.g., 5 mg daily, 21 out of 28 days) in patients with renal insufficiency.
High-dose cytarabine.[
12
,
13
,
16
]
Rituximab.[

Thiotepa.[

Evidence (chemotherapy with or without other therapy):
The International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group evaluated three different induction combinations in 227 patients with newly diagnosed, HIV-negative primary CNS lymphoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive high-dose methotrexate (HD MTX) + high-dose cytarabine (HDA) (group 1), HD MTX + HDA + rituximab (R) (group 2), or HD MTX + HDA + R + thiotepa (the MATRix regimen) (group 3).[
26

Level of evidence A1
]
 With a median follow-up of 88 months, the overall survival (OS) rate was 21% for group 1, 37% for group 2, and 56% for group 3.
The groups were compared as follows:
Group 1 versus group 2: hazard ratio (HR), 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.41–0.99; 
P
 = .04.
Group 1 versus group 3: HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.24–0.64; 
P
 = .00005.
Group 2 versus group 3: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44–0.98; 
P
 = .04.
The OS rate favored the complete MATRix regimen in all comparisons.[

The 113 patients who attained a complete response, partial response, or stable disease were randomly assigned to 36 Gy whole-brain radiation therapy versus autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) after thiotepa + bic-chloroethylnitrosourea + carmustine (BCNU) conditioning. No significant differences were seen in 7-year progression-free survival (PFS) or OS in regard to consolidation in this phase II trial.[
26
][
Level of evidence B1

The thiotepa + BCNU conditioning regimen was well tolerated by  patients aged 60 to 70 years. It had improved tolerability compared with prior reports using the more intensive thiotepa + busulfan regimen.[

Level of evidence D
]
Patients who received the two-drug combination had a complete remission rate of 23% (interquartile range [IQR], 14%‒31%; HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28‒0.74). Patients who received the three-drug combination had a complete remission rate of 30% (IQR, 21%‒42%; HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40‒0.94). Patients who received the four-drug MATRix combination had a complete remission rate of 49% (95% CI, 38%‒60%).
The addition of rituximab and thiotepa to high-dose methotrexate plus cytarabine resulted in a significant improvement in complete response, PFS, and OS.[

In a randomized, nonblinded multicenter trial, 79 patients were assigned  to receive high-dose methotrexate with or without cytarabine.[

The 3-year PFS rate was better for patients who received the two-drug regimen (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31–0.92; 
P

There was no statistical difference in the 3-year OS rate (46% for the two-drug regimen vs. 32% for the one-drug regimen; HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.38–1.13; 
P
 = .07).
This trial was the basis for setting the combination of high-dose methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine as the control arm in the MATRix trial.
In a randomized, prospective, multicenter trial, 200 patients were assigned to receive intravenous high-dose methotrexate, carmustine, teniposide, and oral prednisone with or without rituximab.[

With a median follow-up of 32.9 months, there was no difference in the 1-year event-free survival (EFS) rate: 52% with rituximab  (95% CI, 42%−61%) and 49% without rituximab (95% CI, 39%−58%; HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.70−1.43; 
P

Several other combination induction regimens were created empirically and presented as phase II trials.[

High-dose methotrexate ± rituximab (HD MTX ± R) + other chemotherapy (retrospective analysis of 885 patients) (objective response rate, 59%; complete response, 50%).[
29
]
Summary
High-dose methotrexate regimens delivered with rituximab and other chemotherapeutic agents is used for induction therapy. The MATRix regimen described above has become one such standard based on randomized OS benefit with a four-drug regimen versus a two-drug or a three-drug regimen.[
26
][
Level of evidence 1A
] The MATRix regimen has never been compared with some of the other combination therapies mentioned above. A meta-analysis of rituximab randomized trials found improved PFS with the addition of rituximab (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45–0.95) but no difference in OS.[

Consolidation after induction chemotherapy
Consolidation therapy with or without WBRT
Evidence (consolidation therapy with or without WBRT):
In a prospective, randomized, phase II trial, 87 patients (median age, 59–66 years) had induction therapy with high-dose methotrexate + high-dose cytarabine + rituximab + procarbazine + vincristine. Afterward, 37 patients had consolidation therapy with low-dose WBRT at 23.4 Gy.[
31
]
With a median follow-up of 55 months, the 2-year intention-to-treat PFS was 78% with low-dose WBRT versus 54% without low-dose WBRT (HR, 0.51; 
P
 = .015).[
31
][
Level of evidence B1
]
Investigator-assessed neurotoxicity was less than 15% in each arm and not significantly different. Another small phase II trial that examined low-dose WBRT at 23.4 Gy also found no increased problems seen on neuropsychological testing.[
32
,
33
]
In a prospective, randomized, phase II trial of 97 newly diagnosed patients who received high-dose methotrexate combination therapy for induction, patients were randomly assigned to receive WBRT at 40 Gy versus autologous SCT.[
34
]
With a median follow-up of 8 years, deterioration of balance was significantly greater for patients who received WBRT versus patients who received autologous SCT (52% vs. 10%, 
P
 ≤ .001). Worsening neurocognition was also greater for patients who received WBRT (64% vs. 13%, 
P
 < .001).
The 8-year EFS rate was 67% for patients who received autologous SCT versus 39% for patients who received WBRT (HR, 0.13; 
P
 < .001). There was no significant difference in OS (69% for autologous SCT vs. 54% for WBRT).[
34
][
Level of evidence B1
]
The authors concluded that 40 Gy WBRT should be avoided in first-line treatment because of its neurotoxicity and inferior efficacy.
In a prospective, randomized trial of 551 immunocompetent patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma, all patients received induction chemotherapy with six cycles of high-dose methotrexate (4 g/m
2
) with or without ifosfamide.   After chemotherapy was completed, responders were randomly assigned to receive either WBRT (45 Gy) or no treatment for complete-response patients and cytarabine for partial-response patients.[
35
]
There was no statistical difference in median OS at 32.4 months for patients who received WBRT versus at 37.1 months for those who did not receive WBRT (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.80–1.40; 
P
 = .71).[
35
][
Level of evidence A1
]
Treatment-related neurotoxic effects were significantly worse in the WBRT arm. 
In a prospective, randomized trial, 410 immunocompetent patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma were scheduled to receive high-dose methotrexate. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either WBRT or no radiation therapy.[
36
]
In the intent-to-treat population, WBRT was associated with longer PFS at 15.4 months versus 9.9 months (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64–0.98; 
P
 = .034). There was no difference in OS at 32.4 months versus 36.1 months (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.26; 
P
 = .98).[
36
][
Level of evidence B1
] 
Long-term treatment-related neurotoxic effects were not reported, and the induction chemotherapy would now be considered substandard.
Summary
The significant neurotoxicity of standard-dose WBRT [
37
] has reduced its role to short-duration disease control at relapse, when the expected survival is short enough that the benefit outweighs the longer-term neurological consequences. For patients unable to undergo consolidation with autologous SCT due to age, performance status, or comorbidities, low-dose WBRT (23.4 Gy) would be a consolidation option.
Consolidation therapy with or without autologous SCT
Evidence (consolidation therapy with or without autologous SCT):
In a prospective, randomized trial published in abstract form, 346 patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma (patients aged 65 years and younger and patients aged 66–70 years with a performance status of 2 or lower) underwent induction therapy with 4 cycles of rituximab, high-dose methotrexate, high-dose cytarabine, and thiotepa (
IELSG43
 [NCT02531841]). Eighty-six patients discontinued treatment due to toxicity or progression. Of the 260 patients who completed induction therapy, 229 patients were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy consolidation with rituximab, dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin (n = 115) or autologous SCT using BCNU and thiotepa (n = 114).[
38
][
Level of evidence A1
]
With a median follow-up of 44 months, the 3-year OS rate was 86% (78%–91%) for autologous SCT versus 71% (61%–78%) for chemotherapy alone (HR, 0.47; 
P
 = .01).[
38
][
Level of evidence A1
]
The 3-year PFS rate was 79% (71%–86%) for autologous SCT versus 53% (43%–62%) for chemotherapy alone.
There was no negative effect on neurocognitive function in either arm in the absence of progression.
This was the first randomized trial establishing a survival advantage for newly diagnosed patients receiving autologous SCT who are young enough and healthy enough to endure this aggressive approach.
In a prospective, randomized, phase II trial, 97 newly diagnosed patients receiving high-dose methotrexate combination therapy for induction  were randomly assigned to receive WBRT at 40 Gy or autologous SCT.[
34
]
With a median follow-up of 8 years, deterioration of balance was significantly greater for patients who received WBRT than for patients who received autologous SCT (52% vs. 10%, 
P
 ≤ .001). Worsening neurocognition was also greater for patients who received WBRT (64% vs. 13%, 
P
 < .001).
The 8-year EFS rate was 67% for patients who received autologous SCT versus 39% for patients who received WBRT (HR, 0.13; 
P
 < .001). There was no difference in OS (69% for autologous SCT vs. 65% for WBRT).[
34
][
Level of evidence B1
]
The authors concluded that 40 Gy WBRT should be avoided in first-line treatment because of its neurotoxicity and inferior efficacy.
A prospective, randomized, phase II trial included newly diagnosed patients aged 75 years and younger. Patients received intensive induction therapy with high-dose methotrexate at 8 g/m
2
 every 2 weeks, temozolomide, rituximab, and high-dose cytarabine. Patients were randomly assigned at the start of therapy to consolidation with thiotepa + BCNU conditioning with autologous SCT or nonmyeloablative therapy with high-dose cytarabine with a 46-hour infusion of etoposide (EA).[
39
]
With a median follow-up of 3.8 years, the median PFS was 6 years (95% CI, 3.9–not reached [NR]) for autologous SCT versus 2.4 years (95% CI, 0.6–NR) for EA (
P
 = .02).[
39
][
Level of evidence B1
]
PFS from the time of consolidation was not statistically different (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.25–1.36; 
P
 = .21).
There was no statistically significant difference in the 3-year OS rate: 83% (69%–91%) for autologous SCT and 72% (57%–82%) for EA.
This trial showed the limitations of induction therapy, which affected the impact of consolidation therapy.
Several phase II studies evaluated consolidation with intensive chemotherapy supported by autologous SCT.[

] This approach is appropriate for patients aged 80 years and under with few comorbidities, good performance status, and an adequate response to induction therapy.
Summary
Consolidation therapy with autologous SCT results in an OS advantage for newly diagnosed patients with good performance status, few comorbidities, and an adequate response to induction therapy (in this case, the MATRix regimen: high-dose methotrexate, high-dose cytarabine, rituximab, and temozolomide).[
39
] For patients unable to proceed to autologous SCT, consolidation with low-dose WBRT (32.4 Gy) or nonmyeloablative therapy might be considered.

Treatment Options for Recurrent Primary Central Nervous System (CNS) Lymphoma
The prognosis for patients with recurrent CNS lymphoma is poor, with a median survival of 6 to 12 months, but up to 43 to 50 months if autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) consolidation is performed (if not applied previously).[
1
] This finding implies that deferred autologous SCT until first relapse may still result in longer-term survival. The prognosis is worse for patients 60 years and older, who account for more than 50% of cases.[
2
]
Treatment options for recurrent primary CNS lymphoma include:
Reinduction therapy followed by SCT
.
Reinduction therapy followed by SCT
Patients with recurrence after high-dose methotrexate-based combination chemotherapy may try autologous SCT consolidation after reinduction of remission with single-agent or combination therapy from the following options:[
3
]
Rituximab + lenalidomide.[
4
]
Rituximab + lenalidomide + ibrutinib.[
5
]
Rituximab.[
6
]
Ibrutinib.[
7
]
Temozolomide.
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells.
DA-TEDDI-R: temozolomide, etoposide, liposomal doxorubicin, dexamethasone, ibrutinib, and rituximab  (under clinical evaluation).
Patients deemed ineligible for transplant can receive palliative care with these agents.
Evidence (reinduction therapy):
A phase I/II clinical trial evaluated CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy using tisagenlecleucel in patients with relapsed primary CNS lymphoma.[
8
][
Level of evidence C3
]
One-half of the patients (6 of 12) had a complete response.
Three patients maintained a complete response at 9 months, 12 months, and 23 months at the time of data cutoff. 
Five patients had low-grade immune cell–assisted neurotoxicity.
One patient had grade 3 neurotoxicity. 
CAR T-cell therapy provides an option for patients with relapsed primary CNS lymphoma.[
8
]
The DA-TEDDI-R regimen incorporates temozolomide, etoposide, liposomal doxorubicin, dexamethasone, ibrutinib, and rituximab.[
7
][
Level of evidence C3
] 
Among 18 patients who received this regimen (five previously untreated), the complete remission rate was 86%, but high rates (39%) of invasive aspergillosis were reported. 
Further studies of this regimen are under way (
NCT03964090
 and 
NCT02203526
). Dexamethasone should be avoided with ibrutinib single agent or combination therapy due to the risk of serious fungal infections. This approach requires access to intravenous antifungal agents not available outside of a clinical trial. By eliminating dexamethasone and ibrutinib, the other drugs may be used together with less risk of fungal infections.
In a phase II study, patients with relapsed or refractory primary CNS lymphoma  were treated with rituximab plus lenalidomide.[

][
Level of evidence C3
]
An overall response rate of 36% was reported.

Treatment of Intraocular Lymphoma


In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Retrospective reviews of selected patients with primary intraocular lymphoma and no evidence of disseminated central nervous system (CNS) disease showed that localized therapy with intraocular methotrexate or ocular radiation therapy or systemic therapy with rituximab were effective in clearing lymphoma cells from the eye. However,  most patients had subsequent CNS relapse.[

][
Level of evidence C3
] Anecdotal series reported lower relapse rates when high-dose methotrexate was added, but prospective multicenter trials with even retrospective controls do not exist.[

][
Level of evidence D
] 
Relapsing disease in the rest of the CNS is treated with the same options listed for primary CNS lymphoma in the brain. In   a phase III randomized study of whole-brain radiation therapy, patients with intraocular disease and concomitant brain involvement had a worse prognosis than those with brain involvement alone (19 patients with both, 391 patients with brain involvement only).[
