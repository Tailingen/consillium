This is an Early Study to Investigate the Effect of Gimatecan速 in Adults With Malignant Glioma.
Gimatecan速 is Sigma-Tau Research's new, potent, oral Topoisomerase I inhibitor. Drugs in this class play a crucial role in destroying DNA replication in tumors. We are conducting this study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of our compound. In addition, we plan to assess the drug's ability to affect the evolution of malignant gliomas, when given as a capsule, rather than by intravenous injection.
