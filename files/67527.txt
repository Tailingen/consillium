A Clinical Trial of TQB2102 for Injection in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With HER2 Gene Abnormality
TQB2102 is an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of a humanised antibody against Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), a enzyme-cleavable linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, which combine the ability of antibodies to specifically target tumour cells with the highly potent killing activity of drugs with payloads too toxic for systemic administration. This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy,and safety of TQB2102 for injection in locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with HER2 gene abnormality.
