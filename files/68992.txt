Imatinib Mesylate and Hydroxyurea in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Meningioma
RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as hydroxyurea, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving imatinib mesylate together with hydroxyurea may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving imatinib mesylate together with hydroxyurea works in treating patients with recurrent or progressive meningioma.
Glioblastoma|Gliosarcoma
DRUG: hydroxyurea|DRUG: imatinib mesylate
Progression-free Survival at 6 Months, Percentage of participants surviving six months from the start of study treatment without progression of disease. PFS was defined as the time from the date of study treatment initiation to the date of the first documented progression according to the Macdonald criteria, or death due to any cause., From the date of study treatment initiation to the date of the first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 69 months. For each participant, PFS was assessed at 6 months after treatment initiation.
Median Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time in months from the start of study treatment to the date of first progression according to Macdonald criteria, or to death due to any cause. Patients alive who had not progressed as of the last follow-up had PFS censored at the last follow-up date. Median PFS was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve., From the date of study treatment initiation to the date of the first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 69 months.|Median Overall Survival (OS), Time in months from the start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause. Patients alive at last follow-up are censored as of that follow-up date. Median OS was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve., From the date of study treatment initiation to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 69 months.|Objective Response Rate, Percentage of participants with an objective response (complete response or partial response). Per modified Macdonald criteria and assessed by MRI, complete response (CR) was the disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) was a â‰¥50% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. Objective response = CR+PR., 69 Months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the activity of imatinib mesylate and hydroxyurea, as measured by 6-month progression-free survival, in patients with recurrent or progressive meningioma.

Secondary

* Evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS)
* Overall survival (OS),
* Objective response rate among patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily and oral hydroxyurea twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21 patients will be accrued for this study.
