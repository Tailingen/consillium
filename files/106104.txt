A Safety and Tolerability Study of Peginesatide in Anemic Cancer Patients Receiving Cytotoxic Chemotherapy.
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of peginesatide used to treat anemia in subjects diagnosed with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer or prostate cancer and who also receiving a taxane chemotherapy.
Anemia
DRUG: Peginesatide
Maximum tolerated dose., End of Treatment.
Proportion of subjects who have 2 consecutive Hgb values of either an increase of ≥1 g/dL or a Hgb ≥11 g/dL in the absence of a red blood cell transfusion., At All Visits for every cycle.|Proportion of subjects who have an increase in Hgb of ≥1 g/dL or a Hgb ≥11 g/dL in the absence of a red blood cell transfusion., Days 22 and 43 for every cycle.|Proportion of subjects with 2 consecutive Hgb values increase of ≥1 g/dL or ≥11 g/dL during the Treatment phase absent of red blood cell transfusion within the prior 28 days and without excursion of Hgb values above 12 g/dL for ≥2 consecutive weeks., Within the prior 28 days of every cycle for a minimum of 2 consecutive weeks.|Proportion of subjects who received at least 1 RBC transfusion., From Day 29 to End of Treatment for every cycle.|Change from Baseline in Hemoglobin., At Each Visit for every cycle.|Duration of maintaining Hgb values within the range of 10.5 g/dL and 12.0 g/dL., At Each Visit for every cycle.|Pharmacokinetics of Peginesatide (PK Cohort Only)., At Each Visit for every cycle.|Adverse events and serious adverse events., At All Visits for every cycle.|Physical examination (including weight, vital signs, and oral temperature)., At All Visits for every cycle.|Clinical Laboratory Tests and Electrocardiograms., At All Visits for every cycle.|Electrocardiograms., At Final Visit for every cycle.|Signs and symptoms for thromboembolytic events., At All Visits for every cycle.|Proportion of subjects who have incidence of Hgb values >12 g/dL., At All Visits for every cycle.|Proportion of subjects who have Hgb increases by more than 1 g/dL in a 2-week period., At All Visits for every cycle.|Tumor progression., Every 2 cycles of chemotherapy.
Currently approved erythropoiesis stimulating agents have been used successfully to increase hemoglobin levels, reduce fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms, improve daily function, and alleviate the need for transfusions of red blood cells in subjects with chronic kidney disease-related anemia or in cancer subjects with chemotherapy-induced anemia.

Peginesatide (hematide) Injection is a parenteral formulation for administration by intravenous or subcutaneous injection that is being developed for the correction of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis, and for the treatment of patients with anemia due to concomitantly administered chemotherapy.

This is a multicenter, open-label dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple doses of peginesatide Injection in subjects with refractory non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. These subjects must have anemia diagnosed as a result of taxane chemotherapy.
