Hypofractionated Image Guided Proton Therapy for Low andIntermediate Risk Prostate Cancer
This study is being proposed to evaluate the use of moderate hypofractionated proton therapy in low and intermediate risk prostate cancer patients. Quality of life outcomes as well as gastrointestinal and genitourinary early and late toxicities will be analyzed and compared to conventional proton therapy regimens. It is thought that this regimen will produce comparable findings and would result in substantial health care cost savings, as well as, be more convenient for patients.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Hypofractionated Proton Therapy
Time to biochemical failure, To determine the freedom from biochemical failure survival outcomes (FFBF) and compare to historical FFBF results achieved following standard fractionation proton therapy, 5 years
Toxicity Assessment, To determine the incidence of acute and late Gastrointestinal and Genitourinary toxicity at 2 and 5 years., 2 years & 5 years|Analyze Quality of Life, To assess quality of life following proton therapy (QOL EPIC) at 2 and 5 years, 2 years & 5 years
Salvage Androgen Deprivation Therapy, To determine the need for salvage Androgen Deprivation Therapy for biochemical or other relapse events, Every 6 months for 5 years
Patients will receive: 62 Gy (RBE) in 20 fractions of 3.1 Gy (RBE) over 4 weeks
