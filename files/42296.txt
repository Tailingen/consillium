Preoperative Prediction Model of Pathological Outcomes (Mesorectum Quality and Positive Circumferential Resection Margin) in Patients With Mid-low Rectal Cancer
Elaboration of a preoperative prediction model of the quality of the mesorectum and the involvement of the circumferential margin in patients with mid-low rectal cancer who undergo laparoscopic anterior rectal resection.

In a second phase the investigators will study the utility of the prediction model in classifying patients with high risk of suboptimal quality of mesorectum and/or positive circumferential margin. Patients with high preoperative risk will undergo a transanal total mesorectal excision and patients with low risk a laparoscopic transabdominal mesorectal excision. The investigators finally will compare pathological outcomes ( quality of mesorectum and circumferential margin), survival and recurrence between the two groups.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Transanal total mesorectal excision of rectal cancer
Evaluation of the quality of mesorectum in the rectal specimen according to international consensus (goog quality, moderate quality and poor quality), Evaluation of the quality of mesorectum as optimal or suboptimal (international consensus defines three grades of resection:

Group 1: including mesorectal resection, good quality Group 2: intramesorectal resection: moderate quality Group 3: resection in the muscularis propria, poor quality).

Investigators will group patients into two groups: optimal mesorectum (group 1) and suboptimal mesorectum (group 2-3)., 30 days|Evaluation of the circumferential margin status in the rectal specimen according international consensus (positive margin if tumor ≤ 1mm from circumferential margin), Evaluation of the circumferential margin status (positive or negative) in the rectal specimen according international consensus (positive margin if tumor ≤ 1mm from circumferential margin), 30 days
Recurrence, Rate of tumor recurrence, 2 years|Survival, Rate of survival, 2 years
