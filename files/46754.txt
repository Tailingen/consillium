OKN-007 in Combination With Adjuvant Temozolomide Chemoradiotherapy for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
This is a pilot study exploring the potential benefit of adding OKN-007 with Temozolomide for treatment in patients with malignant Glioblastoma undergoing adjuvant concomitant radiotherapy. This drug combination is expected to have an anti-cancer effect in patients who have experienced disease progression after first line treatment.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: OKN 007|DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Photon/Proton IMRT
The maximum tolerated dose and the type of dose limiting toxicities, To determine how well patients are able to tolerate combination of OKN-007, temozolomide, and radiotherapy. Adverse events will be tabulated using MedDRA. The severity of the AE will be graded by the Investigator using the NCI CTCAE, version 4.03., 5 years
Number of participants who experience progression-free survival, To evaluate the proportion of patients who receive combination OKN-007 and TMZ who do not experience progression, 5 years|Number of participants who comply with study treatment plan, To evaluate the clinical compliance of participants receiving combination OKN-007 and TMZ, 5 years|Number of participants who are able to receive a reduction in steroid dose, To evaluate whether study drug combination allows for a reduced steroid dosage, 5 years|Number of participants who experience overall survival, To evaluate the proportion of patients who receive combination OKN-007 and TMZ who experience overall survival, 5 years
