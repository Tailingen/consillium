Endovascular Brachytherapy Combined With Stent Placement and TACE for HCC With Main Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus
It is a prospective and multi-center clinical research in China to compare the efficacy, safety and related impact factors between TACE alone and endovascular brachytherapy combined with stent placement and TACE for HCC with main portal vein tumor thrombus.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Portal Vein Tumor Thrombus
PROCEDURE: Stent and Iodine-125 seed strand implantation|DEVICE: Stent|DEVICE: Iodine-125 seed|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Ultra-fluid lipiodol|OTHER: Gelatin sponge articles
Overall Survival, From the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 24 months
Time To Progression, Time to progression follow-up is done at three months interval after lesions defined as stable with treatment of TACE or combined therapy six months after enrollment until lesions are defined as disease progression., From the date of first procedure of TACE or combined therapy until the time when the disease progresses from an intermediate to an advanced stage as defined by specific events, assessed up to 24 months
It is an open random prospective phase III clinical trial conducted by Principal Investigator Professor Zhi-ping Yan.Investigators in twenty-seven hospitals in China participate in.Patients with unresectable HCC with main portal vein tumor thrombus are enrolled. The investigators propose to recruitment 253 patients who are randomly assigned into the combined group (treated with endovascular brachytherapy combined with stent placement and TACE) and the control group (treated with TACE alone).There are 127 patients in combined group and 126 patients in control group. The criteria of inclusion and exclusion, and the methods of lab tests, imaging modality and treatment procedures are the same.
