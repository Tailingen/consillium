This is a two-arm, randomized, double-blind and double-dummy, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of vigabatrin versus rapamycin as a preventive treatment in infants with TSC. The study consists of 3 phases for each patient: screening, core blinded phase, and open-label follow-up phase. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive vigabatrin or rapamycin. The randomization ratio is 1:1. Randomization will be stratified by the sex and the presence of epileptiform activity on baseline videoEEG (video electroencephalography) recording (yes versus no). Approximately 60 infants are planned to be enrolled in the study.
