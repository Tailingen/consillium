Part 1: Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs), Number of participants with DLTs will be reported. The DLTs are adverse events including certain high grade non-hematologic or hematologic toxicities, or toxicities meeting other specific criteria., Up to first 21 days after first dose|Part 1 and Part 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered an investigational or non-investigational product and it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational product. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0 with the exception of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome events (ICANS), which will be graded by American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) guidelines. Severity scale ranges from grade 1 (mild) to grade 5 (death). Grade 1= mild, Grade 2= moderate, Grade 3= severe, Grade 4= life-threatening and Grade 5= death related to adverse event., Up to 2 years 9 months
Part 1 and Part 2: Serum Concentration of JNJ-87890387, Serum concentration of JNJ-87890387 will be reported., Up to 2 years 9 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of JNJ-87890387, Cmax is defined as maximum observed serum concentration of JNJ-87890387., Up to 2 years 9 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Time to Reach Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Tmax) of JNJ-87890387, Tmax is defined as the time to reach maximum observed serum concentration of JNJ-87890387., Up to 2 years 9 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Area Under the Curve from Time t1 to Time t2 (AUC[t1-t2]) of JNJ-87890387, AUC(t1-t2) is defined as area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time t1 to time t2 of JNJ-87890387., Up to 2 years 9 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Area Under the Curve from Time Zero to Time tau (AUC[0-tau]) of JNJ-87890387, AUC(0-tau) is defined as area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time 0 to time tau of JNJ-87890387., Up to 2 years 9 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Minimum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmin) of JNJ-87890387, Cmin is defined as the minimum observed serum concentration of JNJ-87890387., Up to 2 years 9 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Accumulation Ratio of JNJ-87890387, Accumulation ratio of JNJ-87890387 will be reported. The R is the accumulation ratio calculated as Cmax or AUC after multiple doses divided by Cmax or AUC after the first dose, respectively., Up to 2 years 9 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Number of Participants with Presence of Anti-JNJ-87890387 Antibodies, Number of participants with presence of anti-JNJ-87890387 antibodies will be reported., Up to 2 years 9 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best response of complete response or partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) maintained for at least 4 weeks., Up to 2 years 9 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the duration from the date of initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of disease progression according to RECIST v. 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years 9 months
Part 1 and Part 2: Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined for the responders as the time from the date of the first dose of JNJ-87890387 to the date of the first documented response., Up to 2 years 9 months|Part 1 and Part 2: Cancer Antigen (CA) 125 Response Rate, CA 125 response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with ovarian cancer who achieved a partial response or complete response according to the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) response criteria for CA 125, maintained for at least 4 weeks. A CA 125 response is defined as at least 50 percentage (%) reduction in CA 125 levels from a pretreatment sample which must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days., Up to 2 years 9 months
The purpose of this study is to determine recommended phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) of JNJ-87890387 and to determine the safety of JNJ-87890387 at the RP2D(s).
