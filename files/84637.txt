Trastuzumab or Lapatinib Ditosylate in Treating Women With Early Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether trastuzumab or lapatinib ditosylate is more effective in treating women with early breast cancer.

Update June 2013:

Since the initial development of EPHOS-B in 2007 more evidence in relation to safety and efficacy of anti-HER2 therapies are now available, and in particular, a growing body of evidence that combinations of two anti-HER2 therapies are more effective than monotherapies. Therefore this study has been amended (PART 2) to a 1:1:2 ratio to control, perioperative trastuzumab or the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying trastuzumab to see how well it works compared with lapatinib ditosylate (and in since June 2013 - compared with a combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab) in treating women with early breast cancer.

Increase in apoptosis, by change in the tumor (morphological apoptosis and activated caspase 3) measured at diagnosis and at surgery (biological phase), 10-13 days|Fall in proliferation between diagnosis and surgery by change in proliferation measured by Ki67 immunohistochemical assessment (%) at diagnosis and at surgery (biological phase), 10-13 days|Relapse-free survival (clinical phase), TBC
Changes in the angiogenic serum markers VEGF-A, VEGF R1, and CD105, measured at diagnosis, surgery (plus also tumor CD31) and 28-30 days post surgery (biological phase), TBC|Pre-treatment and/or surgical expression of molecular markers (EGFR, Her-3, IGF1R, c-myc, AKT, p-ERK, pS6 inase, activated src, or truncated p95HER-2 expression), TBC|Time to local recurrence (clinical phase), TBC|Time to distant recurrence (clinical phase), TBC|Overall survival (clinical phase), TBC
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine whether pre-operative treatment of HER-2 positive breast cancer patients with anti-HER2 therapy consisting of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) vs lapatinib ditosylate inhibits proliferation or increases apoptosis.
* To compare the effects of trastuzumab (Herceptin®), lapatinib ditosylate and the combination of lapatinib ditosylate and trastuzumab (Herceptin®) on the inhibition of proliferation or increase of apoptosis

Secondary

* To determine whether pre-operative anti-HER2 treatment reduces serum angiogenic factors.
* To identify molecular predictors of biological response to anti-HER2 therapy

OUTLINE:

This is a multicenter study.Patients are stratified according to center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

PART 1: From Protocol versions 1 to 4:

* Arm I (control): Patients receive no neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Approximately 14 days after randomization, patients undergo either breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy.
* Arm II (trastuzumab \[Herceptin®\]): Patients receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Approximately 11 days after beginning of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo either breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy, and receive adjuvant trastuzumab on day 15.
* Arm III (lapatinib ditosylate): Patients receive neoadjuvant oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-11. Within 24 hours after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo either breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy, and receive adjuvant lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 12-28.

Patients also receive standard adjuvant systemic therapy, including endocrine therapy (for hormone-sensitive disease) and/or chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

PART 2: From Protocol Version 5 (June 2013)

* Arm I (control): Patients receive no neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Approximately 14 days after randomization, patients undergo either breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy.
* Arm II (trastuzumab \[Herceptin®\]): Patients receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Approximately 11 days after beginning of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo either breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy, and receive adjuvant trastuzumab on day 15.
* Arm III (lapatinib ditosylate and (trastuzumab \[Herceptin®\] combination): Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-11. Within 24 hours after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients undergo either breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy, and receive adjuvant lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 12-28. Patients also receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and receive adjuvant trastuzumab on day 15.

PART 1 and 2:

Patients also receive standard adjuvant systemic therapy, including endocrine therapy (for hormone-sensitive disease) and/or chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

All patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection periodically for biomarker research studies comprising biomarkers of proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 10 years.
