Epigenetic Reprogramming in Relapse AML
Successful treatment for children and young adults with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continues to be a significant challenge. Despite relative improvements in survival for patients with newly diagnosed AML, an estimated 40-60% will relapse with the majority eventually dying of their relapsed disease. Attaining a subsequent remission in patients who relapse is the initial critical step toward achieving a potential cure. As chemotherapy resistance is one of the primary drivers of poor treatment response and subsequent relapse in AML, identifying methods to reverse this resistance are desperately needed. This clinical trial is aimed at improving the remission re-Induction rates for children and adults with relapsed or refractory AML through epigenetic modifying agents that have the ability to reverse chemotherapy resistance. Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), are two epigenetic modifying drugs that act on the methylation of proximal promoter regions of genes and on proteins involved in the wrapping of DNA around histones, respectively. Both processes play a critical role in regulating gene expression, and frequently these genes are involved in chemotherapy resistance. These agents are FDA-approved for treatment in adult hematologic malignancies, making this an opportune time to begin testing these novel therapies in pediatric leukemia trials. This study will investigate chemotherapy priming of relapsed/refractory AML using Decitabine and Vorinostat given for 5 days prior to standard re-Induction with Fludarabine, Cytarabine and G-CSF for children and adults.
Leukemia, Acute Myeloid
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Vorinostat|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Filgrastim|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Sorafenib
Achievement of Complete Remission by Bone Marrow Criteria, Complete Remission (CR): Attainment of M1 bone marrow with no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and with recovery of peripheral counts (ANC \> 750/µL and PLT count \> 75,000/µL). Qualifying marrow and peripheral counts should be performed within 1 week of each other. M1 Marrow: Less than 5% blasts in a bone marrow aspirate and at least 200 cells counted, 60 days
Phase 1 Study Number of Patients: 12 to 24 evaluable subjects will be required to enroll subjects in all 4 dose levels.

Study Objectives:

Primary Objectives

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of decitabine when used in this combination with vorinostat, fludarabine, high dose cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG) for children and young adults with relapsed or refractory AML.
* To evaluate the ability to safely deliver the combination of decitabine and vorinostat followed by fludarabine, high dose cytarabine and G-CSF (FLAG) in pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

Secondary Objectives o To establish the extent of hypomethylation of peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) pre- and post- decitabine and vorinostat treatment by: LINE-1 methylation assay as a surrogate marker of global DNA methylation. Direct Comprehensive DNA methylation analysis Gene expression profiling to assess genetic changes

* To analyze the correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression pre- and post-treatment with decitabine and vorinostat.
* To analyze the correlation between biological changes and clinical response

Selection of Study Patients:

• Study entry is open to patients regardless of gender or ethnic background. While there will be every effort to seek out and include females and minority patients, the patient population is expected to be no different than that of other acute leukemia studies at the Medical College of Wisconsin.
