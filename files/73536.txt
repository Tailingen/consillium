Androgen Deprivation Therapy +/- Radium-223 Dichloride in Metastatic Prostate Cancer With Bone Metastases
Newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer subjects with bone metastases will be accrued to this stratified randomized 2-arm Phase II trial. Subjects will be randomized 1:2 to ADT or ADT with Radium-223 dichloride respectively.

A single numeric score (0, 1, 2 or 3) will be assigned based on the 3-step WHO pain ladder., From baseline until 30 days after the last treatment, assessed for a maximum of 24 months
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center, randomized trial.

STRATIFICATION FACTORS:

Subjects will be stratified based on serum total alkaline phosphatase at baseline and extent of disease (described below). Randomization will occur within stratification group.

* Extent of Disease: \<6 skeletal metastases with no visceral metastases versus ≥6 skeletal metastases or visceral metastases.
* Serum total alkaline phosphatase at baseline: normal vs abnormal. Abnormal alkaline phosphatase is defined as \> 130 IU/L.

Early Induction or Late Induction status will not be a stratification criterion.

TREATMENT SCHEDULE: CONTROL ARM A

All subjects will receive androgen deprivation therapy with a LHRH agonist (any LHRH agonist such as leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate is acceptable) or a LHRH antagonist (degarelix) or bilateral orchiectomy, with dosage determined by the treating physician. Route of administration and cycle days will be administered as per package insert. Androgen deprivation therapy with LHRH agonist or LHRH antagonist will be given continuously.

All subjects will receive bicalutamide, 50 mg Oral (PO) Daily

TREATMENT SCHEDULE: EXPERIMENTAL ARM B

All subjects will receive androgen deprivation therapy with a LHRH agonist (any LHRH agonist such as leuprolide acetate or goserelin acetate is acceptable) or a LHRH antagonist (degarelix) or bilateral orchiectomy, with dosage determined by the treating physician. Route of administration and cycle days will be administered as per package insert. Androgen deprivation therapy with LHRH agonist or LHRH antagonist will be given continuously.

All subjects will receive bicalutamide, 50 mg oral (PO) daily

All subjects will receive Radium-223 dichloride, 50 kBq (1.35 microcurie) per kg body weight, intravenous (IV bolus) every 28 days for 6 injections
