A Study of Epirubicin With Estramustine Phosphate and Celecoxib for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out the effect of epirubicin with estramustine phosphate and celecoxib on PSA and objective response in patients with hormone resistant prostate cancer as well as evaluating the toxicity, quality of life of this combination. Celecoxib is an FDA approved drug to treat arthritis. Epirubicin, alone or with estramustine phosphate has been used in the treatment of hormone resistant prostate cancer. These drugs have demonstrated evidences of tumor blood vessel suppression and combination of these three drugs could possibly arrest further tumor growth or even make the tumor decrease in size.
