To evaluate the combination of PF-04856884 (CVX-060) in combination with Axitinib (AG-013736) in patients that have received one prior systemic regimen for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) vs. axitinib alone.

Number of Participants With Non-serious Adverse Events (AEs) in Part I (Reported in ≥2 of the Participants Overall)., Incidence and severity of all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) of both all-causality and treatment-related by preferred term (PT) categorized according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades reported in ≥2 participants overall (CTCAE Grades 3, 4 and 5, combined) for any PT are presented. Participants who are included under all-causality TEAE PT are coded as NA if they appear for the same PT under treatment-related TEAE below.

Participants in Part I received PF-04856884 15 mg/kg/week and AG-013736 5 mg twice daily. Following the decision on 06 November 2012 not to continue with Part II of the study, any participant remaining in Part I continued to receive PF-04856884 at a reduced dose of 10 mg/kg/week in combination with AG-013736 (5 mg twice a week) or AG-013736 alone (5 mg twice a week)., 4 months|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in Part I, Incidence and severity of all-causality serious adverse events (SAEs) are presented by PT categorized according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades. Participants in Part I received PF-04856884 15 mg/kg/week and AG-013736 5 mg twice daily. Following the decision on 06 November 2012 not to continue with Part II of the study, any participant remaining in Part I continued to receive PF-04856884 at a reduced dose of 10 mg/kg/week in combination with AG-013736 (5 mg twice a week) or AG-013736 alone (5 mg twice a week). Participants with treatment-related TEAE are coded as NA if they appear for the same preferred term under all-causality TEAE., 4 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Adult Participants With Previously Treated Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer (mRCC) in Part II, PFS is defined as the time (in days) from date of randomization to first documentation of investigator assessed tumor progression or death, whichever comes first. Progression free survival was to be calculated as (first event date - the date of randomization +1)., 3 years
Number of Participants With Non-serious AEs and SAEs, Incidence and severity of all-causality AEs and SAEs to be presented by PT categorized according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades. Participants in Part I received PF-04856884 15 mg/kg/week and AG-013736 5 mg twice daily. Following the decision on 06 November 2012 not to continue with Part II of the study, any participant remaining in Part I continued to receive PF-04856884 at a reduced dose of 10 mg/kg/week in combination with AG-013736 (5 mg twice a week) or AG-013736 alone (5 mg twice a week)., 3 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) in Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer (mRCC) Patients Treated With PF-04856884 in Combination With AG-013736 vs. AG-013736 Alone., ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), relative to all randomized participants as defined in the FA Set. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study ≥ 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. Participants who do not have on-study radiographic tumor evaluation or who die, progress, or drop out for any reason prior to reaching a CR or PR will be counted as non-responders (NR) in the assessment of ORR., 4 months|Duration of Response (DR) in Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer (mRCC) Patients Treated With PF-04856884 in Combination With AG-013736 vs. AG-013736 Alone, DR is defined as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that is subsequently confirmed to the first documentation of tumor progression or to death due to cancer. Duration of tumor response was to be calculated as (the end date for DR - first CR or PR that is subsequently confirmed +1)., 3 years|Tmax (Time When Maximum Serum PF-04856884 Concentration Was Reached), Pharmacokinetic parameter, Tmax (Time when maximum serum PF-04856884 concentration was reached) was done using non-compartmental methods., Pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 192, 360, 361, 362, 365, 367 hours post dose and end of treatment|Cmax (Observed Peak Serum PF-04856884 Concentration), Pharmacokinetic parameter Cmax (observed peak PF-04856884 serum concentration) was estimated using noncompartmental methods., Pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 192, 360, 361, 362, 365, 367 hours post dose and end of treatment|Cmin (Trough PF-04856884 Serum Concentration), Pharmacokinetic parameter Cmin (trough PF-04856884 serum concentration) was estimated using noncompartmental methods., Pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 192, 360, 361, 362, 365, 367 hours post dose and end of treatment|Number of Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) Samples Confirmed Positive, Detection of neutralizing anti-PF-04856884 antibodies was based on the ability of anti-PF-04856884 neutralizing antibodies to bind to Tag-PF-04856884., 0 and 360 hours post dose and end of study|Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Adult Participants With Previously Treated Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer (mRCC) as Measured by an Independent Radiological Assessment, PFS is defined as the time (in days) from date of randomization to first documentation of investigator assessed tumor progression or death, whichever comes first. PFS was to be calculated as (first event date - the date of randomization +1)., 3 years|Overall Survival (OS) at 2 Years, OS is defined as the time from the first dose date to date of death. For participants not expiring, their survival times will be censored at the last date they are known to be alive, or 2 year whichever is earlier. The 2-year OS rate will be estimated from a time-to event analysis of OS., 5 years
The study was prematurely discontinued on 06Nov2012 due to tolerability findings in patients treated in Part I of the study that have prompted the Sponsor to re-evaluate the strategic development of the program. An unexpected frequency of arterial thrombotic events (ATEs) and venous thrombotic events (VTEs) were reported in patients treated in Part I.
