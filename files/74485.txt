WCC# 59 Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy Utilizing Carboplatin in First Recurrence Ovarian Cancer
This is an open-label, pilot study in patients with a diagnosis of recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma who have undergone standard cytoreductive surgery following by adjuvant chemotherapy. It is expected that this first surgery was optimal - as defined as no residual tumor \> or = 1 centimeter. Patient has clinical evidence of a first recurrence. The patient undergoes surgery and isotonic normal saline (perfusate) heated and administered into the abdomen, followed by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy infusion (HIPC) administering carboplatin (chemotherapy). Six weeks after surgery patients will receive adjuvant chemotherapy with Paclitaxel and Carboplatin for 6 cycles.

DRUG: Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with Carboplatin|OTHER: Isotonic saline (perfusate)|PROCEDURE: Surgery|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Clinical Response, We will summarize clinical response as the proportion of patients with complete response. Complete response will be defined as normalization of CA125. - After 6 cycles of Second Line Adjuvant Chemotherapy., After 6 cycles of Paclitaxel & Carboplatin (Week 21 up to 27)|Feasibility of HIPC in Recurrent Disease Setting, We will determine feasibility based on the proportion of patients who complete 6 prescribed cycles of second line chemotherapy after undergoing the HIPC procedure., 6 months
Quality of Life Measurements, The quality of life measurements (version 4 of the FACT-O questionnaire) will be summed over each subscale and overall and comparisons will be made using t-tests at distinct visits., Baseline, 6 Weeks Post Surgery, Every 3 Weeks Up to Week 27|Progression-free Survival, Disease progression will be defined as time from surgery to first of either an increase in CA125 from post-treatment value (to a value greater than 100 or doubling of nadir CA125 levels) or new/increasing measurable disease by CT scan as defined by RECIST criteria, (secondary recurrence) or censored at date of last contact for patients still alive and who have no progressed or recurred (from date of surgery to disease progression)., Up to 5 Years (intended)|Overall Survival, Overall survival will be defined as time from date of surgery to date of death or censored at the date of last documented contact for patients still alive., Up to 5 Years
OBJECTIVES

* The primary objectives are

  * to determine the clinical response of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPC) in patients at the time of first clinical recurrence of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma
  * to determine the feasibility of delivering HIPC in a recurrent setting.
* Secondary objectives are

  * to determine disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS),
  * to determine treatment related changes in quality of life (QOL)
  * to monitor the toxicities and complications associated with HIPC.
