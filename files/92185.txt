Ponatinib in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) (EPIC)
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of ponatinib and imatinib in patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: ponatinib|DRUG: imatinib (Gleevec/ Glivec)
Major Molecular Response (MMR) Rate at 12 Months, A ratio of reverse transcribed transcript of BCR-ABL to ABL â‰¤ 0.1% on the international scale, measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction., 12 months after first dose
MMR Rate, To compare the efficacy of ponatinib with imatinib, as measured by MMR rate, at 5 years, 5 years after first dose|<10% BCR-ABL^IS Rate, To compare the proportion of patients achieving a ratio of \<10% BCR-ABL to ABL transcript levels at 3 months, as measured by the international scale (\<10% BCR-ABL\^IS), in patients administered ponatinib versus those administered imatinib, 3 months after first dose|Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) Rate, The percentage of Ph+ metaphases in bone marrow (peripheral blood may not be used), with a review of a minimum of 20 metaphases. Responses are defined as follows: Complete (CCyR): 0% Ph+ metaphases., 12 months after first dose|Progression-free Survival, To compare, according to treatment with ponatinib versus imatinib, progression-free survival, Up to 8 years after the last patient's first dose|Overall Survival, To compare, according to treatment with ponatinib versus imatinib, overall survival, Up to 8 years after the last patient's first dose
This multicenter, international, phase 3 trial will test the hypothesis that ponatinib is an effective treatment for newly diagnosed CP-CML patients when compared with standard imatinib.

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion, stratified by Sokal risk score at diagnosis (low, intermediate, high), to receive once daily oral administration of either ponatinib or imatinib. Efficacy measures include molecular, cytogenetic, and hematologic response rates at various timepoints; time to, duration of, and durability of responses; and survival follow-up. Safety measures include clinical laboratory testing, adverse event monitoring, vital signs, physical exams, ECGs, and ECHOs. Other measures include two patient-reported health outcomes questionnaires (FACT-Leu and EQ-5D-5L), determination of mutation status, and, for ponatinib only, measurement of steady-state plasma concentration. Accrual is expected to take approximately 2 years, and patients will be followed for survival for up to 8 years after the last patient's first dose; therefore, patient participation may last up to 10 years.
