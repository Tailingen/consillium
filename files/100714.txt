Study Evaluating the Tolerance and Biological Activity of Oral Clioquinol in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Hematological Malignancy
This is an open-label, single arm phase 1 study to evaluate the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase II dose of Clioquinol in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies. The study will also characterize Cliquinol's safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamic effect.

DRUG: Clioquinol
To evaluate the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase II dose. To partially characterize the pharmacokinetics of Clioquinol in plasma following single and multiple oral dosing., Varies
To determine the pharmacodynamic effects of Clioquinol on activity of the proteasome and relationship to the steady-state plasma concentrations of Cliquinol following multiple dosing, and to determine the response rate of Cliquinol., Varies
This is an open-label, single arm study. Approximately 4-48 patients will be enrolled. Patients will receive 800mg/day of Clioquinol at the start of the trial and the dose will be increased by 800mg with each subsequent level until the MTD is determined. Patients will then increase their frequency of the drug. Response to Clioquinol will be determined on day 21 for the 8 and 15 day dosing schedule and on day 28 for the 22 day dosing schedule ( 1 cycle). Patients who have demonstrated a response to the drug will be eligible to receive up to 5 additional cycles at the same dose and frequency every 21 days.
