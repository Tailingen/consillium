Single-probe Microwave Ablation (MWA) of Metastatic Liver Cancer
Microwave ablation (MWA) is the most recent development in the field of local ablative therapies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the variability and reproducibility of single-probe MWA versus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of metastatic liver tumours smaller than 3 cm in patients without underlying liver disease.
