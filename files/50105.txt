Comparison of Ropivacaine-Poloxamer 407 Hydrogel and TAP Block for Postoperative Pain Management in Laparoscopic/Robotic Gastrectomy
This study aims to determine whether Ropivacaine-Poloxamer 407 hydrogel provides non-inferior pain control compared to TAP block for patients undergoing minimally invasive gastrectomy. The results will guide postoperative pain management practices and enhance recovery protocols for gastric cancer surgery.
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Arm I (Ropivacaine-Poloxamer 407 hydrogel group)|PROCEDURE: Arm II (TAP block group)
Total fentanyl consumption within 72 hours postoperatively., The total amount of fentanyl administered to the patient via IV PCA during the initial 72-hour postoperative period will be recorded and compared among groups to assess analgesic efficacy., Over the first 72 hours after surgery.
Fentanyl usage at 12, 24, 48 hours., Pain intensity: Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) assessed both at rest and during movement., Fentanyl usage at 12, 24, 48 hours.|NRS pain scores at 24, 48, and 72 hours (at rest and during movement)., Bowel function: Time to resume normal gastrointestinal activity., NRS pain scores(0-10 / 0: no pain / 10: worst pain) at 24, 48, and 72 hours (at rest and during movement).|Pethidine usage at 24, 48, 72 hours, PONV: Incidence of nausea and vomiting documented along with severity scores., Pethidine usage at 24, 48, 72 hours|Time to first flatus and bowel movement. (up to 1 month), The time from surgery completion to the first passage of gas and bowel movement will be recorded to assess postoperative gastrointestinal recovery., 1 month|Incidence of seroma or surgical site infection. (up to 1 month), The presence of seroma or surgical site infection (SSI) will be evaluated through clinical examination and recorded according to standardized criteria., 1 month|Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) scores at baseline and 72 hours, Quality of recovery will be assessed using the 15-item Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) questionnaire, which evaluates physical comfort, emotional state, and overall well-being.(Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) score 0-10 on each items/ 0: worst recovery / 10: best recovery), 72 hours postoperatively|Peak Cough Flow (baseline and 72 hours), Peak cough flow (PCF) will be measured using a peak flow meter to assess respiratory function and recovery after surgery., Baseline (preoperatively) and 72 hours postoperatively|Length of hospital stay. (up to 1 month), The total number of days from surgery to hospital discharge will be recorded to evaluate recovery speed and efficiency., up to 1 month|Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). (up to 72 hours), The occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) will be documented, and severity will be assessed using a standardized scale., 72 hours postoperatively
