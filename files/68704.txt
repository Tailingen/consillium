Afatinib (BIBW 2992) in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With EGFR Mutation
Primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of afatinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR (Epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation(s) and have never been treated with an EGFR-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Secondary objective is to assess the time to symptomatic progression (as judged by investigator).

DRUG: Afatinib
Percentage of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Percentage of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs)., From first drug administration up to 28 days after last drug administration, up to 1624 days.
Time to Symptomatic Progression (TTSP), Time to Symptomatic progression (TTSP) was defined as time from first administration of afatinib to date of first documented clinically significant symptomatic progression that required stopping the anti-cancer treatment according to investigator's assessment. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the median was calculated for TTSP using Greenwood' standard error estimate., From first drug administration until date of first documented clinically significant symptomatic progression that required stopping afatinib treatment, up to 1624 days.|Percentage of Participants With Drug-related (Afatinib-related) Adverse Events, Percentage of participants with drug-related (afatinib-related) adverse events., From first drug administration up to 28 days after last drug administration, up to 1624 days.
