Observational Prospective Study of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors for Solid Neoplasms
This prospective, multicenter observational study included all patients with solid neoplasms who received treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in clinical practice, regardless of tumor type, tumor stage, type of immunotherapy, or treatment lines. This study aimed to assess the use, effectiveness, and safety of ICIs for solid neoplasms in real-world populations, which can provide insights into clinical decisions associated with the use of ICIs for the treatment of cancer patients in the real-world setting.
Cancer
Overall Survival, OS was defined as the time from the date of first administration of immunotherapy until death by any cause. Participants still alive at the time of data analysis were censored at the date of last follow-up., Three years
Progression Free Survival, PFS was measured from the date of first administration of immunotherapy to the date of disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) Version 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. For patients whose disease did not progress, PFS was evaluated by censoring patients at their most recent imaging., Three years|Overall Objective Response Rate, ORR was defined as the proportion of participants with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to treatment as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1., At least 6 weeks after start of treatment|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Treatment-related adverse events were assessed and graded according to CTCAE v. 5.0., Three years
