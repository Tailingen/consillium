REaCT-vascular Access Her2 Negative Vascular Access Strategies for (Neo) Adjuvant Breast Cancer Treatment Without Trastuzumab
In the REaCT-Vascular Access Her2 negative study, the investigator will use a novel method to allow comparisons of established standard of care vascular access strategies using the "integrated consent model" as part of a pragmatic clinical trial.

Determining the optimal vascular access strategy remains an important medical issue for patients, nurses, physicians and society. A novel method to allow comparison of established standards of care is needed as part of an increasing internationally mandated incentive to perform more pragmatic clinic trials.

DEVICE: venous access PORT or PICC
Accrual rates, Percentage of patients who receive (neo)adjuvant IV systemic therapy for Her 2 negative breast cancer compared to the number of participants who agree to randomization. The total number of new patients receiving (neo) adjuvant IV systemic cytotoxic therapy will be provided by the local chemotherapy pharmacy and Oncology Patient Information System records., One year|Patient compliance, Percentage of participants who are randomized who accept randomization, and percentage of patients who cross-over to receive a central line while on study will be calculated using the chemotherapy treatment documentation in the designated hospital electronic patient record program, One year
Physician engagement, Percentage of medical oncologists who have agreed to participate in the trial compared to the percentage who approached patients regarding the trial., One year|Rates of thrombotic events, 2. Rates of documented thrombotic events need for anticoagulation, line infections, phlebitis, and extravasations during chemotherapy., One year|Number of attempts at cannulation, 3. For those patients randomised to peripheral access information on the number of attempts at cannulation will be collected and site of cannulation. (ipsilateral to surgery vs contralateral to surgery), One year
