A Phase I Clinical Trial of RS001 in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Malignancies
This study is an open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic profile in the body after infusion of RS001 injection, and preliminary efficacy in subjects with CD19-positive relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies (BCM).
B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: RS001 injection
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and determine the recommended dosage of RS001 for BCM subjects., Up to 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is the highest dose for DLT in â‰¤1/6 subjects., Up to 28 days|Incidence of abnormalities, Incidence of abnormalities in AE/SAE/AESI/laboratory tests/electrocardiograms/vital signs., Up to 28 days
Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (Cmax), The peak concentration of CD19-CAR-mbIL15-DNT cells amplified in the peripheral blood (Cmax, detected by qPCR or Flow Cytometry)., Up to 90 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (AUC), CD19-CAR-mbIL15-DNT cells blood concentrations will be measured at different time points to evaluate the area under the curve (AUC). (AUC, detected by qPCR or Flow Cytometry)., Up to 90 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (Tmax), CD19-CAR-mbIL15-DNT cells blood concentrations will be measured at different time points to evaluate the peak plasma time (Tmax). Tmax is defined as the time to reach the highest concentration (Tmax, detected by qPCR or Flow Cytometry)., Up to 90 days|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicator (T1/2), CD19-CAR-mbIL15-DNT cells blood concentrations will be measured at different time points to evaluate the elimination half-life in hours (T1/2). T1/2 is defined as the time point when the concentration of CD19-CAR-mbIL15-DNT reaches half of maximum in a patient's peripheral blood (T1/2, detected by qPCR or Flow Cytometry)., Up to 90 days|Overall Response Rate, Objective response rates (ORR; complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\]) in B-NHL subjects and composite complete remission rates (CRc; CR + CR with incomplete hematologic recovery \[CRi\]) in ALL subjects were assessed using Lugano 2014 criteria / LYRIC Criteria (2016) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (v3.2025), respectively., Up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate, The percentage of PR, CR and SD patients in the total B-NHL patient population., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response, The time from the start of the first assessment of CR or PR to the first assessment as disease recurrence or progression or death in B-NHL subjects.

The time from the first assessment of the tumor for CR or CRi to the first assessment of disease recurrence or death from any cause in B-ALL subjects., Up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival, The time from the first cell infusion to the first evaluation of tumor progression or death from any cause in B-NHL subjects., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival, From the date of entry into the clinical study until death from any cause, Up to 2 years|Overall Response Rate at 3 months, The percentage of PR and CR patients in B-NHL patient population at 3 months., Up to 3 months|Relapse-Free Survival, Evaluate only ALL patients who achieved CR or CRi. This refers to the period from the first assessment of CR or CRi until the first evaluation indicating disease relapse or death from any cause during CR or CRi., Up to 2 years|Event-Free Survival, This is used for evaluating all ALL subjects. The period starts from the first infusion of RS001 injection until treatment failure, relapse, or death (any cause), whichever occurs first. For subjects without these events, the timeframe will be calculated up to the date of the last follow-up visit. For patients who did not achieve CR or CRi, EFS will be calculated from the clinical trial enrollment date until disease progression or death, with the first occurring event being considered as the endpoint., Up to 2 years
