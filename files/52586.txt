This study is an open, multicenter, Phase Ib clinical trial evaluating chimeric antigen receptor-modified autologous T cells targeting Claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2) (CT041 autologous CAR T) in subjects with CLDN18.2 expression-positive pancreatic cancer who has undergone adjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety of CT041 treatment.
