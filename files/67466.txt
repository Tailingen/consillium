Thi is a prospective and low-intervention clinical trial. We propose to design a panel of "core" genetic alterations by sequencing Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) DNA in patients with confirmed or suspicious Primary Central Neurvous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) with the aim to improve diagnostic sensitivity, response assessment and monitoring early CNS relapse in routine practice.

Enrolled patients will receive conventional treatments according to well-established international guidelines, DNA assessments will not influence the treatment choices.
Primary CNS Lymphoma
PROCEDURE: Lumbar puncture
Association between recurrent genetic alterations and PCNSL diagnosis or relapse, Frequency of various genetic mutations among enrolled patients at diagnosis or relapse, 3 years and 6 months|Association between recurrent genetic alterations and residual enhanced and not-enhanced images at the MRI, Frequency of various genetic mutations among enrolled patients during treatment, 3 years and 6 months
