A Study of the Effectiveness of Venetoclax in Combination With Azacitidine or Decitabine in an Outpatient Setting in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Ineligible for Intensive Chemotherapy
A study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of venetoclax, in combination with azacitidine or decitabine, in an outpatient setting for treatment-naïve participants with AML who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|Cancer
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Decitabine
Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission or Complete Remission With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CR + CRi), The composite complete remission rate is defined as the percentage of participants with complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) at any time during the study as assessed by the investigator. Response was based on bone marrow results and hematology values according to the modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria for AML:

CR: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 10\^3/μL (1,000/μL), platelets \> 10\^5/μL (100,000/μL), red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence, and bone marrow with \< 5% blasts

CRi: Bone marrow with \< 5% blasts, and absolute neutrophils of ≤ 10\^3/μL or platelets ≤ 10\^5/μL, Assessed at Cycle 1 end, at Cycle 2 end if CR/CRi wasn't achieved at Cycle 1 end, or Cycle 4 end if CR/CRi wasn't achieved at Cycle 2 end. Median treatment duration of venetoclax was 16.1 wks (range 3.9-38.1) and 21.1 wks (range 2.7-40.4), respectively.
Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission (CR), The complete remission rate is defined as the percentage of participants with complete remission (CR) at any time during the study as assessed by the investigator. Response was based on bone marrow results and hematology values according to the modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria for AML:

CR: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \> 10\^3/μL (1,000/μL), platelets \> 10\^5/μL (100,000/μL), red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence, and bone marrow with \< 5% blasts, Assessed at Cycle 1 end, at Cycle 2 end if CR/CRi wasn't achieved at Cycle 1 end, or Cycle 4 end if CR/CRi wasn't achieved at Cycle 2 end. Median treatment duration of venetoclax was 16.1 wks (range 3.9-38.1) and 21.1 wks (range 2.7-40.4), respectively.|Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi), The complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery rate is defined as the percentage of participants with complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) at any time during the study as assessed by the investigator. Response was based on bone marrow results and hematology values according to the modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria for AML:

CRi: Bone marrow with \< 5% blasts, and absolute neutrophils of ≤ 10\^3/μL or platelets ≤ 10\^5/μL., Assessed at Cycle 1 end, at Cycle 2 end if CR/CRi wasn't achieved at Cycle 1 end, or Cycle 4 end if CR/CRi wasn't achieved at Cycle 2 end. Median treatment duration of venetoclax was 16.1 wks (range 3.9-38.1) and 21.1 wks (range 2.7-40.4), respectively.|Percentage of Participants With Post-baseline Transfusion Independence, The transfusion independence rate is defined as the percentage of participants with post-baseline transfusion independence, which is defined as a period of at least 56 days with no transfusion after the first dose of study drug and within 30 days of the last dose of study drug, death, or initiation of post-treatment therapy, whichever is earliest., From the first dose of study drug to the last dose of study drug +30 days, or death, or initiation of post-treatment therapy, whichever occurred earliest. Median time on follow-up was 183.5 days and 195.0 days, respectively.
