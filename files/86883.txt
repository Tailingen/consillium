Biomarker Study of the Antitumoral Activity of Denosumab in the Pre- Operative Setting of Early Breast Cancer
This is a biomarker study designed to test the preclinically generated hypothesis of anti-tumoral activity of denosumab in patients with early breast cancer candidates a tumour excision

This is a biomarker study designed to test in patients the preclinically generated hypothesis of anti-tumoral activity of denosumab.The main objective is to demonstrate the antiproliferative and/or pro-apoptotic activity of denosumab in early breast cancer. Other endpoints are to correlate denosumab activity with RANK and RANKL expressions through mRNA and protein; to characterize the differential antiproliferative activity of denosumab between different phenotypes of breast cancer; to identify biomarkers, to identify global changes in gene expression and validate the activity of RANKL antibody in clinical samples. A total of 60 patients with early breast cancer (Stages I and II) candidates to tumor excision as first therapeutic approach will be randomized 2:1, a treatment arm that will receive two doses of denosumab following diagnosis, and a control arm that will not receive treatment. At least 24 patients with hormone receptor negative breast cancer and 24 premenopausal patients will be included in the study.
