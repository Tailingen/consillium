It will explore the tolerability (phase I) and effectiveness (phase II) of the Donafenib tosilate tablets combined with Toripalimab injection in patients with advanced HCC. The study is conducted in two phases, the first phase is the dose exploration phase (phase I), and the second phase is the dose expansion phase (phase II).
