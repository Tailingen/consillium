Lymphoma is a highly common malignant tumor in Asia. This study aims to observe and describe the clinical and genetic charateristics of Chinese lymphoma patients, and to explore the relationship between those charateristics and pathogenesis and prognostic factors in the real-world population. This study is a non-interventional real world, observational study and all registered data are collected from real clinical practice cases. The medical data includes patient demographic, tumor characteristics, laboratory examination, history of treatments, adverse reactions, efficacy results and possible prognostic factors.
