Study Investigating the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Safety of FE200486
Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from Study FE200486 CS06 and FE200486 CS02 provided further knowledge of the optimal dose regimens for FE200486 (degarelix). Both studies were to guide dose selection for phase III. In addition, safety and tolerance data were generated.

Time to Meet Insufficient Testosterone Response, Figures in the table are Kaplan-Meier estimates of the time to meeting insufficient testosterone response. Insufficient testosterone response was defined as testosterone \>1.0 ng/mL at one visit or testosterone 0.5-1.0 at two consecutive visits., 3 months|Number of Participants With Testostestone Serum Levels Below 0.5 ng/mL for at Least 28 Days, The number of participants suppressed for at least 28 days was defined as the estimated "survival probability" at time=Day 28., 28 days
Time to Testosterone Castration (Testosterone â‰¤0.5 ng/mL)., Time to testosterone castration was calculated as the number of days from dosing to the first scheduled visit when testosterone was less than 0.5 ng/mL. The figures in the table present the number of participants who were castrated after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days., 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42 days|Number of Participants With Sufficient Testosterone Suppression for at Least 84 Days, Sufficient testosterone suppression was defined as not meeting an insufficient testosterone response criterion. Insufficient testosterone response was defined as testosterone \>1.0 ng/mL at one visit or testosterone 0.5-1.0 at two consecutive visits., 3 months|Time to 50% Reduction in Prostate-specific Antigen Levels, The time to 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction from baseline was defined as the median number of days from dosing to the first visit where a 50% reduction in PSA level was reached., 3 months|Time to 90% Reduction in Prostate-specific Antigen Levels, The time to 90% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction from baseline was defined as the median number of days from dosing to the first visit where a 90% reduction in PSA level was reached., 3 months|Liver Function Tests, The number of participants who had abnormal (defined as above upper limit of normal range (ULN)) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, aspartate aminotransferas levels, and bilirubin levels plus the number of participants who had ALT increases \>3x ULN and ALT increases \>3x ULN with concurrently increased bilirubin \>1.5 ULN., 3 months
