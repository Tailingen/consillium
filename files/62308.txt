Combination of Brivanib With 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin (5FU/LV) and 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin/Irinotecan (FOLFIRI)
The purpose of this study is to determine a safe and maximum tolerable dose of Brivanib when combined with standard dose 5FU/LV and FOLFIRI.

DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Brivanib|DRUG: Brivanib|DRUG: Brivanib
Safety-Toxicity, evaluated according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. Assessments based on medical review of adverse events, results of vital signs, ECGs, echocardiography, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests, Cycle 4, Day 1
Pharmacokinetics (Cmax, Tmax, AUC (TAU), T-HALF) plasma concentration vs time for brivanib given alone and in combination with FOLFIRI. Individual concentrations (C) of 5FU will be calculated from samples on Day 2 in the presence and absence of Brivanib, Cycle 2, Day 2|Efficacy-Tumor BOR determined for treated subjects by radiological responses assessed by CT scan or MRI, by RECIST criteria (v1.1). Radiological tumor assessments to evaluate response & progression will be done every 8 wks or more frequently if indicated, Every 8 weeks|Exploratory Measures (Biomarkers for Predictive Analysis): Potential predictive markers, including activity of FGF, VEGF and related pathways as well as K-RAS mutation status, will be evaluated based on blood or tumor samples, Cycle 1, Cycle 2, every other cycle
The purpose of this study is to determine a safe and maximum tolerable dose of Brivanib when combined with standard dose 5FU/LV and FOLFIRI.
