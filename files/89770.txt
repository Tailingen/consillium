A Phase I Clinical Trial of Y150 in the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The main purpose of this Phase I study is to access the safety and tolerability of Y150 at different dose levels. It is hoped to find out the recommended dose for Phase II/III.
Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Y150
Number of Participants With Adverse Events according to CTCAE V5.0, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly., up to approximately 2 years|Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs were assessed using the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until the forth dosing (Day 28)

This is a Phase I, open-label，dose-escalation trial in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. There are two parts of the study: a dose-escalation part and a dose-expansion part. Dose escalation follows an accelerated design initially with 2 single subject cohorts (Cohorts 1-2) and switches to a classical 3+3 design (Cohorts 3-7). Dose-expansion means that at least 9 subjects (included subjects of the dose-escalation part) will be selected in 1 - 3 dose levels to focus on the pharmacokinetics (PK) / pharmacodynamic (PD) features and recommended dose for Phase II (RP2D). Additional purpose of the study is to find out whether the study drug has anti-tumor effects.
