GATA6 Expression as a Predictor of Response to Peri-Operative Chemotherapy in Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
To date, there have been no Canadian led neoadjuvant or peri-operative trials, this multicentre design gives the opportunity to build more experience with this strategy across Canada in more institutions. The design of this prospective trial will also test our important hypotheses regarding the use of biomarkers to understand the benefit of mFFX in improving outcomes for patients with resectable pancreas cancer. Data from this study would likely inform future studies where patients are given personalised options for the best treatment strategies rather than one empiric approach.
Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Modified Folforinox (mFFX)
To assess disease free survival (DFS) in resectable PDAC treated with peri-operative mFFX according to baseline GATA6 expression level, Disease free survival, 2-4 years
