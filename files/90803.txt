First Line Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment (ESMERALDA)
The efficacy of eribulin is now well known in metastatic breast cancer. Furthermore, a phase III combine study ( chemo + bev)in metastatic first line shown a gain in PFS with no extra toxicities.

It could be interesting to explore the combination of bev + eribulin in first line metastatic breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Eribulin
Number of patient with non progressive disease, The principal endpoint is to determine the disease control rate (or rate of non-progression) at one year in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated in the first line setting by a combination of eribulin/bevacizumab.

In this open-label trial, the sample size is calculated based on Simon's two-stage design, used to test whether the disease control rate at one year will be at least 50%, a clinically promising rate, versus a rate of 33%, a rate that is not clinically promising.

Considering a type I risk (alpha) error of 5%, with 54 patients, this study has an 80% power to detect a disease control rate at one year of 50%., 12 months
Toxicity based on the CTCAE v4.03 criteria, 12 months
