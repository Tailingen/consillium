Extended Cancer Education for Longer-Term Survivors in Primary Care for Patients With Stage I-II Breast or Prostate Cancer or Stage I-III Colorectal Cancer
This study tests four different methods of educating patients about follow-up care (NCI facing forward, brochure, EXCELS website alone, EXCELS health coaching alone and EXCELS website \& health coaching combination) after cancer treatment ends. While it is known that patients need information to guide follow-up it remains unknown how to best provide this in primary care.

Use of preventive services, Preventative services will be measured using adherence to evidence based guideline care which will be computed as a percentage of the eligible guideline related services provided to each patient., Up to 18 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Develop the EXCELS intervention to facilitate engaged self-management of cancer follow-up for cancer survivors.

II. Evaluate the efficacy of EXCELS intervention in a small randomized controlled trial.

III. Assess/refine intervention usability and acceptability for primary care patients.

OUTLINE:

PHASE I: EXCELS intervention is developed and assessed.

PHASE II: Participants are randomized into 1 of 4 arms.

ARM I: Participants receive National Cancer Institute's Facing Forward brochure.

ARM II: Participants have untimed access to the EXCELS mobile web application.

ARM III: Participants also receive 4 calls of 15-20 minutes each over 3 months focusing on assisting survivors with addressing challenges to receiving preventive service and health care.

ARM IV: Participants have access to EXCELS website as in Arm II. Participants also receive 4 health coaching calls as in Arm III.

Patients are followed up at 6 months, 12 months and 18 months post randomization.
