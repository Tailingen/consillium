Integrated Dose Escalation for Advanced, Localized Gynecologic Cancer (The IDEAL - GYN Trial)
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of integrated boost radiation therapy when given with concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin).
Cancer of the Cervix|Cervical Neoplasms
RADIATION: Boost radiation
Maximum Tolerated Dose of Integrated Boost Radiation Therapy, Administered With IMRT Technique With Concurrent Chemotherapy (Cisplatin)., Concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy is the standard of care for node positive cervical cancer. While there are several acceptable means to boost the disease in the low pelvis (i.e. brachytherapy, IMRT, or external beam), there is limited research into boosting gross disease in the pelvis or para-aortic region. This protocol is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of treating tumor bearing regions within the abdomen and pelvis, using an integrated boost technique and concurrent chemotherapy., During RT to 6 weeks post RT
Time to Local-regional Control With Integrated Boost Radiation Therapy (TTLR), Local-regional control is defined as local control without any nodal recurrence., 3 years following treatment|Time to Distant Recurrence (TTDR), 3 years after treatment|Disease Free Survival (DFS), 3 years after treatment|Overall Survival (OS), 3 years after treatment|Number of Participants With Acute Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Acute DLT will be defined based on the side effects inherent from radiation therapy for gynecologic cancers, including effects on bowel, bladder, and skin.Since integrated radiation dose escalation is unlikely to substantially affect the hematopoietic system, only non-hematologic, grade 3-4, acute toxicity will be considered the primary dose-limiting toxicity (acute DLT). Dose limiting toxicity will include any of the following during treatment or within 6 weeks of completion: Acute Grade 3-4 enteritis or proctitis, Acute Grade 3-4 bladder toxicity, Acute Grade 4 dermatologic toxicity., 6 weeks following treatment|Number of Participants With Late Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), Late DLTs will be defined at grade 3-4 GI or GU toxicity with onset after 6 weeks of treatment., 3 years following treatment
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of integrated boost radiation therapy when given with concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin).
