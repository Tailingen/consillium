Comparison of Analgesic Efficacy and Occurrence of Emesis Among Different Background Infusion and Bolus Administration Regimens of Fentanyl Based Intravenous Patient-controlled Analgesia in Patients After Laparoscopic Assisted Gastrectomy - a Randomized Blind Study -
Fentanyl based intravenous patient controlled analgesia(PCA)is popular method for postoperative pain control, but information regarding optimal dose of fentanyl in IV PCA is currently lacking. We thus determine appropriate dose of fentanyl (bolus dose and background infusion rate) for effective pain control with minimal side effects such as nausea and vomiting
The Patients With Gastric Cancer Who Are Scheduled to Receive Laparoscopy Assisted Gastrectomy
DRUG: B0 group: bolus 0.6mcg/kg without background infusion|DRUG: BL group: bolus 0.4mcg/kg with background infusion rate 0.2mcg/kg/hr|DRUG: BH group: bolus 0.2mcg/kg with background infusion rate 0.4mcg/kg/hr
Pain score(VAS) within 48hrs after surgery, Pain score after surgery within 48hrs after laparoscopic gastrectomy, Pain socre after surgery 1) within 30min-6hrs, 2) within 6-24hrs, 3) within 24hrs-48hrs
