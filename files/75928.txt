This is a pilot study, designed to collect data on steps walked (ambulation) per day of lobectomy patients after surgery. While the investigators know ambulation improves outcomes after surgery, there is no institutional policy, set of patient goals, or method for deciding which patients require further resources, such as physical therapy. Data collected will be used to set up a hospital-wide strategy for patients to achieve post-operative ambulation milestones more readily.
