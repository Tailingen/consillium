Predicting Gastric Cancer Response to Chemo With Multimodal AI Model
This study aims to develop a multimodal model combining radiomic and pathomic features to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in advanced gastric cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The researchers intended to collected pre-intervention CT images and pathological slides from patients, extract radiomic and pathomic features, and build a prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The model will be validated using a separate cohort of patients. This research intend to build a radiomic-pathomic model that can outperform models based on either radiomic or pathomic features alone, aiming to improve the prediction of pCR in gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer|Chemotherapy Effect
DRUG: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with radical tumor resection surgery
Pathological Complete Response, Pathological complete response (pCR) was defined as no viable cells remained in the primary tumor lesions and the dissected lymph nodes., Assessed within 30 days after radical resection surgery.
