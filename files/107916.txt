Momelotinib Versus Ruxolitinib in Subjects With Myelofibrosis
This study is to determine the efficacy of momelotinib (MMB) versus ruxolitinib (RUX) in participants with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-PV/ET MF) who have not yet received treatment with a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor).

Participants will be randomized to receive either MMB or ruxolitinib for 24 weeks during a double-blind treatment phase, after which they will be eligible to receive open-label MMB for up to an additional 216 weeks. After discontinuation of study medication, assessments will continue for 12 additional weeks, after which participants will be contacted for survival follow-up approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years from the date of enrollment or until study termination. For those participants planning to continue treatment with MMB following the end of the study, the Early Study Drug Discontinuation (ESDD), 30-day, 12-Week, and survival follow-up visits are not required.

Splenic Response Rate at Week 24, Splenic response rate at Week 24 is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a spleen volume reduction of ≥ 35% from baseline at the Week 24 assessment as measured by MRI or CT., Week 24
Total Symptom Score (TSS) Response Rate at Week 24, Total symptom score (TSS) is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a ≥50% reduction in TSS at Week 24 versus baseline as measured by the modified Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) v2.0 diary. Response rate was calculated using the average of the daily TSS from a consecutive 28-day period prior to Week 24, which had ≥20 daily TSS available.

The modified MPN-SAF patient-reported outcome instrument consisted of 8 items assessing worst daily incidence of tiredness, filling up quickly, abdominal discomfort, night sweats, itching, bone pain, pain under ribs on left side, and inactivity. Scoring of the Total Symptom Score (TSS), in this study was based on 7 of these items, (range of 0-70,), excluding inactivity. These items assess the impact experienced by the participant in the 24 hours prior to completing the questionnaire. All items are measured using a 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale, with 0 corresponding to "Absent" and 10 being the worse, Week 24|Rate of Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusions in the Double-blind Phase, (the Average Number of RBC Units Transfused Per Month Not Associated With Overt Bleeding), Rate of RBC transfusion was defined as the average number of RBC units transfused not associated with clinically overt bleeding per subject-month during the double-blind phase., Baseline to Week 24|RBC Transfusion Independence Rate at Week 24, (Defined as Absence of RBC Transfusions and no Hemoglobin Level Below 8 g/dL in the 12 Weeks Prior to Week 24, Excluding Cases Associated With Clinically Overt Bleeding), RBC transfusion independence is the percentage of participants who are transfusion independent at Week 24, defined as absence of RBC transfusions and no hemoglobin level below 8 g/dL in the 12 weeks prior to Week 24, excluding cases associated with clinically overt bleeding., Week 24|RBC Transfusion Dependence Rate at Week 24. (Defined as Having Had at Least 4 Units of RBC Transfusions, or a Hemoglobin Level Below 8 g/dL in 8 Weeks Prior to Week 24 (Excluding Cases Associated With Clinically Overt Bleeding))., RBC transfusion dependence is the percentage of participants who are transfusion dependent at Week 24, defined as having had at least 4 units of RBC transfusions, or a hemoglobin level below 8 g/dL in 8 weeks prior to Week 24 (excluding cases associated with clinically overt bleeding). Participants with the last double-blind phase participation date prior to Day 162 (ie. missing at Week 24) were considered transfusion dependent at Week 24., Week 24
