Transdermal Methylphenidate for Cancer-Related Fatigue
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of the Methylphenidate patch and a placebo patch (a patch that contains no medicine) on patients and their fatigue caused by cancer or by cancer treatment. The Methylphenidate patch contains a medication that is known to increase alertness and wakefulness. Oral methylphenidate has been used in the past to treat cancer related fatigue and is often used to treat unusual sleepiness. But this is the first time that the patch form is offered to try treating cancer fatigue in patients who cannot always swallow tablets.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: methylphenidate via transdermal patch compared to placebo
To investigate the efficacy of sustained-release, transdermal methylphenidate compared to a placebo., In reducing fatigue, increasing activity levels, and sustaining steady wakefulness throughout the day. The outcome measure will be BFI and ESS based self-reporting of the reduction of numeric rating scale on fatigue level and sleepiness, combined with objective measurement of increased activity intensity scores monitored by actigraphy., for 10 days|To evaluate the possible side effects of a methylphenidate patch., In adult head and neck cancer patients with fatigue., for 10 days
To evaluate the feasibility of accelerometry-based objective outcome measures to assess improved activity levels and energy expenditure of cancer patients., To evaluate the feasibility of accelerometry-based objective outcome measures to assess improved activity levels and energy expenditure, will be evaluated by examining the patients' rating of their comfort while wearing the actigraphy device and of how willing they would be to wear the device for a future study., for 10 days
