CD40 Agonistic Antibody APX005M (Sotigalimab) in Combination With Nivolumab
This study is a Phase 1-2 open-label dose escalation study of the immuno-activating monoclonal antibody APX005M administered in combination with nivolumab to adult subjects with non-small cell lung cancer or metastatic melanoma. The Phase 1 portion is intended to establish the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase 2 dose of APX005M when administered in combination with nivolumab. The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate safety and efficacy of the combination.

Number of Participants Experiencing Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), All toxicities were graded according to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.03. DLT was defined as any of the following events attributed to APX005M and nivolumab combination:

* Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥ 7 days (except asymptomatic lymphopenia)
* Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with a single temperature of \>38.3◦ C (101◦ F) or a sustained temperature of ≥38◦ C (100.4◦ F) for more than one hour
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia with signs or symptoms of bleeding or requiring platelet transfusion
* Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity
* Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity lasting \>3 days despite optimal supportive care
* Any Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic laboratory value if: medical intervention is required to treat the subject, abnormality leads to hospitalization, or abnormality persists for \>1 week
* Failure to recover from a treatment-related AE to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks of last dose of investigational product
* Grade 5 toxicity., Up to 21 days following first dose of APX005M and nivolumab|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of APX005M + Nivolumab (Phase 1b), Establish the MTD dose of APX005M combined with 360 mg of nivolumab for which for which \< 33% of DLT- evaluable participants experience a DLT. In Phase 1b, the RP2D was based on the overall safety and tolerability of the combination of APX005M and nivolumab by testing increasing doses up to 0.3 mg/kg APX005M + nivolumab., Up to 21 days following first dose of APX005M and nivolumab|Phase 2 Evaluate the Objective Response Rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST in Each Cohort / Group, ORR defined as the rate of patients who show as best overall response; either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR). The ORR can be evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. using computed tomography (CT) scans/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Per RECIST v1.1, for target lesions and assessed by imaging: Complete Response, (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions and nontarget (NT) lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and no PD in NT lesions or new lesions; Objective Response Rate (ORR)=CR + PR., From start of the treatment (Day 1) until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death, initiation of any anticancer therapy, lost to follow-up, or termination by the Sponsor, whichever comes first (for Phase 2: maximum up to 27 months)
Safety of the APX005M and Nivolumab Combination (Phase 2), Number of participants with TEAEs are reported., Day 1 up to 30 days (or 100 days for SAEs and AEs with potential immunologic etiology) following the after the last dose of APX005M and/or nivolumab (from start of treatment up to 27 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) as Per RECIST 1.1(Phase 2), Duration of Response is defined as the time from the first evidence of confirmed partial response (PR) or better by Per RECIST v1.1 to disease progression or death due to any cause; in subjects alive without progressive disease (PD), DOR was censored on the date of the last tumor assessment. PD is defined using RECIST v1.1, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Maximum up to 25 months|Median Progression-free Survival (PFS) (Phase 2), Progression-free Survival (PFS) in each cohort, measured from first dose to the earlier of PD (by RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From start of treatment (Day 1) up to 27 months|6-month PFS Rate (Phase 2), PFS rate in each cohort, measured from first dose to the earlier of PD (by RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., * Outcome Measure Time Frame From start of treatment (Day 1) to 6 months
APX005M-002 is an open-label Phase 1-2 study and comprises a dose-escalation portion (Phase 1) followed by a Phase 2 tumor specific portion.

Eligible subjects with non-small cell lung cancer or metastatic melanoma will receive intravenous APX005M in combination with nivolumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death, whichever occurs first.

Study objectives include:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase 2 dose of APX005M when given in combination with nivolumab
* Evaluate safety of the APX005M and nivolumab combination
* Evaluate the objective response rate, duration of response and median PFS by RECIST 1.1 in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer or metastatic melanoma receiving APX005M in combination with nivolumab
* Determine the PK of APX005M
