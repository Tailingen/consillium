Genome-based Management of Patients in Precision Medicine (Ge-Med) Towards a Genomic Health Program
The GE-MED APPROACH project will enroll patients (n = appr. 12.000) with unclear molecular cause of the disease, suspected genetic cause of the disease without detailed molecular analysis like Whole Exome Sequencing (WES).

The novelty of this study is to integrate genomic health concepts into immediate clinical care. To achieve these goals, a novel structure for the Triple P (3P) concept of personalized medicine (Personalized, Predictive, Preventive) integrated into a well-established health care system and associated with novel decentralized Disease Analysing Task Forces (DATF) will be implemented.

The overall goal of this study is to implement, for the first time, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis as a first line diagnostic test for all clinical indications such as Rare Disease (RD )and familial cancer syndromes.
