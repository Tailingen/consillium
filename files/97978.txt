OMO-1 in Solid Malignancies
This is a modular, first time in patient, open-label, multicentre study of OMO-1, administered orally, alone and in combination with anti-cancer treatments, in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic solid malignancies.
Neoplasms
DRUG: OMO-1
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events including dose-limiting toxicities, The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent (serious) adverse events including dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Baseline (C1D1) until 28 days after last administration of OMO-1|Incidence of clinically significant abnormal measurements in physical examination, ophthalmological examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), pregnancy test, lab tests and ECOG performance status, Physical examination and ophthalmological examination, vital signs; electrocardiogram (ECG); pregnancy test; haematology; clinical chemistry; urinalysis; plasma/renal makers; tumour markers; ECOG performance status, Screening until 28 days after last administration of OMO-1
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 - the proportion of patients with a confirmed reduction in tumour burden of a predefined amount (this will include short lived responses)., Screening until 28 days after last administration of OMO-1|Percentage change in tumour size, Percentage change in tumour size will be determined for patients with measurable disease at baseline and is derived at each visit by the percentage change from baseline in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. The best percentage change in tumour size will be the patient's value representing the largest decrease (or smallest increase) from baseline in tumour size., Screening until 28 days after last administration of OMO-1|Maximal OMO-1 plasma concentration Cmax, Measurement of OMO-1 levels in plasma over time to calculate Cmax, Baseline (C1D1) and D1 in even cycles (C) until end of treatment (Part A) ; Baseline and C2D1 (Part B)|Area under the OMO-1 plasma concentration curve (AUC), Measurement of OMO-1 levels in plasma over time to calculate AUC, Baseline (C1D1) and D1 in even cycles (C) until end of treatment (Part A) ; Baseline and C2D1 (Part B)|'Proof of mechanism' and 'proof of principle' pharmacodynamic biomarkers, including markers of tumour cell proliferation and apoptosis., Measurement of levels of 'Proof of mechanism' and 'proof of principle' pharmacodynamic biomarkers, including markers of tumour cell proliferation and apoptosis., Screening until end of treatment
The study will consist of a number of study modules. The initial Module 1 will evaluate OMO-1 as monotherapy to provide dose(s) and schedule(s) for further Modules of combination therapy.

Module 2 will evaluate OMO-1 in combination with small molecule EGFR-TKIs.

Study modules will consist of a Part A (dose finding) and an optional Part B (cohort expansion). The option to start Part B and add further modules will be the decision of the safety review committee, based on emerging preclinical anti-tumour data and, safety and tolerability information from the study as a whole.

For all modules, Part A cohorts may be expanded by up to 12 additional patients at doses (at or above the MBAD) that have been confirmed to be tolerated. These patients will have mandatory paired biopsies to assess the tumour for relevant PDc biomarkers, and to explore further the tolerability, safety and PK activity at these doses.

In all combination modules, the dose of each combination agent investigated will not exceed their current recommended dose. The starting dose of OMO-1 in combination modules will not exceed the one currently tolerated in Module 1 (monotherapy). For cohorts in which OMO-1 is dosed in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, dosing will not continue once the cycles of chemotherapy have been completed.
