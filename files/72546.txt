PROMOTE: Identifying Predictive Markers of Response for Genitourinary Cancer
This is a tissue and blood collection protocol requiring image-guided biopsies of metastatic prostate cancer and other genitourinary malignancies including renal cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma. Whenever possible, a new bone lesion or new/progressing soft tissue lesion will be chosen for biopsy as opposed to radiographically stable lesion. Patients will be enrolled in into one of several parallel cohorts based upon disease status or type and the planned systemic therapy following baseline tumor biopsy: (A) Androgen signaling inhibition, (B) Immunotherapy, (C) Radiotherapy, (D) Targeted Therapy/Investigational therapeutic, (E) DNA damage response pathway, (F) Aggressive variant disease, (G1) Castration-sensitive ADT na√Øve and ADT \< 3 months), or (G2) Castration-sensitive pre-treated with sub-optimal PSA nadir \>0.2 ng/ml, (R) metastatic renal cell carcinoma and metastatic and (U) urothelial carcinoma.

Correlation of Treatment Benefit by group, Using PARADIGM and DiPSC tools, the investigators will discover genetic expression and clinical factors that are predictive of treatment benefit within each treatment cohort using correlative analysis., Up to 5 years|Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Supervised analysis using response / benefit from the experimental therapy to assess feasibility of pattern recognition/discovery of factors that are associated with response and generate a positive predictive value. Positive predictive value is the probability that participants with a positive test truly have the disease. Positive Predictive Value: True Positive / (True Positive +False Positive), Up to 5 years|Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the time in months of the initiation of therapy after biopsy at enrollment until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started) or death. For participants initiating treatment, their screening clinical, laboratory, and radiological status will be used as a baseline. Progression is a composite endpoint that can be based upon prostate specific antigen (PSA), objective measures of disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v.1.1), symptoms, or death., Up to 5 years|Median Overall Survival (OS), OS is measured from the time in months of the initiation of therapy after biopsy at enrollment until death., Up to 5 years
Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) Response Rate, PSA response rate will be measured as the percentage of change in PSA from baseline to 12 weeks on therapy (or earlier if participants discontinue therapy prior to 12 weeks) as well as the maximum decline in PSA that occurs at any point during treatment, Up to 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with a measurable response using either Prostate Specific Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria for prostate cancer patients or RECIST v1.1 for genitourinary cancer., Up to 5 years|Number of participants with presence of somatic mutations, The presence of somatic mutations (yes/no) in a panel of prostate cancer-related, genitourinary cancer-related and targetable genes will be identified for each participant and will be summarized by mutation using descriptive statistics., Up to 5 years|Comparison of pathway activity signatures and overall survival, The log-rank test will be used to test if any identified pathway activity signatures or tumor histologies predicts overall survival., Up to 5 years
After performing tumor biopsies and blood collection and processing the biopsies and research blood for comprehensive molecular analysis using established methods for RNA and DNA analysis, we will use Pathway Recognition using Data Integration on Genomic Models (PARADIGM) and Differential Pathway Signature Correlation (DiPSC), computational approaches to pathway activity and predictive signature identification developed at University of California, Santa Cruz. We will also collect blood samples (for circulating tumor DNA, plasma, and serum) and circulating tumor cells from participating patients. Residual paraffin- embedded blocks, frozen tissue, and blood products (serum, plasma, and circulating cells) will be stored in a repository for future testing of candidate predictive markers identified during microarray analysis. We will utilize only Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratories(e.g. Strata Oncology) to identify genetic mutations within mCRPC tumors to provide genetic information that can be returned to patient to potentially inform treatment decisions.

Certain genomic sequencing will be performed by Strata Oncology.

Following biopsy and baseline peripheral blood collection, patients will be treated per investigator discretion, with treatment corresponding to assigned patient cohort and initiated within 42 days following baseline tumor biopsy and/or research blood collection. Patients will be evaluated for response to therapy per the standard of care for their specific disease type; such as with monthly serum PSA measurements (may be done at UCSF or at local laboratory) and/or restaging scans (bone scan + CT abdomen/pelvis) (UCSF or local radiology facility). Outcomes on treatment post-biopsy will be recorded, including maximal PSA decline, date of radiographic progression.

At the time of disease progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria for prostate cancer patients, or by RECIST v1.1 for patients with metastatic renal or urothelial cancer, patients may undergo optional repeat assessment for metastatic tumor biopsy, along with mandatory blood collection for analysis of circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Following second biopsy at progression, patients should continue to be followed for response to subsequent therapy.

Patients will be followed every 6 months for updates on disease status including post-study therapies and survival status via telephone calls and/or chart review.
