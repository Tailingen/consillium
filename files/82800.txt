Adrenocortical Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), using RECIST v1.1 A Simon two stage minimax design will be employed to carry out this objective. In the first stage, 21 patients will be enrolled. If at least 3 out of 21 patients respond (partial response - PR or complete response - CR), we will enroll an additional 18 patients for a total of 39 patients. At the end of the study, 8 of 39 patients will need to respond to consider the therapy promising. The study will be complete when all subjects have either completed 24 months of drug therapy, progressed, or discontinued from the study for other reasons.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 2 years
