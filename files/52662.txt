Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of Anti-HER2 Therapy in Nigerian Women With HER2+ Breast Cancer Before and After Surgery
Doctors leading this study would like to learn about providing cancer treatment/therapies to Nigerian women with breast cancer based on their human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. This study will focus on the efficacy and safety of anti-HER2 cancer treatment before and after surgery.
Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 Negative Carcinoma of Breast|HER2-positive Breast Cancer|Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab emtansine|DRUG: Pertuzumab Injection|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Goserelin
Pathological Complete Response, Pathological complete response of giving three-weekly docetaxel + subcutaneous trastuzumab and Pertuzumab with Tamoxifen/Letrozole added ) to Nigerian women with Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-positive) breast cancer as assessed by the absence of invasive neoplastic cells at microscopic examination of the primary tumor and lymph nodes at surgery., 10 years
Reported Adverse Events and clinical/medical records of participants, Reported adverse events among participants receiving three-weekly docetaxel + subcutaneous trastuzumab and Pertuzumab with Tamoxifen/Letrozole added ) to Nigerian women with Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-positive) breast cancer as assessed by the incidence and severity of adverse events and serious adverse drug reactions including clinical laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiogram and dose interruptions. Adverse events will be defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Grade 4), 10 years|Percentage of participants who are suitable for breast-conserving surgery, To determine suitability of patients for breast conserving surgery after neoadjuvant treatment with docetaxel and PHESGO as assessed by the percentage of patients with breast conservative surgery following neoadjuvant therapy., 10 years|Event-free survival duration reported among participants, Event-free responses defined as time from first dose of study drug treatment to progression or death due to any cause, as assessed by investigators., 10 years|Quality of life reported among study participants, Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed by various domains of QoL over time and the changes from baseline using a QoL instrument (a global/breast module) validated by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). QLQ-C30 version 3.0 and Breast Cancer Module QLQ-BR23 low scores on scale of 0-4 indicates better financial wellbeing, 10 years|Genetic and epigenetic factors associated with breast cancer in Nigeria, To assess the genetic and epigenetic factors associated with breast cancer in Nigeria asa assessed by correlative study of molecular markers and tumor subtypes/tumor biology with patient's characteristics, response or resistance to treatment and participants' outcome., 10 years

This study will focus on the efficacy and safety of anti-HER2 cancer treatment before and after surgery. Participants with HER2-positive breast cancer will receive a combination of trastuzumab with pertuzumab (PHESGO) plus chemotherapy.
