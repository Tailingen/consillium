Study of US-ATG-F to Prevent Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)
The study objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of US-ATG-F as a supplement to standard of care prophylaxis versus standard of care prophylaxis alone in moderate to severe chronic GVHD-free survival.

This study is randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study evaluating the prevention of moderate to severe chronic GVHD in patients undergoing bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from matched, unrelated donors for acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome during the first year after transplant.

Patients meeting all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized (1:1). All patients will receive premedication and study drug 3 days prior to transplantation.
