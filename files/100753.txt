Open Label Prostate Cancer Study
The main purpose of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD3514 when given orally to patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: AZD3514
To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD3514 when given orally to patients with CRPC., At every visit.
To define the MTD, if possible, a lower biologically-effective dose(s) or maximum feasible dose (if decided by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) and AstraZeneca)., After each Cohort.|To characterise the PK of AZD3514 after a single oral dose and at steady state after multiple oral doses., After each Cohort.|To obtain an assessment of the activity of AZD3514 as monotherapy and/or in combination with abiraterone acetate on the circulating levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)., Visits 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, follow-up visits, discontinuation visit|To obtain a preliminary assessment of the anti-tumour activity of AZD3514 as monotherapy and/or in combination with abiraterone acetate by evaluation of counts of Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs)., Visits 1, 6, 8, 9, 10, follow-up visits, discontinuation visit|To obtain an assessment of the activity of AZD3514 as monotherapy and/or in combination with abiraterone acetate on the circulating levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)., Visits 1, 10, follow-up visits, discontinuation visit|To investigate safety, tolerability, MTD (and/or biologically-effective dose(s) or maximum feasible dose) and PK of AZD3514 and abiraterone when administered in combination, in patients who have not received prior treatment with abiraterone acetate, At every visit|To compare the PK of AZD3514 monotherapy in patients who have been fed or fasted before the administration of study treatment, At visits 2 and 4|To investigate the effect of AZD3514 on biomarkers of AR expression in paired pre- and post-dose tumour biopsies., July 2012 - Feb 2013
