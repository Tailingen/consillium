Phase I Study of Adoptive Immunotherapy With Enriched and Expanded Autologous Natural Killer (NK) Cells for Patients With Ph+ Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
The present study aims at studying how safe and tolerable a new therapy for patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is.

This new therapy consists of an immunotherapy, that is an approach focusing on the immune system, and it targets ALL patients in complete remission but who may still have the disease at a cellular level (this is called 'minimal residual disease').

For any further information, please, discuss with your treating physician.

Number of adverse events., To assess the safety and tolerabilty of the treatment by evaluating frequency, type and intensity of adverse events (AEs) according to the CTC classification, as well as the patients' compliance and clinically relevant changes in the laboratory parameters., Two years from start of treatment.|Number of patients able to complete the study., To evaluate the feasibility of the procedure in terms of number of patients able to complete the study and time to complete enrolment., One year from start of treatment.|Time to complete enrolment., Protocol feasibility., Three years from first patient enrollment.|Number and characteristics of immunologic modifications., To assess the immunologic modifications induced by the procedure; in particular, to verify the functional and cytotoxic activity against tumor cell lines and primary fresh allogeneic and autologous blasts cryopreserved at diagnosis, and to monitor the frequency, phenotype and activation status of the infused NK cell populations by flow cytometry analyses, Chromium release cytotoxic assays and intracellular cytokine production., One year from start of treatment.|Number of patients who respond to treatment., To evaluate the clinical response to the treatment in terms of control of MRD with quantitative (Q)- RT-PCR., One year from treatment start.|Number of patients alive after treatment conclusion., To evaluate OS in terms of number of patients alive., Two years from treatment start.|Number of patients alive without progression., To evaluate the TTP in terms of number of patients alive without progression., One year from treatment start.
This is an open label, multicenter, phase I study of adoptive immunotherapy with enriched and expanded autologous natural killer (NK) cells for patients with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in complete hematologic remission (CHR) but with persistent/recurrent minimal residual disease (MRD) â‰¥60 years or not eligible for other post-CHR treatment modalities.

The study will investigate the safety and tolerability of a new type of NK-based immunotherapy based on the infusion of escalating doses of ex-vivo expanded autologous NK cells in Ph+ ALL patients. A maximum of 6 patients will be enrolled in two different steps. No conditioning therapies will be administered before the infusion of the expanded NK cells. Patients may receive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) maintenance.
