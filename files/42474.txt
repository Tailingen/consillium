Study to Evaluate the Efficiency of SOX as Seconde-line Chemotherapy in Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
Currently, there is no standard second line treatment for patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma. SOX regimen has shown promising in previous study. The study was designed to confirm thet SOX regimen can be used as a second-line regimen for patients with advanced or metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma who have progressed after first-line chemotherapy with platinum based regimen.
Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
DRUG: SOX
Overall response rate (ORR), CT/MRI will be performed every 2 cycles of treatment for efficacy evaluation by RECIST 1.1, From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first documented radiological progression or death due to any cause, baseline, every 8 weeks up to 1 year after last patient first treatment|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of start of treatment to date of death due to any cause, baseline, every 8 weeks up to 1 year after last patient first treatment|Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events （Safety and Tolerability）, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
