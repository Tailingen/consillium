Erlotinib, Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This is a phase 1b study to evaluate the combination of gemcitabine and Tarceva (erlotinib) and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: erlotinib|DRUG: gemcitabine|DRUG: nab-paclitaxel
Maximum Tolerated Dose, Monthly (to a maximum of 12 months)
Safety of drug combination assessed through dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 1 month|Safety of drug combination assessed through Adverse Events (AEs), Monthly (to a maximum of 12 months)|Evaluate erlotinib Pharmacokinetic (PK) trough concentrations (C24h), Days 29 (Cycle 2, Day 1) and 30|Objective Response Rate, Response will be based on the RECIST v1.1 criteria. Patients with partial and complete response will be classified as "responders"., Monthly (to a maximum of 12 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be calculated as the time from start of treatment until disease progression or death; patients who are still alive and free of progression at their last follow-up will be censored at that time., Monthly (to a maximum of 12 months)|Overall Survival, Survival will be calculated as the time from start of treatment until death of any cause, patients who are still alive at their last follow-up will be censored at that time., Monthly (to a maximum of 12 months)
This is a single-arm, phase 1b study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of erlotinib (daily), gemcitabine (weekly), nab-paclitaxel (weekly) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
