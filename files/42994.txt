Targeting Driver Oncogenes With a Peptide Vaccine Plus Durvalumab and Tremelimumab for Patients With Biliary Tract Cancers (BTC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the immune response of personalized mutant peptide vaccine with poly-ICLC adjuvant (mBTCvax) in combination with durvalumab and tremelimumab following front-line treatment in patients with advanced stage BTC.
Biliary Tract Cancers
DRUG: mBTC vax [0.3 - 2.4 mg peptide + 0.5 mg Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol)]|DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab
Number of participants experiencing grade 3 or above drug-related toxicities, When calculating the incidence of Adverse Events (AE), each AE (as defined by NCI CTCAE v5.0) will be counted only once for a given subject., 20 Months|Maximum percentage change in interferon-producing mutant-specific cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T cells., Evaluated by the maximal percent change in interferon-producing mutant-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells within 20 weeks post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination baseline., Baseline to 20 weeks post vaccination (baseline, 20 weeks)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the number of months from the date of first vaccine dose until the date of disease progression using RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, for BTC patients. PFS will be censored at the date of the last scan for subjects without documentation of disease progression at the time of analysis. Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Complete Response (CR) = disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR) is =\>30percent decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, Progressive Disease (PD) is \>20percent increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, Stable Disease (SD) is \<30percent decrease or \<20percent increase in sum of diameters of target lesions. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be defined as the number of months from the date of first vaccine dose until date of death due to any cause. OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at time of analysis. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 4 years
