Pilot Study of Redirected Autologous T Cells Engineered to Contain Humanized Anti-CD19 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD19+ Leukemia and Lymphoma Previously Treated With Cell Therapy
This is a pilot study to evaluate humanized CD19 redirected autologous T cells (or huCART19 cells) in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19+ leukemia and lymphoma that was previously treated with cell therapy. This study is targeting pediatric patients aged 1-24 years with CD19+ B cell malignancies with no available curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation) who have a limited prognosis with currently available therapies and were previously treated with a B cell directed engineered cell therapy product.
