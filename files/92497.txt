Flumatinib Efficacy and Safety for New Diagnosed Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
The overall survival (OS)of Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been significantly improved since the advent of Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) .Nevertheless, there still exists a amount of patients who has poor response or intolerance for TKI drugs( Imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib). Flumatinib has been shown to be a more potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase than imatinib,and it aslo has better security when compared to other TKIs(Imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib).It will be a better chioce for CML patients.
