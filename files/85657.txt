Radiation Therapy and Tamoxifen in Treating Adults With Newly Diagnosed Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as tamoxifen may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining radiation therapy with tamoxifen in treating patients who have newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: tamoxifen citrate|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Overall Survival, From registration to date of death or last follow-up. Analysis occurs after all patients have been potentially followed for 18 months.
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether high-dose tamoxifen initiated at the beginning of conventional radiotherapy improves the median survival time of adults with newly diagnosed, supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the feasibility and toxicity of high-dose tamoxifen in these patients. III. Determine the overall survival with respect to protein kinase C lab correlates in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Beginning within 5 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy to the brain 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients receive high-dose oral tamoxifen every 6 hours beginning on day 1 of radiotherapy and continuing in the absence of disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months through year 1, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
