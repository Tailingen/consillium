Efficacy and Safety of SKB264 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Initially Unresectable Stage III NSCLC
This study is a phase 2 open-label, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety SKB264 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

This study is a phase 2 open-label, multicenter clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety SKB264 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer. The study includes a screening period (up to 28 days after the subject signs the informed consent form until before the first dose), a treatment period (including an induction treatment period, a local treatment period (surgery or radical radiotherapy), and a consolidation treatment period), and a follow-up period (including two parts of safety follow-up and survival follow-up).

Approximately 50 patients with initially unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients, without EGFR/ALK/ROS-1-sensitive mutations, without chest radiotherapy and systemic anti-tumor therapy, were enrolled and treated with Sacituzumab tirumotecan (SKB264) in combination with pembrolizumab until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or meeting the criteria for discontinuation of the trial drug.

The primary endpoint is the investigator-assessed 18-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate of intention-to-treat population (ITT). Secondary endpoints include event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), R0 surgical resection rate, complete response (pCR) rate, major pathological response (MPR) rate and safety, objective response rate (ORR) in the induce treatment period. Recruitment for the study is expected to begin in mainland China around January 2025, with the trial anticipated to conclude in January 2028.
