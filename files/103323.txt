Omega-3 Fatty Acids in Treating Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer
This phase I trial is studying the best way to give omega-3 fatty acids in treating patients with advanced prostate cancer. Omega-3 fatty acids may slow disease progression and may be an effective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer

OBJECTIVES:

I. To conduct a pilot study of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) (omega-3 fatty acid) supplementation in a group of patients with advanced prostate cancer to assess the dose of omega-3 PUFA necessary to achieve an omega-6 to -3 ratio of 1:1 on an individual basis and to assess the clinical impact of omega-3 supplementation on disease progression

OUTLINE:

Patients receive long-term omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation orally (PO).

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 6, and 12 months.
