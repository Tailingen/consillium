S8947-9800-9911-0016A Vitamin D Insufficiency in Determining Prognosis in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Follicular Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Studying samples of serum from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: This research study is studying vitamin D insufficiency in determining prognosis in patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma.
Lymphoma
OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Progression-free survival, retrospective
Objective response (confirmed and unconfirmed complete and partial responses), retrospective
OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the role of pre-treatment serum 25(OH)D with regard to progression-free survival and objective response among patients with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma, within the context of a uniformly treated and evaluated Phase III clinical trial in the modern therapeutic era.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Pre-treatment serum samples are analyzed for 25(OH)D levels to determine vitamin D sufficiency or insufficiency.
