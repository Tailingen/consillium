Imatinib Mesylate and Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
RATIONALE: Imatinib mesylate and sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of imatinib mesylate given together with sunitinib in treating patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
DRUG: imatinib mesylate|DRUG: sunitinib malate|OTHER: pharmacological study
Maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate in combination with sunitinib malate, at 6 weeks
Toxicity profile as assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0, every 6 weeks|Pharmacokinetics, days 15 & 43|Preliminary data on anti-tumor activity of these drugs as assessed by RECIST, 18 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate in combination with sunitinib malate in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
* To determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* To determine the antitumor activity in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-14 in course 1 and on days 1-42 in all subsequent courses. Beginning in course 2, patients also receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily on days 1-42. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Blood samples are collected on day 15 and day 43 for pharmacokinetics.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.
