Comparison Study of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy by Multimodal Method in Breast Cancer
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a mainstay surgery method in breast cancer. It provides the surgeon the evidence of axillary lymph node metastasis, which determines the extent of surgery. Because effective SLNB can decrease the extent of axillary lymph node dissection, it is increasingly important. In general, radioactive colloid has been used for SLNB. In order to pursue more precise SLNB, the investigators developed a multimodal method enabling visual guidance with the mixture of indocyanine green, blue dye and radioisotope.

In this study, our hypotheses are as following:

1. Multimodal method enables to increase identification rate of SLNB
2. blue dye and indocyanine green provide the surgeon visual guidance to ensure better outcome
3. Multimodal method alleviates the shortcomings of indocyanine green and blue dye as an identification strategy
Breast Neoplasms
DEVICE: the mixture including indocyanine green|DEVICE: radioisotope
Time to sentinel lymph node biopsy, From the date of randomization, skin necrosis and dye staining are assessed up to 6 months after the operation (post op 3 mon and 6 mon follow-up)., up to 6 months
Identification rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy, The number of participants with sentinel lymph node detection is assessed up to 13 months., 13 months
Indocyanine green Advantages: provides visualization of sentinel lymph node without incision

Blue dye Advantages: easy to employ; no toxicity Disadvantages: diffusion; absorption and disappearance of the marking within minutes

Radioisotope Advantages: can be used for lesions not accessible to Ultrasound; ideal for selective uptake to sentinel lymph node Disadvantages: not able to use palpation and visualization, confirms by gamma-probe only
