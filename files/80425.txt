Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) for Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of urinary and gastrointestinal acute and late side effects in patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the prostate. Stereotactic radiation therapy is given as five treatments over a 2-3 week period. The prostate is localized and the plan is reoptimized as needed prior to each treatment.

This protocol requires radiation treatments to be performed with a stereotactic technique with the use of a 3-D coordinate system defined by implanted transponders (i.e. Calypso) or use of the ExacTrac system and/or use cone-beam CT (CBCT) with fiducial markers.
