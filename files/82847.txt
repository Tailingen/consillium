Platform Study of Circulating Tumor DNA Directed Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Colon Cancer (KCSG CO22-12)
This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized phase 3 clinical trial. It aims to investigate if the early introduction of intensified chemotherapy (3 months of modified FOLFIRINOX) improves the 3-year disease-free survival rate compared to standard treatment (FOLFOX/CAPOX for an additional three months to complete six months of standard adjuvant chemotherapy) in patients with stage 2-3 colon cancer in whom ctDNA MRD in the part 1 study remained positive during adjuvant FOLFOX/CAPOX chemotherapy
Colon Cancer
DRUG: mFOLFIRINOX-FOLFIRI intensified chemotherapy|DRUG: FOLFOX or CAPOX adjuvant chemotherapy
3-year disease-free survival rate, The rate refers to cases that see first tumor metastasis or recurrence or death of any cause from randomization, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 36 months)
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) clearance rate, The proportion of patients with circulating tumor DNA clearance after 36months study treatment., The data of ctDNA clearance rate will be collected at 10 time points|5-year overall survival rate (5y-OS rate), Overall survival is defined as the time from beginning of study treatment until death due to any cause., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 60 months)|Treatment-Related Adverse Events, The number of patients with adverse events and the severity according to CTCAE v5.0., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 36 months)|EORTC QLQ-C30 scale, Using the EORTC QLQ-C30 scale (European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30) to evaluate the quality of life of patients., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 36 months)
About 25% of resectable high-risk stage 2 or stage 3 colon cancers are known to relapse despite standard treatments, including radical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.

Using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based minimal residual cancer (MRD) detection technology, patients whose MRD is not eradicated after adjuvant chemotherapy could be identified. Early introduction of intensified chemotherapy for this group of patients could prolong survival time and increase cure rates.

This study is part of the Platform Study of Circulating Tumor DNA Directed Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Colon Cancer (CLADIA Colon Cancer). Part 1 of the platform study (Prospective Observational Study of ctDNA Monitoring During Adjuvant) is a large-scale, prospective observational study that follows ctDNA up to three years after resection in about 1,200 patients with stage 2-3 colon cancer.

This study (Part 2) aims to study the efficacy of early intensified chemotherapy (3 months of modified FOLFIRINOX ) compared to standard treatment (FOLFOX/CAPOX for an additional three months to complete six months of standard adjuvant chemotherapy) in patients with stage 2-3 colon cancer in whom ctDNA MRD in the part 1 study remained positive during adjuvant FOLFOX/CAPOX chemotherapy.
