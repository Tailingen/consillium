Onalespib, Dabrafenib, and Trametinib in Treating Patients With BRAF-Mutant Melanoma or Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic or Cannot Be Removed by Surgery
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of onalespib when given together with dabrafenib and trametinib in treating patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma or solid tumors that have spread to another place in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Onalespib, dabrafenib, and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

* any grade 4 toxicity
* grade 3 (or grade 2 intolerable) non-hematologic toxicity (including fatigue lasting \>1 week or that requires hospitalization)
* grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity with complications (e.g., thrombocytopenia with bleeding, neutropenia with fever)
* toxicity that lead to missing a dose of onalespib or \>25% of dabrafenib/trametinib in the first cycle

The following grade 3 toxicities are not considered DLTs:

* cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or keratoacanthoma
* nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea persisting \</= 72 hours with maximum supportive care
* electrolyte events that resolve with replacement within 24 hours
* any grade lymphopenia
* lab abnormalities that return to baseline within 7 days: elevated bilirubin, AST, ALT, cholesterol, amylase, lipase, creatinine, hypertriglyceridemia, 28 days after start of treatment (1 cycle)
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate is defined as the number of participants with complete response or partial response as their best response to therapy assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1.

* Complete response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial response (PR) = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., up to 9 months|Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progressive disease assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1, or death, whichever occurs first.

Progressive disease (PD) = At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions., up to 9 months|Progression-free Survival at 6 Months, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progressive disease assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1, or death, whichever occurs first. PFS at 6 months will report the number of participants without progression at 6 months after starting treatment.

Pharmacokinetics of Dabrafenib, Trametinib, and Onalespib Combination, Pharmacokinetics (PKs) represents the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of study drugs from the body.

PKs for this study are reported a Area Under the Curve (AUC), which is estimated using the trapezoidal rule based on the average drug concentrations in blood samples, specifically blood plasma, at 1 hour immediately after study drug infusion.

AUC gives insight into the extent of exposure to a drug and its clearance rate from the body., 1 hour immediately after Cycle 1, Day 1 infusion

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of onalespib. Four dose levels, plus a fallback dose, are specified in the protocol and are summarized below. The trial is based on a standard 3+3 design with dose escalation beginning in dose level 1 (DL1). In a 3+3 design," three patients are initially enrolled into a given dose cohort. If there is no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observed in any of these subjects, the trial proceeds to enroll additional subjects into the next higher dose cohort. If one subject develops a DLT at a specific dose, an additional three subjects are enrolled into that same dose cohort. Development of DLTs in more than 1 of 6 subjects in a specific dose cohort suggests that the maximum total dose (MTD) has been exceeded, and further dose escalation is not pursued. Fallback dose level -1 is initiated if more than 1 of 6 subjects in dose level 1 (starting dose) develop DLTs.

Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), trametinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28, and onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Dose Level -1 (fallback dose):

* Dabrafenib = 75 mg
* Trametinib = 1 mg
* Onalespib = 180 mg/m\^2

Dose Level 1 (starting dose):

* Dabrafenib = 150 mg
* Trametinib = 1 mg
* Onalespib = 180 mg/m\^2

Dose Level 2:

* Dabrafenib = 150 mg
* Trametinib = 2 mg
* Onalespib = 180 mg/m\^2

Dose Level 3:

* Dabrafenib = 150 mg
* Trametinib = 2 mg
* Onalespib = 220 mg/m\^2

Dose Level 4:

* Dabrafenib = 150 mg
* Trametinib = 2 mg
* Onalespib = 260 mg/m\^2

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and every 6 months for up to 2 years.
