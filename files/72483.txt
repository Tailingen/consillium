A Phase I Study of Epitinib(HMPL-813) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Epitinib (HMPL-813) is a selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Epitinib has demonstrated strong inhibitory effects on multiple tumors with overexpressed EGFR or sensitive EGFR mutations in pre-clinical setting. This first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of Epitinib.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Epitinib
incidence of all types/grades of adverse events, for each patient, adverse events are collected from the date of consent until 30 days after trial discontinuation, from first patient in till 30 days after the last patient last visit. It is estimated that last patient last visit happens in Oct 2016.
Objective Response Rate, An average of one year|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Based on single-dose PK result, multi-dose stage subjects take epitinib either once a day or twice a day. For twice a day epitinib uptake, on day 1/14/28, PK samples are collected predose, 1, 4, 8, 12 hours post-dose in the morning and 4 hours post-dose in the evening. On day 2/3/7, PK samples are collected predose, 4, 12 hours post-dose in the morning and 4 hours post-dose in the evening. On day 15/29/56, PK samples are collected predose in the morning.

For once a day epitinib uptake, on day 1/14/28 PK samples are collected predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose. On day 7, PK samples are collected predose and 4 hours post-dose. On day 2/15/29/56, PK samples are collected predose in the morning., At single-dose stage (day 1-day 7): predose, 0.5,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,12,24, 36, 48, 72, 144 hours post-dose.|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Based on single-dose PK result, multi-dose stage subjects take epitinib either once a day or twice a day. For twice a day epitinib uptake, on day 1/14/28, PK samples are collected predose, 1, 4, 8, 12 hours post-dose in the morning and 4 hours post-dose in the evening. On day 2/3/7, PK samples are collected predose, 4, 12 hours post-dose in the morning and 4 hours post-dose in the evening. On day 15/29/56, PK samples are collected predose in the morning.
