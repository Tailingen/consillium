Safety And Efficacy Study Of The Combination Of CpG 7909 And Herceptin In Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of CPG 7909 and Herceptin is safe and effective in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

RATIONALE: There is preclinical data that supports the hypothesis that CPG 7909 may potentiate the action of Herceptin. This Phase I/II study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination treatment of CPG 7909 and Herceptin in patients with metastatic breast cancer who have previously been treated with Herceptin and chemotherapy.

SCHEDULE: Patients will receive CPG 7909 weekly for up to six months.

Phase I: To evaluate the safety, tolerability and and MTD of several dose levels of CPG 7909 of CPG 7909 in combination with the standard Herceptin® treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer|Phase II: Evaluate tumor response and safety of CPG 7909 in combination with Herceptin® in patients with metastatic breast cancer
Phase I: To evaluate tumor response, duration of response, time to disease progression, and survival time|Phase II: To evaluate duration of response, time to disease progression, and survival time
Phase II part of study not initiated because the development plan modified the route of administration to subcutaneous injection.
