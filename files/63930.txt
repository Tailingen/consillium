PD-1 Combined With Adjuvant Chemotherapy and Antivascular Therapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in Patients With Operable Triple-negative Breast Cancer
This review will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of SHR1210 (carrelizumab) compared with the antivascular drug famitinib in combination with anthracyclines/taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy (carrelizumab + FAM + EC-P) compared with conventional chemotherapy regimens (dose-intensive epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, sequential paclitaxel, or EC-P) in patients with early-stage high-risk TNBC.
