Study of Volasertib and Belinostat in Patients With Relapsed and Refractory Aggressive B-cell and T-cell Lymphomas
This phase 1, multicenter, open-label study is designed to find the RP2D of volasertib, a PLK1 inhibitor, and belinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, when given in combination to patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell or T-cell lymphoma. A standard 3+3 dose-escalation design will be employed with study enrollment beginning at dose level 1.
Relapsed and Refractory Aggressive B- and T-cell Lymphomas|Lymphoma
DRUG: volasertib|DRUG: belinostat
Maximum Tolerated Doses (MTD), Dose escalation will follow the traditional 3+3 plan to determine the MTD and the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D). The MTD will be defined as that dose level at which ≤ 1/6 patients experience Dose Limited Toxicity (DLT), with ≥ 2/6 experiencing DLT at the next higher dose level.

If the MTD is not reached at dose level 5, consideration will be given to amending the dose level escalation schema to add an additional dose level., up to 2 years|Adverse Events, To evaluate the safety and toxicity of volasertib and belinostat when given in combination, up to 2 years
