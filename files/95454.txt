Exercise Intervention for Pts With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Receiving Abiraterone or Enzalutamide
This randomized pilot study will be conducted in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) within 3 months of initiating abiraterone or enzalutamide. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of a 12 week exercise intervention in mCRPC patients who have recently started on additional androgen suppression therapy.
Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
BEHAVIORAL: Exercise
Change in lean mass between mCPRC patients undergoing a 12-week exercise intervention (intervention group) and mCPRC patients who do not undergo the exercise intervention (control group), DEXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scans will measure lean mass at baseline and after the 12-week intervention., 12 weeks
This randomized pilot study will be conducted in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) within 3 months of initiating abiraterone or enzalutamide. The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of a 12 week exercise intervention in mCRPC patients who have recently started on additional androgen suppression therapy. The investigators will also explore the effects of the exercise training on biomarkers of inflammation-hormonal status and their potential association with changes in lean mass and function.
