Darolutamide With Radium-223 or Placebo and the Effect on Radiological Progression-Free Survival for Patients With mCSPC
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the combination of Darolutamide with Radium-223 or placebo and the effects on radiological progression-free survival for patients with Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostrate Cancer (mCSPC)

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) in mCSPC
* Overall Survival (OS)
* Symptomatic skeletal event-free survival (SSE-FS)
* Initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy
* Safety

Participants will have visits at baseline, treatment is once a month for up to 6 months, and long term follow up will continue until the participant dies, withdraws consent, and/or study is terminated.

DRUG: Darolutamide|DRUG: Radium-223
Radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) in mCSPC patients, The primary objective of this study is to compare the radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) in mCSPC patients treated with darolutamide plus radium-223 versus darolutamide plus placebo. The primary endpoint is radiological progression-free survival rPFS, defined as time to first occurrence of 99mTc MDP+ bone scan progression per PCWG3 criteria, and/or soft tissue progression by CT/MRI per PCWG3 modifications to RECIST 1.1 criteria, or death from any cause. Randomization will be stratified by ECOG performance status 0 vs 1-2, and metastatic disease status, specifically low volume (\<4 bone lesions) versus high volume (â‰¥4 bone lesions)., First occurrence bone scan progression and/or soft tissue progression per #RECIST 1.1 criteria, participant dies, withdraws consent and/or study is terminated, whichever comes first.
Overall Survival (OS) & Symptomatic Skeletal Event-Free Survival (SSE-FS), Overall survival and SSE-FS will be compared between the two arms using a stratified log-rank test, HR (Darolutamide + radium-223 dichloride / Darolutamide + placebo) with 95% CI. Kaplan-Meier estimates and plots for both treatment arms will be produced to accompany these analyses. The median, 25th and 75th percentiles and event free rates at different timepoints with associated 95% CI will be generated.

SSE-FS as defined as the time from randomization until any one of the following:

* the first use of external-beam radiation therapy to relieve skeletal tumor-related symptoms,
* the occurrence of new symptomatic pathologic bone fractures,
* the occurrence of new symptomatic spinal cord compression,
* a tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention, or
* death., Randomization until death.|Initiation of Subsequent Antineoplastic Therapy, Time to initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy will be compared considering death as a competing risk. Treatment arms will be compared with stratified competing risk HR (Darolutamide + radium-223 dichloride / Darolutamide + placebo) with 95% CI. Event rates will be estimated by cumulative incidence., Randomization to initiation of first subsequent antineoplastic therapy for prostrate cancer.|Safety of the combination of radium-223 and Darolutamide, Safety of the combination of radium-223 and Darolutamide will be assessed by the incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) per Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIR) may be provided., First treatment dose until last dose + 30 Days
A novel treatment strategy combining darolutamide and radium-223 is considered for subjects with mCSPC. Response to treatment is monitored every 12 weeks using a continuous measurement. The main scientific question concerns the comparison of radium-223 to placebo and is best addressed by a randomized clinical trial. Use of placebo in this study is considered ethical, as provision is made for subjects to discontinue their treatment and switch to radium-223 due to lack of efficacy on unblinding where it influences current treatment decisions. Switch to rescue medication is an intercurrent event, after which it is still possible to collect the variable measurements as described in sections on study endpoints below. This is also the case after other intercurrent events such as discontinuation of radium-223 treatment due to an adverse event, but not for intercurrent events such as death unrelated to study IP or disease, subject loss to follow-up, or subject withdrawal from all study treatments and procedures.
