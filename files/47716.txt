The Impact of Chronic Mitochondrial Antioxidant Supplementation on CardiovascularToxicity in Breast Cancer Patients
Investigate the protective effect of chronic MitoQ supplementation on cardiovascular toxicity induced by doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Mitoquinone|OTHER: Placebo
Changes of the left ventricular deformity and reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction, Cardiac function changes (Strain and Simpson's monoplanar), 3 Months
Systemic markers of oxidative stress, Mitochondrial oxidative stress; Cardiac markers (B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin I);, 3 Months|Endothelium-dependent dysfunction of peripheral vascular beds, changes in the endothelium-dependent function of peripheral vascular beds, 3 Months|Arterial stiffness, Increase in the arterial stiffness, 3 Months|Central blood pressure, Alterations on the central blood pressure, 3 Months|Physical capacity, Reduction in the peak oxygen uptake, 3 Months
Test the hypothesis that chronic MitoQ supplementation in breast cancer patients treated with doxorubicin prevents:

1. increased mitochondrial oxidative stress;
2. the increase in cardiac markers (B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin I);
3. changes in left ventricular deformity (speckle tracking, strain) and reduction in LVEF;
4. endothelium-dependent dysfunction of peripheral vascular beds;
5. the increase in endothelial microvesicles;
6. the increase in material stiffness;
7. the elevation of central blood pressure.
