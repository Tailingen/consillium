Study to Evaluate Adverse Events, Change in Disease Activity, Movement of Oral ABBV-623 and ABBV-992 Tablets in the Body of Adult Participants With B-cell Cancers
B-cell cancer is an aggressive and rare cancer of a type of immune cells (a white blood cell responsible for fighting infections). The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABBV-623 and ABBV-992 given alone and in combination in treating B-cell cancers. Adverse events, change in disease activity and how the drug moves through the body of adult participants with B-cell cancers will be evaluated.

ABBV-623 and ABBV-992 are investigational drugs being developed for the treatment of B-cell cancer. Study doctors assign participants to one of six groups, called treatment arms. Approximately 105 adult participants with a diagnosis of B-cell cancer will be enrolled in the study at approximately 50 sites worldwide.

Participants in the combination expansion treatment arms will receive oral tablets of ABBV-623 and/or ABBV-992 once daily for 24 months. All other arms are treated until progression.

Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of treatment will be evaluated by medical assessments and blood tests. Adverse events will be collected and assessed throughout the clinical trial.

DRUG: ABBV-623|DRUG: ABBV-992
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above., Up to approximately 25 months.|Dose Escalation: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of ABBV-623, The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax; measured in ng/mL) is the highest concentration that ABBV-623 achieves in the blood after administration in a dosing interval., Up to approximately 96 weeks|Dose Escalation: Area Under the Plasma Concentration- Time Curve (AUC) From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Measurable Concentration of ABBV-623, The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC; measured in h\*ng/mL/mg) is a method of measurement of the total exposure of ABBV-623 in blood plasma., Up to approximately 96 weeks|Dose Escalation: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of ABBV-992, The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax; measured in ng/mL) is the highest concentration that ABBV-992 achieves in the blood after administration in a dosing interval., Up to approximately 96 weeks.|Dose Escalation: Area Under the Plasma Concentration- Time Curve (AUC) From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Measurable Concentration of ABBV-992, The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC; measured in h\*ng/mL/mg) is a method of measurement of the total exposure of ABBV-992 in blood plasma., Up to approximately 96 weeks|Combination Dose Expansion: Overall Response Rate (ORR) (PR or Better by IWCLL Criteria) in Participants With R/R CLL/SLL, ORR is the proportion of R/R CLL/SLL participants achieving a response of PR or better per IWCLL without the use of new anti-cancer therapy., Up to approximately 2 years
