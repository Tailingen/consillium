Prostate cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancer in men. For its treatment, recent technological advances demonstrate that the most effective treatment is the Radical Prostatectomy (RP) procedure. However, although curative for Prostate Cancer, can result in damage to the cavernosal nerves.

The cavernosal autonomic nerves travel posterolaterally to the prostate to enter the penis and regulate blood flow and hence erection. Thus, damage caused by RP will affect NO tissue release and blood flow regulation, causing erectile dysfunction.

BZ371A has the ability to restore local blood flow regulation by a new and innovative mechanism of action and, therefore, has potential to be a supportive therapy for RP patients (restoring the erectile function).

Thus, this study aims to evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerabilty of BZ371A on the recovery of erectile function of patients that were underwent Radical Prostatectomy.
