Optimal Postoperative Pain Management After Lung Surgery (OPtriAL)
Adequate pain control after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lung resection is important to improve postoperative mobilisation, recovery, and to prevent pulmonary complications. So far, no consensus exists on optimal postoperative pain management after VATS anatomic lung resection.

Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is the reference standard for postoperative pain management following VATS. Although the analgesic effect of TEA is clear, it is associated with patient immobilisation, bladder dysfunction and hypotension which may result in delayed recovery and longer hospitalisation. These disadvantages of TEA initiated the development of unilateral regional techniques for pain management. The most frequently used techniques are continuous paravertebral block (PVB) and single-shot intercostal nerve block (ICNB).

The investigators hypothesize that using either PVB or ICNB is non-inferior to TEA regarding postoperative pain and superior regarding quality of recovery (QoR). Signifying faster postoperative mobilisation, reduced morbidity and shorter hospitalisation, these techniques may therefore reduce health care costs and improve patient satisfaction.

PROCEDURE: Thoracic epidural analgesia|PROCEDURE: Continuous regional paravertebral block|PROCEDURE: Single shot intercostal nerve block
Pain scores, Proportion of pain scores ≥4 as assessed by the numerical rating scale (NRS) (measured from 0 until 10; lowest value signifying no pain and highest value signifying worst pain), Postoperative day 0-2|Quality of Recovery (QoR), QoR measured with the QoR-15 questionnaire on postoperative 1 and 2 (maximum score of 150, the higher the score the better the outcome), Postoperative day 1-2
cumulative use of opioids and analgesics, total opioid and non-opioid consumption as supplementary analgesic requirement, Postoperative day 0 until 3 as well as the use and dosage of opioid use at the follow-up period 2-3 weeks after the operation|postoperative complications, according to the Clavien-Dindo classification;, until 2-3 weeks of follow-up|hospitalisation, defined as the total number of days in hospital after the surgical intervention (including readmissions within the first 30 postoperative days), the following standardised discharge criteria after surgery will be applied in all participating hospitals: normal intake of nutrition, independent mobility, absence of fever (\<38 °C), and no presence of chest tube;, 30 postoperative days|patient satisfaction, 5-point Likert scale: not at all satisfied, slightly satisfied, neutral, very satisfied and extremely satisfied, Postoperative day 0 until 3|degree of mobility, 4-point scale: on the bed (1), to the chair (2), to the toilet (3), outside the patient's hospital room(4), Postoperative day 0 until 3
