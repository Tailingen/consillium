Novel Targeted Drugs Combined With R-ICE Regimen in Relapsed and Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
A single-center, open, single-arm clinical study of the efficacy and safety of a novel targeted agent in combination with R-ICE in the treatment of relapsed and refractory diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Zanubrutinib plus R-ICE|DRUG: Decitabine plus R-ICE|DRUG: Chidamide plus R-ICE|DRUG: Tofacitinib plus R-ICE|DRUG: Pomalidomide plus R-ICE
Complete response rate after 3 cycle chemotherapy, Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., At the end of cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)
Objective remission rate after 3 cycle chemotherapy, Percentage of participants with complete response or partial response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., At the end of cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)|2 year progression free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|2 year overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Chemotherapy-related adverse reactions, Any harmful reaction that occurs during the treatment of a disease according to the normal usage and dosage of a drug, which is unrelated to the purpose of treatment., At the end of cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)
Refractory recurrence of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma inclusion/exclusion standard subjects in a signed written informed consent, according to the results of genotyping, divided the patients into MCD, TP53, BN2, EZB, ST2, NOS, N1, a total of 7 kinds of types. New targeted drugs were added based on typing results: Zanubrutinib for MCD and BN2, Decitabine for TP53, Chidamide for EZB, Tofacitinib for ST2, and Pomalidomide for N1 and NOS. After 3 courses of treatment, PET-CT was used to evaluate the efficacy. Patients with CR/PR, aged â‰¤65 years, qualified and willing for transplantation, were treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT); Patients who did not meet the above requirements or failed to collect autologous hematopoietic stem cells were placed on new targeted drug maintenance therapy for up to 12 months; If patients were evaluated as SD and PD after 3 cycles, they were treated with other regiments. New targeted drugs combined with R-ICE and ASCT were evaluated every 3 months in the first year and every 6 months in the second and third years after treatment.
