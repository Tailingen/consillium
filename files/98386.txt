A total of 1160 hypovitaminosis D patients (12 ng/ml ≤ serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 \< 20 ng/ml) without uterine fibroids will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to two groups: intervention group and control group. The intervention group will receive 1600 IU/d of vitamin D3; the control group will receive regular follow-up. Patients will be followed up at the same time points for 24 months. The outcome measure is the incidence of uterine fibroids in different groups.
