Effect of Omeprazole on the Pharmacokinetics of SHR6390 in Healthy Subjects
This is a one-arm, fixed-sequence study to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of SHR6390 in absence and presence of prior administration of proton pump inhibitor Omeprazole. The increased gastric pH achieved by the treatment with multiple doses of Omeprazole might affect the absorption process of SHR6390.
