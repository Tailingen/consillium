A Study of JNJ-90009530 in Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (r/r B-NHL)
The goal of this multicenter study is to test JNJ-90009530 in Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients. The main questions the study aims to answer are:

* can a dose of JNJ-90009530 be determined that is safe and well tolerated by patients.
* will JNJ-90009530 help patients achieve a response and for how long?
Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: JNJ-90009530
Calculate the Occurence of Adverse Events, The safety and tolerability will be measured by recording the occurence and severity of all adverse events or dose limiting toxicities that occur according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria version 5.0, up to 24 months|Determine Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), Employ a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design and determine the RP2D with review of the number of dose-limiting toxicities, up to 24 months
Determine the Overall Response (OR), Record the number of subjects who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by radiographical assessment using Lugano Criteria 2014, up to 24 months|Determine the time to response (TTR), Record the number of days from the date of JNJ-90009530 infusion to a CR or PR, up to 24 months|Determine the duration of response (DOR), Record the number of days from the date of the first CR or PR to relapse or death., up to 24 months|Measure the amount of JNJ-90009530 in blood over time, Review pharmacokinetics (PK) of JNJ-90009530 by measuring the Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) copy number over time by Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)., up to 24 months
