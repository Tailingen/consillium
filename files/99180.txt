Study Evaluating Tarlatamab in Chinese Participants With Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer After Two or More Prior Lines of Treatment
The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of tarlatamab as assessed by objective response rate (ORR) based on blinded independent central review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1).
