Observation on the Therapeutic Effect of Huaier Granules in the Adjuvant Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Radical Surgery
This study is a multicenter, prospective, and observational clinical study aimed at exploring whether the 3-year DFS in the Huaier group is not inferior to the control group receiving standard platinum dual-drug chemotherapy.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Huaier granule|OTHER: Control
3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate, The proportion of participants who did not experience disease recurrence or death within 3 years after undergoing lung cancer radical surgery., start of treatment until 3-year follow-up
1-year or 2-year DFS rate, The proportion of participants who did not experience disease recurrence or death within 1 or 2 years after undergoing lung cancer radical surgery, start of treatment until 1-year or 2-year follow-up|1-year, 2-year or 3-year overall survival (OS) rate, The proportion of subjects who survived within 1 year, 2 years or 3 years after undergoing radical lung cancer surgery among all subjects., start of treatment until 1-year, 2-year or 3-year follow-up|1-year, 2-year or 3-year local recurrence free survival (LRFS) rates, The proportion of subjects who did not experience local recurrence of lung cancer within 1 year, 2 years or 3 years after undergoing radical lung cancer surgery., start of treatment until 1-year, 2-year or 3-year follow-up|1-year, 2-year or 3-year distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) rates, The proportion of subjects who did not experience distant metastasis within 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years after undergoing lung cancer radical surgery, start of treatment until 1-year, 2-year or 3-year follow-up|Quality of Life Score (SF-36 Scale), The Health Survey Short Form\[(SF-36 Scale (Chinese Version) \]developed by the US Medical Bureau research team was used for evaluation. The scale has 36 items and aims to evaluate the health and functional status of multiple age groups, different diseases, and control populations.Note that all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively., start of treatment until 3-year follow-up|The incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) and severe adverse events (SAE), The definitions and severity grading of AE and SAE can refer to the corresponding descriptions in the definition and evaluation section of AE. The incidence rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who have experienced AE and SAE to the corresponding total population., start of treatment until 3-year follow-up
Changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations, Observe and describe the changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations from baseline, peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations include but are not limited to CD3+T, CD4+T, and CD8+T., start of treatment until 3-year follow-up
This study is a small sample observational study, mainly exploring whether the 3-year DFS of the Huaier group is not inferior to the control group receiving standard platinum dual drug chemotherapy. Therefore, this study will conduct a small sample exploratory analysis. It is expected to include 240 non-small cell lung cancer patients who have been diagnosed with stage Ⅱ-ⅢA and are eligible for surgery at selected research centers from April 2023 to July 2025. Among them, 120 patients in the Huaier Granule group refused to undergo adjuvant chemotherapy due to reasons such as intolerance or disagreement, and agreed to receive Huaier Granule monotherapy as an adjuvant treatment; There are 120 patients in the control group, all of whom plan to receive standard chemotherapy as an adjuvant treatment plan (including platinum based dual-drug combination chemotherapy).
