ERd Combination Treatment in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects that Elranatamab in combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone has on participants that have been newly diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Elranatamab
Minimal residual disease (MRD) (10^-5 sensitivity), Minimal residual disease (MRD) is defined as 0 residual clonal cells in a bone marrow biopsy sample MRD negativity (10\^-5 sensitivity) after 12 cycles, in participants who have been newly diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma receiving Lenalidomide and Low-Dose Dexamethasone (ERd) combination treatment., Up to 2 years
Best Overall Response, The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Will be measured during the first 12 and 24 cycles, in participants who have been newly diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma receiving Lenalidomide and Low-Dose Dexamethasone (ERd) combination treatment.

Will be measured in months., Up to 24 months|Sustained MRD Negativity, The sustained rate of MRD-negativity among participants will be reported. The duration of time in months measured from the first time the participant achieves an MRD-negative bone marrow (BM) biopsy result until the time the participant has relapsed from MRD-negativity objectively documented with an MRD-positive BM result., Up to 2 years|Minimal residual disease (MRD) (10^-6 sensitivity), Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity ( 10\^-6 sensitivity) is defined as 0 residual clonal cells in a bone marrow biopsy anytime in the first 24 cycles, in participants who have been newly diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma receiving Lenalidomide and Low-Dose Dexamethasone (ERd) combination treatment., Up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) among study participants will be assessed during treatment and clinical follow-up. PFS is defined as the time in months from start of treatment until disease progression or death., Up to 24 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) among study participants will be assessed during treatment and clinical follow-up. OS is defined as the time in months from start of treatment until death from any cause., Up to 24 months|Incidence of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), Incidence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), grade of CRS, and management of potentially recurring CRS. CRS will be evaluated according to the standards released by American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria in 2019., Up to 2 years
