Selective Internal Radiation Therapy and 188Re-SSS Lipiodol Treatment for Liver Cancer (Lip-Re2)
The goal of this monocentric interventional study is to evaluate the efficacy, in terms of objective response rate, of the 188Re-SSS lipiodol SIRT in patients with non-operable HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Selective Internal Radiation Therapy with 188Re-SSS lipiodol
The objective response rate, Defined as the best overall response occurring within 6 months' post 188Re-SSS lipiodol injection according to the modified RECIST criteria for hepatocellular carcinoma, through study completion, an average of 4 year
This study is an open-labelled treatment administration study conducted with an exact one-stage one-arm study plan.

The study plans to included 35 patients and to treated 26 patients (take into account screen failures and SIRT contraindications).

The treatment is delivered by a one-day procedure leading to the injection of 188Re-SSS lipiodol. In details, the patient is hospitalized for one night. Two steps are performed while the patient is hospitalized: the pre-treatment simulation step and the treatment step itself.

After treatment, patients are followed until progression, new systemic or locoregional (in the same treatment area) antineoplastic therapy or death, within a maximum 24-month period following the SIRT.
