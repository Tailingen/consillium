A Study of PF-00299804 When Given Through a Feeding Tube in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a study to assess how much of the investigational drug, PF-00298804, is in the blood stream over a period of time (called pharmacokinetic tests or PK) in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have a (gastrojejunostomy) feeding tube.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: PF-00299804
Composite (or Profile) of Pharmacokinetics Time Frame: predose, 0,1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24,48,72, 96 hours post-dose, Cmax, Area Under Curve, Tmax, 3-6 months
Comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters of study subjects with existing phase I pharmacokinetic data following administration of PF-00299804., Tmax=4-24 hrs, Cmax = 28.1 ng/ml, AUCtau=47 hr\*ng/ml, t1/2=85.1, 3-6 months|Overall safety profile as per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0., 3-6 months
This is a single arm pharmacokinetic assessment study conducted at Princess Margaret Hospital in which eligible patients will be enrolled successively to receive a single dose of PF-00299804 in an open-labelled, unblinded manner. All patients will receive 45 mg of PF-00299804 via Gastrostomy (GT) once only on an empty stomach (i.e. 2 hours before or after oral food intake or GT feeds (food intake of less than 500 calories permitted)) as an inpatient. All patients will be admitted for an overnight inpatient stay (approximately 24 hours) to facilitate pharmacokinetic assessment. There will be no dose reductions or modifications. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetics will occur on day 1 immediately prior to the dose of PF-00299804 (t=0), then at t=30 minutes, t=1 hour, t=2 hours, t=3 hours, t=4 hours, t=6 hours, t=12 hours, t=24 hours, t=48 hours, t=72 hours, t=96 hours, t=144 hours, t=168 hours, t=192 hours, and t=216 hours.
