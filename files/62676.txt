Faecal Microbiota Transplantation After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
The aim of this study is to assess the Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) efficacy in the prevention of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) complications and particularly Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD).

The hypothesis of this study is that allogeneic FMT may improve outcomes of these patients.

Graft-versus-host disease and Relapse-Free Survival (GRFS) rate after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, GRFS is a composite endpoint of GvHD-free/relapse-free survival in which events include grade II-IV acute GvHD, moderate and severe chronic GvHD, relapse, or death in the first year post-HSCT. GRFS will be measured at one year after allo-HSCT and compared between both groups of patients., at Day 360 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., at Day -7, Day 30, Day 90, Day 180, Day 360 and Day 720 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|Analysis the intestinal microbiota in patients, The intestinal microbiota composition and diversity will be assessed by 16S-rRNA sequencing performed prospectively in all patients with FMT and without FMT., Before the conditioning regimen, before the FMT and at Day 30, Day 90 and Day 360 after white blood cells recovery|Analysis the intestinal microbiota in stool donnors, The intestinal microbiota composition and diversity will be assessed by 16S-rRNA sequencing performed prospectively in all stool donnors., At the time of the first stool donnation between Day 7 to Day 55 after the inclusion|Blood collection for a metabolomic study in patients, A blood collection will be set up from blood samples collected on patients from both groups.

The TMF-Allo study is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, parallel, randomized phase II clinical trial comparing a group patients with FMT and a control group of patients without FMT.

The main objective of this study is to assess the effect of allogeneic FMT versus no treatment on Graft-versus-host disease and Relapse-Free Survival (GRFS) at one year in adult patients treating with myelo-ablative allo-HSCT for haematologic malignancy.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate :

* Overall survival, progression-free survival at 1 and 2 years,
* The haematological evolution,
* The evolution of infections,
* The tolerance and safety of the TMF carried out in post-transplant,
* The evolution of the composition and diversity of the microbiota in allograft patients receiving TMF or not.
