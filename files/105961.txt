Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) With Temoporfin for Non-Resectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of I-PDT with Temoporfin for patients with Non-Resectable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NR-NSCLC). Several clinical studies suggested that photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be an effective treatment for patients with NR-NSCLC. PDT is a therapy where an external light source, such as laser, is used to activate a light-sensitive medicine to produce byproducts that can destroy cancer cells. In this study the investigators will use an experimental light sensitive medicine, Temoporfin, to perform interstitial PDT (I-PDT). In I-PDT, laser fibers are inserted into the tumor to activate the light-sensitive medicine.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell-Lung
DRUG: Temoporfin
Occurrence of serious adverse events, The specific aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety of CT-guided I-PDT with Temoporfin on patients with NR-NSCLC. Patient safety will be the primary endpoint. The safety of the intervention will be assessed at 14 and 30 days post-therapy. The primary outcome will be occurrence of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)., 14 and 30 days post-therapy
