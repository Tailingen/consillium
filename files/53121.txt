Dexamethasone-induced Hiccup in Chemotherapy Patients Treated by Methylprednisolone Rotation
The aims of this study were to investigate the feasibility of methylprednisolone rotation as treatment of DIH.
Dexamethasone-induced Hiccup in Chemotherapy
DRUG: methylprednisolone
The intensities of hiccups, Clinically assessed every cycles(2-4weeks). The intensities of hiccups were assessed using a NRS., 2 months
The intensities of emesis, CLinically assessed every cycles (2-4weeks) The intensities of emesis were assessed using a NRS., 2 months
we planned a randomized prospective trial for cancer patients with DIH. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the rotation of corticosteroids affects the incidence and intensity of DIH without compromising the antiemetic efficacy.
