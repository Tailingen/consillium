DNX-2440 for Resectable Colorectal Liver Metastasis
The purpose of this study is to test an experimental oncolytic adenovirus called DNX-2440 in patients with resectable multifocal (≥ 2 lesions) liver metastasis, who are scheduled to have curative-intent liver resection surgery. Up to 18 patients will receive two sequential intra-tumoral injections of DNX-2440 into a metastatic liver tumor prior to surgery for liver resection, to evaluate safety and biological endpoints across 3 dose levels (dose escalation). Upon conclusion of the dose-escalation phase, the selected safe and biologically appropriate dose will be administered using the same schema for an additional 12 patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis (expansion cohort) using established biologic endpoints.

BIOLOGICAL: DNX-2440
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) achieved during dose-escalation phase, The MTD will be defined as the highest tolerated dose below the dose that results in greater than or equal to one-third of the subjects exposed who experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)., 1.5 Years
Efficacy of DNX-2440 assessed by Tumor Regression Grade (TRG) score, Efficacy in tumor cell killing will be measured using the TRG score (1-5) for the resected specimens, 3 Years|Viral replication, Viral replication will be assessed by quantitative measurement of viral protein expression by IHC, 3 Years|Measure Immune response with cell response panels, Immunotherapeutic responses will be assessed by examining features and measuring changes following the intervention for Immunologic microenvironment (T-cell and Myeloid-cell response panels-tissue)., 3 Years|Measure Immune response with ImmunoSEQsec, Immunotherapeutic responses will be assessed by measuring changes in T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire - tissue and blood., 3 Years|Measure Immune response with ELISPOT, Immunotherapeutic responses will be assessed by measuring T-cell response (ELISPOT - tissue/blood)., 3 Years
