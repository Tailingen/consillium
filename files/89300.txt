Goal-directed LCVP Based on HP in Laparoscopic Hepatectomy
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about goal-directed LCVP based on hypovolemic phlebotomy (HP) in laparoscopic hepatectomy. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. The safety and feasibility of HP
2. To evaluate whether HP can reduce perioperative blood transfusion ratio Participants undergoing liver resection with HP was performed by the anesthesiologist. Blood was withdrawn approximately 30 min prior to the initiation of liver parenchymal transection from central venous. The aim was to maintain the CVP between 0 to 5 cmH2O. HP volume was 5-10 mL/kg of patient body weight, generally. Participants in control group undergoing liver resection without HP.

PROCEDURE: hypovolemic phlebotomy
The proportion of allogeneic red blood cell products transfusion, The primary end point of the study was the proportion of patients who required transfusion of allogeneic red blood cell products during laparoscopic hepatectomy or at any time during the hospitalization during the index admission., From date of operation until the date of discharge from hospital or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months.
