Autologous and Allogeneic Whole Cell Cancer Vaccine for Metastatic Tumors
This study is based on the finding that tumor cells that are grown in the laboratory can be modified in such a way that, when injected to the patient, they will stimulate his/her immune response. This approach will be evaluated in patients with melanoma and colorectal, gastric, ovarian, breast, lung and kidney epithelial cancer. Tumor cells grown in the laboratory will be modified to make them stimulatory to the immune system, irradiated to kill them, and injected to the patient eight times at two-week intervals. This protocol is expected to prolong survival of metastatic cancer patients.
