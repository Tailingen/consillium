A Prospective, Multicenter, Phase II Clinical Study on the Treatment of Unresectable Advanced HCC with DEB-TACE Combined with SALOX-HAIC
The aim of this study is to clarify the safety and efficacy of DEB-TACE combined with SALOX-HAIC in the treatment of unresectable advanced primary liver cancer. To determine whether this therapy can prolong the indicators such as PFS, TTP, OS, ORR, and DOR.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the first DEB-TACE treatment to either radiological progression or death or up to 24 months
Overall survival (OS), Time Frame: Time from the first DEB-TACE treatment to death or up to 24 months|Objective response rate (ORR), 1, 3, 6,12,18,24 months after the first DEB-TACE treatment, up to death or 24 months, whichever came first.|Disease control rate (DCR), 1, 3, 6,12,18,24 months after the first DEB-TACE treatment, up to death or 24 months, whichever came first|Time to Progression (TTP), Time from the first DEB-BACE treatment to either radiological progression up to 24 months
