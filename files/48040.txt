Treatment of CML Patients With Imatinib and Hydroxyurea (CML2004)
The study will test the tolerability and efficacy of the combination therapy Imatinib/Hydroxyurea (HU) in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in first chronic phase (CP1) newly diagnosted or failing interferon-based therapy.
Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive
DRUG: Imatinib|DRUG: Hydroxyurea
number of participants with complete molecular response as a measure of efficacy, complete molecular response is achieved if BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia) transcripts became undetectable, 18 months
The protocol consists of a part 1, a phase I study that will enrol 20 patients, with the goal to determine the safety of the combination as well as the maximal tolerated dose. If the toxicity of the combination is acceptable, up to 200 more patients may be recruited and randomized to receive either Imatinib/HU or Imatinib alone (part 2).

Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be started on 400 mg Imatinib daily. In part 1 of the protocol, the dose of HU will be increased by 500 mg at 3-weekly intervals until the maximal tolerated dose has been reached. In part 2 of the study, patients will be randomized to receive either the combination or Imatinib monotherapy.

Hematological and cytogenetic response will be evaluated at 3-months intervals during the first year, and at 6 months' intervals thereafter. Primary endpoints for part 1 are dose-limiting toxicity and maximal tolerated dose. Primary endpoints for part 2 are the rates of major and complete molecular response at 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively.
