Immunotherapy With MK-3475 in Surgically Resectable Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The goal of this trial is to test the ability of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) to improve locoregional recurrence and distant metastatic rates in high-risk patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) that are treated with current standard of care surgical approaches.

Locoregional Recurrence Rates in Cohorts 1 and 2, -The percentage of participants who developed local-regional recurrence within one year of surgery, Within 1 year of surgery (surgery occurred within 13-22 days after neoadjuvant MK-3475 dose)|Distant Failure Rate in Cohorts 1 and 2, -The percentage of participants who developed distant failure within one year of surgery. Distant disease is cancer that is found in another part of the body that is far away from where the original (primary) tumor first formed., Within 1 year of surgery (surgery occurred within 13-22 days after neoadjuvant MK-3475 dose)|Rate of Major Pathologic Treatment Effect in Cohort 1, * Major pathologic treatment effect=pathologic tumor response (pTR).
* pTR was defined as the presence of tumor cell necrosis and keratinous debris with giant cell/histiocytic reaction, quantified as a percentage of the overall tumor bed (area pathologic response/area pathologic response plus viable tumor): pTR-0 (\>10%), pTR-1 (10-49%), and pTR-2 (≥50%)., At the time of surgery (surgery occurred within 13-22 days after neoadjuvant MK-3475 dose)|Rate of Major Pathologic Treatment Effect in Cohort 2, * Major pathologic treatment effect=pathologic tumor response (pTR).
* pTR was defined as the presence of tumor cell necrosis and keratinous debris with giant cell/histiocytic reaction, quantified as a percentage of the overall tumor bed (area pathologic response/area pathologic response plus viable tumor): pTR-0 (\>10%), pTR-1 (10-49%), and pTR-2 (≥50%)., At the time of surgery (surgery occurred within 13-22 days after last neoadjuvant MK-3475 dose)
Number of Participants in Cohort 1 and 2 Who Experienced Reportable Adverse Events, Reportable adverse events will be tracked for 30 days following the last day of study treatment. For the purposes of this protocol, reportable adverse events are events thought to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to MK-3475. Events thought to be probably or definitely related to surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, or radiotherapy need not be recorded., Through 30 days after last dose of MK-3475|Number of Surgical Complications and/or Delays in Cohorts 1 and 2, At the time of surgery (approximately 2-3 weeks after registration)|Locoregional Recurrence Rates in Cohorts 1 and 2, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years after treatment)|Rate of Distant Metastases (DM) in Cohorts 1 and 2, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years after treatment)|Event-free Survival (EFS) in Cohorts 1 and 2, Event-free survival will be defined as time from surgery to time to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, new primary, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years after treatment)|Event-free Survival (EFS) Rate Differences by Presence Versus Absence of Recurrent Genomic Alterations in Cohorts 1 and 2, Event-free survival will be defined as time from surgery to time to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, new primary, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years after treatment)|Overall Survival (OS) Rates Differences by Presence Versus Absence of Recurrent Genomic Alterations in Cohorts 1 and 2, Overall survival will be defined as time from surgery to death from any cause., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 5 years after treatment)]
