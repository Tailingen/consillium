A Pragmatic Trial of Ambulatory Toxicity Management in Patients Receiving Adjuvant or Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy for Early Stage Breast Cancer
Comparison of the number of ER plus hospital visits that occurred during chemotherapy between the telephone intervention and control arms.
Early Stage Breast Cancer
OTHER: Proactive Telephone Toxicity Management|OTHER: Control Arm|OTHER: PRO Sub-Study
Number of Emergency and Hospital (ED+H) visits during chemotherapy, Collect the number of ED+H visits that occurred during chemotherapy for all patients, During chemotherapy and the 30 days post-chemotherapy
Severity of Chemotherapy, Severity of treatment side effects will be measured using the NCI PRO CTCAE self-report tool (assessment on a 5 point scale)., Assessed at baseline, at day 1 of cycle 2 prior to start of chemotherapy and again within 60 days of the completion of chemotherapy treatment|Quality of Life (QOL), Measured using the Self-Care during Chemotherapy (L-PaSC), Stanford Self-Management Self-Efficacy Scale, FACT-B, GAD-7, PHQ-9, EQ-5D-3L, Assessed at baseline, at day 1 of cycle 2 prior to start of chemotherapy and again within 60 days of the completion of chemotherapy treatment|Coordination of Care, Measured using the adapted Picker survey., Assessed at baseline, at day 1 of cycle 2 prior to start of chemotherapy and again within 60 days of the completion of chemotherapy treatment|Health Economics, Health system resources utilized by women receiving adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy will be analyzed, Initiation of chemotherapy to the end of chemotherapy plus 30 days
Using a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial design, 20 Ontario cancer centres that provide care to patients with breast cancer will be randomly allocated to one of two arms: pro-active telephone toxicity management (intervention), or control (routine care). All patients with early stage (I-III) breast cancer who commence adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy at participating institutions during the 6 to 12-month intervention period (will vary between centres depending on the number of incident cases) will be evaluated using Ontario healthcare administrative data. A sub-set of at least 25 patients at each participating institution will participate in a PRO sub-study involving the completion of standardized questionnaires to measure: a) severity of chemotherapy treatment toxicities; b) self-care for management of chemotherapy toxicities; c) self-efficacy (confidence) for managing symptoms; d) quality of life; and e) coordination of care. Patients participating in the PRO sub-study will be asked to provide consent to link their PRO data to Ontario healthcare administrative data so that correlations between the symptom self-assessments and Quality of Life (QoL) measures can be made with the administrative data on ED+H visits and use of supportive care medications. the investigators will compare the use of supportive care medications (i.e. anti-emetics, growth factors) by patients in the intervention and control arms to assess their influence on severity of chemotherapy-related toxicities as part of an exploratory sub-group analysis in patients \>65 years of age as administrative data on supportive care medication use is only available for this age group.
