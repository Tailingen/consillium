The 24 Hour Effects of Remedial Exercises With and Without Compression Therapy on Breast Cancer-related Lymphedema
The aim of this study to investigate 24 hours of effects of remedial exercises with and without compression therapy on severity of lymphedema and symptoms of the lymphedema The present study is designed as a non-drug clinical trial. The patients will complete two remedial exercise sessions, one without and one with compression in a randomized order separated by a 3-day wash-out period.The main questions it aims to answer are

1. The 24 hour effects of remedial exercises with and without compression therapy on the severity of lymphedema are different in individuals with lymphedema associated with breast cancer surgery.
2. The 24 hour effects of remedial exercises with and without compression therapy on the symptoms of lymphedema are different in individuals with lymphedema associated with breast cancer surgery.

Ultrasonographic measurements, Ultrasound imaging was performed using a 5-13-Megahertz linear probe. During the procedure, the participants will be seated with their forearms supinated and extended on a pillow. Measurements will be made bilaterally from 10 cm distal and proximal to the elbow bend, from the midpoint of the medial and lateral epicondyles, along the line parallel to the arm axis., Change in symptoms related to lymphedema from baseline up to end of 24 hour|Circumference measurement, The severity of lymphedema between the two extremities will be measured by measuring the environment at 5 cm intervals., Change in symptoms related to lymphedema from baseline up to end of 24 hour|Bioimpedance spectroscopy, The patient is in the supine position with his arms and legs not touching each other. This measurement will be made using the Impedimed L-Dex U 400 device. The reference point is the top of both hands and the dorsum of the foot. This measurement is made using superficial electrodes and there is no risk. The percentage of fluid will be calculated by making a measurement for both arms., Change in symptoms related to lymphedema from baseline up to end of 24 hour
symptoms of lymphedema, Four participant-reported lymphedema symptoms were assessed: swelling, heaviness, tightness commonly associated with BCRL. Using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), participants marked on it the extent to which they perceived their arm to be swollen, heavy or tight and pain during the past month, with 0 being "not at all" and 10 being "extremely"., Change in symptoms related to lymphedema from baseline up to end of 24 hour
