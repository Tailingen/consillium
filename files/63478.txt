18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT in Lung Adenocarcinoma
To evaluate the potential usefulness of 68Ga-FAPI positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions in lung adenocarcinoma, compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT scan
Cut-off value of SUVmax, Using the cut-off value of SUVmax derived from 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET to distinguish IAC from pre-invasive lesions (including atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA)) in GGNs., 30 days
The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, p-value [indicating accuracy exceeding the No-Information Rate], and kappa value, Based on clinical features (age, sex, smoking history) and PET/CT parameters (including SUVmax, TBR, CT value), calculate the diagnostic performance. Based on 68Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT radiomics features, calculate the diagnostic performance and explain the most significant predictors., 30 days
Participants with lung adenocarcinoma underwent contemporaneous 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT for an initial assessment. Tumor uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT were calculated and compared to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy. In addition, the investigators further investigate the performance of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT for differentiating invasive adenocarcinoma from adenocarcinoma in situ (pre-invasive lesion) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma in participants with solitary ground-glass opacity nodules.
