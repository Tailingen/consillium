Advanced Gastric Cancer
Treatment effectiveness, Progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, 2 year|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE V5.0, Adverse effects will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0, 2 year|molecular marker Analysis, * Tissue samples collected before treatment, during treatment, and at disease progression will be analyzed using multiplex IHC to assess PD-L1 expression, MMR gene status, and Claudin18.2. Additionally, NGS testing will be conducted to evaluate the correlation with the treatment response to zolbetuximab.
