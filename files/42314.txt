Chemotherapy for Relapsed Epstein Barr Virus Associated Lymphoma
By combining a variety of agents that potentiate Zidovudine (ZDV), the investigators hope to induce remission in this generally fatal disease. Most therapies for aggressive B cell lymphomas are based upon intensive chemotherapeutic regimens, expensive modalities (bone marrow transplant, Rituximab), or experimental approaches (gene therapy, cytotoxic T cell infusion) that are difficult to implement in heavily pre-treated patients. Therapy for relapsed aggressive B cell lymphomas is very poor. Even curable lymphomas such as Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) and Hodgkin lymphoma are extremely difficult to treat in relapse and/or after stem cell transplant failure. The investigators propose a novel therapeutic approach that exploits the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in lymphomas; antiviral mediated suppression of NF-kB and disruption of viral latency.

Rate of Complete Response to Protocol Therapy, Complete Response (CR) rate in study participants to protocol therapy. Response will be assessed via CT Scan and bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, if applicable. Complete response criteria include:

* Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before therapy, and normalization of those biochemical abnormalities definitely assignable to Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL);
* All lymph nodes and tumor masses disappeared or regressed to normal size (≤ 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameters for nodes \> 1.5 cm before therapy);
* Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter (GTD) before treatment must have decreased to ≤ 1 cm in their GTD after treatment, or by more than 75% bin the sum of the products of the greatest diameters (SPD);
* No new sites of disease., About 21 days
One-year Rate of Overall Survival, Rate of overall survival of study participants at one year since initiation of protocol therapy. Overall survival (OS) will be measured from the date of initiation of study treatment until date of death from any cause. In the absence of death, the follow-up will be censored at date of last contact (censored observation). Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival at one-year., 12 months|One-Year Rate of Failure-Free Survival (FFS), Rate of failure-free survival of study participants one-year after start of protocol therapy. Failure-free survival (FFS) will be measured from the date of treatment initiation until date of documented disease progression, relapse after response, or death from any cause. For patients alive and free of relapse or progression, follow-up time will be censored at the last documented date of failure-free status. Kaplan-Meier estimate of failure-free survival at one-year., 12 months|Rate of Toxicity Related to Protocol Therapy, Rate of adverse events, serious adverse events or other toxicities related to protocol therapy in study participants., Through Duration of Protocol Therapy, Up to six 21-day cycles (+/- 7 days)|HIV Viral Load in Positive Subjects Before, During and After Protocol Therapy, Measurement of HIV Viral Load in positive subjects before, during and after protocol therapy to assess the effect of protocol therapy on immune reconstitution or exhaustion., From Baseline Up to 1 Year Post-Therapy|T-Cell Subset Levels in Peripheral Blood in Positive Participants Before, During and After Protocol Therapy, Measurement of T-cell subset levels (CD4, CD8) in peripheral blood before, during and after protocol therapy to assess the effect of protocol therapy on immune re-constitution or exhaustion., From Baseline Up to 1 Year Post-Therapy|EBV Viral Load in Peripheral Blood Before, During and After Protocol Therapy, Measurement of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) viral load in peripheral blood in study participants before, after treatment, and during surveillance in order to correlate the presence of with tumor load and disease status., From Baseline Up to 1 year Post-Therapy|EBV Reactivation in Circulating Peripheral Blood Memory B-cells Before and After Protocol Therapy., Measurement of EBV reactivation in circulating peripheral blood memory B-cells before and after treatment with chemotherapy/Zidovudine (ZDV) in order to assess the drug effect on EBV latency., From Baseline Up to 1 year Post-Therapy|Baseline Tumor EBV Gene Expression Profile in Study Participants, Determine baseline tumor EBV gene expression profile to assess viral thymidine kinases. (BXLF1/vTK and BGLF4/PK), EBV latency pattern (I, II or III) and lytic phase., Baseline|Measurement of Immune Activation Markers and Inflammation in Peripheral Blood, Measurement of immune activation markers and inflammation in peripheral blood in response to treatment and EBV reactivation., Through Duration of Response to Protocol Therapy Until Disease Progression, Up to 5 years
