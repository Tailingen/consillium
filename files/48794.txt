Dose-escalation Study of Safety of PBCAR20A in Subjects With r/r NHL or r/r CLL/SLL
This is a Phase 1/2a, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, single-dose, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of PBCAR20A in adult subjects with r/r B-cell NHL or r/r CLL/SLL.

GENETIC: PBCAR20A|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is the dose level at which fewer than 33% of patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) using a 3+3 strategy., Day 1 to Day 28|Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities, Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are certain Grade 3 and Grade 4 toxic reactions as defined by the protocol and CTCAE v5.0., 1 year
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate (ORR) is a measure of clinical activity as response in NHL by the revised Lugano Classification (Cheson et al, 2016) or a response in CLL/SLL by the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2018 guidelines., 1 year|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the duration (days) from Day 0 to disease progression or death., 1 year
This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, single-dose, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate safety, tolerability, clinical activity, and find an appropriate dose to optimize safety and efficacy of PBCAR20A in subjects with relapsed/refractory (r/r) CD20+ Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) or r/r Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL). Before initiating PBCAR20A, therapy, subjects will be administered lymphodepletion chemotherapy composed of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. At Day 0 of the Treatment Period, subjects will receive a single intravenous (IV) infusion of PBCAR20A. All subjects are monitored during the treatment period through Day 28. All subjects who receive a dose of PBCAR20A will be followed in a separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) study for 15 years after exiting this study.
