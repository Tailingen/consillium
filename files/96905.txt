Study of INCB053914 in Subjects With Advanced Malignancies
This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of the proviral integration site of Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinase inhibitor INCB053914 in subjects with advanced malignancies. The study will be conducted in 4 parts. Part 1 (monotherapy dose escalation) will evaluate safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of INCB053914 monotherapy and the recommended phase 2 dose(s) (a tolerated pharmacologically active dose that will be taken forward into the remaining parts of the study). Part 2 (monotherapy dose expansion) will further evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the recommended Phase 2 dose(s). Part 3 (combination dose finding) will evaluate safety of INCB053914 in combination with select standard of care (SOC) agents and will identify the optimal INCB053914 dose in combination with conventional SOC regimens to take forward into Part 4. Part 4 (combination dose expansion) will further evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the recommended Phase 2 dose combination(s).

DRUG: INCB053914|DRUG: I-DAC (Intermediate dose cytarabine)|DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Ruxolitinib
Determination of the Safety and Tolerability of INCB053914 as Measured by the Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Approximately 7 months|Part 4 Only : Determination of the Efficacy of INCB053914 in Combination With the Intermediate-dose Cytarabine (I DAC) in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Based on Objective Remission Rate (ORR), The primary efficacy endpoint of ORR in patients with AML who received INCB053914 in combination with cytarabine in Part 4 was not assessed because Part 4 was not opened for enrollment owing to this combination regimen not being tolerated in Part 3., Approximately 2 months|Part 4 Only : Determination of the Efficacy of INCB053914 in Combination With Azacitidine in Subjects With Newly Diagnosed AML Who Are 65 Years or Older and Unfit for Intensive Chemotherapy Based on ORR, The primary efficacy endpoint of ORR in patients with AML who received INCB053914 plus azacitidine in Part 4 was not performed due to limited enrollment as a result of early study termination., Approximately 6 months
