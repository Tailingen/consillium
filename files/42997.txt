Letrozole Plus Ribociclib or Placebo as Neo-adjuvant Therapy in ER-positive, HER2-negative Early Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if ribociclib in combination with letrozole for 24 weeks as neoadjuvant endocrine therapy increases the proportion of women with Pre-operative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) score of 0 at surgery compared to patients treated with letrozole alone therefore allowing more patients excellent outcomes without chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Ribociclib|DRUG: Placebo
Rate of Pre-operative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) score 0 at surgery between ribociclib containing arms (combined) vs letrozole alone arm, At Surgery (22 weeks)
Rate of complete cell cycle arrest at 2 weeks between ribociclib containing arms (combined) vs letrozole alone arm: Complete cell cycle arrest is defined as Ki67 at day 14 of < 2.7%, Day 14 of Cycle 1|Pathologic complete response rate (pCR rate): pCR rate is defined as the proportion of patients with no histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen and the axillary lymph nodes, At Surgery (Days 8-15 of Cycle 6)|Clinical complete response rate (cCR rate): cCR rate is defined as the proportion of patients with no residual tumor by clinical exam, Post-surgery (Once in the first 4 weeks of post-op, then once every 6 months for 5 years post-op)|5 Year Relapse Free Survival (RFS), 5 years post-treatment
Subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to either letrozole plus placebo vs. letrozole plus continuous dosing of ribociclib vs. letrozole plus intermittent dosing (3-weeks-on/1-week-off) of ribociclib.

The difference in clinical, pathologic and radiologic response as well as Pre-operative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) scores across the three treatments arms will be examined. Subjects will also be followed for 5 years post-treatment to determine if ribociclib in combination with letrozole for 24 weeks results in improved 5 year Relapse Free Survival (RFS) compared to letrozole alone.
