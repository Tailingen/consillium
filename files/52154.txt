Sexual Dysfunction and Adaptation in Couples Affected by Prostate Cancer Surgery
The purpose of this study is to explore patient and partner experiences with sexual dysfunction following radical prostatectomy, in order to understand its effects on sexual and non-sexual intimacy. This will enable us to provide assistance in the future to individuals experiencing similar circumstances.

We are studying the impact of sexual dysfunction following radical prostatectomy on patient and partners' experiences of intimacy. Research with men in post-radical prostatectomy recovery indicates 25%-75% experience sexual dysfunction. Many patients experience anxiety and distress related to sexual difficulties. These experiences may progress and result in long-term problems in the relationship between patients and their partners. Despite apparent levels of effectiveness, up to half of the patients who turn to sexually assistive aids after surgical removal of the prostate discontinue use of the aids within one year. Additionally, difficulties in communicating about sexual impairments can significantly interfere with the couples' ability to achieve successful adaptation. We are interested in studying patient and partner experiences with sexual dysfunction in order to understand its effects on sexual and non-sexual intimacy.

Participation in this study will involve completing 6 confidential face-to-face interviews on three separate occasions (3-6 months, 12-15 months, and 21-24 months post-surgery). On each occasion, participants will be required to take part in a "couple's" interview with his/her partner, as well as an individual interview. The interviews will provide participants with the opportunity to discuss the impact of sexual dysfunction on mood, thoughts, and communication with their partners. Demographic information will be collected at the initial interview. As well, at each of the 3 time points, participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire package containing 6 psychological questionnaires. All questionnaires and interview material will be kept strictly confidential.
