Cryoablation of Small Breast Tumors in Early Stage Breast Cancer
This study examines the use of cryoablation as an alternative to surgery in the treatment of early stage invasive breast cancer. The hypothesis is that cryoablation will complete ablation and destroy the tumor in a selected population of women who may otherwise be adequately treated with surgery.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Visica 2 Treatment System
Tumor ablation occurence, Successful tumor ablation will be defined as absence of residual viable invasive or in situ carcinoma. Will be determined at 6-month post-cryoablation biopsy. Residual disease will require surgery., Within 6 months
Local tumor recurrence, Within 5 years|Satisfactory breast cosmesis results, 5 Years|Adverse event assessment, 5 years
PURPOSE:

To determine the rate of successful tumor ablation in patients treated with cryoablation and endocrine therapy in a subset of patients with early stage breast cancer.
