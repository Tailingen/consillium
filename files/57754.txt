68Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT in Imaging Participants With Neuroendocrine Tumors
This trial studies how well gallium Ga 68-edotreotide (68Ga-DOTA-TOC) positron emission tomography (PET)/computer tomography (CT) works in imaging participants with neuroendocrine tumors. 68Ga-DOTA-TOC is used as a tracer chemical during PET/CT scans. Diagnostic procedures, such as 68Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT, may help find and diagnose neuroendocrine tumors.

PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|DRUG: Gallium Ga 68-Edotreotide|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography
Incidence of adverse events, As measured by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. Traceable toxicity/safety data will be assessed. Adverse events and vital signs will be monitored and described with descriptive statistics., Up to 30 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To substitute 68Ga-DOTATOC for 111In-pentetreotide on an expanded access basis, in tumor imaging for study subjects, where the care provider believes that somatostatin imaging is clinically indicated, until such time as 68Ga-DOTATOC becomes commercially available.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To gain experience in the utility of 68Ga-DOTATOC in the management of neuroendocrine tumors at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).

II. To acquire proficiency in generating 68Ga-DOTATOC for human use at MDACC.

OUTLINE:

Participants receive gallium Ga 68-edotreotide intravenously. After 1 hour, participants undergo PET/CT scan over 60 minutes.

After completion of study, participants are followed up at 24 hours or within 72 hours, and at 30 days.
