Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome In Patients Treated For Cancer Of The Upper Aerodigestive Tract
Prospective open-label, non-randomized, monocentric, cohort study, to assess the prevalence and severity of sleep apnea syndrome in patients treated for cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract.

The patient follows a usual course of care including, at the end of the treatment of his cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract, screening for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome at 3 months and 6 months (Epworth score and ventilatory polygraphy)
Upper Aerodigestive Tract Neoplasms|Obstructive Sleep Apnea-hypopnea Syndrome
Occurence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is defined by an apnea-hypopnea index greater than or equal to 15 per hour, 3 months after the end of treatment for cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract
Delay in onset of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome after completion of cancer treatment, Delay in onset of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome after completion of cancer treatment, during the 6 months follow-up|Epworth score, The Epworth auto-questionnaire, rated from 0 (better) to 24 (worse), assess day-time sleapiness., at 3 months and 6 months|Occurence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is defined by an apnea-hypopnea index greater than or equal to 15 per hour, 6 months after the end of treatment for cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract
Prospective open-label, non-randomized, monocentric, cohort study, to assess the prevalence and severity of sleep apnea syndrome in patients treated for cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract.

Patients are included in the study when they are hospitalized for panendoscopy. Thereafter, it takes about 1 month to start any treatment. The duration of treatment is estimated at about 5 months (the longest regimen would be induction chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant complementary treatment). After which the patient follows a usual course of care including, at the end of the treatment of his cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract, screening for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome at 3 months and 6 months (Epworth score and ventilatory polygraphy).
