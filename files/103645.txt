PHE885 CAR-T Therapy in Adult Participants With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase II study to determine the efficacy and safety of PHE885, a BCMA-directed CAR-T cell therapy, manufactured with a new process. The CAR-T cell therapy will be investigated as a single agent in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma

This clinical trial employs an open label, single arm, multi-center design with primary analysis testing overall response rate ( ORR), including one interim analysis for futility and one interim analysis for efficacy.

The trial population includes adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM) after failure of 3 or more lines of therapy, including failing an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an anti-CD38 (cluster of differentiation 38) monoclonal antibody (mAb) and who have measurable disease at enrollment per IMWG criteria . In addition, patients must be refractory to the last line of therapy

The trial will enroll 90 efficacy evaluable adult patients with relapsed and refractory MM (efficacy evaluable means participants infused with a PHE885 product at target dose 10e6 that met all release specifications).

Patients will be followed for acute and intermediate safety and efficacy within this trial for a minimum of 2 years before being transferred to the long-term follow-up trial. A long-term post-study follow-up for lentiviral vector safety will be offered under a separate destination protocol for 15 years post injection per health authority guidelines.
