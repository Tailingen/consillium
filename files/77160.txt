ORR, objective response rate, 3 years|PFS, progression-free survival, 3 years
OS, overall survival, 3 years|EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D-5L score change over time from baseline to disease progression. The EQ-5D-5L is consisted of five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Higher scores indicate poorer health., Up to 36 months|FKSI-19, FKSI-19 score change over time from baseline to disease progression. The scale of FKSI-19 is from 0 to 48, and higher scores indicate worse quality of life., Up to 36 months|DCR, Disease control rate, 3 years|Duration of response, time from the first occurrence of treatment response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death, 3 years|VAS, VAS pain score change over time from baseline to disease progression. The scale of VAS is from 0-10, and higher scores indicate worse symptom of pain., 3 years

Our previous genetic research as well as other published data indicated the possible well response to combination of immunotherapy with targeted therapy in FH-deficient renal cell carcinoma, therefore the investigators intented to perform this single-arm phase II clinical trial to evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of Sintilimab injection combined with Inlyta in FH-deficient renal cell carcinoma.
