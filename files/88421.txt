ClariCore System Used in Transrectal Ultrasound Guided Prostate Biopsy for Real-Time Tissue Evaluation
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of the ClariCore System in obtaining prostate biopsies with device feedback that provides real-time tissue classification.
Cellular Diagnosis, Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: ClariCore Optical Biopsy System
Validation of the tissue classification algorithm, Correlate histopathology of tissue biopsy core samples with the tissue classification algorithm results obtained at the time of the procedure to validate the tissue classification algorithm., At time of procedure
Sensitivity and Specificity, The sensitivity and specificity of the ClariCore System will be calculated and reported., At time of procedure|Cancer Detection Rate, The cancer detection per core rate in the Targeted Cores that have been classified as suspicious will be determined and reported., At time of procedure
Identification of New or Clinically Significant Disease, The number of instances where a new or more clinically significant disease (Gleason 7 or greater) is diagnosed during collection of the Targeted Cores compared to the SOC Cores, At time of procedure, at time of 7 day follow up|Adverse Event Incidence, The cumulative incidence of adverse events related to the device or the procedure., Up to 7 days post-procedure|Serious Adverse Event, The cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the device or the procedure., Up to 7 days post-procedure
The purpose of this study is to collect information on prostate biopsies using the ClariCore System. The ClariCore System is designed to improve how the biopsies are being collected from the prostate by using light sensors (fiber optics) that can see changes in the prostate tissue. Researchers will study the information collected from the light sensors to study a method that has been developed to tell the difference between normal and suspicious (possibly cancerous) prostate tissue during the biopsy. This information will be given to the doctor in real-time. From this study, researchers hope to learn if this method can tell the difference between normal and suspicious prostate tissue, and if this can improve the evaluation of prostate tissue (biopsies).
