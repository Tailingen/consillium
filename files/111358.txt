Pilot Study of a Double Isolation Perfusion Schedule Using Melphalan Alone for Intransit Melanoma or Unresectable Sarcoma of the Extremity
Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with melphalan alone is administered as a double perfusion schedule.

These two isolates limb perfusions with melphalan are treated 3-6 weeks apart. After perfusion is established, the leak rate has been determined to be acceptable, and tissue temperatures are 38 degrees Celsius, then the melphalan is administered by slow injection into an arterial line over approximately 5 minutes. The perfusion with melphalan will then continue for 60 minutes, after which the extremity is flushed out with a total of 3 liters of fluid consisting initially of a saline solution. The dose of melphalan for the second perfusion will be increased.

An attempt to resect the residual lesion between 6-12 weeks after the second

interval perfusion may be made.
Melanoma|Sarcoma
PROCEDURE: double isolated limb perfusion with melphalan alone
Patients with extremity melanoma (Stage IIIA, IIIAB or Stage IV disease who have bulky symptomatic tumor located in the extremity) or patients with unresectable extremity sarcoma will undergo a double isolated limb perfusion with melphalan alone separated by approximately 4 to 6 weeks. The initial perfusion will be done with a melphalan dose of 6 mg/L limb volume and the interval perfusion with a dose of 9 mg/L limb volume. For patients with extremity sarcoma the tumor will be excised if feasible using a limb sparing resection between 6-12 weeks after the second perfusion. Technical feasibility of the double perfusion schedule will be determined. Overall response, duration of response, patterns of recurrence, and survival will be followed.
