A Phase III Study of KN026 in Combination With HB1801 ± Carboplatin as Neoadjuvant Treatment for Early or Locally Advanced HER2-Positive Breast Cancer
This randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of KN026 in combination with HB1801 ± Carboplatin as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with early or locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.
Early or Locally Advanced HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: KN026|DRUG: HB1801|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
tpCR (BIRC, AJCC 8th), tpCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
EFS (INV, RECIST v1.1), EFS event was defined as the time between the data of randomization and the date on which any of the following events: disease progression; breast cancer recurrence; death attributable to any cause., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|tpCR (INV, AJCC 8th), Description: tpCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|bpCR (BIRC and INV, AJCC 8th), bpCR (ypT0/Tis) is defined as an absence of invasive neoplastic cells at microscopic examination of the tumor remnants after surgery following primary systemic therapy., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|ORR (INV, RECIST v1.1), After 2 cycles of chemotherapy (21 days as 1 cycle).|iDFS (INV, RECIST v1.1), IDFS event was defined as the time between the date of non-invasive disease, such as the date of surgery, and the date of the first occurrence of any of the following events: breast cancer recurrence; death attributable to any cause, 3 years after surgery|Frequency and severity of TEAE and SAE, After each cycle of chemotherapy (21 days as 1 cycle), up to 1 years.|Concentration of KN026 and HB1801 in serum, After each cycle of chemotherapy (21 days as 1 cycle), up to 6 cycles.|Incidence of KN026 Anti-drug antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (Nab) (if applicable), After each cycle of chemotherapy (21 days as 1 cycle), up to 6 cycles.
In this randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter Phase III trial, treatment-naive patients with HER2-positive breast cancer were centrally randomized (1:1) and stratified by disease stage, hormone receptor status, and the planned use of Carboplatin. Participants received six cycles of: neoadjuvant therapy: KN026 combined with HB1801 ± Carboplatin (Experimental) or Trastuzumab plus Pertuzumab and Docetaxel ± Carboplatin (Active Comparator). The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast, evaluated in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.
