Study of AVE1642 (IGF-1R/CD221) in Combination With Fulvestrant (FaslodexÂ®) in Postmenopausal Patients With Advanced Hormono-dependent Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical activity of AVE1642 in combination with fulvestrant and of fulvestrant alone in terms of clinical benefit as the rate of "complete response", "partial response" and "stabilization of the disease".

The additional objectives are to evaluate the safety profile of AVE1642 in combination with fulvestrant and of fulvestrant alone, to assess the rate of patients without disease progression at 6 months and the overall progression-free survival time. An evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics interactions between AVE1642 and fulvestrant will also be performed.

The biological activity of treatment will be assessed on tumor biopsies, when possible The potential immunogenicity of AVE1642 will be studied
