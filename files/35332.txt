GEMCAD-REVEAL STUDY - Circulating Tumor DNA as a Predictor of Relapse in Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.
The evaluation of the tumor response to chemoradiotherapy/total neoadjuvant therapy (CRT/TNT) remains a challenge. The integration of a blood-based biomarker such as ctDNA with clinico-radiological tools could offer the potential advantage of improving accuracy of assessment of tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy. Furthermore, data on functional outcomes and quality of life after total mesorectal excision (TME) and especially after " Watch And Wait" (WW) is scarce.

REVEAL is a prospective, multicenter study in which the response to TNT in correlation with liquid biopsy (LB) of patients with rectal cancer in Spain will be evaluated. It is planned to include 120 patients. All patients will be aged 18 years or older, with histologically confirmed rectal adenocarcinoma, located in the mid or distal third (with the inferior margin within 12cm from the anal verge), clinically staged II and III (cT3-T4 and/or any TN+), scheduled to undergo TNT will be eligible. All cases and treatment decisions will be discussed by local Multidisciplinary Boards. Patients will be included consecutively when visiting the corresponding health centers for outpatient visits or hospitalization.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the role of ctDNA in the prediction of relapse in patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with TNT followed by WW or TME based on a clinical assessment of the local response

DRUG: total neoadjuvant therapy
ctDNA from liquid biopsy, The results from ctDNA will be dichotomized to positive or negative. The investigator will report the percentage of patients with positive or negative ctDNA. Correlation of these values with clinical endpoints of response / survival to total neoadjuvant therapy will be done to fulfill the proposed objectives of this study. The ctDNA isolation test selected for this study is marketed by Guardant Health (Redwood City, California, USA) under the name Guardant RevealTM. It consists of a single state-of-the-art liquid blood biopsy, which is capable of detecting residual or recurrent disease seven days after blood extraction. This test uses a sequencing method that simultaneously evaluates genetic alterations and methylation without the need for a biopsy of the primary tumor tissue to determine specific mutations., 2 years after to start treatment total neoadjuvant therapy/2 years per patient

Locoregional failure rate will be estimated using the appropriate logistic regression model at 1-year after the first dose of TNT and end of study. Those patients lost to follow-up with no event of local recurrence will be considered not evaluable for LFR endpoint. Patients who die as a direct or secondary cause of the cancer will be considered as an event at the date of death for LFR analysis. Death by other reasons other than cancer progression/relapse will not be considered as an event for LFR., Throughout the study period, approximately 2 years per patient|Distant relapse rate (DRR), Distant relapse rate (DRR) defined as the percentage of patients who present progression/relapse of disease in distant locations. DRR will be estimated using the appropriate logistic regression model at 1-year after the first dose of TNT and end of study. Those patients lost to follow-up with no event of distal recurrence will be considered not evaluable for DRR endpoint. Patients who die as a direct or secondary cause of the cancer will be considered as an event at the date of death for DRR analysis. Death by other reasons other than cancer progression/relapse will not be considered as an event for DRR., Throughout the study period, approximately 2 years per patient|Disease-free Survival (DFS), Disease-free Survival (DFS): defined as the time elapsed from the first dose of TNT to progression (only for pts with nCCR), relapse, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.

The 1-year DFS rate is defined as the rate of patients alive and free of relapse or progression at 1 year after the first dose of TNT estimated by Kaplan-Meier.

The objective of the present study is to evaluate the role of ctDNA in the prediction of relapse in patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with TNT followed by WW or TME based on a clinical assessment of the local response.

HYPOTHESIS ctDNA is a predictor of complete clinical response and could potentially be used to guide patient selection for WW strategy.

ctDNA is an early marker of local tumor relapse and could potentially guide strategy changes during follow-up.

Patients who are enrolled in a WW strategy have better long-term functional outcomes in comparison to patients who undergo surgery.

SECONDARY:

Secondary objectives related to ctDNA and tumor response to TNT:

* To estimate the concordance between the post-TNT ctDNA measurement and the clinical evaluation of response (endoscopy-biopsy, DRE and MRI) to TNT.
* To estimate the concordance between the ctDNA measured after TNT and the endoscopy-biopsy evaluation of response.
* To estimate the concordance between the ctDNA measured after TNT and the MRI-defined response pattern groups.
