Study to Evaluate Percussive Ventilation Breathhold to Improve Lung Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy
The purpose of this research is to evaluate and determine the rate of successful administration of Percussive ventilation breathhold (PVB) to allow for more accurate radiotherapy for lung tumors.
Lung Cancer
OTHER: Percussive Ventilation Breathhold SABR (PVB-SABR)
Rate of successful Percussive Ventilation Breathhold (PVB) maneuver in healthy volunteers., The rate will be measured as the proportion of healthy volunteers who can be successfully execute the Percussive Ventilation Breathhold for 5 minutes. In the event of a failure, both investigator and patient will be asked to specify the reason for failure for purposes of failure analysis., 18 months|Rate of successful administration of Percussive Ventilation Breathhold Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (PVB SABR) in lung patients., The rate will be measured as the proportion of lung cancer patients who successfully complete treatment using the PVB SABR method as defined by 100% of the prescribed Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy dose being delivered using the Percussive Ventilation Breathhold (PVB) technique. A failure will be defined as a patient who fails to use the method for any part of the treatment. In the event of a failure, both investigator and patient will be asked to specify the reason for failure for purposes of failure analysis., 18 months
Additional time-related endpoints for duration of breathhold with Percussive Ventilation (PV) breathhold intervention for Healthy patients, The rates will be measured as the proportion of healthy volunteers who can be successfully execute the PV breathhold for 10 minutes, 3 months|Exploratory clinical and dosimetric data on Percussive Ventilation Breathhold Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (PVB SABR) technique, We will collect optional exploratory noninvasive clinical data during PVB including but not limited to real-time CO2 and SpO2 data (using the SenTec Digital Monitoring System or similar device) and surface anatomy monitoring (using devices such as Kinect camera, vision-RT, or laser surface monitoring system). All of these data will be collected on an optional exploratory basis., 3 months
Primary Objective(s)

* To determine the rate of successful administration of the PVB-SABR in lung cancer patients.
* To determine the rate of successful administration of PVB in healthy volunteers for 5 minutes

Secondary Objective(s)

* To determine the rate of successful administration of PVB in healthy volunteers for 10 minutes as well as for patients' successfully completing the technique for 5 and 10 minutes.
* To collect exploratory clinical (both arms) and dosimetric data from lung cancer patients using PVB-SABR.
