Evaluation of AP-002 in Patients With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this trial is to define an effective and safe dose of AP-002 in advanced or recurrent solid tumors for which there are no standard therapies to use in subsequent studies in advanced or recurrent breast, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or prostate cancers.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: AP-002
Safety Assessment, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events (safety and tolerability) as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Through study completion/ up to 18 months|Dose Assessment, Define the recommended phase 2 dose, Up to 6 months
Efficacy Assessment, Estimation of anti-tumor activity per RESIST v1.1, Through study completion/ up to 18 months|Efficacy Assessment, For patients with bone metastases, the time to new bone metastasis, progression of bone metastases, or other skeletal related events, Through study completion/ up to 18 months|Pharmacokinetic Assessment, Estimation of pharmacokinetic profile by evaluating maximum plasma concentration \[Cmax\], Through study completion/ up to 18 months
The Phase 1 portion of this study will determine the Pharmacodynamically Active Dose (PAD) of AP-002 in humans, defined as the dose at which the plasma concentration of AP-002, as measured by Ga, is 300-500 ng/mL and which is at or below the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), to use in the clinical setting of advanced or recurrent solid tumors. This will be followed by a Phase 2 expanded cohort treated at the PAD, to estimate the efficacy of AP-002 in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer, NSCLC and prostate cancer.

Patients will receive AP-002 orally, once daily for 14 days of a 21 day cycle.
