Mid-point Transverse Process to Pleura Block for Breast Cancer Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial
This study will compare the analgesic effects of midpoint transverse process to pleura (MTP) block to control as well as thoracic paravertebral block.
Breast Cancer|Acute Pain|Anesthesia
PROCEDURE: PVB group|PROCEDURE: MTP block group|PROCEDURE: Control Group
Postoperative analgesia during the first 24 hours., Measured by opioid (equivalents of morphine) consumption and pain scores on a numerical rating scale., 48 hours
Post-operative quality of recovery during the first 24 hours., Measured by the Quality of recovery (QoR-15 scale)., 48 hours
Paravertebral blocks (PVBs) are frequently used for regional anesthesia for breast surgery. Ultrasound-guided paravertebral block is an advanced skill. The needle tip can be difficult to visualize with ultrasound, and the proximity to neurovascular structures as well as the pleura presents a risk of neurovascular injection and pneumothorax respectively. The midpoint transverse-process to pleura (MTP) block incorporates a novel needle endpoint that is technically easier to achieve and more distant from neurovascular structures and the pleura compared to traditional PVB. This study will compare the analgesic effects of MTP block to control and PVB.
