Efficacy and Safety of Cryoablation with Robotic Bronchoscopy System in Patients with Lung Cancer
The goal of this single-arm clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of robotic bronchoscopy system (RBS)-assisted cryoablation in the treatment of primary lung cancer in adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with histologically confirmed non-resectable primary lung cancer, regardless of gender. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does RBS-assisted cryoablation achieve a predefined target technical success rate for complete tumor ablation under imaging guidance? Is the incidence of severe procedure-related adverse events within an acceptable safety threshold ?

Participants will:

Provide written informed consent for RBS-assisted cryoablation.

Undergo pretreatment evaluations, including:

Multimodal imaging (CT/PET-CT) for tumor localization and staging. Pulmonary function tests and cardiopulmonary risk assessment. Receive RBS-guided cryoablation therapy under general anesthesia. Be monitored for intraoperative complications and postoperative adverse events for 72 hours.

Complete follow-up assessments at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure, including:

Contrast-enhanced CT scans to evaluate local tumor control. Documentation of symptom progression and quality-of-life metrics.
