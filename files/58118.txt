Deep Biopsy Via Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection in Upper GI Subepithelial Tumors
Upper gastrointestinal subepithelial tumors are frequently encountered during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Treatment plans for subepithelial tumors are determined by algorithms based on endoscopic ultrasonography images. However, endoscopic ultrasonography alone may not be able to diagnose and evaluate upper gastrointestinal SETs with sufficient accuracy. Adequate tissue samples are required to increase the diagnostic accuracy of subepithelial tumors.

Deep biopsy is method that normal mucosa was dissected using enodsocpi submucosal dissection technique and multiple endoscopic biopsies were performed.

The investigators will perform deep biopsy in subepithelial tumor.
