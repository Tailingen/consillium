A Study Of PF-03732010 In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
P-cadherin may play a part in tumor growth; PF-03732010 is a new drug that inhibits P-cadherin. This study will test how well the drug is tolerated, and what effects there might be. Blood will also be taken to measure the amount of drug in blood.
