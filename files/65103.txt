Pemetrexed and Radiation for Poor-Risk Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Pemetrexed is approved for second line therapy in metastatic NSCLC. Given the single-agent activity of pemetrexed and the tolerability of pemetrexed in combination with radiation, this study will evaluate survival rates and toxicities in patients with poor risk stage III NSCLC.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pemetrexed|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Progression Free Survival, To determine progression free survival in patients with poor risk stage III NSCLC treated with pemetrexed and concurrent definitive radiation, 24 months
Assess Safety and Toxicity, - To determine the toxicities of pemetrexed and concurrent definitive radiation in patients with poor risk stage III NSCLC., 24 months|Overall Survival, To determine overall survival of pemetrexed and concurrent definitive radiation in patients with poor risk stage III NSCLC., 24 months
OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

* Pemetrexed (Alimta) 500mg/m2 administered intravenously over approximately 10-minutes on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle x 3 cycles
* Radiation will start between days -1 to 2 from day 1 of cycle 1. Day 1 radiotherapy must be a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.

The planned radiation dose is 60 Gy in 2.0 Gy fractions. The entire PTV, including primary tumor and areas of known nodal disease, shall receive 60 Gy at 2.0 Gy fractions, 5 fractions/week for 30 fractions over 6 weeks.
