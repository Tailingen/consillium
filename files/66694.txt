Tangential Radiation Therapy Without Axillary Dissection in Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether treatment to the axilla (area under the arm) can be safely minimized by omitting axillary surgery and full axillary radiation therapy and replacing it with radiation therapy to the breast and lower axilla.
Early-Stage Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Tangential radiation
To determine if patients with early-stage breast tumors can be effectively treated by tangential breast radiation., 5 years
To determine the safety of this treatment., 5 years
* Patients will have undergone conservative breast surgery without axillary dissection prior to enrollment in this study.
* Patients will receive radiation therapy to the breast, including the lowest axillary lymph nodes, over a period of 6 1/2 weeks.
* No radiation will be specifically directed toward the upper axilla or supraclavicular lymph nodes.
* Patients will also receive 5 years of tamoxifen or another type of hormone therapy determined by the medical oncologist.
* Follow-up visits will occur every 6 months and mammograms every 12 months.
