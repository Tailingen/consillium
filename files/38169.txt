A Study of LNP3794 in Subjects With NRAS/KRAS Mutated Advanced or Metastatic Refractory Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study of LNP3794 (BI3011441) in subjects with NRAS/KRAS mutated advanced or metastatic refractory solid tumors. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of the orally administered LNP3794 (BI3011441) as monotherapy at selected dose levels.
NRAS/KRAS Mutated Advanced or Metastatic Refractory Solid Tumors
DRUG: LNP3794
Number of subjects with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at each dose level during the first cycle, Dose limiting toxicities will be evaluated through the first cycle (each cycle is 28 days), up to Day 28
Number of subjects with DLTs during the entire on-treatment period, Dose limiting toxicities will be evaluated through the entire on-treatment period, up to 2 years|Number of subjects with Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (AEs), Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events will be evaluated through the entire on-treatment period, up to 2 years|Number of subjects with treatment-related AEs at each dose level, Treatment-related AEs at each dose level will be evaluated through the entire on-treatment period, up to 2 years|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of LNP3794, Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration., Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) Day 1 and Day 14|Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of last quantifiable concentration (AUC[0-last]), AUC\[0-last\] is the measure of plasma drug concentration from time zero to the time of last quantifiable concentration., Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) Day 1 and Day 14|Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the end of dosing interval (AUC[0-tau]), AUC\[0-tau\] is the measure of plasma drug concentration from time zero to the end of dosing interval., Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) Day 1 to 2 and Day 14 to 15|Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), Tmax is the time to reach maximum plasma concentration., Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days) Day 1 and Day 14
