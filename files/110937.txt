BAY43-9006 (Sorafenib) Versus Interferon Alpha-2a in Patients With Unresectable and/or Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of the study is to:

* Find out if patients receiving BAY43-9006 will live longer without tumor progression than those receiving standard therapy with interferon alpha-2a
* Find out if a higher dose of BAY43-9006 can inhibit tumor progression in patients who progressed during standard dose treatment with BAY43-9006, and for how long these patients live without progression
* Find out how long patients live without progression who receive BAY43-9006 after failing to respond to standard therapy with interferon alpha-2a
* Find out in how many percent of patients BAY43-9006 prevents the growth of or shrinks kidney tumors and/or their metastases depending on treatment and dosage
* Find out if BAY43-9006 has any effect on the quality of life of patients with kidney cancer
* Find out the level of BAY43-9006 in the blood once per month and any changes in this level
* Find out whether BAY43-9006 effects are associated with specific biomarkers
