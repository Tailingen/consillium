Weight Management in Overweight Endometrial Cancer Patients Undergoing Fertility-sparing Treatment
In this study, overweight and obese patients with endometrial cancer treated with fertility- sparing therapy were randomly divided into two groups. The test group was given weight management, while the control group was given routine care. Relevant information such as body morphology and composition, glycolipid metabolism, molecular typing and tumor outcomes of the subjects were collected. By evaluating the tumor outcome and changes in glycolipid metabolism indicators, to confirm the effectiveness and safety of weight management for overweight and obese patients with endometrial cancer and treatd with fertility preservation.

Complete remission, Complete remission indicated by complete endometrial regression and interstitial metaplasia-like changes on histopathology after treatment (without any endometrial atypical hyperplasia or endometrioid adenocarcinoma lesions, as clarified by pathologists), 6 months of intervention|Recurrence, After complete remission, the reappearance of endometrioid adenocarcinoma or atypical endometrial hyperplasia during follow-up or after pregnancy or childbearing is defined as recurrence and is diagnosed by the pathologist., 6 months of intervention|Pregnancy, The clinical diagnosis was pregnancy., 2 years of intervention
Obesity is recognized as a major risk factor for the development of endometrial cancer. Notably, several retrospective studies have shown that obesity reduces complete remission and pregnancy rates and increases recurrence rates in patients with endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia who undergo fertility-sparing treatment. Guidelines or consensus statements for fertility-sparing treatment in endometrial cancer recommend weight management. However, prospective intervention studies on the effectiveness of systematic weight management models in patients receiving reproductive function-preserving treatment for endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia are lacking. This study therefore aimed to investigate the impact of the weight management on body morphology and composition, glycolipid metabolism, and tumor outcomes in overweight and obese patients with endometrial cancer and atypical hyperplasia who underwent reproductive function-preserving treatments.In this study, overweight and obese patients with endometrial cancer treated with fertility- sparing therapy were randomly divided into two groups. The test group was given weight management, while the control group was given routine care. Relevant information such as body morphology and composition, glycolipid metabolism, molecular typing and tumor outcomes of the subjects were collected. By evaluating the tumor outcome and changes in glycolipid metabolism indicators, to confirm the effectiveness and safety of weight management for overweight and obese patients with endometrial cancer and treatd with fertility preservation.
