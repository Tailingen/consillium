Safety and Efficacy of Anlotinib in Combination With Irinotecan in Patients With Pretreated Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Patients with pretreated advanced colorectal cancer are recruited to the phase I portion of this prospective non-randomised study in an escalated dose cohort. The primary endpoint of the dose-escalation phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of anlotinib when given in combination with irinotecan. The phase II (dose-expansion) portion is designed to characterize the safety and potential efficacy of the combination therapy in pretreated advanced colorectal cancer patients.
