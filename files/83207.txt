Cold Snare Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) vs Cold EMR With Margin Snare Tip Soft Coagulation (STSC)
Randomised controlled trial comparing cold snare endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) with cold snare EMR and adjuvant margin STSC in the complete resection of 15-40mm lateral-spreading adenomas
Colorectal Polyp|Colon Adenoma|Colon Cancer
PROCEDURE: Cold Snare Endoscopic mucosal resection with adjuvant snare tip soft coagulation|PROCEDURE: Cold Snare Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
Complete resection rate (CRR), Determined by endoscopic assessment (no visible residual adenoma) and histological assessment (biopsies of resection margin), 1 day|Adenoma recurrence rate (ARR), ARR at first surveillance colonoscopy (SC1) as determined by endoscopic assessment (no visible recurrent adenoma) and histological assessment (scar biopsies), 4-6 months
Intra-procedural and post-procedural complication rates, Intraprocedural bleeding, clinically significant post-polypectomy bleeding, deep mural injury, post polypectomy coagulation syndrome, 30 days
Rationale:

Conventional EMR is well-established for the resection of lateral-spreading adenomas and has been shown to be highly efficacious with adjuvant STSC. Cauterisation-related complications occur relatively frequently and while endoscopically treatable, still carry morbidity not seen in current cold snare polypectomy data.

Cold snare polypectomy has an excellent safety profile for smaller polyps, without cauterisation-related adverse events. Limited data on cold EMR for large adenomatous laterally-spreading lesions shows minimal complications. Efficacy, however, is yet to be evaluated in prospective randomised trials. Observational data demonstrates recurrence rates exceeding conventional EMR. Since STSC causes significant reduction in recurrence in conventional EMR, the safety and efficacy of this adjuvant technique, when compared to isolated cold snare EMR, has theoretical advantages in both safety and efficacy.

The safety and efficacy of these two techniques will therefore be compared in a randomised controlled trial.

Hypothesis:

Cold snare EMR of 15-40mm lateral-spreading adenomas with adjuvant STSC is expected to be superior regarding complete resection and adenoma recurrence rates as compared to cold snare EMR.
