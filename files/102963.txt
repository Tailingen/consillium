EXErcise Regimen Designed to Improve Functional Mobility, Body Composition, and Strength After Treatment for Cancer
This protocol seeks to analyze patient outcomes of the standard of care, monitored group exercise regimen of high-load resistance training and functional exercises with compound movements under close supervision on individuals who have been treated for cancer.

Determine changes in fat mass in pounds from before to after the nutrition and exercise regimen via bioimpedance analysis, Measurement on bioimpedance analysis machine (Inbody 970), 3 months|Determine changes in fat mass in pounds from before to after the nutrition and exercise regimen via ultrasound, Measurement via ultrasound and calculation with Jackson-Pollack calculations, 3 months|Determine changes in muscle mass in pounds from before to after the nutrition and exercise regimen, Measurement on bioimpedance analysis machine (Inbody 970), 3 months
Determine changes in overall score of functional movement screen (FMS) from before to after the nutrition and exercise regimen, Determine changes in overall score of functional movement screen (FMS) from before to after the nutrition and exercise regimen, 3 months|Determine changes in Y-balance score for each leg, Y-balance score adds up the distance each leg can move in the front and side directions, divided by the length of the hip. This correlates inversely with fall risk., 3 months|Determine changes in strength via load measured in pounds from before to after the nutrition and exercise regimen, Load is calculated by multiplying sets by repetitions by weight lifted for a specific exercise, 3 months|Determine changes in EQ-5D responses 1-5 and overall score from before to after the nutrition and exercise regimen, EQ-5D asks 5 questions rates from 1-5 and an overall rating of health, 3 months
