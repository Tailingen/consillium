Vertebral Marrow Attention Trial (VMAT)
The purpose of this study is to see whether designing radiation to spare the vertebral bone marrow can limit the rates of lymphopenia during standard of care chemoradiation therapy and in the time to count recovery in the ensuing weeks. Secondary endpoints will examine whether this leads to improved disease control whether this is predictive of improved clinical outcomes such as rates of local recurrence (LR), metastasis free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), and progression free survival (PFS) which will be followed prospectively up to 5 years.

OTHER: Evidence-based radiation dose limitation to the vertebral bone marrow
Limited G3L Toxicity, The primary end point will be evaluating whether implementing dosimetric constraints to the bone marrow will decrease rates of G3L toxicity in the peripheral blood compared to expected rates of 40% in large series examining toxicities during chemoradiation. Values will be expressed as a percentage rates of G3L lymphopenia., 6 weeks
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS), as measured from time of enrollment in the study, Baseline to study end (up to 5 years)|Progression free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS), either distant or local measured on routine surveillance imaging, Baseline to study end (up to 5 years)|Local Recurrence (LR), Local Recurrence (LR), measured per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria on routine imaging,, Baseline to study end (up to 5 years)|Metastasis Free Survival (MFS), Metastasis Free Survival (MFS), as measured on surveillance imaging, Baseline to study end (up to 5 years)|Change in Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Baseline to study end (up to 5 years)
