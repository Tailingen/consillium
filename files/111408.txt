Safety and Dose Finding Study of New Vehicle Formulations Containing Ingenol Mebutate to Treat Actinic Keratosis on the Forearm
The purpose of this study is to determine if the new vehicle formulations containing ingenol mebutate are as safe and effective as Picato® gel 0.05% (it's current vehicle formulation) when applied to AK lesions on the forearm for two consecutive days.
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: once daily for two consecutive days (Picato)
Safety of 3 new vehicle formulations containing ingenol mebutate compared to Picato® gel applied topically once daily for two consecutive days to four separate treatment areas containing actinic keratosis on the forearm, Safety data to be collected via CRF entries of AEs/SAEs and photographs. Relative skin reactions for comparison to Picato®., 2 weeks
Evaluate treatment responses on AK of selected concentration of ingenol mebutate containing vehicle formulation from Part 1 compared to Picato® gel as assessed by reduction in the number of selected AK lesions 2 months after treatment, Assessed by visible and imaged lesion count, 2 months
Safety of the new ingenol mebutate vehicle formulation (ascertained in Part 1) compared to Picato® gel applied topically once daily for 2 consecutive days to 4 separate treatment areas containing actinic keratosis on the forearm, Safety data to be collected via CRF entries of AEs/SAEs and photographs. Treatment responses assessed by Reflective confocal microscopy scoring of visible selected AK lesions, 8 weeks
This study will be run in 2 parts. The first part involves applying escalating concentrations of the new vehicle formulations containing ingenol mebutate to AKs on the forearms. Reactions and safety will be compared to Picato® (a registered and marketed ingenol mebutate gel) to ascertain if the new vehicle formulations are at least as safe and effective as Picato® . The purpose of part 2 is to select the concentration in the "new formulation" that produces this same, if not better response, as Picato® and with a similar or better safety profile.
