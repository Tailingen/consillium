Biomarkers of Resiliency in Childhood Cancer Surgery
This observational study is to better understand how children and their families recover after the stress of major surgery for cancer so that investigators can create ways to improve resilience during recovery. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Can information obtained from patients and their caregivers wearing smartwatches and answering questionnaires be used to measure how patients are recovering from surgery?
2. Are there specific patterns in patients' circulating proteins and metabolites that are associated with stress after surgery?

Participants, including pediatric patients undergoing surgery for cancer and their primary caregiver, will be asked to:

* wear a smartwatch
* complete questionnaires
* allow for extra blood to be drawn for this research study when they are having their regular blood draws for clinical purposes

These actions will occur at baseline prior to patients' surgery and then afterwards for up to one year. There are no changes to participants' clinical care or surgical care as a result of the study. Investigators will also collect participants' clinical information and cancer-specific outcomes. Participants will be remunerated for their time.

Surgical resilience, Using smartwatches, we will assess motor activity by minutes spent being sedentary, active, or highly active, heart rate, and sleep duration and stages. This information will be collected before and after surgical resection. Data from the smartwatches syncs with Garmin connect using Fitabase which allows the study team to monitor and analyze the data. Results will be correlated with questionnaires responses, to see if there are digital biomarker patterns associated with return to baseline quality of life postoperatively., 1 year
Quality of life - PedsQL, Results from Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Brain Tumor Module will be used to evaluate the quality of life outcomes in patients up to 18 years old. PedsQLâ„¢ assessments include 23 items answered on a Likert scale where 0=never a problem; 1=almost never a problem; 2=sometimes a problem; 3=often a problem; 4=almost always a problem., 1 year|Quality of life - PHQ-9, The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 consists of 9 items related to problems over the last 2 weeks. Items are answered on a 4-point Likert scale where 0=not at all; 1=several days, 2=more than half the days; and 3=nearly every day. If any problem items were indicated, participants are asked to answer a final question with one of the following: not difficult at all; somewhat difficult; very difficult; or extremely difficult., 1 year|Biomarkers, Participants who are the patients having surgery will have extra blood collected during routine clinical blood draws over time. This will be used for proteomic, metabolomic, and exposomic testing to see if specific proteins, metabolites, or chemicals are changed from baseline after surgery and if any levels are associated with improved resilience or quality of life., 1 year
