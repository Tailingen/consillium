Partial Liver Radiotherapy for Unresectable Liver Metastases
This study is designed to treat tumors in the liver that cannot be removed surgically and chemotherapy cannot control these tumors, using radiation therapy and a more precise delivery than has been used before.
Metastatic Colorectal Liver Cancer
RADIATION: radiation therapy
To evaluate feasibility of conformal radiation therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal liver cancer and determine its safety
To evaluate local control rate within irradiated fields|To assess failure patterns and survival of patients treated with conformal liver radiation|Set up verification with cone-beam CT (OBI on Boar Imager)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility of conformal radiation therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal liver cancer. This study would also evaluate local control rate within irradiated area and to assess failure patterns and survival of patients treated with conformal liver radiation.
