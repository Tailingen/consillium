A Phase 1, Open-Label, Randomized, Cross-Over, Pharmacokinetic Study Evaluating the Effect of S-1 on Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-sequence, cross-over, pharmacokinetic (PK) study evaluating the effect of the DPD inhibitory action of CDHP as an S-1 component compared with FT alone on the PK of 5-FU in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts (Cross-Over Pharmacokinetic Phase and S-1 Extension Phase).
Tumors
DRUG: S-1|DRUG: FT
Cross-Over Pharmacokinetic Phase: To compare plasma concentrations, investigate the plasma and urine pharmacokinetic profiles, and to evaluate the duration of DPD inhibition after the administration of S-1, The Cross-Over Pharmacokinetic phase (Part 1) will last 11 days|S-1 Extension Phase: Efficacy (antitumor response), Each cycle of the S-1 Extension Phase (Part 2) will be 21 days (14 days S-1 treatment, 7 days recovery). The end of study for the Extension Phase will be 30 days after the last dose of S-1.|S-1 Extension Phase: Safety (Adverse events, lab assessments), Each cycle of the S-1 Extension Phase (Part 2) will be 21 days (14 days S-1 treatment, 7 days recovery). The end of study for the Extension Phase will be 30 days after the last dose of S-1.|S-1 Extension Phase: Pharmacokinetic profiles of the components of S-1 and their metabolites, and duration of DPD inhibition after administration of multiple doses (end of Cycle 1), Each cycle of the S-1 Extension Phase (Part 2) will be 21 days (14 days S-1 treatment, 7 days recovery). The end of study for the Extension Phase will be 30 days after the last dose of S-1.
