T-cell Receptor α/β Depleted Donor Lymphocyte Infusion
This pilot study is being conducted to treat patients who have a certain type of malignancy (lymphoid or myeloid) with immune effector cells after a T-cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (TCD HSCT).

This study is designed to see whether an investigational cellular product of immune cells obtained from a donor's cells that have been treated so that the type of cells that can lead to graft vs host disease have been removed can be safely administered. These cell products are administered following the initial stem cell transplant to assess the effect and improvement on minimal residual disease status, infectious complication, progression-free and overall survival.
Lymphoid Leukemia, Acute|Myeloid Malignancy|Plasma Cell Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: T-cell Receptor α/β Depleted Donor Lymphocyte Infusions
Incidence of Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TE-SAEs), TE-SAEs are defined as the composite of death, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, stroke, acute graft versus host disease (GvHD), and clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities., 30 days post-infusion
Number of Participants in Remission, Remission - measured by absence of signs and symptoms, 2 years|Number of Participants With Transplant-associated Viral Complications, Transplant-associated viral complications - measured by viral infections associated with transplant, 2 years|Disease Free Survival- Measured by Absence of Relapse/Recurrence or Death., Disease free survival - measured by (absence of ) relapse/recurrence or death.

Relapse and recurrence, both will be measured by greater than 5% circulating leukemic blasts in the marrow or peripheral blood and/or the presence of blasts in any extra medullary site and/or disease determined by clinical assessment., 2 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival - measured by death, 2 years
