RRx-001 in Second Line Treatment of Advanced Cholangiocarcinoma Prior to Readministration of First-Line Therapy
The purpose of this study is to see if the investigational drug, RRx-001, an epigenetic agent, which turns on a number of beneficial genes that the tumor has silenced, can resensitize the tumor(s), in other words make it/them re-respond to gemcitabine and cisplatin, which, hopefully, will translate to a longer lifespan. The name of the open-label study, which means that patients will know what treatments they are receiving, is EPIC, a hybrid or combination of EPIgenetic for the mechanism of action of RRx-001 and Cholangiocarcinoma.

The study treatment is divided into two stages. During the first stage, patients will receive RRx-001, which is administered intravenously weekly, for a fixed time period of six weeks. At that time the second stage starts in which cisplatin and gemcitabine are reintroduced for as long as the tumors respond to them to determine whether resensitization has occurred.

The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients at 9 weeks after the reintroduction of gemcitabine and cisplatin.
