Phase 2 Study of HMPL-453 Tartrate in Advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate in patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma harboring FGFR2 fusion/rearrangement. The main questions it aims to answer are:

• To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of HMPL-453 tartrate in the treatment of patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma harboring fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 fusions/rearrangements after at least one line of systemic treatment failure or intolerance Participants will receive HMPL-453 tartrate 300 mg QD orally (for 14 consecutive days \[Days 1 to 14\] followed by 7 days off \[Day 15 to 21\], 21 days as a treatment cycle.\]
Advanced Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: HMPL-453
Overall response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients whose best overall response are confirmed CR or PR, Measured up to 6 months after the last patient has been enrolled or all patients have finished their last PFS follow up, whichever comes first
Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of patients whose best overall response after treatment is confirmed CR or PR, or judged as SD (SD≥6 weeks), Measured up to 6 months after the last patient has been enrolled or all patients have finished their last PFS follow up, whichever comes first|Time to response (TTR), The time from the first dose of study drug to the first CR or PR in patients whose best overall response is a confirmed CR or PR, Measured up to 6 months after the last patient has been enrolled or all patients have finished their last PFS follow up, whichever comes first|Duration of response (DoR), The time from initial CR or PR to PD or death from any cause, whichever comes first, in patients whose best overall response is a confirmed CR or PR, Measured up to 6 months after the last patient has been enrolled or all patients have finished their last PFS follow up, whichever comes first|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from the first study treatment to the onset of PD or death from any cause, Measured up to 6 months after the last patient has been enrolled or all patients have finished their last PFS follow up, whichever comes first|Overall survival (OS), The time from the patients receiving the first study drug until the death due to any cause, up to 2 years
This is an open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HMPL-453 tartrate in the treatment of patients with advanced ICC harboring FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements after at least one line of systemic treatment failure or intolerance. The study consists of cohort 1 and cohort 2.

Cohort 1: Approximately 12 patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma harboring FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements after at least one line of systemic treatment failure or intolerance are planned to be enrolled in this cohort to receive HMPL-453 tartrate 150 mg administered orally once daily (QD) continuously in 21-day cycles.

Cohort 2: A total of approximately 113-116 patients are planned to be enrolled in this cohort, divided into safety run-in and extension phases. Approximately 6 to 9 patients with solid tumors who failed standard treatment or had intolerable toxicity will be enrolled into the first phase (safety run-in phase), to receive HMPL-453 tartrate 300 mg QD orally (for 14 consecutive days \[Day 1 to 14\], followed by 7 days off \[Day 15 to 21\], 21 days as a treatment cycle). Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) observation period consists of 28 days, in which a cycle of treatment will be received. Patients will enter second stage of cohort 2 (extension phase) after completion of safety run-in assessments. Approximately 20 patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma harboring FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements after at least one line of systemic treatment failure or intolerance will receive HMPL-453 tartrate 300 mg QD orally administered (for 14 consecutive days \[Day 1 to 14\], followed by 7 days off \[Day 15 to 21\], 21 days as a treatment cycle). Based on the efficacy and safety data of the already enrolled patients, and after reaching an agreement with China Center for Drug Evaluation, approximately 90 additional patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma harboring FGFR2 fusions/rearrangements after at least one line of systemic treatment failure or intolerance are being enrolled to support registration submission as the registration study stage of this study, receiving HMPL-453 tartrate 300 mg QD orally (for 14 consecutive days \[Days 1 to 14\] followed by 7 days off \[Day 15 to 21\], 21 days as a treatment cycle.
