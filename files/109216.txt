The FACT-B is a 36-item questionnaire composed of five multi-item functional subscales: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and a subscale related with the breast cancer and its treatment. The questionnaire employs 5 points Likert scales with responses from "not at all" to "very much". The total score is obtained from the sum of the score on each subscale.

Patients will complete a questionnaire at cycle 1 day 1 (before the first dose of neratinib and anti-diarrhoeal therapy), on day 1 of cycles 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 and at the End of Treatment Visit., Up to 13 months|Patient reported outcomes (PRO) of health related quality of life measured by EQ5D-5L, To be assessed using the EQ5D-5L questionnaire, a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It has 2 components:

* health state description: measured in terms of 5 dimensions; mobility (person's walking ability), self-care (ability to wash or dress by oneself), usual activities (work, study, housework, family or leisure activities), pain/discomfort (how much pain or discomfort they have), and anxiety/depression (how anxious or depressed they are). The number of levels of severity is 5; having no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and being unable to do/extreme problems. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension.
* Evaluation: It also includes a visual analogue scale, EQ VAS, which records patient's self-rated health on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable).

To be completed at day 1 of cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 and at the End of Treatment Visit., Up to 13 months|Patient reported outcomes (PRO) of health related quality of life measured by Systemic Therapy-Induced Diarrhea Assessment Test (STIDAT), PRO of health related quality of life will be assessed using the STIDAT questionnaire.

The STIDAT is a questionnaire that was developed using the FDA iterative process for patient-reported outcomes in which patients define diarrhoea based on presence of watery stool. The STIDAT assess patient's perception of having diarrhoea, daily number of bowel movements, daily number of diarrhoea episodes, antidiarrheal medication use, the presence of urgency, abdominal pain, abdominal spasms or fecal incontinence, patient's perception of diarrhoea severity, and QoL.

Patients will complete the instrument at cycle 1 day 1 (before the first dose of neratinib and anti-diarrhoeal therapy), on day 1 of cycles 2, 3, 4, 7, 10 and at the End of Treatment Visit., Up to 13 months
Minimal residual disease (MRD), Correlation of biomarkers data with patient outcome and safety data These analysis will be performed in the biomarker population. Given a relapse rate of around 10%, we anticipate that approximately 150-200 patients would be sufficient to explore the prognostic value of the MRD assessed on circulating tumor DNA and the correlation of the molecular and clinical relapse., Up to 13 months
This is an international, multicenter, prospective, controlled, randomized, adaptative, phase II study to evaluate the incidence of discontinuations due to diarrhoea within the first 3 cycles in patients with early-stage HER2+ and HR+ breast cancer treated with neratinib plus loperamide prophylaxis for the first 2 cycles versus neratinib with initial 2-week dose escalation plus PRN loperamide versus neratinib and loperamide plus colesevelam prophylaxis for 28 days.

After the preplanned therapy, prophylaxis or treatment for diarrhoea will be given as clinically indicated following the standard of care by the treating physician.

Approximately 315 patients will be enrolled in the study.

All enrolled patients will receive neratinib orally once daily for 13 cycles, continuously. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the diarrhoea prophylaxis arms, using an interactive response technology (IRT) module within the electronic data capture (EDC) system. Patients will be stratified according to menopausal status (premenopausal versus postmenopausal) and prior anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab only versus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab).

Baseline assessments will be performed prior to C1D1 dosing. During the first 3 cycles of treatment, safety data will be collected during the cycle visits. After the first 3 cycles, all patients will enter in a follow-up period to complete approximately 1 year of neratinib treatment. During this follow-up period, safety data will be collected every 3 months. An End-of-Treatment (EOT) Visit is planned on cycle 13 day 28 for all treatment arms (unless patient discontinues earlier), followed by a Safety Follow-up Visit (30 +/-5 days after the last dose of neratinib). This will be the core phase of the study.

After this safety follow-up visit, long term outcome data will be collected for 5 years to address the exploratory objectives. This will be the extended phase of the study. Archived primary tumor tissue (at baseline) and whole blood samples (at baseline, during the treatment and follow-up period, and at disease relapse) will be collected for the exploratory analyses.

Patients are anticipated to participate in the core phase of the study for approximately 1 year to address primary and secondary objectives (28 days for screening, approximately 12 months to complete neratinib treatment, and 30 days for a safety follow-up visit after the last dose of neratinib). Later on patients will continue in the extended phase of the study and will be followed-up for at least 5 years to collect long term outcome data to conduct the exploratory analyses. The approximate duration of the full study is 8 years.

The objectives of the study are indicated below:

Primary objectives:

To evaluate the incidence of neratinib discontinuations due to diarrhoea within the first 3 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days) in patients with early-stage HER2 overexpressed/amplified (HER2+), hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer who have completed adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy.
