Sodium Selenite and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of sodium selenite when administered in combination with radiation therapy to subjects with metastatic cancer based on safety and tolerability.
Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate|Hormone-resistant Prostate Cancer|Recurrent Prostate Cancer|Stage IV Prostate Cancer|Multiple Myeloma|Plasmacytoma
DRUG: sodium selenite|RADIATION: radiation therapy|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacological study|OTHER: questionnaire administration
MTD defined as the maximum dose at which =< 1 of 3 to 6 subjects in a dose group experience a drug-related dose-limiting toxicity, graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version (v)4.0, 3 weeks|Safety and tolerability of the combination using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria v4.0 grading system for adverse events, Safety observations and measurements including adverse events, laboratory data, vital signs, and performance status will be summarized., Up to 2 years
Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, PK parameters will be calculated using non-compartmental and/or compartmental models and PK parameters (if possible, maximum concentration \[Cmax\], time to Cmax, area under the curve during the dosing interval, half-life, oral clearance) will be summarized and presented., Week 1, day 1: at predose; 15 minutes; and at 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours; weeks 2 and 4, day 1: at predose and 1 hour|Overall biochemical response rate, Biochemical response defined as PSA decline \>= 50% from baseline at 8 weeks of therapy and which has been confirmed with a second PSA at \>= 3 weeks later., Up to 11 weeks|Tumor responses within the radiation therapy field, assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, Up to 2 years|Response rate (complete response, partial response and stable disease) within the radiation therapy field, Up to 2 years
Primary Objectives:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sodium selenite when given in combination with palliative radiation therapy
* To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of sodium selenite and palliative radiation therapy in metastatic cancer

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the pharmacokinetics of sodium selenite
* To evaluate the anti tumor activity of sodium selenite and palliative radiation therapy when given in combination

OUTLINE:

Patients receive sodium selenite orally (PO) 2 hours before daily radiation therapy treatments. Treatment continues for the duration of the course of radiation therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.
