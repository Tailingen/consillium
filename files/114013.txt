Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time interval from the date of surgery to the date of death due to any cause or the date a patient was last known to be alive. Estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 60 months
Disease Free Survival, Disease free survival (DFS) was defined as the time interval from the date of surgery to the date of disease recurrence or death or the date of a participant was last known to be alive without disease recurrence. Response was evaluated according to revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to 48 months
Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events, Number of participants experiencing adverse events during chemoradiation and during adjuvant chemotherapy, at any grade, as defined by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. This is used to determine the Toxicity profile., Up to 60 months
