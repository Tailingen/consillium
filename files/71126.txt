Ipilimumab With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Patients With Unresectable Stage III and Stage IV Melanoma
The safety of the combination of ipilimumab with carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment with two different dosing schedules will be investigated in patients with metastatic melanoma. This protocol will also investigate both the clinical benefit of this combination and the features of the host immune system that may predict response to ipilimumab with chemotherapy in patients with unresectable Stage III and Stage IV melanoma.
