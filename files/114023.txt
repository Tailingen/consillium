Safety and Efficacy of EGEN-001 Combined With Carboplatin and Docetaxel in Recurrent, Platinum-Sensitive, Ovarian Cancer
Ovarian cancer may be caused by a build-up of genetic defects, or damaged genes within the body's cells. When genes are damaged, the body may be unable to produce a group of proteins, called cytokines, used by the immune system to fight cancer and some infections. The investigational gene transfer agent EGEN-001 contains the human gene for the cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) in a special carrier system designed to enter the cells and help the body to produce cytokines. Therefore, the purpose of the EGEN-001 therapy is to attempt to enhance the body's natural ability to recognize and fight cancer cells. Funding Source - FDA OOPD

GENETIC: EGEN-001 (phIL-12-005/PPC)
Determine the MTD and treatment-related toxicities of intra-peritoneal (IP) infusion of EGEN-001 in combination with carboplatin and docetaxel for recurrent, platinum-sensitive, ovarian cancer., 12-14 months
Examine the optimal EGEN-001 treatment regimen in combination with carboplatin and docetaxel in recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, and assess EGEN-001's impact on tumor, CA-125, and activity markers of biological activity., 10 months
This study has two purposes:

* To determine what different strengths and number of doses of EGEN-001, administered directly into the peritoneal cavity, can be given safely in combination with standard intravenous chemotherapy for ovarian cancer
* To evaluate the anti-cancer activity of EGEN-001 when combined with standard chemotherapy; biological markers of EGEN-001 activity will be collected and ovarian cancer burden will be evaluated per standard practice.
