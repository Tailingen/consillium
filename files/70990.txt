Prasterone (Dehydroepiandrosterone) in Treating Postmenopausal Cancer Survivors With Vaginal Symptoms
RATIONALE: Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may help relieve vaginal symptoms in female cancer survivors.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial studies DHEA to see how well it works compared to placebo in treating postmenopausal cancer survivors with vaginal symptoms.

Alleviation of the Most Bothersome Vaginal Symptom (Vaginal Dryness or Dyspareunia) Over 12 Weeks, The primary outcome is severity of the most bothersome vaginal symptom: dryness or dyspareunia. The Vaginal Symptom Measure (VSM) was used to evaluate the severity of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. The VSM uses a 5- point ordinal response scale; 1="none", 2="mild", 3="moderate", 4="severe" and 5="very severe" to measure the severity associated with vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia. For each patient, the change in severity was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the week 12 reported score. Therefore, the full range of scores ranges from -4 (greatest decrease in severity) to 4 (greatest increase in severity). A negative score indicates a decrease in severity from baseline, zero indicates no reported affect and positive scores indicate a more severe report at week 12. The primary assessment method will be a comparison of the averages of the changes over time in the severity items for the most bothersome symptom from baseline to 12 weeks (as indicated at baseline)., At baseline and 12 weeks
Primary Goal:

* To determine the effectiveness of two doses of daily vaginal prasterone (dehydroepiandrosterone \[DHEA\]) versus placebo for alleviation of the most bothersome vaginal symptom (vaginal dryness or dyspareunia) over 12 weeks.

Exploratory Goals:

* To evaluate any toxicities arising from DHEA in this patient population. (Exploratory)
* To evaluate the impact of vaginal DHEA on negative sexual thoughts, sexual function and urologic symptoms. (Exploratory)
* To explore the role of psychologic (mood, stress), physical (demographics and treatment variables) and situational factors (partner variables and fatigue) as predictors of vaginal dryness and performance outcomes at baseline and at various endpoints throughout the study. (Exploratory)
* To explore the characteristics of vaginal atrophy and the relationship between vaginal atrophy and quality-of-life questionnaire responses and exposure to hormonal therapy (tamoxifen, exemestane, anastrozole, or letrozole). (Exploratory)
* To examine the effects of the use of open-label vaginal DHEA gel over 8 weeks in women completing the placebo gel arm of the randomized trial. (Exploratory)

Correlative Research Goals:

* To evaluate the impact of vaginal DHEA on maturation index and pH (select institutions).
* To evaluate the impact of vaginal DHEA on sex steroid concentrations (estradiol, free testosterone, estrone, and DHEA-S) and markers of bone turnover (osteocalcin and bone alkaline phosphatase). (Correlative)
* As part of ongoing research for NCCTG Cancer Control studies, we are banking blood products for future studies. (Correlative)

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to current tamoxifen therapy (yes vs no), concurrent aromatase inhibitor use (anastrozole/letrozole vs exemestane vs none), hysterectomy (yes vs no), and cigarette smoking (current vs past vs never). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms, patients receive low dose vaginal DHEA, high dose vaginal DHEA or vaginal placebo gel.

Participants may complete the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Fatigue: Vitality subscale of the SF-36, the Vaginal Symptom Quality Questionnaire, the DHEA Side Effect Questionnaire, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), the Sexually Related Intrusive Thoughts - ITS, Impact of Treatment Scale, the Urogenital Atrophy Questionnaire, and the Subject Global Impression of Change at baseline and periodically during study.
