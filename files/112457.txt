Early Switch From First-Line Docetaxel/Prednisone to Cabazitaxel/Prednisone and the Opposite Sequence, Exploring Molecular Markers in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
Docetaxel and cabazitaxel are cancer chemotherapy agents of the taxane drug class. The purpose of this study is to explore the benefit, for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), of a regimen in which participants begin treatment with either of these two taxane drugs (docetaxel or cabazitaxel, in combination with prednisone) and are switched to the other taxane drug if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value does not decrease ≥30% after 4 cycles. As defined in study protocol amendment 3, efficacy results are summarized for all participants combined, irrespective of which agent (docetaxel or cabazitaxel) was administered initially, rather than separately for the two groups based on taxane administered initially. One of the primary outcome measures is percentage of participants with a ≥50% sustained decrease from baseline in PSA at any time during the trial. By providing an opportunity for patients to switch taxane based on early PSA response, there may be a difference in result for this measure versus result in a study where it was not possible to switch. The other primary outcome measures are change from baseline in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) biomarkers percent androgen receptor nuclear localization (%ARNL) and microtubule bundling (MTB).

Percentage of Participants With PSA Response, PSA response was defined as ≥50% decrease in PSA levels in both treatment arms from baseline, during the whole treatment, before treatment switch and after treatment switch. PSA progression was defined as decline of PSA from baseline (an increase of ≥25% \[at least 2ng/ml\] over the nadir value, confirmed by a second PSA value at least 3 weeks apart) and no decline of PSA from baseline (an increase of ≥25% \[at least 2ng/ml\] over the baseline value after 12 weeks of treatment, confirmed by a second PSA value at least 3 weeks apart). Because the purpose of this study is to explore the benefit of a regimen in which participants are switched to a different taxane if PSA does not decrease ≥30% after 4 cycles, irrespective of which agent (docetaxel or cabazitaxel) is administered initially, the data for participants who began treatment with docetaxel and for those who began treatment with cabazitaxel were combined for the efficacy analyses., Baseline, Pre-dose every 3 weeks, 30 days after last treatment administration (End of treatment [EOT]), every 3 months (for 1 year) then every 6 months until PSA progression or study cut-off, whichever was earlier (Maximum duration: 60 weeks)|Drug-target Engagement in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs): Change From Baseline at Cycle 1 Day 8 in Percent Androgen Receptor Nuclear Localization (%ARNL) by Categories of PSA Decrease From Baseline (≥50%, Not ≥50%) After Cycle 4, Analysis of CTCs is a co-primary endpoint. Growth of prostate cancer cells is dependent on sustained androgen receptor (AR) nuclear signaling. Taxanes (e.g., docetaxel and cabazitaxel) may mediate some of their activity in prostate cancer by impairing AR trafficking along the microtubules from the tumor cell cytoplasm into the nucleus, as a result of taxane-induced microtubule bundling (MTB). Blood samples were collected at baseline and post-treatment to allow isolation of CTCs, which were evaluated for tumor cell biomarker measures %ARNL and MTB score. %ARNL was assessed by quantitative analysis of images of CTCs captured by geometrically enhanced differential immunocapture (GEDI). Reduction from baseline in %ARNL (percentage of total cellular AR that is located in the nucleus) may indicate inhibition of AR signaling. Change from baseline in %ARNL at Cycle 1 Day 8 is summarized by categories of participants with PSA decrease from baseline (≥50%, Not ≥50%) after Cycle 4., Baseline and Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 4|Drug-target Engagement in CTCs: Change From Baseline at Cycle 1 Day 8 in MTB by Categories of PSA Decrease From Baseline (≥30%, Not ≥30%) After Cycle 4, Analysis of CTCs is a co-primary endpoint. Growth of prostate cancer cells is dependent on sustained AR nuclear signaling. Taxanes (e.g., docetaxel and cabazitaxel) may mediate some of their activity in prostate cancer by impairing AR trafficking along the microtubules from the tumor cell cytoplasm into the nucleus, as a result of taxane-induced MTB. Blood samples were collected at baseline and post-treatment to allow isolation of CTCs, which were evaluated for tumor cell biomarker measures %ARNL and MTB score. MTB in images of CTCs captured by GEDI was qualitatively assessed by three independent operators for increase compared with baseline on a scale of 0 to 3 from no to most MTB increase. Increase from baseline in MTB may indicate inhibition of AR signaling. Change from baseline in MTB at Cycle 1 Day 8 is summarized by categories of participants with PSA decrease from baseline (≥30%, Not ≥30%) after Cycle 4., Baseline and Cycle 1 Day 8, Cycle 4
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of random allocation of the treatment and the date of first documentation of any of the following: radiographic tumor progression (using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST1.1\] before any switch and during the study), clinical progression (including skeletal-related events, increasing pain requiring escalation of narcotic analgesics, urinary obstruction), PSA progression or death from any cause. Analysis was performed by Kaplan Meier method., From Baseline until DP or death due to any cause or study cut off, whichever was earlier (Maximum duration: 60 weeks)|PSA Progression Free Survival, PSA progression-free survival before any switch and PSA progression free survival during the study was defined as the time interval between the date of Day 1 of Cycle 1 to the date of either first PSA progression or death due to any cause whichever came first. PSA progression was defined as decline of PSA from baseline (an increase of ≥25% \[at least 2ng/mL\] over the nadir value, confirmed by a second PSA value at least 3 weeks apart) and no decline of PSA from baseline (an increase of ≥25% \[at least 2ng/mL\] over the baseline value after 12 weeks of treatment, confirmed by a second PSA value at least 3 weeks apart)., From Baseline until DP or death due to any cause or study cut off date, whichever was earlier (Maximum duration: 60 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, From baseline until DP or study cut off, whichever was earlier (Maximum duration: 60 weeks)|Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS), From baseline, every 12 weeks until radiological tumor progression or study cut-off, whichever was earlier (Maximum duration: 60 weeks)|Clinical Progression-free Survival (cPFS), cPFS was assessed before switch and during the study including skeletal-related events (SRE), increasing pain requiring escalation of narcotic analgesics, urinary obstruction, etc. SRE included pathological fractures and/or spinal cord compression, need for bone irradiation (including radioisotopes or bone surgery), change of antineoplastic therapy (including introduction of bisphosphonates or denosumab in the face of increase in pain) to treat bone pain. Pain was assessed using present pain intensity (PPI) scale (0=no pain, up to 5=excruciating pain) and analgesics used for cancer pain (1 point for non-narcotic medications and 4 points for narcotic medications)., Baseline, Pre-dose every 3 weeks, EOT, every 3 months (for 1 year) until first SRE occurrence or death or study cut-off, whichever was earlier (Maximum duration: 60 weeks)|Overall Survival, Overall survival before switch and overall survival during the study was defined as the time interval from the date of random allocation to the date of death due to any cause until study cut-off date., From baseline until death due to any cause or study cut-off, whichever was earlier (Maximum duration: 60 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With ≥30% and ≥50% Reduction in PSA Response, Participants with ≥30% and ≥50% reduction in PSA response from base line were evaluated in participants who were previously treated with a high potency androgen receptor (AR)-targeted agent (AR signaling inhibitor or cytochrome P450 17 alphahydroxylase/17,20lyase \[CYP 17\] inhibitor)., From baseline until DP or study cut-off, whichever was earlier (Maximum duration: 60 weeks)
