Intensive Chemotherapy and Autotransplantation for Patients With Newly Diagnosed Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma
The purpose of this study is to see how effective treatment of high doses of chemotherapy is for your tumor. We will also be looking at the side effects and risks of this treatment.

You will receive very high doses of chemotherapy. High doses of chemotherapy can destroy tumor cells, but it can also destroy normal bone marrow cells. These cells produce white blood cells (which fight infection), red blood cells (which carry oxygen) and platelets (which allow your blood to clot). With too few of these cells there is a serious risk of infection and bleeding.

Therefore, before treatment begins, we will collect some of your own blood cells, called peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). These cells help create new blood cells. The PBPCs are frozen and saved while you are being treated. Then at the end of treatment, your PBPCs are thawed and given back to you. These healthy PBPCs will replace the blood cells that the high dose chemotherapy destroys and allow your bone marrow to recover and produce blood cells. In a prior study we treated 69 patients in a similar way. More than half were able to avoid or delay brain radiation. This new study will use a different high dose chemotherapy regimen.
