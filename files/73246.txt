Low Dose Mosunetuzumab for the Treatment of Patients With Indolent B-Cell Lymphoma
This phase II trial tests the safety, side effects and effectiveness of mosunetuzumab in treating patients with slow growing (indolent) B-cell lymphoma. Mosunetuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

Overall response (OR), OR will be defined as complete response and partial response at the end of therapy based on the latest version of Lugano criteria. Response rates will be calculated using simple binomial proportions and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will be derived., Up to week 13
Incidence of adverse events (AE's), All AEs will be graded in severity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. AEs will be summarized by type, severity, duration, and attribution., Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment|Incidence of grade 3 or greater cytokine release syndrome (CRS), CRS will be graded by the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Consensus Grading system., Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment|Incidence of Immune Effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity syndrome, Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment|Progression free survival (PFS), Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate PFS., At initiation of study treatment to disease progression, up to 5 years|Duration of response, Up to 5 years|Time to next lymphoma treatment, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate time to next lymphoma treatment., At initiation of study treatment to initiation of next therapy, up to 5 years|Time to cytotoxic treatment, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate time to cytotoxic treatment., At initiation of study treatment to initiation of cytotoxic treatment, up to 5 years
OUTLINE:

Patients receive mosunetuzumab intravenously (IV) over 2-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Patients also undergo blood sample collection and positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) on study. Patients may undergo CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as clinically indicated and may undergo collection of oral and/or rectal swabs on study.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 13, at 6 months, and then for up to 5 years per institutional standards.
