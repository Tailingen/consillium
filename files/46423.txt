Association Between Pre-op Non-Selective Beta-Blockers and Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence Post-Liver Transplant
The goal of this observational study is to investigate the effect of non-selective beta-blocker (NSBB) on the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) following liver transplantation in patients who underwent liver transplantation (LT) for treating hepatocellular carcinoma.

The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* Is the usage of non-selective beta-blocker associated with decreased recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma following liver transplantation?
* Is the usage of non-selective beta-blocker associated with all-cause mortality following liver transplantation?

Researchers will compare the NSBB group, including patients who received non-selective beta-blocker therapy for at least 30 consecutive days within 3 months prior to liver transplantation more than 30 days prior, with the control group to to see if non-selective beta-blocker treatment is associated with decreased recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma following liver transplantation.
