Epidemiologic Study of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the US
The purpose of this study is:

* to investigate the risk factors of HCC among Americans with focus on lifestyle factors and energy balance.
* to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes that are associated with HCC risk through a genome-wide search.
* to assess if genetic susceptibility differs by hepatitis virus infection or lifestyle factors, and to explore if there are interplays or effect modifications between genetic factors and viral infection or lifestyle factors.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Lifetime physical activity, Lifetime physical activity will be measured by collecting data on major types of physical activity separately and by determining frequency, intensity, and duration of each activity using a combined modification of Friedenreich's lifetime physical activity questionnaire and Kriska's past year physical activity questionnaires., 20 years|Energy intake, A modified Food Frequency questionnaire based on one developed by Dr. Alan Kristal from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) in Seattle will capture energy intake by differentiating low-fat food options from higher-fat counterparts., 20 years|Lifestyle factors, Structured questionnaires will be used to elicit information on demographic, anthropometric, and socioeconomic factors, long-term use of medications, medical history, and family history of cancer, cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, physical activity, and dietary habits. Additional information unrelated to liver cancer will be included in the questionnaire to help assess possible recall bias., 20 years
