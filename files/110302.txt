Postoperation Maintenance Therapy for Resectable Liver Metastases of Colorectal Cancer Guided by ctDNA
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare in resectable liver metastases colorectal cancer patients.The main question it aims to answer is to investigate whether the progression-free survival (PFS) of resectable colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) patients with positive ctDNA after surgery is superior with the combination of adjuvant chemotherapy and maintenance therapy compared to adjuvant chemotherapy alone.

3-years Progression Free Survival, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of any progression or death from any cause., 3 years after operation.|5-years Progression Free Survival, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of any progression or death from any cause., 5 years after operation.
3-years overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. For patients who are still alive at the time of the final analysis, the date of the last contact will be recorded., 3 years after operation.|5-years overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause.

Specifically, chemotherapy-related adverse reactions may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, and infections; radiation therapy-related adverse reactions may include skin inflammation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and dry mouth; postoperative complications may include bleeding, infection, intestinal obstruction, and poor wound healing. Researchers typically record the types, severity, and impact of these complications on treatment to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adjuvant therapy., 5 years.
