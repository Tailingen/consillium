Swallowing, Speech and Quality of Life of Patients With Carcinoma of the Oropharynx
The curative treatment and organ preservation in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx is multimodal. It involves induction chemotherapy and depending on the response radio-chemotherapy or surgery. The combination of these methods has important functional consequences.

The aim of this prospective pilot study is to describe swallowing, speech, but also patients' quality of life before and after therapeutic management (existing studies measuring these functions after treatment but not before).
