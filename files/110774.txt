Impact of Osteopathy on Pain After Breast Cancer Surgery
Breast cancer can be painful following surgery or can develop later and remain persistent. Pain occurrence is frequent with 50% of women developing sequelae pain of varying intensity with an impact on the quality of life. One of the priorities of the 3rd French Cancer Plan is to preserve quality of life.

Osteopathy, complementary therapy, may help to reduce inconvenience caused by the disease, treatments and their side effects (asthenia, anxiety and pain).

The main objective is to assess the impact of osteopathic treatment on pain in patients following breast cancer surgery. The impact will be considered beneficial if the pain score (digital scale) in the intervention group is lower, by at least two points, than the pain score in the control group at the end of the study.

This is a monocentric, randomized, parallel group, single-blind and prospective clinical trial.

Assess the impact of osteopathic treatment on pain in patients following breast cancer surgery, The primary outcome measure will be the evaluation of the "usual pain in the last eight days" measured from the pain score (digital scale).
