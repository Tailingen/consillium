ARX788 in Breast Cancer With Low Expression of HER2
A Phase 2 Study of ARX788 in unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer with low expression of HER2.
Breast Cancer With Low Expression of HER2
DRUG: ARX788
Objective remission rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects who have achieved complete response and partial response according RECIST 1.1, 2 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time between date of first dose of study therapy and date of progression or death, whichever occurs first, will be computed for response evaluable subjects. Subjects will be censored at time of subsequent therapy, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from first dose of study therapy to the date of death (any cause). Subjects who are alive will be censored at the last known time that the subject was alive, 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as cases where objective remission (assessed as complete remission or partial remission according to RECIST 1.1 standard) or stable disease during the study, 2 years|Duration of relief (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented objective response (CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression or death, 2 years
A single arm, phase 2 study of ARX788 in unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer with low expression of HER2. Subjects should received ≥2 lines of systemic chemotherapy regimens for recurrent or metastatic disease, and for HR positive subjects, also need to have received ≥2-line endocrine therapy ± targeted therapy (including neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy). HER2 low expression is defined as HER2 IHC 1+ or HER2 IHC 2+ and FISH negative. The ARX788 will be administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) intravenous (IV) infusion.
