Carbon Ions Radiation Therapy for Resectable or Borderline Resectable Pancreas Adenocarcinoma
Relapses free survival will be evaluated as efficacy of carbon ions radiation therapy released before surgery.

Progression free survival, The local progression free survival is measured, The local progression free survival will be assessed at 1-year
overall survival, the overall survival of enrolled patients is considered, The overall survival of enrolled patients will be assessed at 2-years|resectability rate R0 stratified (operable vs not operable), how many surgeries completed according to the procedures and with histopathological margins free from the disease/enrolled patients, time of surgery (4-6 weeks after radiotherapy)|Incidence of acute, medium term and late toxicity according to CTCAE v 4.0 grading toxicity, Incidence of acute, medium term and late toxicity according to CTCAE v 4.0 grading toxicity, The incidence of acute and medium term toxicity will be assessed up to 90 and 180 post-operative days respectively. The incidence of late toxicity will be assessed through study completion, an average of 1 year.|intra and perioperatory complications, intra and perioperatory complications, The incidence of intra- and perioperatory complications will be assessed up to 30 post-operative days
Enrolled subjects will undergo to 3 cycles of Folfirinox before re-evaluation of the lesion. Then, 4D planning and imaging with respiratory gating end rescanning technique will be adopted to calculate the optimal treatment plan to carbon ions radiation therapy: 38.4 Gy\[RBE\] is the prescribed dose to CTV. 4.8 Gy\[RBE\]/fraction will be delivered 4 times a week in two weeks. 4/6 weeks after hadrontherapy, after a CT scan with contrast, patient will undergo to a surgery. After 4/6 weeks, Gemcitabine will be administered for 6 cycles.

Secondary endpoints of the trial are overall survival, resectability rate (operable vs borderline operable), acute toxicity within 3 months, 3-6 months, over 6 months.
