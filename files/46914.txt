Precision Treatment of Recurrent/Metastatic Salivary Gland Carcinoma Guided by Molecular Typing
Patients with salivary gland carcinoma were divided into groups according to HER2, NTRK, AR, TROP-2, etc. Patients in different groups were given precision targeted therapy or chemotherapy to evaluate the efficacy (ORR rate, etc.) and safety of precision neoadjuvant or conversion therapy.

1. Patients with locally advanced/recurrent or oligometastatic salivary carcinoma are divided into groups based on HER2, NTRK, AR, TROP-2, etc. for precision targeted therapy or chemotherapy, and the efficacy (ORR rate, etc.) and safety of precision neoadjuvant or transformative treatment are evaluated.
2. Patients with locally advanced/recurrent or symptomatic, rapidly progressive metastatic salivary carcinoma who cannot tolerate or refuse surgery and radiotherapy are divided into groups based on HER2, NTRK, AR, TROP-2, etc. for precision treatment, and the efficacy (ORR rate, etc.) and safety of salvage treatment are evaluated.
3. The efficacy (ORR rate, etc.) and safety of post-line treatment for locally advanced/recurrent or distant metastatic salivary carcinoma.
4. Multi-omics technology explores the heterogeneity of salivary carcinoma and the biomarkers related to recurrence, metastasis, efficacy, and prognosis.
5. The consistency between the drug sensitivity detection in ex vivo 3D tumor models and the actual clinical efficacy of salivary carcinoma is studied, and the sensitive schemes selected based on the results of the drug sensitivity experiments are used to guide the post-line treatment of salivary carcinoma.
