Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) is the peak plasma concentration of a drug after administration, obtained directly from the plasma concentration-time curve. Cmax for Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, fexofenadine, pioglitazone, rosuvastatin will be assessed along with the metabolites of Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole and pioglitazone., Day 1, 8, 9, 43, 50, and 51|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Time (AUC [0-last]), The AUC (0-last) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time. AUC (0-last) for Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, fexofenadine, pioglitazone, rosuvastatin will be assessed along with the metabolites of Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole and pioglitazone., Day 1, 8, 9, 43, 50, and 51|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinite Time (AUC[0-infinity]), The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC(last) and C(last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC(last) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda(z) is elimination rate constant. AUC\[0-infinity\]) for Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, fexofenadine, pioglitazone, rosuvastatin will be assessed along with the metabolites of Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole and pioglitazone., Day 1, 8, 9, 43, 50, and 51
Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax), The Tmax is defined as actual sampling time to reach maximum observed analyte concentration. Tmax for Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, fexofenadine, pioglitazone, rosuvastatin will be assessed along with the metabolites of Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole and pioglitazone., Days 1, 8, 9, 43, 50, and 51|Elimination Rate Constant (Lambda[z]), Lambda(z) is first-order elimination rate constant associated with the terminal portion of the curve, determined as the negative slope of the terminal log-linear phase of the drug concentration-time curve. Lambda\[z\]) for midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, fexofenadine, pioglitazone, rosuvastatin will be assessed along with the metabolites of Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole and pioglitazone., Day 1, 8, 9, 43, 50, and 51|Elimination Half-Life (t1/2), The elimination half-life (t1/2) is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by 1 half to its original concentration. It is associated with the terminal slope of the semi logarithmic drug concentration-time curve, and is calculated as 0.693/lambda(z). t1/2 for Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, fexofenadine, pioglitazone, rosuvastatin will be assessed along with the metabolites of Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole and pioglitazone., Days 1, 8, 9, 43, 50, and 51|Apparent Clearance (CL/F), Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood. CL/F for Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole, fexofenadine, pioglitazone, rosuvastatin will be assessed along with the metabolites of Midazolam, S-warfarin, omeprazole and pioglitazone., Days 1, 8, 9, 43, 50, and 51|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for JNJ-56021927, The Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration., Day 43|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) for JNJ-56021927, The Tmax is defined as actual sampling time to reach maximum observed analyte concentration., Day 43|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 24 Hours (AUC[0-24]), The AUC (0-24) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours., Day 43|Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough), The (Ctrough) is the plasma concentration before dosing or at the end of the dosing interval of any dose other than the first dose in a multiple dosing regimen., Day 43, 50 and 51|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Up to 6 years 6 months
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study in participants with CRPC. The study will consist of a Screening Phase to determine eligibility, a Pretreatment Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow-up Phase. The study is designed to estimate the magnitude of the effects of JNJ-56021927 on the pharmacokinetics of probe substrates. In vitro studies have indicated that JNJ-56021927 and its active metabolite JNJ-56142060 (M3) have the potential to affect multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8) and drug transporters proteins (P-glycoprotein \[P-gp\] and breast cancer resistance protein \[BRCP\]) via inhibition or induction. In human hepatocytes, JNJ 56021927 and JNJ-56142060 (M3) were found to be inducers of CYP3A4. The induction of CYP3A4 suggests that JNJ-56021927 and M3 will induce other CYP isozymes and drug transporters (eg, CYP2C and P-gp via activation of pregnane X receptor). The study is designed to confirm the in vivo significance of these non-clinical findings.
