Trans-Rectal Ultrasound of the Female Pelvis for Real-Time MRI-US Fusion Based Needle Tracking
The purpose of this study is to utilize transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images of the intact and post-hysterectomy female pelvis in order to provide feasibility information for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-TRUS fusion based 3D needle navigation system for use in image guided brachytherapy. The fusion and needle guidance will be performed using Eigen Health's navigation system that currently provides targeted MR/Ultrasound fusion based prostate biopsies utilizing a proprietary 3D semi-robotic navigation system.
