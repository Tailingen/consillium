A Phase IV Study of Safety and Efficacy of Everolimus in Taiwanese Patients With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Who Have Renal Angiomyolipoma (TSC-AML)
The purpose of this prospective study is to assess the safety and efficacy of everolimus in Taiwanese patients with renal angiomyolipoma (AML) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) . Only patients who fulfil the local reimbursement criteria of everolimus for TSC-AML will be included in this study.
Renal Angiomyolipoma
DRUG: Everolimus
Percentage of participants with adverse events (AEs), Serious AEs (SAEs) and AEs of special interest (AESI), Percentage of participants with AEs, SAEs and AESIs., From first dose of study treatment up to 56 weeks
Angiomyolipoma (AML) response rate, AML response rate is defined as the percentage of patients with an AML response. AML response will be defined as: A reduction in AML volume of at least 50% relative to screening, where AML volume is the sum of the volumes of all target AML identified at screening. In addition, AML response have to satisfy: no new AML ≥ 1 cm in longest diameter are identified, neither kidney increases in volume by more than 20% from nadir (where nadir is the lowest kidney volume at the screening), the participant does not have any angiomyolipoma-related bleeding of grade equal or over 2 (as defined by NCI CTCAE, version 5)., Up to 52 weeks|AML progression rate, AML progression rate is defined as the percentage of patients with an AML progression. AML progression status is defined as one or more of the following: an increase from nadir of 25% or more in AML volume to a value greater than screening AML (where nadir is the lowest AML volume obtained for the participant previously in the trial), the appearance of a new AML ≥ 1.0 cm in longest diameter, an increase from nadir of 20% or more in the volume of either kidney to a value greater than screening (where nadir is the lowest kidney volume obtained for the participant previously in the trial), angiomyolipoma-related bleeding grade ≥2 (as defined by NCI CTCAE, version 5), Up to 52 weeks|Percentage of participants with laboratory abnormalities, The laboratory assessment (including hematology, coagulation, biochemistry, and urinalysis) will be recorded at baseline and during the study based on changes in grade of laboratory abnormality., From screening up to 56 weeks
This open-label, prospective, single-arm, multicenter Phase IV post approval commitment (PAC) study is planned to be conducted in approximately 10 patients with confirmed diagnosis of TSC-AML and who fulfil the local reimbursement criteria of everolimus for TSC-AML treatment.

The study will have a 30-day screening phase, and each patient will be on treatment up to 52 weeks. Enrollment will end at the latest within 52 weeks from Day 1 of the study, regardless of the number of patients actually recruited. After completion of the treatment phase/end of treatment (EOT), eligible patients will enter a 4-week safety follow up (FU) phase. Patients who continue to be on treatment beyond 52 weeks, based on the investigator's judgment will not be included in the 4-week safety FU phase.
