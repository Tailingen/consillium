A Phase 1 Study of RO7623066 Alone and in Combination in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 study to assess the safety and clinical activity of RO7623066 alone and in combination in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: RO7623066|DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Carboplatin
The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Measured by the Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Approximately 4 years 10 months
Incidence and severity of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and change from baseline in laboratory results, Assess safety and tolerability, Approximately 4 years 10 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters of RO7623066, PK parameters of RO7623066, including maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), total exposure (area under the concentration-time curve \[AUC\]), clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vd), and half-life (T1/2), Approximately 4 years 10 months|Objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) Investigator assessment, Anti-tumor activity, Approximately 4 years 10 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 Investigator assessment, Anti-tumor activity, Approximately 4 years 10 months|Duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1 Investigator assessment, Anti-tumor activity, Approximately 4 years 10 months|Time to response (TTR) per RECIST v1.1 Investigator assessment, Anti-tumor activity, Approximately 4 years 10 months|Overall survival (OS), defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death from any cause, Anti-tumor activity, Approximately 4 years 10 months|Effect of food on PK parameters, PK parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC, and T1/2 for participants who received study treatment who were either in a fed state or in a fasted state., Approximately 4 years 10 months
This is a Phase 1 study consisting of 2 parts: Dose Escalation and Expansion to evaluate the safety, tolerability, clinical activity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) Study of RO7623066 as a Monotherapy or in Combination in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors, and a Food Effect Cohort.
