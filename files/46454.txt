Anti-Mesothelin CAR-T Cell Injection in Patients With Mesothelin-positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a single-arm, open-label, exploratory clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of Anti-Mesothelin CAR-T cell injection in patients with Mesothelin-positive advanced malignant solid tumors.
Mesothelin-positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-mesothelin CAR-T cells|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence and severity of adverse events., 2 years|Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Incidence and severity of serious adverse events., 2 years|Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), Incidence and severity of adverse event of special interest., 2 years|dentification of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) & Incidence of Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Incidence and severity of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) following infusion of CAR-T cell injection, at each dose level tested in dose escalation phase., 4 weeks after the CAR-T cells infusion
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1., 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants who achieved Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable disease (SD) based on RECIST version 1.1., 2 years|Duration of Overall Response (DOR), Time from documentation of disease response to disease progression., 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from CAR-T infusion to the date of the disease progression or death from any cause., 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from CAR-T infusion to the date of death due to any cause., 2 years|Cytokine Level in Peripheral Blood, Level of cytokines in serum., 2 years|Bio-distribution of Anti mesothelin CAR-T cells, CAR copies will be measured by qPCR to evaluate the expansion and persistence of CAR-T cells in vivo., 2 years|Tmax is time to peak CAR level in blood or bone marrow., Tmax is time to peak CAR level in blood or bone marrow., 2 years|AUC0-tlast and AUC0-inf, AUC0-tlast and AUC0-inf are area under the curve of the CAR level, 2 years|Cmax, Cmax is the maximum CAR level in peripheral blood or bone marrow., 2 years|Anti-drug Antibodies, Number of participants with anti-drug antibodies., 2 years|RP2D, The RP2D is the optimal dose level selected for further evaluation in Phase II clinical trials, based on safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and preliminary efficacy data gathered during Phase I dose-escalation studies. It represents the dose that balances maximum therapeutic benefit with acceptable toxicity for patients., 4 weeks after the CAR-T cells infusion
In this study, patients with advanced malignant solid tumors with positive MSLN expression will be included. All eligible participants will receive a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by Anti-MSLN CAR-T cell injection.

The dose escalation phase will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Anti-MSLN CAR-T cell injection. Additional patients will be enrolled in the dose expansion phase to further characterize the safety profile and evaluate the efficacy of Anti-MSLNCAR-T cell injection, and establish recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
