Nab-Paclitaxel and Cisplatin or Nab-paclitaxel as Induction Therapy for Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (HNSCC)
In this trial, the objectives are to determine the efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy (IC) with nab-paclitaxel + cisplatin (Arm 1: AP) and with nab-paclitaxel (Arm 2: A) alone in patients with HNSCC, and to compare these data to nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU (APF). The investigators also hypothesize that the high anti-tumor efficacy of nab-paclitaxel in HNSCC is due to the upregulation of macropinocytosis, a result of the frequent presence of Ras and PI3K (and epidermal growth factor receptor -EGFR) activation in this cancer.

Amendment to Add Arm 3:

In this amendment, the investigators retain the AP + concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) backbone but de-escalate the dose of radiation therapy (RT) from 70 Gy to 42 Gy. The investigators also plan to administer one dose (vs three) of cisplatin during RT. This novel treatment approach will be evaluated in patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) (Arm 3), a sub-group with a very favorable prognosis.
