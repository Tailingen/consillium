Feasibility of Radioisotope-guided Excision of Mediastinal Lymph Nodes in Patients With Non-small Cells Lung Carcinoma
Non-small cells lung carcinoma (NSCLC) represents one of the most common and lethal neoplasms. NSCLC is characterized by an early asymptomatic phase, which hinders the disease identification in its earliest stages. As a consequence, NSCLC is often diagnosed at a clinical stage when the potentially curative surgical approach is challenging. In general, NSCLC up to the TNM stage cT3N2M0 are considered operable; in particular, nodal localizations in the homolateral hilus (N1) and underneath the carina (N2) are considered surgically manageable. Identification of nodal disease on the pre-operative PET/CT does not guarantee that all disease-bearing lymph node will be retrieved in the course of the open operative procedure. Smaller nodes might be challenging to identify; moreover, the co-existence of macroscopic and microscopic disease might hinder the radicality of the surgical intervention. This process can be tracked using specific radioactive radiopharmaceuticals, such as radioisotope-labelled colloids, which can be injected in the immediate proximity of the primary and then travel toward the closest cluster of mediastinal lymph nodes. There, they are incorporated in the nodal structure and progress no farther. By employing a radioisotope probe during surgery, all of the first-line nodes (so-called sentinel lymph node, SLN), which receive the lymphatic flow from the tumor region directly, can be identified.

The hypothesis of the investigators is that, by performing a radioisotope SLN mapping intraoperatively, the surgeons will be able to detect the metastatization process more accurately than relying on pre-operative imaging alone.

The present study will be a prospective and monocentric trial. Clinical, histological, and imaging data collected from examinations performed according to the good clinical practice will be analyzed. The estimated duration of the study is 12 months. It will include the prospective inclusion of patients with a diagnosis of operable NSCLC, who will receive a surgical treatment with curative intent at the investigators' institution (ICH).

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Sentinel lymph node scintigraphy
Detection rate (DR) of the SLN technique., The DR is defined as the capability of the SLN of identifying the mediastinal lymph nodes receiving the lymphatic flow, i.e., the presence and the number of lymph nodes, which can be identified with the gamma probe intraoperatively. This parameter will be measured as the ratio between the number of removed lymph nodes that will show a signifcant uptake of the radiotracer (\>10 counts per minute) and the total number of removed lymph nodes., 12 months|Sensitivity (Se) of the SLN technique., The Se will be defined as the ratio between the number of identified nodal disease foci that will show a signifcant uptake of the radiotracer (\>10 counts per minute) and the total number of identified nodal disease foci., 12 months
Measurement of the efficiency of a portable gamma camera, the measurement of the efficiency of a portable gamma camera, when compared with the standard gamma probe, in terms of DR. This parameter will be measured as the ratio between the number of removed lymph nodes that will show a signifcant uptake at the examination with the portable gamma camera (as evaluated by an expert operator) and the number of removed lymph nodes that will show a signifcant uptake of the radiotracer (\>10 counts per minute) with the standard gamma probe, 12 months|Comparison between the lower (I-II) and the higher (III and above) disease stages, The comparison of DR and Se between the lower (I-II) and the higher (III and above) disease stages. The analysis will be performed using the ROC curves for these parameters., 12 months
