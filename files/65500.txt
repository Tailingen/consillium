Niraparib with BeVAcizumab After Complete CytoreductioN in Patients with OvArian Cancer
Randomized, open label, phase II multicenter study to assess the efficacy niraparib versus niraparib +bevacizumab maintenance in patients with newly diagnosed stage IIIA/B/C high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer with no residual disease after frontline surgery and treatment by adjuvant platinum-basedchemotherapy +/-bevacizumab.

Progression-Free survival (PFS) rate up to 24 months, Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months.
PFS2, PFS2 is defined as time from randomization to objective tumor progression on next-line treatment or death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years.|Number of Participants with abnormal physical examinations, abnormal vital signs and abnormal findings according to CTC-AE v5, Through treatment completion for all participants, an average of 28 months|Time to First Subsequent Treatment, TFST is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of the first subsequent anticancer therapy or death, assessed up to 5 years.|Time to Second Subsequent Treatment, TSST is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earlier of the date of second subsequent chemotherapy start date, or death date, assessed up to 5 years.|Long-term Overall Survival in both arms, from time of signature of informed consent, throughout the study period, assessed up to 5 years|Confirmation of the predictive value (overall chemo-sensitivity) of the KELIM., Repeated CA-125 assay repeated through study completion, From study start until the end of the study, assessed up to 5 years
