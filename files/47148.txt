Aneustat Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer Under Active Surveillance
Assessment of the effects of OMN54 (Aneustat) in a population of men with indolent prostate cancer who are otherwise healthy and free of significant co-morbidities and have chosen active surveillance for disease management. The investigators will assess how OMN54 affects PSA, overall tumor burden in addition to any changes in urinary flow. Other biomarkers will be tested to follow disease evolution.
