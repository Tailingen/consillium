CED With Irinotecan Liposome Injection Using Real Time Imaging in Children With Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) (PNOC 009)
This is a Phase I and Early Efficacy Study of Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) of irinotecan liposome injection (nal-IRI) Using Real Time Imaging with Gadolinium in Children with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma who have completed focal radiotherapy
Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma
DRUG: Convection Enhanced Delivery (CED) of Nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI)
Number of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Related Adverse Events (AE), Safety of repeated CED of nal-IRI following standard of care focal radiotherapy will be assessed by monitoring for adverse events, scheduled laboratory assessments, vital sign measurements, and physical examinations for subjects who receive the vaccination. The severity of toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0. Adverse events and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (meeting Grade 3, 4, or 5 criteria according to CTCAE) will be summarized by maximum intensity and relationship to study drug(s). Grade 1 and 2 adverse events will be summarized if related to study therapy. Descriptive statistics will be utilized to display the data on toxicity, 12 months
Overall Survival (OS) at 12 months (OS12), Any eligible subject treated on the dose level that will be investigated within the expansion cohort will be considered evaluable for clinical efficacy. Analyses will be performed after all enrolled patients have completed 12 months, or whenever the status of all patients has been established, whichever comes first. The primary analysis will be based on the Kaplan-Meier method. Kaplan-Meier estimates and the associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be calculated, 12 months
Distribution of Gadolinium, Assessment of observed distribution of gadolinium compared to pre-treatment modeling of the drug distribution utilizing predictive imaging software., 12 months
This study will assess the safety and tolerability of repeated administration of nal-IRI co-infused with gadoteridol given by intratumoral CED in children with newly diagnosed DIPG.
