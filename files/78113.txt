To establish the safety of intranasal foralumab in non-active primary and secondary progressive MS in escalating doses for 14 consecutive days, Analyses through review of adverse events categorized and graded via CTCAE., 14 days
Change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) at Day 45, The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist.

Lower score indicates that the subject is doing better., 45 days
This is a Phase 1b double blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose escalating study evaluating multiple doses of Foralumab via intranasal administration for 14 days in patients with MS.
