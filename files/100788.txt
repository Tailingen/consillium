Safety And Efficacy Of Tofacitinib In Patients With Refractory Myasthenia Gravis: A Pilot Study
This is a 6 month study that will evaluate the efficacy of 5mg tofacitinib tablet taken twice a day in patients with refractory myasthenia gravis. Twenty adult participants will receive a four month treatment of tofacitinib followed by elution for one month.
Myasthenia Gravis, Generalized
DRUG: Tofacitinib 5 MG
Change From Baseline in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Scores at Month 6, A quantitative MG scoring system (QMG Score) is essential in the objective evaluation of therapy for MG.This scoring system is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups. Total QMG score range from 0 (extreme disease severity) to 39 (none), higher score indicated less disease severity., Baseline, Month 6
Change From Baseline in Myasthenia Gravis-related Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) Scores at Month 6, The myasthenia gravis activities of daily living (MG-ADL) profile is an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities.Total MG-ADL score range from 0 (none) to 24 (extreme disease conditions), higher score indicated more disease severity., Baseline, Month 6|Change From Baseline in Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) Scores at Month 6, The MMT score is the sum of strength or function values assigned by the examining physician to 30 muscle groups usually affected by MG. Total MMT score range from 0 (none) to 124 (extreme muscle weakness), higher score indicated more disease severity., Baseline, Month 6|Change From Baseline in Myasthenia Gravis-Quality of Life Questionnaire-15 item (MG-QOL15) Scores at Month 6, The MG-QOL15 is helpful in informing the clinician about the patient's perception of the extent of and dissatisfaction with MG-related dysfunction. Total MG-QOL15 score range from 0 (none) to 60 (extreme disease severity), higher score indicated more disease severity., Baseline, Month 6|Change From Baseline in Doses of Steroids at Month 6, Steroids is recommended as the first-line treatment for myasthenia gravis. Here we followed the combined doseage of steroids while administrating tofacitinib for enrolled participants., Baseline, Month 6
Change From Baseline in Serum Titers of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies at Month 6, Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies are the major pathological autoantibodies of MG. For anti-AChR antibodies-positive candidates, we followed the antibodies titers at Month 6., Baseline, Month 6|Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Cytokines at Month 6, MG is an autoimmune disease manifested by impairment at the neuromuscular junction featured by weakness and fatigability. We compared the inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β,IL-2,IL-4,IL-5,IL-6,IL-9,IL-10,IL-12p70,IL-13,IL-17A,IL-18,IL-21,IL-22,IL-23,IL-27,IFN-gamma,TNF-α and GM-CSF) at Baseline and Month 6., Baseline, Month 6
