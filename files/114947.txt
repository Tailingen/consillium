Comparative Genomic and Genetic Analysis of Paired Primary Breast - Metastatic Tumor Specimens Using High-throughput Platforms
Adequate quality and quantity of RNA may be extracted from paraffin-embedded tumor blocks for gene expression analysis. This has clinical relevance as gene expression signatures may then be profiled using archival tumor blocks, which are more readily available than frozen tissues.
