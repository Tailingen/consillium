A Study of Capecitabine (Xeloda) in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral capecitabine (Xeloda) versus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), in combination with intravenous (IV) cisplatin, in participants with advanced and/or metastatic gastric cancer. The anticipated time on study treatment is at least 6 weeks and continued up to disease progression, and the target sample size is 300 individuals.
