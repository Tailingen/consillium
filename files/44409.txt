PVd Versus Vd in NDMM Patients With RI
This is a multicenter, randomized controlled, open-label study, and the purpose of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of PVD regimen (Pomalidomide \& Bortezomib \& Dexamethasone) versus VD regimen (Bortezomib \& Dexamethasone) in NDMM patients with RI. The main efficacy indicator is VGPR after 4 cycles of induction therapy.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: pomalidomide|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone
≥very good partial response, The sum of a complete response and a very good partial response, At end of cycle 4 (each cycle is 21 days)
MRD negative rate, When patients reached CR, NGF was used to detect the proportion of patients with bone marrow clonoplasma cells without phenotypic abnormalities. The minimum detection sensitivity was 1 clonoplasma cell in 10000 nucleated cells, From randomization to the date of first documented evidence of PD until study completion, an average of 1.5 year|immunologic function, Twelve cytokine assays, lymphocyte subsets and absolute count, Treg cell assays, lymphocyte activation marker assays, TH1/TH2/TH17 subsets of cytokines assays, At day 1±3 of cycle 2-5 (each cycle is 21 days)|renal tubular function, Renal remission rate was evaluated according to the 2016 IMWG expert consensus on MM renal injury, At day 1±3 of cycle 2-5 (each cycle is 21 days)|safety（Number of adverse events ）, Number of adverse events according to symptoms, physical examination and scheduled laboratory tests, Each cycle (each cycle is 21 days), up to 24 months of follow-up
