A Study of HQP1351 in Patients With GIST or Other Solid Tumors
This study is a Multi-center, Open-label Phase 1 Study to Determine the Recommend Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) and Evaluate PK/PD and preliminary Efficacy of HQP1351 in Patients With GIST or Other Solid Tumors.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST)|Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: HQP1351
Safety and tolerance, Patients with HQP1351 treatment related adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE) will be assessed according NCI CTCAE Version 4.03., 30 days after the last dose of HQP1351
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of HQP1351 on Day 1 and Day 27 post HQP1351 treatment on cycle 1., Pharmacokinetic evaluation, 28 days|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of HQP1351 on Day 1 and Day 27 post HQP1351 treatment on cycle 1., Pharmacokinetic evaluation, 28 days|Anti-tumor activities of HQP1351, Response will be evaluated every 2 cycles (8 weeks), according to the revised RECIST Guideline, Version 1.1, 3-60 months
The primary objective of this phase 1 study is to determine the RP2D of HQP1351 in patients with GIST or other solid tumors. The secondary objective is to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary anti-tumor activities of HQP1351 in Patients With GIST or Other Solid Tumors.
