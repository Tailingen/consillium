First in Human Study of T3P-Y058-739 (T3P)
This is a first in human, phase I/II open-label, dose-finding, safety, and proof-of-concept clinical trial of T3P-Y058-739, a genetically-modified, live attenuated strain of the bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica, in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: Pembrolizumab+T3P-Y058-739|DRUG: T3P-Y058-739 (IV)|DRUG: T3P-Y058-739 (IT)
Phase 1: To assess the safety and determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) when given by IT injection and by IV infusion, as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab., AEs(adverse events), SAEs(serious adverse events) will be graded by the investigator according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 5.0)., up to 45 months|Phase 2: To assess the safety and preliminary antitumor response T3P when given by IT injection and/or IV infusion, as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab., Response according to immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) (Seymour et al, 2017)., up to 45 months
Assessment of Duration of response (DoR), DoR and PFS according to RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al, 2009) or modified criteria for selected malignancies, as appropriate(e.g., Verslype et al, 2012 for hepatocellular carcinoma)., up to 45 months|Assessment of progression free survival (PFS), PFS according to RECIST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al, 2009) or modified criteria for selected malignancies, as appropriate(e.g., Verslype et al, 2012 for hepatocellular carcinoma)., up to 45 months|To evaluate the distribution of T3P, Microbiological culture and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of samples of blood, urine, stool and (in patients with tumor's close to or involving the oropharynx) saliva., up to 45 months|To evaluate the clearance of T3P, Shedding will also be evaluated in swabs taken from lesions that ulcerate following T3P administration., up to 45 months|To evaluate the shedding of T3P, Tumor colonisation will also be evaluated in tumor biopsies (optional)., up to 45 months|Assessment of Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) (maximum 16 months of follow-up)., Maximum 16 months of follow-up
The study, which has a modular design with up to 6 parts, anticipates enrolling approximately 100 participants. Part A will open first. Part B and subsequent parts will open later. The study will evaluate T3P-Y058-739 monotherapy given by intratumoural (IT) injection (Part A) and by intravenous (IV) infusion (Part B). In addition, either IT or IV T3P-Y058-739 (route of administration to be chosen based on emerging data) will be evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab. All patients will receive low doses of desferrioxamine (which provides iron in a form that can be used by the bacteria) to support bacterial survival and growth. All patients will receive antibiotics on completion of therapy to eradicate any residual T3P-Y058-739.
