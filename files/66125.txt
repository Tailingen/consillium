Improving Detection and Early Action for HPV-positive Oropharynx Cancer
This study aims to determine whether a blood test for HPV DNA can improve diagnosis of HPV-positive oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC).
HPV Positive Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Blood test for HPV DNA
Prevalence of circulating HPV DNA, Proportion of participants with circulating HPV DNA detected in their blood., Test results are returned within 1 week.
Predictive value of circulating HPV DNA, Proportion of participants with positive circulating HPV DNA for whom HPV-OPC is detected, Long-term follow-up for up to 2 years|HPV-OPC awareness, Awareness of HPV-OPC and other HPV-related malignancies among participants will be assessed by a brief survey, At the time of study enrollment|Impact on clinical practice, The proportion of participants for whom clinicla management by the treating clinician is affected by results of the blood test will be measured by a survey sent to treating clinicials, Within 2-3 weeks of study enrollment
The diagnosis of HPV-OPC is often delayed. In this study, individuals with signs or symptoms potentially related to HPV-OPC, such as unexplained throat pain, tonsil or tongue base asymmetry, or a neck mass, will have their blood tested for circulating HPV DNA. A positive test may indicate that their symptoms are caused by HPV-OPC, and their treating physician will be encouraged to complete all the necessary testing to determine whether this is the case.
