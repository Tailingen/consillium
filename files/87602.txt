Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Transitional Cell Cancer of the Urothelium
RATIONALE: Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with progressive metastatic transitional cell cancer of the urothelium.
Bladder Cancer|Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter|Urethral Cancer
DRUG: sunitinib malate
Overall Objective Response, Response rate as measured by RECIST criteria. The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria, 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the response rate in patients with progressive metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium treated with sunitinib malate.
* Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

Secondary

* Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

  * To determine time to tumor progression (TTP) for sunitinib malate on a continuous dosing schedule for treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma.
  * To estimate sunitinib and SU012662 trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) data for the continuous daily schedule and to determine potential association with efficacy and safety.
