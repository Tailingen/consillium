Platinum for Triple-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer and Evaluation of p63/p73 as a Biomarker of Response
The purpose of this research study is to :

* Determine how effective cisplatin or carboplatin is in slowing the time it takes for ER negative (estrogen-receptor-negative), PR negative (progesterone receptor-negative), HER2 negative (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) breast cancer to progress. Cisplatin and carboplatin are anti-cancer chemotherapy drugs that stop cancer cells from growing abnormally and is used to treat other cancers.
* Evaluate a new biomarker to help determine which breast cancers are most likely to respond to cisplatin chemotherapy

The hypothesis is that Triple Negative metastatic breast cancer may be particularly sensitive to platinum, and that a subgroup of those patients may have a marker in their tumors that predicts response.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: carboplatin
Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate (ORR) (complete response \[CR\]+ partial response \[PR\]) by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors).

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD (longest diameter) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started

Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, 3 years|Response Rate Categorized by p63/p73 Ratio, Response rate categorized by pre-specified Î”Np63/TAp73 expression ratio cutoff in the primary tumors from this patient cohort as a bio-marker to predict response to cisplatin or carboplatin. Response is defined as partial or completed response as determined by RECIST. Expression ratio was measured using quantitative RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction)., 3 years
Objective Response Rate Categorized by Subgroup, The number of participants achieving an objective response (as determined by RECIST) categorized by treatment cohort and whether the treatment was first or second line treatment. First line treatment means that the drug used was the first drug used for the treatment of the primary cancer. Second line treatment means that a first line treatment failed to produce the desired response, so a new drug was used for treatment., 3 years|Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival, Median progression free survival and overall survival (progression determined using RECIST) during a median follow-up time of 50 months., 5 years
This study is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate cisplatin/carboplatin as first or second line therapy in metastatic triple negative (ER negative, PR negative, Her2 Negative) breast cancer and to evaluate the expression of p63/p73 as a biomarker to predict response.

* Participants will be given a cisplatin or carboplatin infusion intravenously on the first day of each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle will last 3 weeks. Treating physician will select agent up to 41 patients in each cohort. Final primary endpoint analysis will use combined cis/carbo results.
* During all treatment cycles participants will have a physical exam (including weight and vital signs) and they will be asked general questions about their health and any medications they may be taking, as well as specific questions about any side effects they may be experiencing while receiving study treatment.
* During every treatment cycle participants will have standard blood tests to check blood counts, liver and kidney function, and a blood marker for you particular type of cancer.
* CT scans will be taken of the participants tumor every 2 to 3 cycles to assess the response of the tumor to cisplatin.
* Participants will be in this study for as long as they tolerate the study treatment and their disease does not get any worse.
* Participants will be required to have a sample of their original tumor sent to Massachusetts General Hospital for correlative studies, or a sample from a metastatic diagnostic biopsy.
* Patients with accessible tumor will be asked to provide an optional metastatic tumor biopsy for correlative studies.
