Tumors
DRUG: Mirvetuximab soravtansine
Dose-Escalation Phase: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine, MTD was defined as the highest dose at which 1 or fewer among 6 participants or less than or equal to (\<=) 33 percent (%) experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (calculated based on adjusted ideal body weight \[AIBW\]). AIBW was calculated as ideal body weight (IBW) + 0.4 \* (actual weight - IBW), where IBW for men was 0.9 \* height in centimeters (cm) - 88 and IBW for women was 0.9 \* height in cm - 92. DLT was defined as a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or abnormal laboratory value related to study treatment (that is, assessed as unrelated to disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications), including those TEAEs and abnormal laboratory values that resulted in a failure to meet the criteria for re-treatment., Cycle 1 (21 days)|Dose-Escalation Phase: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of Mirvetuximab Soravtansine, RP2D was determined by MTD. MTD was defined as the highest dose at which 1 or fewer among 6 participants or \<=33% experienced a DLT. DLT was defined as a TEAE or abnormal laboratory value related to study treatment (that is, assessed as unrelated to disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications), including those TEAEs and abnormal laboratory values that resulted in a failure to meet the criteria for re-treatment. Available clinical data indicated that the MTD defined for the Q3W schedule was equal to the RP2D., Cycle 1 (21 days)
Number of Participants With TEAEs, An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to study drug.

The study consists of a dose-escalation phase that will evaluate 2 dosing schedules (Schedule A and Schedule B) of mirvetuximab soravtansine and up to 5 dose-expansion groups at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The first 4 escalation cohorts will be single participant cohorts. Subsequent escalation cohorts will use a standard 3+3 design, with each cohort consisting of 3 or 4 to 6 participants. Data were collected and analysed for the escalation and expansion groups by dose schedule and not by individual dose.
