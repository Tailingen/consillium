Study of AZD5863 in Adult Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This research is designed to determine if experimental treatment with AZD5863, a T cell-engaging bispecific antibody that targets Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) and CD3, is safe, tolerable and has anti-cancer activity in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This is a first-time in human, modular Phase I/II, open-label multicentre study of AZD5863 monotherapy administered intravenously (Module 1), or AZD5863 monotherapy administered subcutaneously (Module 2) in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Each module contains dose-escalation (Part A) and dose-expansion (Part B).
