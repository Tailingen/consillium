A Phase I Study of Adagrasib and Durvalumab for Treatment of Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancers and Gastro-intestinal Cancers Harboring KRAS G12C Mutations
To find a recommended dose of the combination of adagrasib and durvalumab that can be given to patients with cancers that have a KRAS G12C mutation.
Lung Cancer|Gastro-intestinal Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Adagrasib
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives:

â€¢ To determine the safety and tolerability, and to establish the recommended dose of the adagrasib and durvalumab combination in advanced NSCLC or GI cancer patients.

Secondary Objectives:

* To determine the objective response rate of the adagrasib and durvalumab combination for frontline treatment of advanced NSCLC harboring a KRAS G12C mutation.
* To determine the objective response rate of the adagrasib and durvalumab combination for treatment of advanced CRC that have progressed on prior therapy with KRAS G12C inhibitors.
* To determine duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS) for the combination of the adagrasib and durvalumab in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring a KRAS G12C mutation.
* To determine DOR and PFS for the combination of the adagrasib and durvalumab in patients with advanced CRC that have progressed on prior therapy with KRAS G12C inhibitors.

Exploratory Objectives:

* To assess predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to the combination of adagrasib and durvalumab.
* To assess mechanisms of tumor cell adaptation upon treatment with the combination of adagrasib and durvalumab.
* To determine mechanisms of acquired resistance to the combination of adagrasib and durvalumab.
* To assess the effect of the combination of adagrasib and durvalumab on the immune tumor microenvironment.
* To generate cell lines and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models from tumor samples.
* To assess the anti-tumor reactivity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from tumor biopsies.
