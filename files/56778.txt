Triple Therapy Sequential Radiotherapy in Unresectable HCC (TALENP003)
This is an Open-label, Multicenter, Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), Lenvatinib combination with Sintilimab (Triple Therapy) sequential radiotherapy in patients with Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (uHCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-resectable
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: TACE, Lenvatinib combination with Sintilimab sequential radiotherapy
Objective response rate, ORR, The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the complete response (CR) rate + the partial response (PR) rate according to RECIST 1.1., 4 weeks after the initiation of medication until the day before surgery
Progression free survival, PFS, The Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time between the start of treatment and the progression of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic tumors, or the occurrence of death or loss of follow-up for any reason., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Overall survival, OS, The Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time between receiving treatment and observing death or loss of follow-up for any reason., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Objective response rate, ORR, The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the complete response (CR) rate + the partial response (PR) rate according to mRECIST., 4 weeks after the initiation of medication until the day before surgery|Conversion resection rate, CRR, The Conversion resection rate (CRR) was defined as the patient who reach the resectable criterion after treatment and accepted operation., 3 months|Major pathological response rate, MPR rate, The major pathological response (MPR) rate was defined as less than 10% active tumor cells in the excised tissue sample in patients accept operation., Immediately after surgery|Toxicity Adverse events, Grade 1-5 AEs according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0., through study completion, assessed up to 60 months
For Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (uHCC) patients, Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), Lenvatinib combined with PD-1 inhibitors treatment is an important choice, which can achieve deeper tumor remission. However, there are still some patients whose lesions have not reached complete response after treatment. According to research, patients with complete response of lesions after conversion therapy have a more ideal long-term survival rate. For populations that have not yet achieved complete response, sequential radiotherapy will achieve deeper tumor remission, delay recurrence, and achieve better oncological outcomes. This study is a single arm, multicenter, prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE, Lenvatinib combination with Sintilimab (Triple Therapy) sequential radiotherapy in the treatment of uHCC patients.
