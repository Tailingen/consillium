Study to Compare the Diagnostic Accuracy of Nuance Full-Field Digital Mammography to Screen-Film Mammography
Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Planmed Sophie Nuance Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) X-ray System compared to screen-film mammography (SFM) in the detection of breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Full Field Digital Mammogram (Planmed Sophie Nuance)
Area under ROC curve based on subjects' maximum POM scores; sensitivity based on subjects' maximum BI-RADS scores with 4 or higher as positive for cancer; and specificity based on subjects maximum BI-RADS scores with 4 or higher as positive for cancer, Approximately one year after completion of study.

Objectives: 1) To establish the non-inferiority of the diagnostic accuracy of the Planmed Sophie Nuance Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM) X-ray System compared to screen-film mammography (SFM) in the detection of breast cancer; and 2) To demonstrate in a comparative side-by-side feature analysis that interpretations based on the Planmed Sophie Nuance FFDM X-ray System are diagnostically non-inferior to SFM in the detection of breast cancer.
