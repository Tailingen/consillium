FDOPA-PET/MRI for the Pre-operative Evaluation of Gliomas
This is a pilot study designed to evaluate the potential of using FDOPA-PET/MRI for improving surgical planning and providing non-invasive prognostic information in patients with gliomas that have substantial non-enhancing regions. The results will be used to develop larger adequately powered studies.

DRUG: 6-[F-18]-Fluoro-L-3,4,-dihydroxyphenylalanine|DEVICE: PET/MRI|PROCEDURE: Surgical resection (standard of care)
Percentage of cases in which the addition of FDOPA-PET to MRI changes the surgical plan, We will consider our primary endpoint successful if FDOPA-PET changes the surgical plan in at least 4 of the 20 patients (20%), a much lower margin than previously reported with \[C-11\]methionine which is on the order of 60-70% of cases. When safe and feasible, these discrepant areas identified on FDOPA-PET/MRI will undergo tissue sampling. However, tissue sampling of discrepant areas may not be possible in all patients, and this decision will be made by the treating neurosurgeon., At the time of surgery (approximately week 2)
