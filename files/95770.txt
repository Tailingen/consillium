Randomized Trial With Trastuzumab Versus Observation in Breast Cancer Patients
Epithelial tumor cells can be detected in the bone marrow and/or the peripheral blood \[disseminated and circulating tumor cells, (DTCs) and (CTCs) respectively\] of otherwise metastases-free patients with early breast cancer. Several studies have shown that the presence of these cells is an independent factor associated with an increased incidence of early disease relapse and disease-related death. In almost 50% of the patients, adjuvant chemotherapy cannot eliminate these occult tumor cells and this is also associated with a higher probability of early relapse and death. In 60-70% of the patients, DTCs and/or CTCs express the HER2/c-neu molecule and one or two administrations of their monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN) could eliminate these cells for a period ranging from 3-12 months.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab
Compare the disease-free interval of patients with early-stage breast cancer, 3 years
Elimination of CK-19 mRNA-positive CTCs., Assessment of CK-19 mRNA CTCs every 3 months
This pilot trial will compare the efficacy of the anti-HER2/erb-B2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN) given after the completion of the standard adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus observation in patients with stage I-III operable breast cancer who have detectable cytokeratin-19 (CK-19) mRNA-positive tumor cells in the bone marrow or the peripheral blood before and/or after the adjuvant treatment.
