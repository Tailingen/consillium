18F-sodium Fluoride (NaF) PET to Replace Bone Scintigraphy: Safety and Efficacy Assessment
18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) was already investigated numerous times in the last 40 years as a PET alternative to standard 99m-technetium-derived bone scintigraphy. However, lack of universal tracer availability and higher costs contributed to the failure of 18F-NaF to systematically supplant bone scintigraphy as a standard of care.

Recently, an isotope shortage crisis occurred and evidenced the need to have non-reactor-derived alternatives for many nuclear medicine procedures, including bone scintigraphy. Since 18F-NaF is cyclotron-produced, it could become a necessary alternative to bone scintigraphy in case of another worldwide isotope shortage.

The study aims to evaluate the safety profile of 18F-NaF injection. Moreover, a patient registry will be compiled in order to perform sub-studies on 18F-NaF diagnostic performance on diverse bone and articular diseases.

Safety profile of 18F-NaF, A registry monitoring eventual adverse effects for this radiopharmaceutical agent will be compiled. Usual procedures will be applied to divulgate any serious adverse effects., 17 years|Efficacy profile of 18F-NaF compared to 99mTc-biphosphonate bone scintigraphy, Using the patient registry, and in the eventual sub-studies to come, the diagnostic performance of 18F-NaF-PET will be compared to similar available imaging tests, most notably 99mTc-biphosphonate bone scintigraphy., 17 years|Correlate 18F-NaF PET images with pathology reports, Pathology data from the diverse conditions eligible for the 18F-NaF PET scan will be also monitored when available. Prognostic value from the imaging data will be compared with those obtained from the pathology., 17 years
