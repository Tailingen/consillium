PFS（progression-free survival）, PFS is refers to the patients randomly into group to the date of any objective records of patients with tumor progression or death time., Change from Baseline at the week 6,12, 18 of treatment phase and the month 3, 6, 9 and 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ,33,36 of the followup phase
ORR（Objective Response Rate）, 1 weeks before treatment, Change from Baseline at the week 6,12, 18 of treatment phase and the month 3, 6, 9 and 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ,33,36 of the followup phase|DCR(disease control rate), Change from Baseline at the week 6,12, 18 of treatment phase and the month 3, 6, 9 and 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ,33,36 of the followup phase|OS（overall survival）, Change from Baseline at the week 6,12, 18 of treatment phase and the month 3, 6, 9 and 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 ,33,36 of the followup phase

2.1 main objectives: PFS 2.2 the secondary goal: 2.2. 1 ORR, DCR and OS 2.2. 2 the quality of life 3. The study design 3.1 research nature This is a single arm, multicenter clinical study, is expected to total 100 patients into the group.

Hierarchical factors include: the tumor staging (Ⅲ B vs Ⅳ), ECOG score (0 v 1), gender (male vs female).

3.2 research center and research Proposed by taizhou people's hospital and medical association of jiangsu province tumor chemotherapy and biological branch of the lung cancer group led by several large and medium-sized hospitals in the province of the malignant tumor treatment related department to participate, in accordance with the unified test plan of this research.
