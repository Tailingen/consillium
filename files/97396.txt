Study of PI3 Kinase/mTOR Inhibitor BEZ235 Twice Daily for Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a dose escalation trial to evaluate twice daily dosing of the sachet formulation of BEZ235. This trial will find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the sachet formulation given twice daily, as well as evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the twice daily dosing. Patients will initially be given once daily dosing to determine the PK and PD of the single daily dose. On Day 9, they will begin twice daily dosing, with half of the single daily dose divided twice daily, and PK and PD of the twice daily dose will be determined.
Malignant Solid Tumour
DRUG: BEZ235
Maximum tolerated dose of BEZ235 given twice daily, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BEZ235 given twice daily in patients with advanced solid tumors, 18 months
To describe the toxicities of this regimen, The safety endpoints to be summarized are:

* Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
* Incidence of adverse events (AEs)
* Incidence of grade 1, grade 2, grade 3 and grade 4 AEs
* Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), 18 months|Clinical Efficacy, To describe the clinical efficacy of this regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors. The tumor response will be measured by the number of patients with complete responses, partial responses, stable disease and progressive disease., 18 months|PK profile of BEZ235, To characterize the PK profile of BEZ235 given as a twice daily dose. The PK parameters (including AUC (0-∞), AUC (0-t), Cmax, tmax, λz, and t½) of BEZ235 following oral administration will be assessed by analysis of BEZ235 plasma concentrations using a non-compartmental approach.

During treatment PK blood samples will be taken at the following timepoints:

* Cycle 1, Day 1: pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours post-dose
* Cycle 1, Day 8: pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours post-dose
* Cycle 1, Day 28: pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours post-dose, 18 months
