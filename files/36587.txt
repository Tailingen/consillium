At the End of the Study, patients with no clinically significant toxicities, no contraindications to continue treatment with talazoparib, and no disease progression (underlying cancer progression) may be eligible to continue talazoparib treatment in a separate open-label extension study after discussion with the Principal Investigator and obtaining Sponsor permission. Sponsor decision to allow the patient to continue dosing with talazoparib in an open-label extension study will be based on potential overall benefit-risk, patient acceptance and other relevant criteria.
