Combination of Pembrolizumab and Cabozantinib in Patients With Advanced Sarcomas
Phase II trial with three independent strata to independently assess the effects of the association of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib in advanced sarcomas.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma Adult|Advanced Soft-tissue Sarcoma|Ewing Sarcoma|Osteosarcoma|Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma
DRUG: Association of pembrolizumab + cabozantinib
Assessment of the efficacy of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib (independently for each stratum), Efficacy will be assessed in terms of non-progression rate at 6 months and is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR), or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at 6 months from the start of the treatment, based on RECIST 1.1 criteria., 6 months
Best overall response, independently for each stratum, Best overall response is defined as the best response across all time points (RECIST 1.1). The best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known (RECIST 1.1)., Throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|1-year progression-free survival, independently for each stratum, Progression-free survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of progression (as per RECIST 1.1) or death (from any cause), whichever occurs first., 1 year|1-year overall survival, independently for each stratum, Overall survival is defined as the delay between the start date of treatment and the date of death (of any cause)., 1 year|Safety profile, independently for each stratum: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5, Toxicity graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5., Throughout the treatment period, an expected average of 6 months|6-months non-progression rate according to iRECIST, Efficacy will be assessed in terms of non-progression rate at 6 months and is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR), or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at 6 months from the start of the treatment, based on iRECIST criteria (Seymour, 2017)., 6 months|Blood cytokines levels, Levels of cytokines in blood will be measured by ELISA., baseline, cycle 2 day 1, cycle 2 day 8, cycle 3 day 1, cycle 4 day 1, cycle 6 day 1 and at progression (each cycle is 21 days)|Blood lymphocytes levels, Levels of lymphocytes in blood will be measured by flow cytometry., baseline, cycle 2 day 1, cycle 2 day 8, cycle 3 day 1, cycle 4 day 1, cycle 6 day 1 and at progression (each cycle is 21 days)|Blood kynurenine levels, Levels of kynurenine in blood will be measured by ELISA., baseline, cycle 2 day 1, cycle 2 day 8, cycle 3 day 1, cycle 4 day 1, cycle 6 day 1 and at progression (each cycle is 21 days)|Tumor immune cells levels, Levels of immune cells in tumor will be measured by immunohistochemistry., before treatment onset and cycle 2 day 8 (each cycle is 21 days)
3 independent, multicenter, prospective, signel-arm phase II trial, based on 2-stage Simon's optimal design, will be conducted in parallel to assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab + cabozantinib, in distinct populations of sarcomas:

* stratum 1: advanced undiffenrentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
* stratum 2: advanced osteosarcoma
* stratum 3: advanced ewing sarcoma
