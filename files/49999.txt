The Effect of Combined General/Epidural Anesthesia Versus General Anesthesia on Diaphragmatic Function
The aim of this study was to investigate whether robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy give rise to the impairment of diaphragmatic function postoperatively, and whether combined general/epidural anesthesia could provide better postoperative diaphragmatic function.

Change of diaphragm movement using sonography (diaphragm inspiratory amplitude, diaphragm inspiratory and expiratory velocity)on postoperative day 1 and 2 from baseline (day before surgery), The measurements of diaphragmatic motion were attained at the posterior surface of the diaphragm. From the tracings on M-mode, the distance between echogenic lines (DIA) in cm and diaphragm inspiratory/expiratory velocity in cm.s-1 during quiet, deep, and sniff breathing were measured on the frozen images. Three consecutive sonographic examinations were performed, and the highest value of three measurements was recorded, on the day before surgery until postoperative day 2
Change in pulmonary function test on postoperative day 1 and 2 from baseline (day before surgery), Spirometric measurements included vital capacity (VCIN), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, peak expiratory flow rate (PEF), maximal midexpiratory flow rate (MMEF), tidal volume (VT), and expiratory residual volume (ERV), on the day before surgery until postoperative day 2
Diaphragmatic dysfunction after abdominal surgery can result in extended hospital stay and increased medical costs, because it is related with atelectasis, lung collapse or pneumonia. The mechanism of diaphragm dysfunction is thought to be from not only direct injury to abdominal wall and viscera but inhibitory reflexes of phrenic activity. Thoracic or upper abdominal surgery is suggested as a risk factor of postoperative diaphragm dysfunction, and perioperative analgesic modality is also known to affect diaphragm movements. But there has been no trial to investigate the effect of laparoscopic pelvic surgery such as prostatectomy on diaphragm movement. Moreover, it is not clear if minimally invasive Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) has any influence on respiratory and diaphragm functions.
