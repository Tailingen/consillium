Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) in Participants With Previously Treated B-Cell Lymphoma Intolerant of Prior Bruton Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (BTKi) Treatment
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of zanubrutinib (also known as BGB-3111) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, mantle cell lymphoma, or marginal zone lymphoma patients who have become intolerant of prior ibrutinib and/or acalabrutinib treatment, by comparing intolerance to adverse event profile as assessed by the recurrence and the change in severity of adverse events.
