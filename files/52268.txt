Radiolabelled Nectin-4 Targeted LMW Probe PET/CT in Patients With Lung Lesions
To evaluate the ability of \[68Ga\]N188 to detect nectin-4 overexpression in patients with lung lesions.
Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell|Lung Infection
OTHER: FDG-PET
Standardized uptake value（SUV）, SUV is a semi-quantitative analysis index to describe the radioactive uptake of lesions, which has certain reference value for differentiating benign and malignant lesions. The uptake of the tracer （68Ga-N188） in lung lesions by measuring SUV on PET/CT., 1 year
To evaluate the ability of \[68Ga\]N188 to detect nectin-4 overexpression in patients with different lung lesions, such as inflammation and lung cancer.
