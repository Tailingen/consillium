Cancer
DRUG: Liposomal paclitaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Pharmacokinetic parameters, 72 hours after the infusion
The pharmacokinetics of a new formulation of taxane (liposomal paclitaxel) has never been studied in Chinese cancer patients. This clinical trial is designed to find out the pharmacokinetics of liposomal paclitaxel at the dose of 175mg/m2 and whether it has a different pharmacokinetic profile to paclitaxel.
