Study of Rofecoxib and Prolonged Constant Infusion of Gemcitabine in the Polychemotherapy Treatment of Advanced NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of the addition of rofecoxib to first-line chemotherapy, and to evaluate the efficacy of prolonged continuous infusion of gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of patients affected by advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

The primary end-points of the GECO study

* To evaluate the tolerability of three innovative schedules of treatment for advanced NSCLC
* To evaluate the efficacy of the addition of rofecoxib to first-line chemotherapy in the treatment of patients affected by advanced NSCLC
* To evaluate the efficacy of prolonged continuous infusion (p.c.i.) of gemcitabine, with the fixed infusion rate of 10 mg/sqm/minute) versus the standard administration in 30 minutes, in combination with cisplatin, in the treatment of patients affected by advanced NSCLC

Four treatment arms are planned.

* ARM A standard treatment : cisplatin + gemcitabine
* ARM B cisplatin + gemcitabine + rofecoxib
* ARM C cisplatin + p.c.i. gemcitabine (10 mg/sqm/minute)
* ARM D cisplatin + p.c.i gemcitabine (10 mg/sqm/minute) + rofecoxib

The phase II part of the study for experimental arms B, C and D will be conducted to evaluate tolerability in the three treatment arms.

The phase III study for efficacy has been designed according to a factorial 2x2 model with the planned comparison of

* The efficacy of rofecoxib: A + C (arms without rofecoxib) vs B+D (arms with rofecoxib)
* The efficacy of p.c.i. gemcitabine: A + B (arms with standard infusion of gemcitabine) vs C+ D (arms with p.c.i gemcitabine)
