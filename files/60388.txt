Belinostat, Carboplatin and Paclitaxel (BelCaP) Compared to Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Patients With Cancer of Unknown Primary
The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy and safety of belinostat in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with previously untreated carcinoma of unknown primary.
Carcinoma of Unknown Primary
DRUG: belinostat, carboplatin, paclitaxel|DRUG: carboplatin, paclitaxel
Progression Free Survival, Time from the date of randomization to the time of disease progression or death due to any cause, measured by RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors)., Tumor assessment every 6 weeks for the treatment period. Subsequent assessments every 6 weeks for the initial 6 months, then every 9 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks for 12 months and then every 6 months until 5 years from the start of study
Best Overall Response, The best overall response in an individual patient according to the RECIST criteria (Eisenhauer 2009 ) is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Objective response is defined as best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), Tumor assessment every 6 weeks for the treatment period. Subsequent assessments every 6 weeks for the initial 6 months, then every 9 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks for 12 months and then every 6 months until 5 years from the start of study|Overall Survival (OS), Time from the date of randomization to the date of death, Tumor assessment every 6 weeks for the treatment period. Subsequent assessments every 6 weeks for the initial 6 months, then every 9 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks for 12 months and then every 6 months until 5 years from the start of study|Time to Response, For patients with overall best response being CR or PR, time to response was measured as the time from randomization to the first time when the measurement criteria for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) were met, Tumor assessment every 6 weeks for the treatment period. Subsequent assessments every 6 weeks for the initial 6 months, then every 9 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks for 12 months and then every 6 months until 5 years from the start of study|Duration of Response, Duration of overall response was measured from the time that measurement criteria were first met for CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first) until the first date that PD (\[Progressive Disease\]) or death was documented, Tumor assessment every 6 weeks for the treatment period. Subsequent assessments every 6 weeks for the initial 6 months, then every 9 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks for 12 months and then every 6 months until 5 years from the start of study|Time to Progression (TTP), Time from the date of randomization to the time of disease progression, Tumor assessment every 6 weeks for the treatment period. Subsequent assessments every 6 weeks for the initial 6 months, then every 9 weeks for 6 months, then every 12 weeks for 12 months and then every 6 months until 5 years from the start of study
This is an open-label, multinational, multicenter, randomized, comparative efficacy and safety study in previously untreated patients with carcinoma of unknown primary. Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to treatment in Arm A (BelCaP) or Arm B (CaP).
