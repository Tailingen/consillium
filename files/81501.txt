Clinical Trial Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of ZL-2306 (Niraparib) in Ovarian Cancer Patient
This is a 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, phase III clinical study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ZL-2306 (niraparib) for maintenance treatment in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal cancer (collectively referred to as relapsed ovarian cancer).The evaluation will be divided into two stages: Stage I will be conducted in all patients, and if the predetermined statistically significant difference is not reached, the trial will continue to extend to Stage II during which evaluation will be performed in gBRCA mutation-positive ovarian cancer patients.
Platinum-sensitive Relapsed Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: ZL-2306(nirapairb)|DRUG: Placebos
Progression-free survival (PFS), It is defined as the time from randomization to progressive disease or death due to various causes, whichever occurs first. Progressive disease will be determined by the Independent Central Imaging Review according to standard RECIST 1.1., 35 months
Chemotherapy-free interval (CFI), It refers to the time from the last platinum-containing treatment to the start of the next anti-cancer treatment (excluding maintenance treatment);, 35 months|Time to first subsequent anti-cancer treatment (TFST), It refers to the time from the date of randomization in the study to the date when the first subsequent anti-tumor treatment starts., 35 months|Overall survival (OS), It refers to the time from the date of randomization to death for any cause., 35 months
