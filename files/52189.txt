The recommended Phase II dose will be based on acceptable dose-limiting toxicity, Study Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49.
Pharmacokinetic parameters may also be factored into the determination of a Phase II dose and; Tumor response, Study Days 0, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168, 196, 224, 252, 280, 308, 336, 357; and tumor response on Study Days 56, 112, 168, 224, 280, 336, and 387.
* Assess the safety and tolerance of a weekly MEDI 522 regimen in patients with irinotecan-refractory advanced CRC.
* Determine a Phase II recommended dose based on acceptable dose-limiting toxicity. Other considerations such as pharmacokinetic parameters may also be factored into the determination of a Phase II dose.

The secondary objectives of the study are to:

* Assess any antitumor activity of MEDI-522 in this patient population.
