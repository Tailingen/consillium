Patients With Stage III-IVa Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma With or Without a Mobile Medical Platform Full-course Nutritional Intervention
To study the difference in the proportion of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who lost more than 10% of their body weight within 1 month after radiotherapy and chemotherapy using the mobile platform for whole-process individualized nutritional rehabilitation management compared with conventional nutritional rehabilitation management.

weight loss >10%, Differences in the proportion of patients who lost \>10% of their body weight at the end of chemoradiotherapy between experimental and control groups, at the end of chemoradiotherapy|weight loss >20%, Differences in the proportion of patients who lost \>20% of their body weight at the end of chemoradiotherapy between experimental and control groups, at the end of chemoradiotherapy|ncidence rate of adverse events (AEs), Analysis of acute and late adverse events (AEs) are evaluated. Numbers of patients of treatment-related adverse events(acute toxicity) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0.Numbers of patients of late radiation toxicities were assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring scheme., at the end of chemoradiotherapy|change of PG-SGA, Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA).It consists of two parts: the patient's self-assessment part and the medical staff's assessment part. The specific contents include seven aspects, including body weight, food intake, symptoms, activity and physical function, the relationship between disease and nutritional needs, metabolic needs, and physical examination. The first 4 Each aspect is evaluated by the patient himself, and the last three aspects are evaluated by the medical staff. The overall evaluation includes qualitative evaluation and quantitative evaluation., 1 month after chemoradiotherapy|change of NRS2002, The outstanding advantage of NRS2002 is that it can predict the risk of malnutrition, and can proactively and dynamically judge the changes in the nutritional status of patients, which is convenient for timely feedback of the nutritional status of patients, and provides evidence for adjusting nutritional support programs. It is a better nutritional risk screening tool., 1 month after chemoradiotherapy
