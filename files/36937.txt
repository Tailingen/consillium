Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone With/Without Stem Cell Transplant in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The study is being done to compare the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) and lenalidomide and dexamethasone without PBSCT in patients with untreated multiple myeloma. This comparison will include how the subjects respond to each study treatment combination, and what side effects are caused by each combination.

Complete Response Rate, The primary objective of this study is to determine the complete response rate of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone versus that of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (will include unconfirmed complete response (CR), CR and stringent complete response (sCR))., 3 years
Overall Survival Rate (OS), To compare overall survival in subjects receiving autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant after undergoing induction therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus in those receiving only lenalidomide and dexamethasone, followed by lenalidomide maintenance in both arms. Only patients who achieved at least a partial response (PR) following 4 cycles of induction were included in the analysis., 4 years|Overall Survival Rate (OS), To compare overall survival in subjects receiving autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant after undergoing induction therapy with lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus in those receiving only lenalidomide and dexamethasone, followed by lenalidomide maintenance in both arms.

Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell proliferative disorder responsible for 11, 000 deaths each year in the United States. Approximately one third of myeloma patients develop hypercalcemia and about two thirds present with anemia. As the second most common hematologic malignancy, myeloma remains incurable. In the last forty years, options for therapy have included melphalan-prednisone, anthracyclines, and vinca alkaloids; however, relapse with those regimens continues to be inevitable with a median survival of 3 years.
