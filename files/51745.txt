Evaluation of Store-and-Forward Teledermatology Versus a Face-to-Face Assessment During a Skin Cancer Screening Event
The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic and management concordance of face-to-face dermatologist versus a store-and-forward teledermatologist at a skin cancer screening event.

The investigators' hypotheses include the following:

1. Compared to in-person assessment, store-and-forward teledermatology assessment will result in adequate diagnostic concordance.
2. Compared to in-person assessment, store-and-forward teledermatology results in adequate management concordance.
3. The sensitivity and specificity of store-and-forward evaluation to detecting lesions that are either premalignant or malignant will be similar to that of in-person evaluation.
