Efficacy and Safety of SCRT Versus TNT in Older Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
The SHAPERS study is a multicentre, open-label, randomised, pragmatic clinical trial, comparing standard-of-care neoadjuvant treatment options for older (i.e., ≥70 years) subjects with high-risk stage II and stage III rectal cancer.

Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) will be calculated from randomisation to death from any cause., At 3 years after randomisation|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) will be calculated from randomisation to any of the following events: unresectable tumour due to local tumour progression, R2 resection of the primary tumour, loco-regional recurrence after an R0/R1 resection, distant metastases, or death from any cause., At 3 years after randomisation|Any grade peripheral sensory neuropathy, Any grade peripheral sensory neuropathy as assessed by the investigator according to the NCI-CTCAE v5.0 will be analysed., At 3 years after randomisation|Grade ≥3 toxicities during treatment, Grade ≥3 toxicities during treatment (i.e., from the 1st day of treatment until the EOT visit) as assessed by the investigator according to the NCI-CTCAE v5.0 will be analysed., At 3 years after randomisation
The SHAPERS study is a multicentre, open-label, randomised, pragmatic clinical trial, comparing standard-of-care neoadjuvant treatment options for older (i.e., ≥70 years) subjects with high-risk stage II and stage III rectal cancer.

Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the SCRT arm or the TNT arm (The study design is shown in figure 3.1 and 3.2).

SCRT arm:

The SCRT arm consists of:

* SCRT (5 fractions of 5 Gy), followed by
* Surgery (according to the principles of TME) or watch \& wait, followed by
* Optional adjuvant chemotherapy

TNT arm Different treatment regimens can be used in the TNT arm including Rapido, Rapido light, OPRA INCT-CRT or OPRA CRT-CNCT. The regimen to use will be decided by the investigator and will need to be declared before randomisation. No switch between regimens is allowed during the study treatment period.

The Rapido regimen consists of:

* SCRT (5 fractions of 5 Gy), followed by
* Up to 18 weeks of oxaliplatin based chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or CAPOX), followed by
* Surgery (according to the principle of TME) or "watch \& wait".

The Rapido light regimen consists of:

* SCRT (5 fractions of 5 Gy), followed by
* Up to 12 weeks of oxaliplatin based chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or CAPOX), followed by
* Surgery (according to the principle of TME) or "watch \& wait".

The OPRA with induction chemotherapy (INCT-CRT) regimen, consists of:

* Up to 16 weeks of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or CAPOX), followed by
* CRT (25-28 fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy each +/- a boost to the primary tumour and involved lymph nodes, for a total of 50-56 Gy of radiation combined with either continuous infusion ﬂuorouracil or capecitabine) followed by
* Surgery (according to the principle of TME) or "watch \& wait"

The OPRA with consolidation chemotherapy (CRT-CNCT) regimen consists of:

* CRT (25-28 fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy each +/- a boost to the primary tumour and involved lymph nodes, for a total of 50-56 Gy of radiation combined with either continuous infusion ﬂuorouracil or capecitabine) followed by
* Up to 16 weeks of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or CAPOX), followed by
* Surgery (according to the principle of TME) or "watch \& wait".
