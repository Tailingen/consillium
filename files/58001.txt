Lymphoma is a common hematological malignancy. Many different pathologic types of lymphoma can originate in extranodal organs or be associated with extranodal organ involvement. For lymphoma with extranodal involvement, conventional regimens often cannot provide satisfactory results for patients. This study aims to prospectively collect clinical information on patients with extranodal DLBCL, including the distribution of involved sites, clinical and molecular characteristics of different lymphoma subtypes, clinical treatment protocols, and prognosis, to explore the the best therapeutic strategies in the real-world population.
