Treatment of Canadian Men and Pre/Peri/Post-menopausal Women With ER+ Advanced Breast Cancer in the Real-World Setting With Hormone Therapy Â± Targeted Therapy
Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide evidence of efficacy, generalization of these results to patients in the real-world setting is challenging, given RCTs are conducted in highly selected patient populations.

An understanding of the effectiveness of approved cancer therapies in routine clinical practice is essential in order to optimize the management of these patients and to identify treatment and monitoring gaps.

This is the first Canadian study to describe real-world treatment patterns/sequencing, effectiveness and monitoring for men and pre/postmenopausal HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer patients. This registry incorporates an observational prospective cohort design and will enroll 500 men and pre/postmenopausal HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer women that have been exposed to endocrine therapy (ET) or ET in combination with targeted therapy (TT) including patients receiving CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy combinations..
