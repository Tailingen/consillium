A Study of IAP0971 in Combination With Bacillus Calmette Guerin in High Risk Non-muscular Invasive Bladder Cancer
The efficacy and safety of IAP0971 single drug or combined with BCG intravesical instillation in the treatment of high-risk non muscle invasive bladder cancer with BCG treatment failure.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: IAP0971|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: IAP0971＋BCG|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: IAP0971＋BCG
DLTs occurrence, The DLT evaluation period is defined as 21 days after the first administration of investigational product., 21 days
MTD, During DLT evaluation period, if ≥2 cases DLTs occur in the 3 or 6 subjects in one dose group, the previous dose is defined as MTD., 21 days
Phase Ia study: for adults with BCG treatment failure or intolerance to BCG, high-risk non muscle invasive bladder cancerPatient, evaluate the safety and tolerability of IAP0971 monotherapy bladder infusion, and determine dose limiting toxicity and/or phase II recommended dose.

Phase Ib study:To evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravesical IAP0971 in combination with BCG in patients with BCG unresponsive high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, and to determine the DLT and RP2D.

Phase II study:To evaluate the efficacy of intravesical IAP0971 in combination with BCG in patients with BCG unresponsive high risk NMIBC using RP2D as determined in the phase I study.
