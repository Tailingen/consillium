Intensive Cancer Screening After Cryptogenic Stroke
The INCOGNITO Pilot Trial is a single centre pilot prospective randomized open-label blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial to assess the feasibility of a full-scale randomized trial to determine whether an occult cancer screening strategy of FDG PET/CT in addition to usual care increases the number of occult cancers diagnosed after screening compared to usual care cancer screening alone in patients with cryptogenic stroke.
