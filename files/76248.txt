Study of Calgranulin A/B Levels in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage I,II,III Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Measuring levels of calgranulin A and calgranulin B in the blood of patients with breast cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to breast cancer.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is measuring calgranulin A and calgranulin B levels in the blood of patients with newly diagnosed stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: immunoenzyme technique|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Correlation between circulating levels of calgranulin A and calgranulin B and the presence of estrogen receptor negative breast cancer, upon diagnosis
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine circulating levels of calgranulin A and calgranulin B in patients with estrogen receptor negative or estrogen receptor positive, newly diagnosed, primary stage I-III adenocarcinoma of the breast.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

Patients undergo a blood draw following diagnosis of breast cancer to assess levels of circulating tumor markers, calgranulin A and calgranulin B. Serum samples are evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for tumor marker expression.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
