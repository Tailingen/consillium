Pre-Habilitation Exercise Intervention
The purpose of this study is to see whether exercise can improve the health and well-being of patients scheduled to undergo surgery for a bowel related condition.
Inflammatory Bowel Diseases|Colon Cancer|Rectal Cancer|Diverticular Disease
BEHAVIORAL: Exercise for Cancer Patients
The primary outcome measure for this study is fatigue assessed by the FACIT-F fatigue subscale.., The primary analyses will involve examination of means, standard deviations, and effect sizes of the two arms on fatigue at all three times, separately by cohort and combined., 12 weeks
Aerobic Capacity via VO2 maximum testing, The secondary aim is to provide preliminary data on the influence of a home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program (EXCAP) plus standard care versus standard care alone on aerobic capacity in subjects who have undergone colorectal resection., 12 weeks|Skeletal Muscle Mass will be assessed using bio-electrical impedance assessment of muscle mass, The secondary aim is to provide preliminary data on the influence of a home-based aerobic and resistance exercise (EXCAP) intervention on skeletal muscle mass and its relationship to fatigue in subjects who have undergone colorectal resection., 12 weeks|Skeletal Muscle Mass will be assessed using CT assessment of muscle mass, The secondary aim is to provide preliminary data on the influence of a home-based aerobic and resistance exercise (EXCAP) intervention on skeletal muscle mass and its relationship to fatigue in subjects who have undergone colorectal resection., 12 weeks|Circulating Levels of Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines will be measured by standard Complete Blood Count (CBC) differential procedures., The secondary aim is to provide preliminary data on the influence of a home-based aerobic and resistance exercise intervention (EXCAP) plus standard care versus standard care alone on the circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8,IL-10, IL-1B,and IFN-y) and TNFr1 cytokine receptor expression in subjects who have undergone colorectal resection., 12 weeks|Post-operative Complications will be extracted from patient charts and will be classified for severity using the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications., The secondary aim is to provide preliminary data on the influence of a home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program (EXCAP) plus standard care versus standard care alone on post-operative complications in subjects who have undergone colorectal resection., 12 weeks|Quality of Life (QOL) on self reported psychological distress questionnaires: Profile of Mood States (POMS)., The secondary aim is to provide preliminary data on the influence of a home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program (EXCAP) plus standard care versus standard care alone on quality of life (QOL) in subjects who have undergone colorectal resection., 12 weeks|Quality of Life (QOL) on self reported psychological distress questionnaires: Spielberg State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI Form Y-1)., The secondary aim is to provide preliminary data on the influence of a home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program (EXCAP) plus standard care versus standard care alone on quality of life (QOL) in subjects who have undergone colorectal resection., 12 weeks
The proposed randomized controlled trial aims to recruit 60 patients that have a primary diagnosis of either colon or rectal cancer, inflammatory bowl disease, or diverticular disease and are scheduled for elective surgery. This two-arm clinical trial of an intervention examining the efficacy of a home-based walking and progressive resistance exercise program for the relief of post-operative fatigue and improvement of functional outcome following surgery.
