A Study of PET/CT Imaging Using INR101 Injection in Healthy Male Subjects and Patients With Suspected Prostate Cancer
Phase I/II study in the management of Healthy Male Subjects and patients with suspected prostate cancer.
Healthy Male Subjects|Suspected Prostate Cancer
DRUG: INR101|DRUG: INR101
Phase I primary outcome: incidence of adverse events of INR101 injection, Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) will be assessed and graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 7 days after administration|Phase I primary outcome:radiation dosimetry, Mean absorbed radiation doses were estimated using the source and target organ framework. Eight health subjects underwent serial INR 101 PET/CT scans at three time points following radiotracer injection: 5±5 min，30±5 min，60±10 min，120±10 min，180±20 min., 3 hours after administration|Phase I primary outcome:Tmax (Time to reach maximum plasma concentration), Assessment of INR101 Tmax in whole blood 4 hours after administration, 4 hours after administration|Phase I primary outcome:t1/2 (Elimination half-life), Assessment of INR101 t1/2 in whole blood 4 hours after administration, 4 hours after administration|Phase I primary outcome:AUC0-t (Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to time t), Assessment of INR101 AUC0-t in whole blood 4 hours after administration, 4 hours after administration|Phase I primary outcome:AUC0-∞ (Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity), Assessment of INR101 AUC0-∞ in whole blood 4 hours after administration, 4 hours after administration|Phase I primary outcome:CL (Clearance), Assessment of INR101 CL in whole blood 4 hours after administration, 4 hours after administration|Phase I primary outcome:Cmax (Maximum plasma concentration), Assessment of INR101 Cmax in whole blood 4 hours after administration, 4 hours after administration|Phase I primary outcome:SUV-standardized uptake value, Assessment of INR101 uptake by PET scan by measuring standardized uptake value in the target organs., 3 hours after administration|Phase I primary outcome:%ID/g - percentage of injected dose per gram, Assessment of INR101 uptake by PET scan by measuring percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue in the target organs, 3 hours after administration|Phase I primary outcome:residence time - residence time in the the target organs, Assessment of INR101 uptake by PET scan by measuring residence time in the target organs, 3 hours after administration|Phase II primary outcome :diagnostic efficacy, The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of INR101 PET/CT, 28 days after administration
Phase II secondary outcome: Incidence of adverse events of INR101 injection, Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) will be assessed and graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 7 days after administration
A multi-center, prospective, open-label, randomized Phase I/II diagnostic study designed for the management of healthy male subjects and patients with suspected prostate cancer.

Phase I Study Objective: The primary goal is to assess the biodistribution, dosimetry, pharmacokinetic (PK) attributes, and safety profile of INR101 injections in healthy Chinese male subjects. The specific endpoints include evaluating the safety, Standardized Uptake Value (SUV), Accumulation (%ID), Retention Time, Absorbed Dose, Effective Dose, and PK parameters in whole blood, plasma, and urine following an intravenous administration of INR101.

Phase II Study Objective: This phase aims to determine the diagnostic efficacy of INR101 injection PET/CT scans in patients with suspected prostate cancers. The principal aim is to ascertain the optimal imaging conditions, which involve determining the best dose and timing of administration. This will be gauged based on the diagnostic performance metrics-sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy-of the INR101 injection PET/CT at different dosages and imaging intervals, using prostate biopsy pathology results as the reference standard.
