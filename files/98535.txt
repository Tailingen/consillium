Effect of Low Tidal Ventilation on Intraoperative Bleeding in Laparoscopic Major Hepatectomy
This randomized controlled study's objective is to find a safer mechanical ventilation strategy to reduce intraoperative bleeding in liver cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic major liver resection. The hypothesis is that low tidal volume ventilation in laparoscopic major hepatectomy results in less bleeding.

Patients are randomized into the conventional tidal volume (tidal volume \[ml\]= ideal body weight \[kg\]\* 10\~12) group and low tidal (tidal volume \[ml\]= ideal body weight \[kg\] \* 6\~8) volume group and ventilated accordingly throughout the surgery. All patients undergo general anesthesia with propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium and are intubated with an endotracheal tube (ID 7.0 for females, ID 7.5 for males). Anesthesia is maintained with sevoflurane, end tidal CO2 is targeted between 30-35mmHg. The radial artery is cannulated and connected to the Flotrac sensor and goal directed fluid therapy is done. The estimated blood loss is checked as the primary outcome. In addition postoperative complications, transfusion amounts, operation time, satisfaction of the surgeon and participants are also recorded.
