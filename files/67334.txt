BBO-11818 in Adult Subjects With KRAS Mutant Cancer
A first in human study to evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of BBO-11818, a pan-KRAS inhibitor, in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic KRAS mutant solid tumors.

This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of BBO-11818, a pan-KRAS inhibitor, alone and in combination with pembrolizumab, pembrolizumab +/- cis/carboplatin + pemetrexed, or cetuximab in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic KRAS mutant solid tumors. The study includes dose escalation phase and dose expansion phase.
