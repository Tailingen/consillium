Zanubrutinib-based Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Young and Fit Patients With Untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma
This is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, phase II study of Zanubrutinib-based induction followed by ASCT and Zanubrutinib maintenance (2 years) or followed directly by Zanubrutinib maintenance without ASCT in young and fit patients with untreated MCL.

There will be an initial safety run-in phase of 6 patients which will be closely monitored for the observed toxicities during cycle1 in， induction therapy. After completion of safety run-in phase, the investigator will assessed and decided whether to continue the trial as planned. If no unexpected toxicity has been observed, study will expand the sample size to further assess efficacy and safety.

Total around 47 patients aged 18-65 years with previously untreated, Ann Arbor stage II-IV, histologically proven MCL will be enrolled to receive alternating 3 cycles R-CHOP + Zanubrutinib /3 cycles R-DHAOx induction. Totally 6 cycles in induction and every 21 days per cycle. Due to lack of published data about BTKi in combination with R-DHAOx, Zanubrutinib is only applied in cycle 1,3,5(R-CHOP), 160mg BID, d1-21, and not in combination with R-DHAOx

Patients who achieve remission (≥PR) will be allowed to proceed to ASCT or maintenance. Whether ASCT or not depends on investigator's evaluation and discretion. In patients who do not achieve a remission at end of induction (treatment failure), no study specific treatment is defined; rather, the further salvage treatment is upon the discretion of investigators. Patients remain in study for progression and survival follow-up.

Patients will receive Zanubrutinib maintenance for two years in case of remission at ASCT assessment or end of induction assessment. Zanubrutinib is applied oral 160mg BID, continuously for 2 year or until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or death, whichever comes first.

The primary analysis will be performed after last-patient completes induction treatment.

MRD negativity rate, To evaluate the MRD negativity rate after Zanubrutinib-based induction therapy in subjects with newly diagnosed, young and fit MCL.

The primary endpoint of the trial will be bone marrow minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate after induction therapy (at the completion of cycle 6 or at premature discontinuation)., 18 weeks
Duration of MRD negativity, The time from the first achieving MRD negativity after start of treatment to the MRD convert to positive, 60 months|Progression free survival (PFS), The time from start of treatment to progression or death from any cause, 60 months|Overall survival (OS), The time from start of treatment to death from any cause, 60 months
