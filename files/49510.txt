Microbiota and Pancreatic Cancer Cachexia
This monocentric study aims at evaluating the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation from newly diagnosed cachectic and non-cachectic pancreatic cancer patients, and healthy volunteers on several cachexia-related parameters of germ-free mice.

Aim: Evaluating the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from 6 newly diagnosed cachectic and 6 non-cachectic pancreatic cancer patients, and 12 healthy age-and sex-matched volunteers on several cachexia-related parameters of 96 germ-free mice (4 per donor) over a 30-day period. The fecal material of all 12 pancreatic cancer patients will be collected at diagnosis before any cancer treatment onset.

Hypothesis: FMT of cachectic patients with pancreas cancer, na√Øve of any anti-cancer treatment and artificial nutrition, into germ-free mice impairs weight gain, in contrast to FMT of non-cachectic patients and healthy controls.
