Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR) as Assessed by Investigator According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Tumor response was assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1. BOR was defined as percentage of participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total or pathological nodes (with short axis \[SA\] of at least (\>/=) 15 millimeter \[mm\]) were identified as target lesions (TLs) and measured and recorded at baseline. A sum of diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, SA for nodal lesions) for all TLs was calculated and reported as baseline sum of diameters (SD). All other lesions (or sites of disease) were identified as non-TLs. CR: disappearance of all TLs and SA reduction to less than (\<) 10 mm for nodal TLs/ non-TLs. PR: \>/=30 percent (%) decrease in SD of TLs, taking as reference baseline SD. Confirmation of response at 2 consecutive tumor assessments \>/=4 weeks apart was required. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed using Clopper-Pearson approach., Baseline, every 3 cycles up to 36 months, and every 6 cycles thereafter if progression free after 36 months, 28 days after end of treatment, every 3 months thereafter (maximum up to approximately 3.5 years)
Time to Response as Assessed by Investigator According to RECIST v 1.1, For participants with a BOR of CR or PR, time to response = (Date of first confirmed CR/PR - Date of first study treatment) + 1. For participants without a CR or PR, time to response = (Date of adequate last tumor assessment - Date of first study treatment) + 1. For participant with no tumor assessment (or if all assessments were progressive disease \[PD\]) the censoring day was set to date of first study treatment +1. CR: the disappearance of all TLs and SA reduction to \<10 mm for nodal TLs/ non-TLs. PR: \>/=30% decrease in SD of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SD. Confirmation of response at 2 consecutive tumor assessments \>/=4 weeks apart was required. PD: \>/=20% relative increase and \>/=5 mm of absolute increase in the SD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SD recorded since treatment started, or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. The 95% CI was computed using log-log transformation., Baseline, every 3 cycles up to 36 months, and every 6 cycles thereafter if progression free after 36 months, 28 days after end of treatment, every 3 months thereafter (maximum up to approximately 3.5 years)|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by Investigator According to RECIST v 1.1, DOR, in participants with a BOR of CR or PR, was defined as the period from the date of initial PR or CR until the date of PD or death from any cause. Participants with no documented PD or death after CR or PR were censored at the last date at which they were known to have had the CR or PR, respectively (regardless of the response at intermediate assessments). CR: the disappearance of all TLs and SA reduction to \<10 mm for nodal TLs/ non-TLs. PR: \>/=30% decrease in SD of TLs, taking as reference the baseline SD. Confirmation of response at 2 consecutive tumor assessments \>/=4 weeks apart was required. PD: \>/=20% relative increase and \>/=5 mm of absolute increase in the SD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SD recorded since treatment started, or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. The 95% CI was computed using log-log transformation., Baseline, every 3 cycles up to 36 months, and every 6 cycles thereafter if progression free after 36 months, 28 days after end of treatment, every 3 months thereafter (maximum up to approximately 3.5 years)|Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression as Assessed by Investigator According to RECIST v1.1 or Death From Any Cause, PD was defined as \>/=20% relative increase and \>/=5 mm of absolute increase in the SD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SD recorded since treatment started, or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Percentage of participants with radio-graphically documented PD as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause was reported., Baseline, every 3 cycles up to 36 months, and every 6 cycles thereafter if progression free after 36 months, 28 days after end of treatment, every 3 months thereafter (maximum up to approximately 3.5 years)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator According to RECIST v 1.1, PFS was defined as the time from first intake of any study medication until the first radio-graphically documented PD as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Participants with no PFS events were censored at the time of the last evaluable tumor assessment. Participants with no baseline or no tumor assessment after the baseline visit were censored on the date of first study treatment. PD: \>/=20% relative increase and \>/=5 mm of absolute increase in the SD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SD recorded since treatment started, or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Participants who had radio-graphically documented PD as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1 or died due to any cause were considered as having an event. The median PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. The 95% CI was computed using log-log transformation., Baseline, every 3 cycles up to 36 months, and every 6 cycles thereafter if progression free after 36 months, 28 days after end of treatment, every 3 months thereafter (maximum up to approximately 3.5 years)|Percentage of Participants With Disease Progression as Assessed by Investigator According to RECIST v1.1, PD was defined as \>/=20% relative increase and \>/=5 mm of absolute increase in the SD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SD recorded since treatment started, or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Percentage of participants with radio-graphically documented PD as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1 was reported., Baseline, every 3 cycles up to 36 months, and every 6 cycles thereafter if progression free after 36 months, 28 days after end of treatment, every 3 months thereafter (maximum up to approximately 3.5 years)|Time to Progression (TTP) as Assessed by Investigator According to RECIST v 1.1, TTP was defined as the time from first intake of any study medication until the first radio-graphically documented PD as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1. Participants who did not have a radio-graphically documented PD and had died due to reason other than PD were censored on the last available tumor assessment prior to the death date. Participants with no baseline or no tumor assessment after the baseline visit were censored on the date of first study treatment. PD was defined as \>/=20% relative increase and \>/=5 mm of absolute increase in the SD of TLs, taking as reference the smallest SD recorded since treatment started, or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Participants who had radio-graphically documented PD as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1 were considered as having an event. The median TTP was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. The 95% CI was computed using log-log transformation., Baseline, every 3 cycles up to 36 months, and every 6 cycles thereafter if progression free after 36 months, 28 days after end of treatment, every 3 months thereafter (maximum up to approximately 3.5 years)|Percentage of Participants Who Died From Any Cause, Percentage of participants who died due to any cause was reported., Baseline until death (up to approximately 3.5 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from first intake of any study medication to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death. Participants who were known to be alive at the time of the analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up assessment. Participants without follow-up assessment were censored at the day of last study treatment, and participants with no post-baseline information were censored at the date of first study treatment plus 1 day. Participants who died due to any cause were considered as having an event. The median OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. The 95% CI was computed using log-log transformation., Baseline until death (up to approximately 3.5 years)|Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score, EQ-5D VAS: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life (QoL) in terms of a single index value. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 mm (worst imaginable health state) to 100 mm (best imaginable health state); higher scores indicate a better health state., Baseline, thereafter every 3 cycles from Cycle 3 to Cycle 45 (each cycle = 21 days)|Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) Questionnaire Score, FACT-B questionnaire is used for assessment of health-related QoL in participants with breast cancer. It consists of 36 items, summarized to 5 subscales: physical (7 items), functional (7 items), social/family (7 items); all 3 ranged from 0 to 28, emotional (6 items) ranging from 0 to 24, and breast cancer subscale (9 items) ranging from 0 to 36; high subscale score represents a better QoL. All single-item measures ranges from 0='Not at all' to 4='Very much'. Total possible score ranged from 0 to 144. High scale score represents a better QoL., Baseline, thereafter every 3 cycles from Cycle 3 to Cycle 45 (each cycle = 21 days)
