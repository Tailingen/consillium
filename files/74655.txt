The Efficacy of Surgical Treatment After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Plus Intraperitoneal Immunotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone for Patients With Positive Wash Cytology Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether intraperitoneal immunotherapy (with interleykin-2 - human cytokine reaction activator) with systemic chemotherapy will be more effective than systemic chemotherapy alone in patients with gastric cancer and verified free cancer cells in abdominal cavity in improving the long term outcomes and overall survival of further surgical treatment.
