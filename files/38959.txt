A Study of SAR428926 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Primary Objectives:

To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR428926 when administered as a single agent in patients with advanced solid tumors.

To evaluate the anti-tumor response of SAR428926 when administered as a single agent in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) positive for the protein targeted by SAR428926 To assess the preliminary anti-tumor response of SAR428926 when administered as a single agent in patients with advanced solid tumors positive for the protein targeted by SAR428926

Secondary Objectives:

To determine the overall safety profile of SAR428926 as a single agent. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of SAR428926 and its metabolites.

To identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SAR428926 as a single agent. To evaluate the immunogenicity of SAR428926. To assess the tumor response and duration of tumor response in all treated patients.

To evaluate the benefit of primary prophylaxis on the occurrence of corneal (keratopathy/keratitis) toxicity (Expansion cohorts).
Neoplasm Malignant
DRUG: SAR428926
Number of patients with dose limiting adverse events (Escalation cohort), 4 weeks|Number of patients with corneal adverse events impacting study treatment (Escalation cohort), 8 weeks|Assessment of overall response rate using standard imaging and RECIST v1.1 criteria (Expansion cohort), Tumor assessment every 2 months until disease progression or up to 36 months, whichever came first
Number of treatment emergent adverse events, Up to 3 years|Assessment of PK parameter: maximum concentration (Cmax), 2 months|Assessment of PK parameter: time to reach maximum concentration (tmax), 2 months|Assessment of PK parameter: trough plasma concentration (Ctrough), Every 2 weeks until approximately 14 weeks|Assessment of PK parameter: area under the plasma concentration curve versus time curve between 1 and 14 days (AUC0-14 day), 2 months|Assessment of PK parameter: mean systemic clearance (CL), 2 months|Assessment of PK parameter: clearance at steady state (CLss), 2 months|Assessment of PK parameter: accumulation ratio on AUC0-14, 2 months|Assessment of PK parameter: accumulation ratio on Cmax, 2 months|Preliminary tumor response by RECIST v1.1 (Escalation), 2 months|Number of corneal events according to the presence or not of preventive measures, 12 weeks
The study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion of up to 28 days, a treatment period, an end-of-treatment (EOT) visit around 30 days following the last administration of SAR428926, and at least one follow-up visit around 30 days after the EOT visit. The treatment period may continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or investigator, Sponsor, or patient decision to discontinue therapy. Patients who discontinue treatment for reasons other than progression of disease will be followed every 3 months until progression, initiation of subsequent therapy, or until the primary analysis cutoff date, whichever comes first.
