Perfusion CT as a Predictor for Response to Antiangiogenic Therapy in Patients With Metastasized Renal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is the evaluation of dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (Perfusion-CT) for therapeutic response predicition in patients with metastasized renal carcinoma (mRCC) undergoing antiangiogenetic therapy (AAT) with multikinase inhibitors.

In this study patients with mRCC under AAT will be examined with 3 serial Perfusion - CT scans - partially intergrated in their regular staging CT scheme - at baseline (before AAT start), 1 week after AAT as well as 8 weeks after AAT initialization. Thereby selected intrabdomial or intrathoracic metastases will be monitored longitudinally with perfusion CT. Pretreament and post-treament perfusion characteristics of the assessed metastatic lesions will be quantified and correlated with patient outcome.

Prediction of progression-free interval and overall survival after initialization of antiangiogenic therapy based on baseline values and relative changes of CT perfusion parameters, up to 3 years
Correlation of CT perfusion parameters at baseline as well as their relative changes after start of antiangiogenic therapy with response status according to RECIST 1.1, up to 3 years
