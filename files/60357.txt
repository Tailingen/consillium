Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Patients With Hematologic Malignancies Using Related, HLA-Haploidentical Donors
The purpose of this study is to determine if engraftment can be achieved safely in patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies who undergo non-myeloablative transplant with peripheral stem cells from Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) haploidentical donors with pre and post-transplant cyclophosphamide as immunosuppression.

It is important to extend the option of nonmyeloablative, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for potential therapy of hematologic malignancies to patients who do not have an HLA-matched donor. Almost all patients would have a related donor identical for one HLA haplotype (haploidentical) and mismatched at HLA-A, B or DR of the unshared haplotype. Thus far, nonmyeloablative HSCT from HLA-mismatched donors has been associated with a high rate of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In this protocol, we will use a combination of immunosuppressive agents including cyclophosphamide administered before and after HSCT to facilitate engraftment and to delete highly alloreactive T-cell clones presumably involved in GVHD.
