Efficacy and Safety of Photodynamic Therapy for Unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma
The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in increasing the survival time, decreasing cholestasis and improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by comparing PDT puls stents versus stents alone in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma,and to assess the safety of PDT by observing the complications after the procedure.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is difficult to diagnose due to its anatomic location, clinical course, and lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. It is often clinically silent with symptoms developing only in advanced disease. Surgical resection is the recommended curative intervention with only a minority of patients (10-20%) having potentially resectable tumors at time of diagnosis.

Endoscopic palliative therapy in CCA entails the relief of obstructive jaundice through transpapillary or percutaneous insertion of plastic or metal biliary stents. Although biliary decompression provides relief of cholangitis and improvement in quality of life, it does not improve survival.

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) in conjunction with biliary stenting may improve bile duct patency by local obliteration of malignant tissue through the cytotoxic effects of reactive oxygen species. Several studies suggest PDT plus biliary stent placement may prolong survival (range of 360-630 days), reduce cholangitis, and improve the quality of life of patients with advanced disease. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of PDT with biliary stenting compared to biliary stenting alone in the palliative treatment of unresectable CCA in China.
