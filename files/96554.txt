The Outcomes of Ultrasound-guided Thermal Ablation for Benign Thyroid Nodules
1. To evaluate the clinical outcomes of ultrasound-guided thermal ablationfor the treatment of benign thyroid nodules;
2. To develop and validate a artificial intelligence model to predict the outcomes of ultrasound-guided thermal ablation in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules
Thyroid Nodules
PROCEDURE: ultrasound-guided thermal ablation
volume reduction rate, The volume reduction rate (VRR)was calculated by the equations: VRR=(\[initial volume-final volume\] × 100)/initial volume, through study completion, an average of 6 months|rate of nodule regrowth, Regrowth was defined as ≥50% volume increase compared to the previously recorded smallest volume during the follow-up, through study completion, an average of 1 months
rate of complications, complications after ablation, 1 week|cosmetic score, The cosmetic score was assessed by a physician (1, no palpable mass; 2, no cosmetic problem but palpable mass; 3, a cosmetic problem on swallowing only; and 4, a readily detected cosmetic problem), through study completion, an average of 6 months|symptom score, The symptom score was self-measured by patients using a 10-cm visual analogue scale (grade 0-10), through study completion, an average of 6 months|vital volume, vital volume was the incompletely treated vital volume which located peripherally, through study completion, an average of 6 months|total volume, the overall volume of the nodules, through study completion, an average of 6 months
