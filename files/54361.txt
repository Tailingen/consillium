A Phase Ib Study to Evaluate the Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of IL6-receptor Antibody Sarilumab in Combination With antiPD1 Antibody Cemiplimab for Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
To learn if the combination of sarilumab (also called Kevzara) and cemiplimab can help to control EGFR- or LKB1/STK11-mutant NSCLC.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Cemiplimab|DRUG: Kevzara (Sarilumab)
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 2 years
Primary Objective:

* To evaluate the safety of sarilumab cemiplimab combination in metastatic lung cancer patients.
* The primary endpoint is DLT for safety Run-In cohort.
* To preliminarily assess efficacy of sarilumab cemiplimab combination in patients with EGFR- or LKB1/STK11-mutant NSCLC respectively.
* The primary efficacy endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) in cohort A and cohort B, evaluated separately.

Secondary Objectives:

--To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DOR), duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS), and safety and tolerability of this combination in patients with EGFR- or LKB1-mutant NSCLC respectively.

Correlative/Exploratory Objectives:

* Explore the association of baseline genomic profiles (from tumor, germline DNA, and ctDNA) with clinical benefit in patients treated with sarilumab and cemiplimab combination
* Explore the association of immune profiles (tumor immune microenvironment features) with clinical benefit in patients treated with sarilumab and cemiplimab combination
* Explore resistance mechanisms to sarilumab and cemiplimab combination.
* Determine the impact of sarilumab on immunotherapy-related side effects from cemiplimab.
