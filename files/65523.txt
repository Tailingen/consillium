Neoadjuvant Toripalimab in Combination with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin Therapy in Local Advanced Bladder Cancer Subjects
This is a pre-surgical study involving subjects with local advanced bladder cancer, who are candidates for neoadjuvant therapy. It is a single-arm phase II portion.
Urinary Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Neoadjuvant Toripalimab in Combination With Gemcitabine and Cisplatin
Pathological response rate evaluated after 4 cycles of neoadjuvant Toripalimab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin at time of radical cystectomy, each cycle is 21 days, the absence of residual muscle invasive bladder cancer in surgical specimens of cystectomy (pathologically decreased to ≤pT1N0, including pT0, pT1, pTa and pTis, Up to 90 days after last dose of investigation product
Safety assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 4 criteria, To assess safety of Toripalimab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with bladder cancer according to CTCAE v4 criteria, From the first day of the treatment to the end of neoadjuvant treatment, assessed up to 6 month|Progression-free survival assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1, From the start of neoadjuvant therapy to the time when any disease progression is first recorded, disease progression includes the progression detected by clinical or imaging before cystectomy, as well as the distant metastasis or pelvic recurrence after cystectomy. Newly discovered primary tumors in other parts of the urinary tract such as renal pelvis, ureter and urethra are not considered as disease progression., From the start of neoadjuvant therapy to the time when any disease progression is first recorded. Assessed lasted for 24 months, calculated from the date of enrolled|Tumor immune microenvironment indicators assessed by Microenvironment Analysis Panel, The expression rate of PDL1 in pathological specimens assessed by Burning Rock's product OncoScreen plus+Microenvironment Analysis Panel at the time of surgery, Assessed lasted for 24 months, calculated from the date of enrolled
Outline: This study is a single-arm, open, exploratory clinical trial;

Subjects receive: gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV Day1 and Day8 every 21 days repeated for 4 cycles; cisplatin 35mg/m2 IV Day1 and Day2 every 21 days, repeated for 4 cycles.

Toripalimab at recommended phase II dose is given every 3 weeks for 4 doses starting with Cycle1 Day1(C1D1).

Subjects will then have surgery to remove their primary tumor within 6 weeks after their last dose of neoadjuvant therapy.

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0-1
