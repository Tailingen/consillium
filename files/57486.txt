Osimertinib or Docetaxel-bevacizumab as Third-line Treatment in EGFR T790M Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Acquired epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation is the most common genetic change after resistant to first generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) in non-small cell lung cancer. After a 10 to 14 months median progression-free survival with the treatment of first generation EGFR TKI, half of patients will get disease progression.For patients progression after treated with first line EGFR TKI and second line double bullets chemotherapy or chemotherapy then EGFR TKI, optimal third line therapy is quite critical important for benefit patients' survival. We conducted this study was aimed to compare the efficacy and toxicity between osimertinib and docetaxel-bevacizumab as the third line therapy in patients with local advanced or metastatic non-squamous cell lung cancer.
