Composite Health Assessment Risk Model (CHARM) for Older Adults (BMT CTN 1704)
Prospective observational multicenter study of allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HCT) in recipients 60 years and older to assess important determinants of health status to be combined into a composite health risk model to improve risk assessment of non-relapse mortality (NRM).
Hematologic Malignancy
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Age 60+ with planned HCT for Hematologic Malignancy
One Year Non-Relapse Mortality, To determine the set of assessments and biomarkers that could together constitute a robust and valid composite health risk model for accurate personalized estimation of NRM by analyzing data collected from all measures pre and post transplant., 1 year
Overall survival, Overall survival, 1 year|Cumulative Incidence of Frailty, Cumulative Incidence of Frailty determined by score determined through the Hopkins Frailty Phenotype assessment on a scale of 0-5 where a score of 3 or more is considered 'frail'., 1 Year|Cumulative incidence of disability, Cumulative incidence of disability measured through Lawton instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) assessment. Disability is defined as any assistance needed for a specific IADL domain, and measured by a worsening of disability score by one or more IADL within one year., 1 Year|Cumulative incidence of admission to a skilled nursing facility, Cumulative incidence of admission to a skilled nursing facility, 1 Year|HRQOL using PROMIS domains, Health Related Quality of Life as measured using the PROMIS Global Health Physical Function, Anxiety, and Depression domains on scales from 0-100 where 50 is the mean score in a healthy reference population. A higher score indicates 'more' of that domain - for this study that would be more physical function, more anxiety, or more depression than the reference population., 1 Year|Cumulative incidence of serious organ toxicity by day 100, Cumulative incidence of serious organ toxicity by day 100, 100 Days|Cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD, Cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD at 100 days, 6 months and 1 year and chronic GVHD requiring treatment with systemic immune-suppression at 6 months and 1 year, 100 days|Cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD, Cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD at 100 days, 6 months and 1 year and chronic GVHD requiring treatment with systemic immune-suppression at 6 months and 1 year, 6 months|Cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD, Cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD at 100 days, 6 months and 1 year and chronic GVHD requiring treatment with systemic immune-suppression at 6 months and 1 year, 1 year|Chronic GVHD requiring treatment with systemic immune-suppression, Cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD at 100 days, 6 months and 1 year and chronic GVHD requiring treatment with systemic immune-suppression at 6 months and 1 year, 6 months|Chronic GVHD requiring treatment with systemic immune-suppression, Cumulative incidence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD at 100 days, 6 months and 1 year and chronic GVHD requiring treatment with systemic immune-suppression at 6 months and 1 year, 1 year|Survival after development of acute grade 2-4 GVHD, Survival after development of acute grade 2-4 GVHD, 1 year|Cognitive decline at day 100, Cognitive decline at day 100 as measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a rapid screening instrument for mild genitive dysfunction. MoCA uses a scale of 0-30 where 26-30 indicates the normal range in healthy populations. Cognitive decline will be defined as a 2 point or greater decline from baseline on total score., Day 100
At baseline, standardized Geriatric Assessment (GA) tools incorporating subject reported data and bedside testing will be collected. HCT-Comorbidity Index (CI) scores will be assigned and C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin will be measured locally. Serial measures at 3, 6, and 12 months for frailty, skilled facility admission, and quality of life (QOL) using PROMIS measures for physical function, depression and anxiety will be determined. Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) through one year, serious toxicities through day 100, cognitive status at day 100 and causes of death will be captured.
