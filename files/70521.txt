Dose Reduction of Postoperative Radiation for Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Arms and Legs
The investigators are doing this study to find out whether lowering the dose of postoperative radiation therapy and targeting a smaller area of tissue for treatment is as effective as the standard dose and volume of radiation therapy to control soft tissue sarcoma after surgery. They also want to find out whether the study approach causes fewer and less severe long-term side effects than the standard approach.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
RADIATION: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)
Assessment of local control at 2 years., will be assessed via imaging of the primary tumor site (MRI preferred, CT for patients who cannot get or tolerate an MRI). Imaging must take place at least annually for the first two years post-radiation. Local failure is defined as a relapse in the primary tumor bed., 2 years
overall survival, will be performed for each patient using clinical data obtained from chart review 2 years after the last patient enrolled is treated. Will use Kaplan Meier methods to estimate survival at 2 years after RT starting at the end of RT, 2 years
