CRP-guided Transanal Drainage Removal After Rectal Surgery
Transanal drainage tube (TDT) has the benefit of reducing intraluminal pressure after rectal surgery and may provide ideal regional environment for anastomotic healing. Postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) trajectory has a high negative predictive value of 0.99 for ruling out anastomotic leak (AL). Previously, TDT was removed at the surgeon's own discretion. In the present study, we design a single arm study to investigate the safety and efficacy of CRP-guided TDT removal for AL prevention following laparoscopic anterior resection for rectal carcinoma
