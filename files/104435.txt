Herceptin Followed by Chemotherapy in Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Overexpresses HER2
RATIONALE: To compare efficacy, toxicity and quality of life of the sequential administration of Her alone followed, at PD, by the combination with Chemotherapy (Arm A) vs. the upfront combination of Her and Chemotherapy (Arm B) in patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer.

PURPOSE: Trial SAKK 22/99 addresses clinically relevant and currently unresolved questions regarding the optimal use of Herceptin in the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic breast cancer.

In advanced HER2+ breast cancer the impact of combining Trastuzumab (T) and chemotherapy (chemo) versus T alone followed by the addition of chemo at disease progression has not been properly studied.

The trial compared efficacy, toxicity and quality of life of sequential administration of T followed, at progression, by combination with chemo (T\>TChemo) versus the upfront combination of T and chemo (TChemo) in patients with HER2+ advanced breast cancer.
