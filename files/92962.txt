18F-FDG PET/CT Guided Reduced-dose Radiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to explore whether 18F-FDG PET/CT guided reduced-dose radiotherapy would maintain survival outcomes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RADIATION: Reduced dose|RADIATION: Conventional dose|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Local-regional recurrence free survival (LRFS), The LRFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of initiation of treatment until the day of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 5 years
Overall survival (OS), The OS was defined as the duration from the date of of initiation of treatment to the date of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 5 years|Progression free survival (PFS), Progress-free survival is calculated from the date of initiation of treatment to the date of the first progress at any site or death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 5 years|Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), The DMFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of initiation treatment until the day of first distant metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 5 years|Incidence of treatment related acute complications, treatment-related adverse events will be assessed by NCI-CTC5.0 criteria and RTOG/EORTC criteria., up to 3 months|Incidence of treatment related late complications, treatment-related adverse events will be assessed by NCI-CTC5.0 criteria and RTOG/EORTC criteria., up to 5 years|Overall response rate, efficacy will be measured by PERCIST1.0 and RECIST1.1 criteria., up to 5 years
Biomarkers, The correlation between the radiotherapy dose with biomarkers such as peripheral blood lymphocyte and EBV-DNA., up to 5 years
Enrolled patients with complete metabolic response (CMR) and more than 70% partial metabolic response (PMR) according to PERCIST criteria at the 25th fraction will receive intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of reduced-dose (prescribed dose, 63.6 Gy, 2.12 Gy per fractions, 30 fractions), for those who with â‰¤70% PMR will receive conventional dose (prescribed dose, 70Gy, 2.12 Gy per fractions, 33 fractions).
