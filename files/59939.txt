CfDNA in Hereditary And High-risk Malignancies 2
The goal of this study is to understand the performance of an experimental blood test that aims to detect early tumors in patients with hereditary cancer syndromes. If this new blood test is accurate, it could be used to screen patients for cancer and allow for earlier cancer detection. The study will compare cancer detection rates between those receiving the new blood test and those receiving standard care, assess if the test leads to earlier cancer diagnosis, and evaluate its impact on patient outcomes. The study will also use questionnaires and interviews to understand how patients feel about the blood test, its incorporation into routine medical care, and perceptions of the medical value of test results. This research could lead to more effective and less invasive cancer screening for high-risk individuals.

Determine the cancer detection rate of the cfDNA sequencing assay in patients with HCS., We will assess the performance of the cfDNA assay for cancer detection in patients with HCS, including assay sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. The test performance endpoint is a diagnosis of cancer and will be assessed at multiple points during the study (at a minimum yearly)., 4 years from enrollment in the study.
To assess the time to cancer diagnosis using cfDNA sequencing compared to controls., We will establish whether blood plasma cfDNA testing can detect cancers at the same time as, or earlier, than conventional standard-of-care screening tests for carriers of HCS. We will also assess the time to disease management in carriers receiving cfDNA sequencing results compared to controls., 4 years from enrollment in the study.|To assess the detection rate of cancers with no standard-of-care screening available using cfDNA sequencing., To establish whether cfDNA testing increases the frequency of cancers detected, in particular cancer types with limited detection rates using standard-of-care protocols (e.g., pancreatic cancer, endometrial cancer)., 4 years from enrollment in the study.|Assess the impact of tri-annual cfDNA testing on participant cancer worry., We will assess the impact of tri-annual cfDNA testing on participants' cancer related worry, using the Cancer Worry Scale (PMID: 19382100)., 4 years from enrollment in the study.|Assess the impact of tri-annual cfDNA testing on cancer risk perception., We will assess the impact of tri-annual cfDNA testing on participants' risk perception, using the Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment (PMID: 12433008)., 4 years from enrollment in the study.|Assess the impact of tri-annual cfDNA testing on cancer anxiety and depression., We will assess the impact of tri-annual cfDNA testing on participants' anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (PMID: 18325093)., 4 years from enrollment in the study.
Through the CHARM Consortium (www.charmconsortium.ca), we have shown that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) profiling can enable more frequent cancer surveillance from readily accessible blood collections. We are now conducting a prospective, multi-center, randomized control trial of cfDNA testing of 1,000 HCS carriers from across Canada to 1) compare cancer detection rates with and without cfDNA testing, 2) assess cancer stage shift and clinical impact reducing mortality and morbidity cancers, and 3) assess impact of access to cfDNA results on patients' quality of life and psychological distress.
