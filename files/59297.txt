Organ Preservation in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer by Radiochemotherapy Followed by Consolidation Chemotherapy.
There is a growing body of evidence that surgery and associated morbidities can be omitted without compromising oncological safety in selected patients who have achieved a clinical complete response after radiochemotherapy. However with standard neoadjuvant treatment regimens the pathological complete response rate lies in the range between 10%-20%, the number of patients qualifying for non-operative management is even lower since the sensitivity of currently available diagnostic measures for predicting the pathological complete response hardly surpasses 50%-60%.The hereby proposed phase II trial CAO/ARO/AIO-16 aims at finding novel and innovative aspects of rectal cancer treatment. According to recently published data the radiochemotherapy regime in the present study with consolidating chemotherapy and delayed assessment of response has the potential to achieve pathological complete rates of approximately 40%. A standardized re-evaluation after consolidating chemotherapy will select patients who are candidates for organ-preservation. These patients will not undergo radical surgery and will instead be follow-up closely for tumor regrowth.

Clinical complete response rate, Response to treatment is assessed on day 106 after the start of radiochemotherapy.

A clinical complete response is defined by standardized findings in rectoscopy, MRI and digital rectal examination, Day 106 after the start of treatment
