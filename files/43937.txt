A Study of DSP-5336 in Relapsed/Refractory AML/ ALL With or Without MLL Rearrangement or NPM1 Mutation
A phase 1/2 dose escalation / dose expansion study of Enzomenib (DSP-5336) in adult patients with acute leukemia.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Acute
DRUG: Enzomenib|DRUG: azoles|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Gilteritinib|DRUG: Azacitidine (AZA)
Phase I Assess the safety and tolerability of DSP-5336 in relapsed/refractory AML, ALL or acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage, Occurrence of DLTs and frequency, duration and severity of TEAEs and SAEs assessed by NCI CTCAE v 5.0, Approximately 2 months after first dose|Phase I Determine the RP2D based on lowest dose of DSP-5336 that provides the maximum biologic and clinical effect, or the MTD, whichever is lower., Occurrence of DLTs and frequency, duration and severity of TEAEs and SAEs, plasma concentration-time profiles, changes in expression levels of biomarkers (gene expression levels)., Approximately 2 months after first dose|Phase 2 To evaluate clinical activity of DSP-5336 in adult patients with Relapsed /refractory AML who have MLL (KRMa gene rearrangement or NPM1 gene mutation), Occurrence of CR(MRD-); CR; CRh; CRi; PR; MLFS; CR(MRD-) + CR; CR(MRD-) + CR + CRh; OR (=CR(MRD-) or CR or CRi or MLFS or PR); DOR; time to response; time to CR; TI; OS; EFS; RFS, Approximately 6 months after first dose
Phase I Preliminary clinical activity of DSP-5336 in adult patients with AML or ALL, Disease response as assessed by ELN 2017 criteria, Approximately 6 months after first dose|2. Phase 2 To further assess safety and tolerability of DSP-5336 in adult patients with Relapsed /refractory AML, Frequency, duration, and severity of TEAEs and SAEs assessed by NCI CTCAE v 5.0, Approximately 2 months after first dose
Phase 1 (dose escalation) will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) (i.e. the lowest dose of Enzomenib (DSP-5336), that provides the maximum biologic and clinical effect, or the MTD, whichever is lower) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML, ALL, or acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage. Enrollment to the phase 1 portion of the study may be limited to patients with certain genetic abnormalities.

Phase 2 dose-expansion will further evaluate the safety and clinical activity of Enzomenib (DSP-5336) monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory AML who have MLLr or NPM1m, and relapsed/refractory ALL who have MLLr.
