Study of [68Ga]FAPI-46 PET in Patients With Pancreatic Ductal Carcinoma
This is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, open label, non-randomized study to evaluate the ability of \[68Ga\]FAPI-46 to detect FAP expressing cells in patients with resectable or borderline resectable PDAC. The \[68Ga\]FAPI-46 PET scans will be acquired after initial staging using institutional standard methods. If the participant is prescribed neoadjuvant therapy, a second \[68Ga\]FAPI-46 PET scan will be performed within 21 days prior to planned surgical resection. This will be followed by histopathology and IHC analyses and comparison to resected PDAC tumor specimens.
