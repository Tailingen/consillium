Is Thoracic Paravertebral Block a Better Option Than Conscious Sedation for PRFA of Liver Tumors
Percutaneus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver tumors causes acute pain during the periooperative setting. In order to facilitate tumor access, patient should collaborate with a surgeon during the procedurę, therefore should be conscious.

This study aims to assess the impact of a single shot thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) on a patient's haemodynamic stability, patient's and operator's comfort and satisfaction during the operation and analgesia in the post-operative period.
Liver Tumor
PROCEDURE: thoracic paravertebral blockade|PROCEDURE: local anaesthesia
Effectiveness of PVB on pain intensity, The level of pain will be assessed in all groups (PVB and BB) basing on the NRS scale (NRS 0- no pain, NRS 10 - the worst pain imaginable) Self reported pain intensity in 5 time points based on the numerical rating scale NRS (where 0 is no pain, 10 is the strongest pain).

comparison of analgesic drug use in both groups, NRS during the procedure and 0,1,3,6,24 hours post surgery|Effectiveness of PVB on pain intensity, The level of pain will be assessed in all groups (PVB and BB) basing on analgesic drugs consumption, 0,1,3,6,24 hours post surgery
Patients' satisfaction, Patients' satisfaction will be assessed in all groups (PVB and BB) basing on a survey, 24 hours post surgery|Surgeon's satisfaction, Surgeon's satisfaction will be assessed in all groups (PVB and BB) basing on a survey (where 0 is no satisfaction, 10-maximal satisfaction), 0 h post surgery (immediately after surgery)
High temperatures used during the percutaneus radiofrequency ablation (PRFA) of liver tumors can cause acute pain in the perioperative setting. In order to facilitate tumor exposure and access, patient should collaborate with a surgeon during the procedurę, therefore should be conscious. It is mandatory to provide an adequate acute postoperative pain control for our patients.

This prospective randomized, single center study was approved by the Bioethics Committee at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, (Poland) under the resolution No. 46/2017.
