Phase II Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Ociperlimab in Combination With Tislelizumab and Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment for Participants With Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The primary scientific question of interest of this study is whether the combination of ociperlimab, tislelizumab and chemotherapy improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the combination of placebo, pembrolizumab and chemotherapy as first-line therapy for adult men and women with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumors express programmed death ligand 1 (PD - L1) \[combined positive score (CPS) ≥10\], regardless of study treatment discontinuation or start of new anti-neoplastic therapy.

Each cycle is 21 days|Change from baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) Trial Outcomes Index (TOI) score, Change from baseline in the FACT-B TOI score for participants in Arms A, B and C. The FACT-B is a questionnaire that consists of 37 items with items from FACT-General (FACT-G) questionnaire (27 items) and from the Breast Cancer Subscale (BCS, 10 items). FACT-B consists of five subscales that address different aspects of the participant's quality of life: physical well-being (PWB), social/family well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional well-being (FWB), and BCS. The FACT-B TOI is a composite of PWB, FWB and BCS, and ranges from 0 to 96, with higher scores indicating better quality of life., Up to approximately 32 months after first dose|Time to 5-point definitive deterioration in FACT-B TOI score, Time to 5-point definitive deterioration in the FACT-B TOI in Arms A, B and C. The FACT-B is a questionnaire that consists of 37 items with items from FACT-General (FACT-G) questionnaire (27 items) and from the Breast Cancer Subscale (BCS, 10 items). FACT-B consists of five subscales that address different aspects of the participant's quality of life: physical well-being (PWB), social/family well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB), functional well-being (FWB), and BCS. The FACT-B TOI is a composite of PWB, FWB and BCS, and ranges from 0 to 96, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Definitive deterioration is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of event defined at least 5-point worsening from baseline with no later improvement above this threshold during the course of treatment or until death due to any cause, in the FACT-B TOI score., Up to approximately 32 months after first dose|Serum concentrations of ociperlimab, Summary statistics of serum ociperlimab concentrations by time point, Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1, C1D2, C1D4, C1D8, C1D15, D1 of C2, C3, C4 and C5, C5D8, D1 of C6, C8, C12 and C16, end of treatment and 30 day post-treatment.

This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ociperlimab in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for participants with advanced TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥ 10).

Additionally, the efficacy and safety of the triple combination (ociperlimab + tislelizumab + chemotherapy) will be assessed in Arm D (a separate single-arm, open-label cohort) in 30 participants with advanced TNBC whose tumors express PD-L1 (CPS ≥ 1 to \< 10).

Study treatment will continue until the participant experiences one of the following: disease progression per investigator's assessment by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, pregnancy, treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or participant, start of a new antineoplastic therapy, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, death, or study is terminated by the sponsor.
