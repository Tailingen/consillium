Phase 1b/2 Trial of Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, and Ciforadenant (Adenosine A2a Receptor Antagonist) in First-line Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.
To learn if the combination of ciforadenant, ipilimumab, and nivolumab can help to control advanced renal cell carcinoma
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ciforadenant
To establish the objective response rate (ORR), through study completion and average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives:

* To determine the safety and tolerability of ipilimumab, nivolumab, and ciforadenant in patients with untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
* To assess the depth of responsein patients with untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab, and ciforadenant.

Secondary Objectives:

• To estimate the objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR) progression free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD) rate, and irAE rate of ipilimumab, niovlumab, and Ciforadenant combination in untreated advanced RCC.

Exploratory Objectives:

• To assess association of gene expression signatures and pharmacodynamic parameters with outcome.
