CAR-NK Targeted CD19 for r/r B-cell Malignancies
This is a single-centre, single-arm and open-label study to investigate the safety and efficacy of JD010 in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B cell hematologic malignancies. JD010 injection is a CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor modified natural killer cells (CAR-NK) derived from a healthy donor
