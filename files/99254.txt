Brightline-2: A Study to Test Whether Brigimadlin (BI 907828) Helps People With Cancer in the Biliary Tract, Pancreas, Lung or Bladder
This study is open to adults with advanced cancer in the biliary tract, pancreas, lung, or bladder. This is a study for people for whom previous treatment was not successful or no treatment exists.

The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called BI 907828 helps people with cancer in the biliary tract, pancreas, lung, or bladder. BI 907828 is a so-called MDM2 inhibitor that is being developed to treat cancer. All participants take BI 907828 as a tablet once every 3 weeks. Participants may continue to take BI 907828 as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. They visit the study site regularly. At the study site, doctors regularly check the size of the tumour and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.

The QLQ-C30 incorporates both multi-items scales and single-item measures. These include 1 global health status/QoL scale, 5 functional scales, 3 symptoms scales and 6 single items to assess dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function, symptoms and financial difficulties and 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life., Up to 30 months|Change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue domain score, It is part of QLQ-C30 and uses 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much), Up to 30 months|Change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 role functioning domain score, It is part of QLQ-C30 and uses 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much), Up to 30 months|Change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-BIL21 tiredness domain score, The QLQ-BIL21 is specific for the assessment of quality of life in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and cancer of the gallbladder. It consists of 21 questions with a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much), and the tiredness domain is part of it., Up to 30 months
