An Evaluation of SprayShield in Reducing Post-Operative Adhesion Formation Following Major Open Abdominal Surgery
This will be a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single blind study to collect and evaluate post-market clinical data on the SprayShield Adhesion Barrier System as an adjuvant to good surgical technique for the reduction of postoperative adhesion formation following major open abdominal surgery.
Ulcerative Colitis|Familial Polyposis
DEVICE: SprayShield Adhesion Barrier System|PROCEDURE: Good Surgical Technique Alone
The Incidence of Adhesions, Defined as the Proportion of Subjects Presenting at the Follow-up Surgery (10-12 Weeks) With One or More Adhesions to the Midline Incision, Regardless of Extent and/or Severity., 10-12 Weeks post Initial Surgery for J-Pouch
Severity of Adhesions, Worst midline adhesion severity score. The severity of adhesions was categorized as filmy thickness, avascular; moderate thickness, limited vascularity; and dense thickness, vascularised. The corresponding numeric severity ratings are "1", "2", and "3". Subjects without adhesions were assigned a severity rating of "0"., Average 10-12 weeks post surgery|Adhesion Involvement Along the Midline Incision (Percentage), The proportion of the total length of the initial midline incision associated with any adhesion at the time of the follow-up surgery, as determined by dividing the length of the incision associated with adhesions (cm) by the overall initial midline incision length (cm). This calculates the extent of adhesion involvement as a percentage., average 10-12 weeks post surgery|Mobilization Time, The time (minute) required to incise and mobilize the ileal loop in preparation for reanastomosis for ileostomy closure., average 10-12 weeks post surgery
