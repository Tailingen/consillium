IO102 With Pembrolizumab, With or Without Chemotherapy, as First-line Treatment of Metastatic NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to determine if IO102 combined with pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy is safe tolerable and effective in the treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC).

The hypothesis is that IO102 will improve the objective response rate (ORR) in patients with metastatic NSCLC.
