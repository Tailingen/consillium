CRT Versus Surgery for Retroperitoneal or Paraaortic Lymph Node Recurrence of CRC
The study aims to compare the effects of chemoradiation versus radical surgery in treating retro-peritoneal or para-aortic lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer. By prolonging patients' progression-free survival, local control rate and overall survival, investigators can conclude the best regimen for colorectal cancer patients.

PROCEDURE: lymphadenectomy|RADIATION: chemoradiotherapy
Progression-free survival, The length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. In a clinical trial, measuring the progression-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. Also called PFS., From date of randomization until the date of disease progressed for any reason, assessed up to 5 years
overall survival, The length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease, such as cancer, that patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive. In a clinical trial, measuring the overall survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. Also called OS., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years|local control rate, no recurrence of the retroperitoneal or paraaortic lymph node region., From date of randomization until the date of disease recurrece, assessed up to 5 years
