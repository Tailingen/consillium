The dyspnoea scale was only calculated if all three items had been answered. Some respondents ignore question "dyspnoea when stairs" because they never climbed stairs. Hence if item "dyspnoea when stairs" was missing then items "dyspnoea when resting" and "dyspnoea when walking" was used as single-item measures under item "dyspnoea".

Participants last known to be alive were censored at the date of last contact. 18-month OS rates was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method with right censoring., 18 months|Number of Participants Per Morisky Score Classification at Month 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18, Compliance to study drug was evaluated using Morisky score. The questionnaire consisted of 4 questions in which the scale was 0 for "yes" (indicating poor compliance) and 1 for "no" (indicating good compliance). The items were summed to give a range of scores from 0 to 4. A score of 4 indicated high compliance, 2-3 indicated medium compliance and 0-1 indicated low compliance., Month 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AE: any untoward medical occurrence in participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship.
