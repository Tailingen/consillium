Phase I/II Trial of Antagonism of HER in GI Cancer
Recruitment to phase I of the PANTHER trial is complete.

Phase II, is to evaluate the best overall response rate for AZD8931 + FOLFIRI treatment.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer|Recurrent Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: AZD8931|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Folinic Acid|DRUG: Fluorouracil|DRUG: Fluorouracil
Best overall response, Best overall response will be assessed according to RECIST v1.1., From registration to date of documented best response, assessed up to 36 months
To evaluate the efficacy of AZD8931 plus FOLFIRI, Percentage change in tumour size will be considered the best response only if a second assessment has been carried out which confirms SD at least four weeks after trial entry. Assessment will be determined using CT scans performed at baseline, 12 weeks after start of chemotherapy, then every 3 months until disease progression up to 3 years from registration/ randomisation, Baseline to 12 weeks post treatment start|Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival time will be calculated from the date of trial entry to the date of documented progression, or death from any cause. In cases where progression is suspected and subsequently confirmed by scans, the date of documented suspected progression will be used., From date of randomisation to date of documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 3 years from date of registration/ randomisation|Overall Survival, Overall survival time will be calculated from the date of trial entry to the date of death from any cause or end of trial follow-up., From date of registration/ randomisation until date of death or date of last follow-up assessment (up to 3 years from date of registration/ randomisation)|Occurrence and Severity of Adverse Events, Will include all grade 1-5 adverse events, From date of registration/ randomisation until 30 days after completion of trial treatment (AZD8931 and FOLFIRI)
PANTHER is a registered phase I/phase II trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer.

The phase II part of the study will be a single arm trial. Patients will receive AZD8931 (an EGFR/ERBB inhibitor) in combination with FOLinic acid, Fluorouracil and IRInotecan (FOLFIRI), Treatment will be given in two-weekly cycles. Phase II's primary objective is to evaluate the Best overall response
