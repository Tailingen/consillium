Carevive Survivor Care Planning System in Improving Quality of Life in Breast Cancer Survivors
This pilot clinical trial studies how well the Carevive Survivor Care Planning System works in improving quality of life in breast cancer survivors. A personalized survivor care plan includes a summary of a patient's cancer treatment and a customized survivor care plan and may provide beneficial information and resources.

PRIMARY OBJECTIES:

I. To evaluate the feasibility of using the Carevive Survivor Care Planning System (SCPS) during the follow-up visit for breast oncology survivors treated in a university cancer center or a community medical center.

II. To evaluate survivors' perceptions of the usability of the Carevive technology.

III. To evaluate their perceptions of the acceptability (perception of benefit) of the treatment summary and survivor care plan.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Examine the psychometrics of surveys developed for this research. II. Compare participants' perceptions of the care received under the Carevive system with clinician documentation.

III. Compare clinician documentation of care received by this sample with documentation of care provided for historical controls at each site.
