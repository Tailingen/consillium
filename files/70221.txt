TACE Combined With Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors and Tislelizumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Most hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are found in the intermediate or advanced stage. The patients lose the opportunity of curative surgical resection. In clinical practice, unresectable HCC is often encountered with large tumor lesions and insufficient remaining liver volume. It is expected that the benefit of direct surgical resection will not exceed that of non-surgical treatment if the tumor is limited in scope but with unclear boundaries, surrounding small foci, or adjacent to important vascular structures, or combined with secondary or higher portal vein tumor thrombus. These patients account for a significant proportion of unresectable HCC, but have the potential for surgical resection. If the investigators can make full use of the existing HCC treatment, the patients hope to obtain radical surgical resection opportunities and better long-term survival after tumor shrinkage and tumor necrosis boundary becomes clear.

Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been the standard arterial treatment for advanced HCC. Tyrosine kinase Inhibitor is the first-line treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Tislelizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a first-line treatment for HCC. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors and tislelizumab in the treatment of unresectable HCC.
