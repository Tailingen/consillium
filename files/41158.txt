Pemigatinib + Pembrolizumab vs Pemigatinib Alone vs Standard of Care for Urothelial Carcinoma (FIGHT-205)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pemigatinib plus pembrolizumab or pemigatinib alone versus the standard of care for participants with metastatic or unresectable urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible to receive cisplatin, are harboring FGFR3 mutation or rearrangement, and who have not received prior treatment.
Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma|Unresectable Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Pemigatinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of disease progression (as measured by a blinded independent central review \[BICR\] per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 \[RECIST v1.1\]) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., up to 130 days
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause., up to 225 days|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 (as measured by BICR)., up to 148 days|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the date of the first assessment of CR or PR until the date of the first disease progression (per RECIST v1.1) or death, whichever occurred first (as measured by BICR)., up to 148 days|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as an adverse event that was either reported for the first time or the worsening of a pre-existing event after the first dose of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug., up to 178 days|EORTC QLQ-C30 Score, The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) contains 30 items and measures 5 functional dimensions (i.e., physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 3 symptom items (i.e., fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), 6 single items (i.e., dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global health and quality of life scale. For each scale and single item, a linear transformation was applied to standardize the scores between 0 (worst) and 100 (best) as described in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual., up to 160 days|Change From Baseline in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Score, The European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) contains 30 items and measures 5 functional dimensions (i.e., physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 3 symptom items (i.e., fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), 6 single items (i.e., dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global health and quality of life scale. For each scale and single item, a linear transformation was applied to standardize the scores between 0 (worst) and 100 (best) as described in the EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value., Baseline; up to 160 days|Number of Participants With the Indicated EQ-5D-5L Dimension Scores, The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system is composed of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-case, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 response levels, which are coded by single-digit numbers: 1 = no problems, 2 = slight problems, 3 = moderate problems, 4 = severe problems, 5 = unable to/extreme problems. The EQ-5D-5L also includes a graded (0 \[worst overall health\] to 100 \[best overall health\]) vertical visual analog scale that provides a quantitative measure of the participant's perception of their overall health., up to 160 days|Change From Baseline in the EQ-5D-5L EQ Visual Analog Scale Score, The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome.
