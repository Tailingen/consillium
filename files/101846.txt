A Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of IOV-3001 in Adults With Advanced Melanoma Who Will Receive Lifileucel
A Phase 1/2, open-label study of a modified interleukin-2 fusion protein (IOV 3001) in participants with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic melanoma who will receive lifileucel.
Unresectable Melanoma|Metastatic Melanoma|Ocular Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: IOV-3001
Safety and Tolerability, The frequency and severity of treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events will be assessed when IOV-3001 administered, Up to 30 days|Recommended Dose for Phase 2, Determine the recommended dose for Phase 2, Up to 30 days
Pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of IOV-3001, PK as measured by maximum observed drug concentration in plasma (Cmax) after single dose, Up to 8 days|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile of IOV-3001, Area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC) after single dose, Up to 8 days|Antidrug Antibody (ADA) Profile, ADAs to IOV-3001 will be measured, Up to 5 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator from the date of lifileucel infusion until disease progression, start of a new anticancer therapy, or death due to any cause cause, whichever occurs first (up to a maximum of 5 years after the lifileucel infusion), Up to 5 years|Complete Response (CR) rate, CR rate is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator from the date of lifileucel infusion until disease progression, start of a new anticancer therapy, or death due to any cause cause (up to a maximum of 5 years after the lifileucel infusion), Up to 5 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is measured from the time that criteria are met for CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator disease progression or death due to any cause (up to a maximum of 5 years after the lifileucel infusion), Up to 5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is measured by the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed response of CR or PR at any time participants with SD â‰¥ 4 weeks per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by the investigator from the date of lifileucel infusion disease progression, start of a new anticancer therapy, or death due to any cause (up to a maximum of 5 years after the lifileucel infusion), Up to 5 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of lifileucel infusion until disease progression per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigator or death due to any cause (up to a maximum of 5 years after the lifileucel infusion), Up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of lifileucel infusion to death due to any cause (up to a maximum of 5 years after the lifileucel infusion), Up to 5 years
This study is the first-in-human (FIH) study of IOV-3001. IOV-3001 is an antibody interleukin-2 (IL-2) fusion protein in which a modified form of aldesleukin is incorporated into the antibody palivizumab.

The Phase 1 portion will include 2 parts. Participants will receive IOV-3001 either before the Lifileucel regimen (Part 1) or after Lifileucel instead of aldesleukin (Part 2).
