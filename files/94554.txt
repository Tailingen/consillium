Novel Controlled Hypo-Perfusion Technique in Partial Nephrectomy
Many patients who are candidates for nephron-sparing surgery, partial nephrectomy is now the standard treatment with a surgical, small, clinical T1 tumor (\<7 cm). In many recent studies, partial nephrectomy provides equivalent oncologic, and superior functional, outcomes compared with the standard radical nephrectomy over the short and long term (2, 3). Partial nephrectomy techniques, whether open, laparoscopic or robotic, typically involve hilar clamping, which creates the desired bloodless operative field, allowing for more precise tumor excision and renal reconstruction. This hilar clamping eventually may lead to ischemic kidney injury which can compromise the functional outcomes of the remaining kidney.We are working now to develop a novel technique of Hypo-Perfusion by achieving partial renal arterial clamping, with the goal of completely eliminating surgical ischemia to the renal remnant.
Partial Nephrectomy|Renal Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Hypoperfusion of renal artery
To perfect the Renal Hypoperfusion during partial nephrectomy is feasible safe and result in better renal function than complete occlusion of renal blood flow, renal function will be measured using creatinine, eGFR, 24 hr creat clearance, and NGAL biomarker of acute kidney injury, up to 2 weeks prior to surgery and up to 24 hrs post surgery
