Single Nucleotide Polymorphism(SNP)Study. ICORG 08-40, V4
Primary Objective:

Correlation of the skin and/or eye toxicity grade secondary to Cetuximab or Panitumumab and the SNP profile of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) domain III region.

Secondary Objectives:

Correlation of SNP profile with indicators of tumour response parameters, such as radiological response, duration of response, time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) time, incidence of non-dermatological adverse events.
Colorectal Cancer|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Correlation between the type and degree of reported skin and/or eye reaction and the SNP profile of the EGFR domain III region., Using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4, Throughout treatment with up to 5 years in follow up
Correlation between the SNP profile(s) and disease response, Time to progression TTP and OS over 5 years, Throughout treatment with up to 5 years in follow up
Baseline assessment:

* Contact Lenses
* Medical History
* Previous chemotherapy
* Vital Signs (weight, height, Karnofsky Performance status, heart rate, blood pressure)
* Symptom Assessment (Pre-existing skin and/or eye conditions, CEA measurement (CRC only), Disease status (TNM Staging))
* Planned chemotherapy regimen
* Radiotherapy

Blood Sample: A 2ml blood sample should be collected in ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) containing Vacutainer at any time before or after starting treatment. DNA will be extracted from the samples and the 11 SNPs in the region of the EGFR gene encoding domain III will be characterized.

Follow-up Assessment: with every second cycle of Cetuximab- or Panitumumab-containing regimen (CRC: every 2. Week; NSCLC: every 3-4 weeks):

* Visit Number and Date
* Vital Signs (weight, height, Karnofsky Performance status, heart rate, blood pressure)
* Symptom Assessment (CEA measurement (CRC only), Disease status (TMN Staging), Skin Toxicity (CTCAE) grading)
* Current chemotherapy regimen
* Radiotherapy
* CEA measurement only for CRC (every second cycle/every 4 weeks)

Long-term follow-up (up to 5 years):

* CT restaging (TNM Staging) should be done 3 monthly for as long as the subject is receiving Cetuximab- or Panitumumab- containing regimen or if there is suspicion of disease progression.
* OS
