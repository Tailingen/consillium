Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Treating Women Who Are Undergoing Surgery for Newly Diagnosed, Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. Combining paclitaxel with carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving paclitaxel together with carboplatin works in treating women who are undergoing surgery for newly diagnosed, locally advanced breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: paclitaxel
Determine the clinical and pathological response in women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced operable breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel and carboplatin, baseline to 18 months
Evaluate specific biomarkers for prognostic value and as markers for response/resistance in patients treated with this regimen, baseline through 18 months|Determine the tolerability and toxicity of this regimen in these patients., baseline to 18 months
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the clinical and pathological response in women with newly diagnosed, locally advanced operable breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel and carboplatin.
* Evaluate specific biomarkers for prognostic value and as markers for response/resistance in patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the tolerability and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Patients with non-palpable lymph nodes undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy within 4 weeks before beginning neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

All patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients undergo lumpectomy or modified radical mastectomy. Patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy or palpable axillary adenopathy undergo axillary lymph node dissection. All patients undergoing lumpectomy or mastectomy with high-risk disease also undergo radiotherapy.

Patients refusing lumpectomy or mastectomy due to persistence of disease may undergo core needle biopsy.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
