Study to Evaluate Induction Chemotherapy Using Docetaxel, Cisplatin and Fluorouracil in Concurrence With Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy for Local Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)
Study Objective:

Primary

1. To evaluate the complete response (CR) rate with induction chemotherapy using Docetaxel, Cisplatin and Fluorouracil(TPF) followed by Docetaxel plus Cetuximab (TC) in concurrence with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).

Secondary

1. To determine the overall response rate.
2. To determine the locoregional and distant control rate
3. To determine the progression-free survival (PFS)
4. To determine the overall survival (OS)
5. To determine the safety of the induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiation plus Cetuximab.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Docetaxel, Cisplatin, 5-FU and Cetuximab
Complete response rate, Complete response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with disappearance of all target lesions after induction and concurrent therapies., 5 years
Overall response rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects with best response (confirmed CR or PR) compared to the overall treated group., 5 years|Locoregional and distant control rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects with no local or nodal progression or recurrence and no distant disease progression or recurrence compared to the overall treated group., 5 years|Progression free survival, Defined as the time in months from first dose of cetuximab until PD is observed or death occurs due to any cause within 90 days after the last tumour assessment or first cetuximab dose., 5 years|Overall survival, Defined as the time in months from first dose of cetuximab to the date of death is observed. If subject has not died, the survival time will be censored on the last date the subject was known to be alive., 5 years
