An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as adverse events/serious adverse events that started or worsened after the study drug treatment., From Screening (Day -28) to Post Therapy Day 30|Number of Participants With Electrocardiogram (ECG) Abnormalities Recorded as Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) were defined as events that occur following the first injection of study treatment, or that started prior to the first injection and worsened during treatment. An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as adverse events/serious adverse events that started or worsened after the study drug treatment., From Screening (Day -28) to Post Therapy Day 30
Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR), The CR rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had achieved CR based on both the evaluable population for efficacy., Baseline (Day 1) until Final Study Visit Post Therapy (up to 2 year after the last participant begins study drug treatment)|Duration of Complete Response, Duration of CR was measured from the first documentation of a CR to the time of relapse for the subgroup of participants with CR. Duration of CR was calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. The Evaluable Population for efficacy was used to evaluate the endpoints for the efficacy profile., Baseline (Day 1) until Final Study Visit Post Therapy (up to 2 year after the last participant begins study drug treatment)|Percentage of Participants With Partial Response (PR), Baseline (Day 1) until Final Study Visit Post Therapy (up to 2 year after the last participant begins study drug treatment)|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), OR was defined as the percentage of participants with CR or partial response (PR)., Baseline (Day 1) until Final Study Visit Post Therapy (up to 2 year after the last participant begins study drug treatment)|Time to Response (TTR), TTR was measured from the start of moxetumomab pasudotox administration to the first documentation of response (CR or PR) and was only assessed in participants who had achieved objective response (OR)., Baseline (Day 1) until Final Study Visit Post Therapy (up to 2 year after the last participant begins study drug treatment)|Duration of Objective Response (DOR), DOR was measured from the first documentation of OR to the event of relapse. DOR was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Baseline (Day 1) until Final Study Visit Post Therapy (up to 2 year after the last participant begins study drug treatment)|Duration of Stable Disease (SD), Duration of SD was defined as the time period from start of moxetumomab pasudotox administration to the event of progressive disease (PD)/relapse. Duration of SD was only calculated for the subgroup of participants with best response of CR, PR, or SD, and was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Baseline (Day 1) until Final Study Visit Post Therapy (up to 2 year after the last participant begins study drug treatment)|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Moxetumomab Pasudotox, Maximum observed drug concentration of Moxetumomab pasudotox in plasma., Pre-dose and End of infusion on Day 1, 3 and 5 of each cycle; 1, 3 and 6 hour after the end of infusion on Day 1 of each cycle|Area Under Concentration-Time Curve From Dosing Extrapolated to Infinity (AUCinf) of Moxetumomab Pasudotox, Area under the concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity (AUC) of Moxetumomab pasudotox in Plasma., Pre-dose and End of infusion on Day 1, 3 and 5 of each cycle; 1, 3 and 6 hour after the end of infusion on Day 1 of each cycle|Clearance (CL) of Moxetumomab Pasudotox, CL of drug is rate at which drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes and is influenced by fraction of dose absorbed., Pre-dose and End of infusion on Day 1, 3 and 5 of each cycle; 1, 3 and 6 hour after the end of infusion on Day 1 of each cycle|Elimination Half Life (t1/2) of Moxetumomab Pasudotox, Plasma decay half life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half., Pre-dose and End of infusion on Day 1, 3 and 5 of each cycle; 1, 3 and 6 hour after the end of infusion on Day 1 of each cycle|Number of Participants With Positive Anti-Drug Antibody, The moxetumomab pasudotox specific bridging assay using the Meso Scale Discovery platform was employed to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADA)., Baseline (Day 1) up to End of the Treatment (Last dose of Last cycle) (approximately 3 years)|Number of Participants With CD22 Expression Levels, CD22 Expression was analyzed using Prism® analysis. Flow cytometry was performed to quantitate the CD22 expression for the purpose of evaluating the relationship of CD22 expression with response to treatment., Baseline (Day 1) up to End of the Treatment (Last dose of Last cycle) (approximately 3 years)|Number of Capillary Leak Syndrome (CLS) Participants With Weight Changes, Albumin, Hypotension, Edema, Hypoxia, and Pulmonary Adverse Events (AEs), The correlation of CLS and weight changes, albumin, hypotension, edema, hypoxia, and pulmonary AEs were examined., From Screening (Day -28) to Post Therapy Day 30|Percentage of Participants With Stable Disease (SD), Baseline (Day 1) until Final Study Visit Post Therapy (up to 2 year after the last participant begins study drug treatment)
