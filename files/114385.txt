AVELUMAB and CETUXIMAB and mFOLFOXIRI as Initial Therapy for Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of mFOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab and avelumab as first line treatment of patients with initially unresectable and previously untreated RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), in terms of Progression-free Survival.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: 5Fluorouracil|DRUG: L-leucovorin|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Avelumab
Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 19 months
Toxicity Rate, Toxicity Rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, experiencing a specific adverse event of grade 3/4, according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 5.0), during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment., 24 months|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment. The determination of clinical response will be based on investigator reported measurements. Responses will be evaluated every 8 weeks., 19 months|Immuno-related Objective Response Rate, Immuno-related Objective Response Rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to immune-modified RECIST criteria, during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment. The determination of clinical response will be based on investigator reported measurements. Responses will be evaluated every 8 weeks., 19 months|Early Objective Response Rate, Early Objective Response Rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of the enrolled subjects, achieving a â‰¥ 20% decrease in the sum of diameters of RECIST target lesions at week 8 compared to baseline., up to 2 months from randomization|Deepness of Response, Deepness of Response is defined as the relative change in the sum of longest diameters of RECIST target lesions at the nadir, in the absence of new lesions or progression of non-target lesions, when compared with baseline., 19 months|R0 Resection Rate, R0 Resection Rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, undergoing secondary R0 resection of metastases. Secondary R0 surgery is defined as microscopically margin free complete surgical removal of all residual disease, performed during treatment or after its completion, allowed by tumoral shrinkage and/or disappearance of one or more lesions., 19 months|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from registration to the date of death due to any cause. For patients still alive at the time of analysis, the OS time will be censored on the last date the patients were known to be alive., 48 months
This is a prospective, open-label, multicentric phase II single-arm trial in which patients with initially unresectable and previously untreated RAS wild-type mCRC will receive induction treatment with mFOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab and avelumab up to 12 cycles followed by maintenance with 5-FU/LV plus cetuximab plus avelumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal. The second- and subsequent lines of treatment will be at investigators' choice.
