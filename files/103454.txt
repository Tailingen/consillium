A Study of GC007F CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy for Relapsed or Refractory B- ALL
The study is an early, open, single-centered trial.
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: GC007F
Number of Patients with Dose Limiting Toxicity, A dose limiting toxicity is defined as any toxicity that is considered to be primarily related to the GC007F cells, which is irreversible, or life threatening or hematologic or non-hematologic Grade 3-5, 12 weeks|Incidence and severity of adverse events, After GC007F infusion, adverse events will be graded as CTCAE 4.0, 12 weeks|GC007F persistence, After GC007F infusion, GC007F CAR copies in peripheral blood. bone marrow and CSF will be measured by qPCR in 12 weeks, 12 weeks
Percents of Patients with best response as complete remission and MRD negative complete remission., Response rates will be estimated as the percents of patients whose best response is complete remission and MRD negative complete remission., 12 weeks
The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of GC007F CAR-T cell immunotherapy in relapsed or refractory B-ALL. The study will include 20 subjects to receive GC007F therapy.
