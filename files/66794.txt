A Study of MK-6598 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Advanced Solid Tumors (MK-6598-001)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety and establish a preliminary recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of MK-6598 administered as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in adult participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: MK-6598|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Number of Participants with a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Graded Using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (AEs) Version 5.0, DLT is defined as any of the following toxicities, unless assessed by the investigator to be clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes: Grade (Gr) 4 nonhematologic toxicity (not laboratory); Gr 4 hematologic toxicity lasting ≥7 days, except thrombocytopenia; Gr 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration; Gr 3 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding; Gr 4 anemia regardless of duration; Nonhematologic AE Gr ≥3 in severity, with exceptions; Any Gr 3 or 4 nonhematologic lab abnormality if clinically significant medical intervention is required, or if leads to hospitalization, persists for \>72 hours or results in drug-induced liver injury with exceptions; Gr 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia; Prolonged delay (\>2 weeks) in initiating Cycle 2 due to treatment-related toxicity; Treatment-related toxicity resulting in study treatment discontinuation during Cycle 1 (C1); Missing \>25% of MK-6598 doses as a result of treatment-related AE during C1; Gr 5 toxicity., Up to approximately 21 days|Number of Participants Who Experience At Least One AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who experienced an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 27 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 24 months
Area Under the Curve (AUC) of MK-6598, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine AUC., Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1: predose, postdose at 30 minutes (min), 45 min, 60 min, 2 hours (hrs), 6 hrs; Days 2 and 9 of Cycle 1: predose; Day 1 of Cycles 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35: predose|Minimum Serum Concentration (Cmin) of MK-6598, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Cmin, Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1: predose, postdose at 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 2 hrs, 6 hrs; Days 2 and 9 of Cycle 1: predose; Day 1 of Cycles 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35: predose|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of MK-6598, Blood samples collected pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine Cmax., Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1: predose, postdose at 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 2 hrs, 6 hrs; Days 2 and 9 of Cycle 1: predose; Day 1 of Cycles 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35: predose|Tumor Phenylpyruvate Concentrations, Blood samples pre-dose and at multiple timepoints post-dose will be used to determine tumor phenylpyruvate concentrations., Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1: predose, postdose at 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 2 hrs, 6 hrs; Days 2 and 9 of Cycle 1: predose; Day 1 of Cycles 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35: predose
