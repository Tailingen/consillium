Chemoradiotherapy in Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Radiochemotherapy is a standard for the treatment of unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer. The investigators goal is to study the efficacy and the toxicity for a promising association of new agents (cetuximab and pemetrexed) with concurrent radiotherapy.
Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Chemotherapy|DRUG: ERBITUX|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Disease-Control Rate, percentage of patients with disease control (complete response + partial response + stable disease) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions.

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions)., 16 weeks after inclusion
18-month Overall Survival Rate, Percentage of patient alive 18 months after registration, 18 months|Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as time between date of inclusion and progression or all-cause death.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 52.3 months (median duration of follow-up)
