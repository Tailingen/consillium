Treatment of Polycythemia Vera With Gleevec
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of patients with Polycythemia Vera treated with Gleevec.

Phlebotomy is a standard temporizing treatment for Polycythemia Vera. Performing repeated phlebotomies may lead to iron deficiency and can contribute to a rising platelet count. This may create additional problems, such as clots particularly in patients older than 50. There is reason to believe that the use of Gleevec may cause a decrease in the activity of the marrow so that patients may not require as many or any phlebotomies. Thus, spleen function may possibly improve by decreasing in size and patients' platelet counts may also improve.
