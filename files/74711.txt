Comparative Efficacy of 3L and 2L Integrated Techniques for Gynecologic Cancer-related Lower Extremity Lymphedema: a Retrospective Study
The goal of this retrospective study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of 3L versus 2L integrated techniques in patients with gynecologic cancer-related lower extremity lymphedema (GCR-LEL). The main research question is:

Do 3L integrated techniques provide superior long-term outcomes in reducing lower extremity lymphedema compared to 2L techniques in patients with GCR-LEL?

Medical records of patients who have received either 3L or 2L integrated interventions as part of their routine clinical management for GCR-LEL were reviewed and analyzed to assess treatment outcomes over an extended follow-up period.
Gynecologic Cancer-related Lower Extremity Lymphedema|Lymphedema
PROCEDURE: VLNT（Vascularized Lymph Node Transfer）|PROCEDURE: LVA（Lymphaticovenular Anastomosis）|PROCEDURE: LS（Liposuction）
Change in lower limb volume (mL) measured by circumference-based calculation, Each participant's lower limb circumference will be measured at predefined anatomical landmarks, and limb volume will be calculated using the truncated cone formula., Preoperative baseline vs. postoperative follow-up (e.g., 3, 6, 12 and 18 months)
Cellulitis Infection Rate (episodes/year), The incidence of cellulitis episodes per patient was assessed through retrospective chart review and clinical records. A clinically diagnosed cellulitis episode was defined by acute onset of erythema, warmth, tenderness, and edema. We compared the mean episodes per year among different surgical approach groups., Preoperative baseline vs. postoperative follow-up (e.g., 3, 6, 12 and 18 months)|Change in Lymphoedema Quality of Life (LYMQOL) Score, Lymphedema-specific quality of life was measured using the LYMQOL questionnaire, which includes four domains: symptoms, emotions, function, and appearance. The total LYMQOL score was calculated and compared between preoperative and postoperative assessments in different surgical groups. We evaluated both within-group (pre-to-post) and between-group differences., Preoperative baseline vs. postoperative follow-up (e.g., 3, 6, 12 and 18 months)|Incidence of Surgical Complications, Surgical complications (e.g., flap infection, necrosis, lymphorrhea, or deep vein thrombosis) were assessed through postoperative clinical evaluations and chart review. Wound healing status was recorded, and the presence of any adverse events was documented., Up to 30 days post-surgery and during follow-up (e.g., 3, 6, 12 and 18 months)|Changes in Lymphoscintigraphy and Ultrasound Findings, Lymphoscintigraphy was performed to assess dermal backflow and collateral lymphatic vessel formation, while ultrasound evaluated lymph node and lymphatic vessels status (e.g., size, vascularity, viability). Postoperative changes were compared to baseline (preoperative) imaging in each group (LVA + VLNT + LS, VLNT + LS, LVA + LS)., Preoperative imaging vs. postoperative imaging at 6, 12 and 18 months
