Higher Dose Weekly Topotecan In The Treatment Of Patients With Extensive Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer
This proposed phase II trial will investigate weekly topotecan at a higher dose than was used in the previous trials in an attempt to achieve improved response rates and disease control without added toxicity. To help ameliorate the fatigue, planned rest weeks will be incorporated into the schedule. This trial will be the first clinical trial to evaluate a higher dose of weekly topotecan in the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC.
