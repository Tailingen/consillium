Cardiac Monitoring of Post-Operative Cancer Patients Experiencing Atrial Fibrillation
The purpose of this study is to assess whether it is possible and acceptable to monitor patients at a distance who experience a condition called atrial fibrillation after their cancer surgery. Some patients have no other clinical reason for staying in the hospital after cancer surgery except in order to control their heart rhythm. Being able to send these patients home earlier and monitor them at a distance from their home can be good for their quick recovery. Studies have shown greater quality of life and patient satisfaction when patients are monitored at a distance for conditions like atrial fibrillation, however cancer patients have not been studied.
Post-Operative Cancer Patients Experiencing Atrial|Fibrillation
BEHAVIORAL: questionnaire about the use of ECG device
Assess the feasibility and acceptance of continuous remote cardiac monitoring, In post-operative patients with respect to recurrence of post-operative atrial fibrillation upon discharge., 4 to 6 weeks
