ENGOT-cx1/BGOG-cx1: 3 Weekly Carboplatin/Paclitaxel With or Without Nintedanib in Cervix Cancer
Indication:

Treatment of subjects with advanced (FIGO stage IVB) or recurrent cervical cancer, prior radiochemotherapy or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed.

Study design:

This is a phase II randomized, double blind and placebo controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of Nintedanib/placebo in combination with the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by Nintedanib/placebo maintenance in the treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer.

A total of 120 patients will be randomized between the experimental and control arm in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified for 1previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes/no) and 2disease status (Stage IVB primary versus recurrent disease).

Experimental arm: Subjects will receive 6 cycles of 3-weekly carboplatin (AUC 5) + paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and Nintedanib 200 mg BID followed by Nintedanib maintenance until progression or for a total maximum duration of 120 weeks.

Control arm: Subjects will receive 6 cycles of 3-weekly carboplatin (AUC 5) + paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and placebo 200 mg BID followed by placebo maintenance until progression or for a total maximum duration of 120 weeks.

Subjects without evidence of disease progression after completion or discontinuation of the study treatment will be followed until radiographic disease progression, withdrawal of consent or death.
Uterine Cervical Neoplasms
DRUG: Nintedanib|DRUG: Placebo
Progression free survival, Primary objective:

The purpose of this trial is to determine if chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) plus Nintedanib (BIBF 1120) can improve progression free survival compared to chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel) plus placebo in patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer., 1.5 years after LPI
Safety and toxicity, Secondary objectives:

To evaluate the safety and toxicity reported for of the combination regimen, 5 years after LPI|Overall survival, To evaluate the response rate according to RECIST 1.1, 5 years after LPI|Patient health status, To explore the effect of Nintedanib on patient reported health status as measured by EORTC-QOL-Cx 24 and EORTCQLQ-C30 questionnaires, 5 years after LPI|Overall survival, To evaluate the overall survival, 5 years after LPI
Indication:

Treatment of subjects with advanced (FIGO stage IVB) or recurrent cervical cancer, prior radiochemotherapy or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed.
