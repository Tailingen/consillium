Study of Safety and Efficacy of DKY709 Alone or in Combination With PDR001 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.
This is a phase I/Ib, open label study. The escalation portion will characterize the safety and tolerability of DKY709 and DKY709 in combination with PDR001 in subjects with NSCLC or melanoma who have received prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, or subjects with NPC. After the determination of the MTD/RD for a particular treatment arm, dose expansion will further assess safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and anti-tumor activity of each regimen at the MTD/RD.
