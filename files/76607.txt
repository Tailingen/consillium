Circulating Tumoral DNA in Choroidal Melanoma (ctDNA MU)
Quantification and follow-up during 3 years of circulating tumoral DNA in patients with choroidal melanoma
Choroidal Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Blood sampling
Assesment of the change of the circulating tumor DNA from baseline at 3 years, T0: before treatment; T1: 1 month after local treatment; T2: at 7 months; Tn : every 6 months up to 3 years.
Compare the treatment effects of the primary tumor (protontherapy, iodine plaque, enucleation) on the rate of circulating tumoral DNA., 3 years|Comparison of the circulating tumor DNA rate to hepatic imaging if available., 3 years
This study is a prospective, open-labelled, monocentric trial. The aim is to observe, in patient with choroidal melanoma (any stage of the disease), the prevalence of the circulating tumor DNA at the diagnostic and its evolution during 3 years.

The patient will have a blood sample at the following times :

* T0: before treatment of the primary tumor.
* T1: 1 months after the end of the local treatment.
* T2: at 7 months.
* Tn: every 6 months up to 3 years.
