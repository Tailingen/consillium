Sorafenib and Topotecan in Refractory/Recurrent Pediatric Malignancies
H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute will be the Sunshine Project Coordinator, but will not be recruiting locally.

The purpose of this research study is to establish a dose of the combination of drugs, Topotecan and Sorafenib in children. This will be called the maximum tolerated dose. The chemotherapy in this study is a combination of Topotecan and Sorafenib. The investigators are trying to find the highest dose of Topotecan and Sorafenib that can be given safely to children with Refractory or Recurrent Pediatric Solid Malignancies. The investigators will do this by testing different doses of these drugs in different groups of children. The investigators will also study how the body processes these drugs.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Topotecan|DRUG: Sorafenib
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Establish the recommended phase II dose of the combination of topotecan and sorafenib in children. This will be the maximum tolerated dose., 24 months
Time to Progression (TTP), Determine Time to Progression (TTP) for all patients, comparing TTP on study to TTP on previous regimen. This study will use the (RECIST 1.1) Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors from the NCI for assessment of radiographic response in patients with solid tumors and in order to determine if patients have met off study criteria, i.e. disease progression. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the disease measurement, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions, or evidence of laboratory or clinical progression., 24 months|The Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Feasibility, Describe the toxicity as per NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, version 4.0 (CTCAE 4.0)., 24 months
