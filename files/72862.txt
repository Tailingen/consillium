Trial of LAVA-051 in Patients with Relapsed/refractory CLL, MM, or AML
A phase 1, first-in-human trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LAVA-051 in patients with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Multiple Myeloma (MM), or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Multiple Myeloma|Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: LAVA-051|BIOLOGICAL: Interleukin 2
Part 1 & Part 2 - Frequency and severity of AEs:, Frequency, severity, and grading of Adverse Events using the Common Terminology Criteria and grading for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. CRS will be evaluated using the ASTCT., Approximately 6 months|Part 1 - Frequency and type of DLT, A DLT is defined as an adverse event that is unrelated to disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications and is occurring during the first 28 days of treatment. These events will be classified according to the CTCAE v5.0; CRS will be evaluated according to the ASTCT consensus criteria, First 28 days of treatment
Part 1 & Part 2: Number of participants with an antitumor response, Antitumor response for CLL per iwCLL guidelines, MM per IMWG-based response criteria, and AML per ELN criteria, Approximately 6 months|Part 1 & Part 2: Pharmacokinetics of LAVA-051, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of LAVA-051 will be assessed in all patients treated with LAVA-051, Approximately 6 months|Part 1 & Part 2: Incidence and prevalence anti-LAVA-051 antibodies, Development of antibodies (anti-drug antibodies) to LAVA-051 will be evaluated, Approximately 6 months
An open-label, phase 1 dose escalation trial with disease-specific expansion cohorts to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of LAVA-051 in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, MM, or AML.

The trial was intended to be a Phase 1/2 trial (but the trial never moved forward to Phase 2).
