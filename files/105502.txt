Aerobic Exercise in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer
RATIONALE: Aerobic exercise may help prevent side effects caused by chemotherapy and help improve heart health.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects of aerobic exercise and to see how well it works in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer.
Cardiac Toxicity|Chemotherapeutic Agent Toxicity|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
BEHAVIORAL: exercise intervention
Percentage of patients enrolling in the study, day 1|Percentage of patients completing the study, 24 weeks|V02 peak before and after chemotherapy, 24 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine if patients with cancer can exercise safely and routinely, under supervision, while receiving anthracycline chemotherapy.
* To determine the magnitude of the change in the peak ventilatory oxygen uptake (VO2) before and after completion of anthracycline chemotherapy with concurrent exercise versus without exercise in patients with cancer.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

* Arm I (exercise): Patients undergo supervised aerobic exercise (walk or bicycle) 3 days a week concurrently with standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy for approximately 18-24 weeks.
* Arm II (non-exercise): Patients receive standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy for approximately 18-24 weeks.

Patients undergo peak ventilatory oxygen uptake (VO_2) by exercise bike test with gas exchange analysis at baseline and at 2 weeks after completion of anthracycline-based chemotherapy.
