UNC Metastatic Cancer Radiation Therapy Registry
The purpose of this registry is to collect clinical data from participants attending UNC Hospitals who present with metastatic cancer and are evaluated to receive radiation therapy as part of their standard of care treatment. The goal of this study is to provide a foundation for studies designed to identify projects across the translational continuum related to metastatic cancer and radiation therapy treatment. The relevant clinical data will be linked to patient-reported outcomes (PROs) thus allowing for a unique and robust dataset. Ultimately, this registry will provide current and future studies with the ability to analyze the correlation of radiation therapy regimens with metastatic cancer outcomes.
