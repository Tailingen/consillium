A Study Using Risk Factors to Determine Treatment for Children With Favorable Histology Wilms Tumors (FHWT)
This phase III trial studies using risk factors in determining treatment for children with favorable tissue (histology) Wilms tumors (FHWT). Wilms Tumor is the most common type of kidney cancer in children, and FHWT is the most common subtype. Previous large clinical trials have established treatment plans that are likely to cure most children with FHWT, however some children still have their cancer come back (called relapse) and not all survive. Previous research has identified features of FHWT that are associated with higher or lower risks of relapse. The term "risk" refers to the chance of the cancer coming back after treatment. Using results of tumor histology tests, biology tests, and response to therapy may be able to improve treatment for children with FHWT.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the impact of imaging schedule and modality (chest x-ray \[CXR\], ultrasound \[US\], versus computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging \[CT/MRI\], versus clinical symptoms) on relapse, timing of detection of relapse, burden of disease at relapse (as assessed by retrospective central imaging review), as well as impact on survival.

II. To analyze the impact of radiologically determined pulmonary tumor burden on outcomes.

III. To assess whether imaging modality (ultrasound, CT, MRI with or without hepatocyte specific contrast agent) at diagnosis is associated with detection of increased number of liver metastases, and whether modality choice impacts surgery and/or radiation planning for liver metastases.

IV. To accurately describe the responses of extrapulmonary metastases to the various therapeutic modalities (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery) through central review of institutional imaging at various stages of treatment, and to correlate institutionally interpreted radiologic response interpretations with central review.

V. To describe the association of the number of anatomically relevant and pathologically confirmed lymph nodes sampled and percent of positive lymph nodes (LNs) on EFS and overall survival \[OS\].

VI. To document the surgical and/or medical rationale and approach for biopsy (including type of biopsy, number of biopsies, and site of biopsy) for all patients who are treated with the approach of initial biopsy and delayed nephrectomy.

VII. To describe sites of recurrence for patients with liver metastases according to the surgery and/or radiation therapy administered for residual liver lesions at Week 6 and 12.

VIII. To increase the number of patients eligible to avoid lung radiation therapy (RT) by encouraging resection of residual pulmonary nodules for patients defined as Stage IV FHWT with standard biology and who have 1-3 residual pulmonary nodules on imaging after Cycle 2, by omitting lung RT for those who are found to have no viable tumor in resected nodules.

IX. To describe whether residual lung lesions at end of therapy are associated with relapse.

X. To improve the reliability of data derived from central surgical review through the implementation of a standardized operative note.

XI. To describe the treatment, perioperative morbidity and outcome of patients noted to have inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus at time of diagnosis, including surgical approach, pathology findings and specific radiation therapy received.

XII. To determine the feasibility of employing intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with central quality assurance (QA) monitoring within the prescribed time frame.

XIII. To determine the lung tumor and liver tumor control rate using intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and/or proton therapy and compare it to standard 3-dimensional radiotherapy in the current study and the AREN0533 study.

XIV. To determine the flank and abdominal tumor control rates in children with Stage IV FHWT who received abdominal radiotherapy after 2 cycles of chemotherapy in this study (delayed abdominal radiation) and compare it to AREN0533 study where abdominal radiotherapy was performed within 2 weeks of nephrectomy (upfront abdominal radiation).

XV. To compare abdominal relapse according to protocol-recommended radiotherapy fields (flank vs. whole abdominal) in the current study and compare it to the abdominal relapse according to radiotherapy fields (flank vs. whole abdominal) in the AREN0532 and AREN0533 studies.

XVI. To determine the impact of radiotherapy on local and distant control rates for EPM sites and compare them to EPM sites not receiving radiation.
