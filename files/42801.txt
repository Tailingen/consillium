A Study of The Impact of Severe Hepatic Impairment on the Pharmacokinetics and Safety of Vemurafenib in BRAF V600 Mutation-Positive Cancer Participants
This open-label, Phase I study will evaluate the impact of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics and safety of vemurafenib in participants with BRAF V600 mutation positive cancer. Participants will receive vemurafenib 960 milligrams (mg) (normal hepatic function) or 720 mg (severe hepatic impairment) orally twice daily (BID) on Days 1 to 20 (morning dose) and from Day 27 onward until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
