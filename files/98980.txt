Effect of the PIPAC on the Survival Rate of Patients With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis of Gastric Origin
Pressurised intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy is a new surgical technique, developed for the treatment of initially unresectable peritoneal carcinomatosis. The objective of this study was to compare the results of PIPAC associated with systemic chemotherapy with those of systemic chemotherapy alone in patients with gastric peritoneal carcinomatosis without metastasis other than peritoneal, and WHO performance status \<3.
