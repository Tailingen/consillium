Endoscopy for Post-operative Fistula
Endoscopic treatment of early post-operative fistula in patients with underlying esophageal or gastric cancer has now become the standard of care. However, data regarding the yield of this type of treatment is lacking. This study aims to evaluate endoscopic management of this post-operative complication. The main outcome of this prospective observational study conducted in tertiary centers in France is fistula healing defined as the absence of collection on CT scan (with opacification) in a patient on PO diet, 3 months after the end of the endoscopic treatment.
