To evaluate the efficacy and safety of B013 in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.
Platinum-resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: B013|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-free survival (PFS), From the date of randomization to the date of progression disease or death , whichever occurred first., Approximately 2 years
Objective response rate (ORR), Tumor response will be evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1., Approximately 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease., Approximately 2 years|Duration of remission (DOR), DOR was defined for participants who had an objective response as the time from the first occurrence of a documented unconfirmed response (CR or PR) to the date of disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause., Approximately 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), Determination of the overall survival times of all participants., Approximately 2 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), The incidence of adverse event (regardless of its relationship to study drug) will be classified using MedDRA and the severity of each adverse event will be graded using NCI CTCAE v5.0., Approximately 5 years
