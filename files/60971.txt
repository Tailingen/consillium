INTER-Regional COHORTE of Long Term Pancreatic Cancer Survivors
The study is particularly innovative as it will accurately analyze the microscopic characteristics of the stroma, tumor budding and mucin expression in adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, using a comparative approach of long-survivor/short-survival patients.
Pancreas Cancer|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Relationship between known prognostic histological markers of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and patient survival., Tissue analysis will be performed by conventional microscopy and will evaluate histological markers known in the literature to have a prognostic impact., at 2 years
Relationship between newly described histological markers for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and patient survival., Immunohistochemistry tissue analysis. It will allow the evaluation of newly described histological markers for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which could have a prognostic impact such as the immunophenotype of the inflammatory infiltrate, the expression of the mucins MUC1, MUC5AC, MUC4, MUC16, mesothelin, p53, Ki67 (MIB1) and markers of aggressive subtypes identified by transcriptome studies, in particular the basal-like molecular subtype., at 2 years
