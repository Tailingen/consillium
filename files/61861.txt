Attenuation of the Hemodynamic Response to Double-lumen Endotracheal Intubation With Nebulized Lidocaine
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effect of nebulized lidocaine on the hemodynamic response in the participant undergoing double-lumen endotracheal intubation.

The main question it aims to answer is to evaluate the changes in mean arterial pressure after intubation.

Participants will inhale 5ml of 2% lidocaine by nebulization15min before intubation.

Researchers will compare saline group to see if saline effects
