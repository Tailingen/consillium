Breast Cancer
DRUG: SHR-1316|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Cisplatin/Carboplatin
Overall Response Rate in the CNS, CNS ORR will be assessed by the investigator according to RANO-BM criteria. According to these criteria Complete Response (CR) will be defined as the disappearance of all CNS target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions, no corticosteroids; stable or improved clinically. Partial Response (PR) will be defined as a decrease of at least 30% in the sum longest diameter (LD) of CNS target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD, sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; no corticosteroids; stable or improved clinically., from enrollment to progression or death (for any reason), assessed up to 24 months
Clinical Benefit Rate in the CNS, CNS clinical benefit rate (CBR) will be defined as the percentage of patients who experience a CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks., from enrollment to progression or death (for any reason), assessed up to 24 months|Progression-free survival, PFS will be defined as the time from the first dose of treatment to death or disease progression., Up to 2 years|Overall survival, OS will be defined as the time from the first dose of treatment to death for any cause., Up to 2 years|First progression site, The first lesion to progress., Up to 2 years|Safety as assessed by percentage of patients with any Adverse Event, Adverse event according to NCI-CTC AE 5.0, Up to 2 years
This is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, Simon's two-stage design, phase II clinical trial in triple-negative breast cancer brain metastases patients. Subjects will receive bevacizumab，SHR1316 combined with cisplatin/carboplatin，and will be treated until disease progression, toxicity is intolerable, informed consent is withdrawn, or investigators determine that medication must be discontinued. Drug efficacy and safety data will be collected.
