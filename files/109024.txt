Short Term Surgical Outcomes of Anatomical Versus Non Anatomical Laparoscopic Liver Resection for Liver Tumors
aimed to discuss the short term surgical outcomes of Anatomical versus Non anatomical laparoscopic Liver resection for Liver tumors.
Liver Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Anatomical laparoscopic liver resection for liver neoplasms|PROCEDURE: Non-Anatomical laparoscopic liver resection for liver neoplasms
complete resection of the neoplasm, to ensure complete resection with free resection margins, 3.5 years
residual liver tissue, to evaluate the remnant liver tissue post neoplasm resection, 3.5 years|recurrence rate, 3.5 years
This study aimed to be both prospective and retrospective study including the cases of laparoscopic liver resection that was done and will be done during the period from December 2021 to June 2025. This study will include cohort of patients who met the eligible criteria.

Complete history taking with special concern to the following:

* Age, sex and life style.
* present medical history: hepatic condition and other debilitating diseases.
* Past medical History: blood transfusion, hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and history of hospital admission.

Complete local examination of the abdomen including:

* Local examination of the skin overlying for any signs of infection, radiation fibrosis and or presence of sinuses
* Percussion for presence of ascites
* Palpation for cirrhosis or any palpable masses investigations will be carried

  1. Ultrasonography: routine abdominal US for every case.
  2. Triphasic CT scan
  3. CT volumetric study to evaluate remaining liver volume when needed.
  4. Dynamic or triphasic MRI if needed
  5. Metastatic work up (CT chest, bone scan and PET scan in selected patients).
  6. Preoperative histopathological examination when needed.
  7. routine laboratory investigations
