O-RADS MRI System on Early Detection of Ovarian Cancer
This study is designed to prospectively enroll individuals with suspected or potential risk of ovarian cancer across multiple centers. The investigation will implement rational optimization of the recommended imaging sequences and interpretation protocols within the standard Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) MRI framework. By integrating comprehensive clinical parameters and histopathological correlations, we aim to validate the diagnostic efficacy and reproducibility of the optimized protocol against the standard O-RADS MRI system. The ultimate objective is to establish a refined methodology for accurately diagnosing early-stage or low-burden ovarian malignancies, thereby improving prognostic outcomes of patients with ovarian cancer.
