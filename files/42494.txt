the Beijing Randomized Study Of Prostate Cancer Screening
BROPCS is a randomized trial study comparing the effectiveness of traditional systematic biopsies and bpMRI followed targeted biopsies with PSA \> 4ng/ml in initial screening.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Target biopsies|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: systemic biopsies
detection of clinically significant prostate cancer （Gleason Score ≥7）, Cancers detected by pathological evaluation of biopsy specimen collected from the respective study arm, At 2 months after the last included biopsy procedure
detection of clinically insignificant prostate cancer （Gleason Score 3+3）, Cancers detected by pathological evaluation of biopsy specimen collected from the respective study arm, At 2 months after the last included biopsy procedure
The aim of BROPCS study is to explore a suitable prostate cancer screening model for Chinese population, which can increase the specificity in early detection of prostate cancer without decreasing the sensitivity of clinically significant prostate cancers, and can reduce prostate cancer-specific mortality.This study will use a cluster randomized controlled trial method with a total of approximately 30,000 participants. The subjects will be randomly assigned to a control group (about 20,000 people) and a screening group (about 10,000 people), and some basic information will be obtained through a questionnaire survey. The screening group will undergo initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, and high-risk subjects (PSA \> 4ng/ml) will be randomly assigned to two groups. The standard biopsy group will undergo traditional systematic biopsy, while the precision screening group will undergo further MRI examination and targeted fusion biopsy for those with positive MRI results.
