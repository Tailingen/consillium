Brentuximab Vedotin Combined With AVD Chemotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Early Stage, Unfavorable Risk Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes across the 4 different treatment groups. The investigators hope that this treatment will improve the ability to cure more patients with HL and also limit the long-term side effects from the treatment. Although eliminating radiation in cohort 4 will eliminate the risk for long-term side effects from radiation, it is also possible that with BV+AVD chemotherapy alone there may be an increased risk of the Hodgkin lymphoma coming back after initial treatment.

DRUG: Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35)|DRUG: Doxorubicin HCL|DRUG: Vinblastine Sulfate|DRUG: Dacarbazine|RADIATION: Involved-Site Radiation Therapy (ISRT)|PROCEDURE: Interim PET|RADIATION: consolidation volume RT (CVRT)
development of significant pulmonary toxicity, specifically non-infectious pneumonitis The definition of unacceptable pulmonary toxicity will be defined as the development of grade 2 or higher pneumonitis as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4)., 1 year|complete responses (all cohorts), Evaluate the rate of PET-negative complete responses after completion of the treatment program (8 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) after completion of radiotherapy)., 1 year
Evaluate the prognostic significance, (i.e. correlation with progression free survival) of interim fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET) in this patient population measured by visual analysis and semi-quantitative analysis., 1 year
