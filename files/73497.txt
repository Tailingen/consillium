Recurrent Ovarian CarcinoSarcoma Anti-pd-1 Niraparib
Carcinosarcomas (CS) (malignant mixed Müllerian tumors) are highly aggressive and rare tumors with a worldwide annual incidence between 0.5-3.3 cases/100.000 women. Gynecological CS, i.e. ovarian CS (OCS) and uterine CS (UCS), have a 5-year overall survival (OS) \< 10% and a poor prognosis. After initial treatment (surgery +/- adjuvant radiotherapies +/- chemotherapies (CT)), vast majority of patients relapsed and received diverse CT producing modest benefits, and nearly all patients will die. After first line CT including platinum salt, monotherapy (doxorubicin or paclitaxel) is frequently used for relapsed patients, but the response rate (RR) is \<20%, progression-free survival (PFS) \<4 months, and OS \<1 year. In this unmet need situation, a better knowledge of these aggressive neoplasms is essential to propose new therapeutic options.

Response Rate (RR) at 4 months, RR is defined as the proportion of patients with a partial response or complete response 4 months after randomization, 4 months after the last patient included|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of the randomization until death due to any cause, 1 year after the last patient included
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is the time from randomization to the date of event defined as the first documented progression (RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause., 1 year after the last patient included|Time To Subsequent Treatment (TTST), TTST is the time from the date of randomization to the earliest date of anti-cancer therapy start following study treatment discontinuation, or death by any cause in the absence of start of new anti-cancer therapy, 1 year after the last patient included|Progression-Free Survival 2 (PFS2), PFS2 is the time from the date of randomization to the second objective disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 1 year after the last patient included|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of patients with a best response of Complete Response or Partial Response., 1 year after the last patient included|Adverse events, Assessed by CTCAE 5.0, 1 year after the last patient included|Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), Assessed with questionnaires to be completed by patient and collected frequently during the study, 1 year after the last patient included
