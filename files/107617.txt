Multidimensional Rehabilitation Intervention in Colorectal Cancer Survivors
A metaverse-based multidimensional rehabilitation program will be implemented for colorectal cancer survivors who have undergone curative surgery and adjuvant therapy. The intervention is based on the behavior change wheel and includes dietary intervention, exercise intervention, psychological support, and behavior management. Through various methods such as training, education, and motivation, the program aims to enhance the patients' functional ability, opportunities, and motivation, thereby promoting healthy behavior. Outcome measures include quality of life, fear of recurrence, and adoption of a healthy lifestyle.
