The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Patients with Solid Malignancies: a Single-Institution Survey Study
The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent government-imposed restrictions have undeniably resulted in unprecedented changes to the life of patients with cancer. It has become more evident that patients with cancer may be at significant risk of higher morbidity and mortality when infected with SARS-CoV-2, which is understandably causing anxiety amongst both patients and their oncology team.

This project is a single centre, non-interventional observational prospective cohort study; which aims to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and general wellbeing of patients diagnosed with solid malignancies by utilising a range of non-invasive questionnaires (GAD-7, PHQ-9, PC-PTSD-5, WHO-5 and Wellbeing thermometer). Data on patient demographics, treatment and medical history, and medical resource utilization will be obtained through a medical chart review at enrolment for up to 4 months. Participants will be asked to complete five questionnaires regarding their mental health and wellbeing status during their routine clinic visits, but no other additional tests or procedures will be undertaken for the study outside of their routine care.

It is essential to understand both the short and long term psychological consequences of COVID-19 on cancer patients to better inform the institute and other regional and national stakeholders of the scale of the issue, in order to recommend necessary measures and resources required to address this important issue.
