Targeting CD19/CD20/CD22 Triple-targeted Cell in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
A phase I, open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LCAR-AIO, a triple-targeted cell preparation targeting CD19/CD20/CD22, in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma.

Incidence, severity and type of TEAEs (Treatment-emergent Adverse Events), An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)|Pharmacokinetics in peripheral blood, CAR positive T cells and CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood after LCAR-AIO infusion., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)|Pharmacokinetics in bone marrow, CAR positive T cells and CAR transgene levels in bone marrow after LCAR-AIO infusion., Minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)|The recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for this cell therapy, RP2D established through ATD+BOIN design and the DLTs occurring following CAR T-cell infusion, 30 days after LCAR-AIO infusion
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or PR after treatment via LCAR-AIO cell infusion, Through study completion, minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of the LCAR-AIO to the first documented disease progression (according to Lugano 2014) or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, Through study completion, minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LCAR-AIO to death of the subject, Through study completion, minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)|Time to Response (TTR), Time to Response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of LCAR-AIO to the date of the first response evaluation of the subject who has met all criteria for CR or PR., Through study completion, minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Remission (DoR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of remission (CR or PR) to the first documented relapse evidence of the responders, Through study completion, minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)|Immunogenicity assessment of LCAR-AIO cells, The incidence of Anti-LCAR-AIO antibody in patients who received LCAR-AIO cells infusion, Through study completion, minimum 2 years after LCAR-AIO infusion (Day 1)
This is an open-label, dose-escalation/dose extension study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LCAR-AIO in the patient â‰¥ 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphoma. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of LCAR-AIO injection. The study will include the following sequential phases: screening, pre-treatment (cell product preparation; lymphodepleting chemotherapy), treatment, and follow-up.
