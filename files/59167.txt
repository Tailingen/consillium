Triple Negative Breast Cancer and Germline Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Mutation Carrier Registry
PROGECT is a registry for patients with Triple Negative breast cancer (TNBC) or patients who have an identified germline mutations (such as a mutation on the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes).
Breast Cancer|Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer
Prevalence of germline mutations (such as BRCA1/2 mutations) in patients with TNBC, 5 years|. Predictors of response to neo/adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with TNBC, 5 years|Long term Disease free and overall survival rates in TNBC patients treated with different systemic therapies, 10 years
This study is being done to collect cancer-related information from patients with triple negative breast cancer and patients with hereditary genetic mutations. This information will help us better understand the link between genetic changes and cancer outcome in patients with triple negative breast cancer.
