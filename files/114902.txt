Study of Abiraterone Acetate in Subjects With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
Abiraterone acetate is an orally effective CYP17 inhibitor, which is metabolized into abiraterone in the body, and its inhibitory activity against CYP17 is 10-30 times that of ketoconazole. Clinical studies have shown that abiraterone acetate can significantly reduce the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in PCa patients, and help to reduce tumors, extending the lifespan of patients with advanced PCa for several years, and the toxicity is acceptable.
Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Abiraterone Acetate|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Prednisone
Time to PSA progression (TTPP）, The time interval between the administration of the drug and the progression of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA)., Baseline up to 24 months
Prostate specific antigen remission time, It was ≥50% lower than the baseline, and was confirmed as remission after re-testing after ≥4 weeks., Baseline up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of participants with a best overall response defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Baseline up to 24 months|Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), The ECOG scoring standard is an indicator of the general health status and tolerance to treatment from the patient's physical strength. ECOG physical status score standard from 0 to 5. Starting with the dose until the score increases from the baseline., Baseline up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause., Baseline up to 24 months|To pain progression time, Time from the start of medication to the progression of pain., Baseline up to 24 months|Quality of life assessment scale (FACT-P), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Prostate Cancer (FACT-P) total score, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) total score, trial outcome index, functional well-being, physical well-being, prostate cancer subscale, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Advanced Prostate Symptom Index-6 (FAPSI-6)., Baseline up to 24 months|Prostate specific antigen remission rate, The remission rate was defined as the proportion of remissions to the total number of people., Baseline up to 24 months
