Nonclinical studies have indicated that tivantinib (parent molecule) has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4 (\[I\]/Ki=0.15, midazolam as substrate), CYP2C19 (\[I\]/Ki=0.98), CYP2C9 (\[I\]/Ki=0.44), and CYP1A (\[I\]/Ki=0.37), and the efflux transporter P glycoprotein (P-gp) (I2/IC50=82) at the clinical concentrations being studied in the Phase 3 development program. In addition, tivantinib has major circulating plasma metabolite(s) which also have been shown in nonclinical studies to exhibit similar CYP inhibition potential. The results of this study will evaluate the potential of tivantinib to influence the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4/CYP2C19/CYP2C9/CYP1A and/or P-gp substrates, and help to provide the guidance to clinicians on co-administration of tivantinib with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4/CYP2C19/CYP2C9/ CYP1A and/or transported by P-gp.
