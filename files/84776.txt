Reduced Radiation in Patients With Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This study will evaluate whether a reduction in the radiation dose and field size will maintain a high rate of local control while minimizing the risk of acute and late toxicity.

Hypothesis- The radiation dose and treatment volume can be safely reduced from 30 Gy to 20 Gy while maintaining high rates of local control in patients who had a negative PET scan following rituximab-containing chemotherapy.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Number of Participants With Local Control, This trial will accrue 62 patients over a time period of approximately 5-6 years. The primary objective is to determine whether the number of participants with local control at 5 years, estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve of time-to-local failure, is as high as that observed in historical controls, i.e., 0.90., 5 years
Percentage of Participants With Progression-free Survival at 5 Years, Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from on-study to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first., 5 years|Percentage of Participants With Overall Survival, Overall survival will be defined as the number of participants who are alive, 5 years|Number of Participants With Local, Distant, or Local+Distant Failure, To examine the patterns of failure, we will tabulate the various ways that patients failed up until the time of the analysis. For example, these ways will include local only, local + distant, and distant only., 5 years
