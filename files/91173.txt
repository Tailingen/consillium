Software Monitoring of Treatment Related Toxicities in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
To determine if Carevive software, which monitors treatment-related toxicities and then generates self-care management plans for these symptoms, will be feasible to implement among patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Additionally for collection of preliminary data on treatment-related toxicities, quality of life, distress level, and drug adherence.

OTHER: Carevive software
Carevive Survey Usage Rates, Carevive software will track subject compliance with survey logins and whether they access the generated care plans. The percentage of times logged in out of the number of study recommended logins will be tabulated. Also, the percentage of times a careplan was accessed out of the number of times it was offered will be determined.

* To determine the practicality of the intervention, by analyzing the reasons why subjects fail to self-report treatment-related toxicities or utilize software generated care plans after enrollment.
* To assess the acceptability of this intervention with validated patient reported usability scores of the software.
* To determine potential implementation obstacles of the intervention, by assessing the reasons eligible study candidates decline participation., 48 weeks|Reasons Participants Do Not Complete Survey or Utilize Care Plans, After missing a survey, subjects will be asked the reason at their following login. The reason provided will be sorted into pre-specified categories and presented as a percentage., 48 weeks|Average Usability Score Using the Software Usability Scoring System, At the 48 week time point or at the point of subject withdrawal from study, they will be asked to take the System Usability Scale. The survey provides us with a score of between 0 and 40 which is then multiplied by 2.5 to convert to a scale of 0 to 100. A SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average., 48 weeks|Reasons for Declining Study Participation, If a subject declines to participation in the study, he/she will be asked to provide a reason for declination. If willing, we will have them sign a separate consent with a space to write in their reason. The reason provided will be sorted into pre-specified categories and presented as a percentage., 48 weeks
Patient Reported Toxicities Using PRO-CTCAE Questions, Patient reported toxicity data will be collected via Carevive surveys weekly for the first 12 weeks and then every other week for another 36 weeks. We will not deliver the PRO-CTCAE in its entirety but will specifically ask about the following common toxicities that are experienced with oral targeted therapy and immunotherapy: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hand/foot syndrome, rash, abdominal pain, anorexia, mouth sores, cough and shortness of breath., 48 weeks|Clinician Reported Toxicities Using CTCAE, Toxicities will also be formally assessed in-office every 3-4 months using CTCAE scoring. The categories chosen are common toxicities that occur with oral targeted therapy and immunotherapy: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hand/foot syndrome, rash, abdominal pain, appetite, mouth sores, cough and shortness of breath, 48 weeks|Quality of Life Determination Using the FKSI-DRS Survey, Subjects will be asked to fill out the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI-DRS) at baseline and approximately every 3 months in-office., 48 weeks|Distress Level Using the NCCN Distress Thermometer, The subject will be asked to rate their distress level in-office using the NCCN Distress Thermometer, which is a 1 to 10 numerical scale. This will be delivered during routine office visits approximately every 3 months on a tablet., 48 weeks|â€¢ Health Care Utilization Assessment By Quantification of Health Care Visits or Hospitalizations, Health care utilization will be self-reported by the subject through CareVive software monthly, in addition at the end of the study or at time of withdrawal, a search of the electronic medical record will be performed to determine the number of calls made to oncology care providers and the number of visits to the oncologist during the study period., 48 weeks
