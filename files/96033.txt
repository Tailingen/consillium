Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Interferon-α Combined With ATO in the Treatment of Arsenic-resistant APL
This study was a single-arm, open study. After the screening period, arsenic-resistant APL patients were treated with interferon α-2b, arsenic and venetoclax. The efficacy (ORR) and safety were evaluated.
Tumour
DRUG: interferon α-2b
ORR, Efficacy: objective remission rate, 4 to 6 weeks
Adverse Events, Safety: the incidence and severity of adverse events were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, version 5.0)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|DFS, disease free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 year|OS, overall survival, From date of randomization until the date of date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years
Eligible APL patients with arsenic-resistant relapse will enter the run-in period, and the subjects in the run-in phase will be treated with arsenic combined with venetoclax. After the run-in period, the patients were treated with interferon α-2b, arsenic trioxide for injection and venetoclax until the outcome of CR/PR/PD/ death/withdrawal/loss to follow-up occurred. Tumor assessments were performed every 4 to 6 weeks (as determined by the investigator) during trial treatment. Those who achieved CR/PR/PD/ withdrawal were then returned to standard treatment (treatment regimen was determined by the clinician), and those who completed the combination treatment period of the trial entered the survival follow-up period.
