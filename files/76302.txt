BCMA/CD3 BsAb in the Treatment of High-risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CM-336, which is a BCMA/CD3 BiTE, in the treatment of high risk smoldering multiple myeloma.

High-risk SMM has a high risk of transforming to MM, and there is no unified treatment plan in clinical practice at present. Studies have proved that early treatment can help prevent end organ damage caused by disease progression and improve patient prognosis. The treatment of high-risk SMM needs to be further explored. BCMA/CD3 BITE in the treatment of RRMM shows a high remission rate and low toxicity and side effects, and it is expected to become a potential treatment choice for high-risk SMM patients
