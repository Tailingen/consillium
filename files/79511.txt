Study of the Fixation of Various Vectors in PET/CT in Patients With a With Lung Cancer Before and During of CRT or RT
Study of the modification of the fixation(binding) of Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), fluoro-misonidazole (FMISO) and 3'deoxy-3-fluoro-thymidine deoxy-3-fluoro-thymidine (FLT) measured in tomography by broadcast(emission,issue) of positrons (PET) at patients before and in the course of exclusive radiotherapy or concomitant radiochemotherapy for primitive bronchial cancer.

This protocle allows to study the simultaneous variations of the metabolism, the hypoxie and the cellular proliferation by PET SCAN at 5 patients reached(affected) by a primitive bronchial cancer in the course of exclusive radiotherapy for primitive bronchial cancer not small cell lung.

The investigators are also going to study several scenarii of optimization of the radiotherapy according to the variations of the tumoral metabolism, the hypoxie and the cellular proliferation measured in the course of radiotherapy (theoretical study on console using the scanner and the various examinations).
