A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Phase II Trial of Iparomlimab and Tuvonralimab (QL1706) Combined with SOX Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone in the Treatment of Locally Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
To explore the efficacy of Iparomlimab and Tuvonralimab (QL1706) in combination with SOX chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for the neoadjuvant treatment of locally-progressed gastric/gastroesophageal union adenocarcinomas by evaluating the complete pathologic remission rate (pCR).
Locally Advanced Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Neoadjuvant Therapy(QL1706+SOX Chemotherapy)|DRUG: Neoadjuvant Therapy(SOX Chemotherapy)|PROCEDURE: Radical surgery (D2)|DRUG: Drug: Adjuvant therapy(QL1706+SOX chemotherapy)|DRUG: Drug: Adjuvant therapy(SOX chemotherapy)
Pathological complete response rate (pCR), Pathological complete response was defined as pT0N0M0, From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of postoperative pathological assessment, assessed up to 14-16 weeks.
Major pathological response rate (MPR), The percentage of surviving tumor cells in the tumor bed after neoadjuvant therapy was ≤10%., From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of postoperative pathological assessment, assessed up to 14-16 weeks.|R0 resection rate, The proportion of patients who completed R0 resection in the total enrolled patients., From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of postoperative pathological assessment, assessed up to 14-16 weeks.|Event-free survival (EFS), From the beginning of the study to the time of the first occurrence of any of the following events, disease progression beyond surgical treatment, local or distant recurrence, death from any cause, etc., From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of the first occurrence of the above events, assessed up to 60 months.|Overall survival (OS), From study inception to patient death from any cause., From the date of diagnosis to the date of death, assessed up to 60 months.|Disease-free survival (DFS), The time from randomization until disease recurrence or death due to disease progression., From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of the disease recurrence or death due to disease progression, assessed up to 60 months.|Surgical safety, The occurrence of postoperative complications including surgical site infection, anastomotic leakage, gastrointestinal bleeding, incisional dehiscence, adhesive bowel obstruction, biliary and celiac fistulae, and unexplained fever (≥37.5°C)., From date of neoadjuvant therapy until the date of 30 days post-surgery, assessed up to 17-19 weeks.|Adverse Events, Based on NCI-CTCAE (version 5.0) adverse events (AEs): including type, incidence, grading, severity, duration, and relevance to the study drug, From the date of neoadjuvant therapy to the completion of postoperative adjuvant therapy, up to 24 months.|Drug tolerance, The proportion of dose interruptions, dose reductions, and discontinuations due to drug-related toxicity during the study period., From the date of neoadjuvant therapy to the completion of postoperative adjuvant therapy, up to 24-28 weeks.|Prognostic Biomarkers, Biomarkers of interest include PD-L1 expression (assessed by IHC), microsatellite instability (MSI) status (determined by PCR-based testing), tumor mutation burden (TMB) (evaluated using next-generation sequencing), and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels (quantified via liquid biopsy). The correlation between these biomarkers and treatment efficacy, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), will be analyzed., From the date of neoadjuvant therapy initiation until the end of postoperative follow-up, up to 24 months.
