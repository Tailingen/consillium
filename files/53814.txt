Biomarkers in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

Association between clonally expanded somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations and acute myeloid leukemia
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine whether clonally expanded somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations are associated with acute myeloid leukemia.

OUTLINE: Genomic DNA from blood samples obtained at diagnosis, remission, and relapse are analyzed for mitochondrial DNA mutations via PCR.
