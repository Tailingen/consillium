Second-Look Ultrasound Post Contrast-Enhanced Mammography for Additional Lesions Characterization
This study investigates the utility of second-look ultrasound (US) following contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) to characterize additional lesions detected during routine breast imaging.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: CEM protocol
Detection Rate of Additional Lesions on CEM, This measure evaluates the number of additional lesions identified on Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM) that require further assessment through second-look ultrasound or biopsy., Within 12 months of imaging assessment.
Concordance Between Imaging Findings and Histopathology, This measure assesses the percentage of biopsied lesions in which imaging findings (from CEM and SLUS) correlate with the histopathological results, Up to 3 months post-biopsy.|Concordance Between Imaging Findings and Follow-Up Imaging, This measure evaluates the percentage of lesions that remain stable or resolve in follow-up imaging, confirming or refuting the initial CEM and ultrasound findings., 6-12 months after the initial CEM examination
The goal is to assess the diagnostic accuracy and clinical value of combining CEM with targeted ultrasound to improve lesion characterization and guide biopsy decisions.
