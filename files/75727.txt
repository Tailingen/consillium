An Observational Study of Continued Bevacizumab Plus Chemotherapy Until First Progression in Participants With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRC)
This prospective, multicenter, observational study will investigate the effectiveness and safety of bevacizumab in routine clinical practice in participants with metastatic CRC. Participants are to have initiated first-line treatment with fluoropyrimidine-based doublet chemotherapy plus bevacizumab according to the bevacizumab Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).
