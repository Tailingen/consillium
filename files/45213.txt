Neoadjuvant Nivolumab+Ipilimumab Followed by Adjuvant Nivolumab or Neoadjuvant Nivolumab+Ipilimumab Followed by Adjuvant Observation Compared With Adjuvant Nivolumab in Treatment-Naive High-risk Melanoma Participants
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and to demonstrate high pathologic complete response (pCR) and near pCR rates in melanoma participants with clinically detectable nodal disease and a high risk of recurrence. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy aims to enhance the systemic T-cell response to tumor antigens while detectable tumor is still present, inducing a stronger and broader tumor-specific immune response. Of the neoadjuvant approaches studied within melanoma, the neoadjuvant combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab has demonstrated high pCR and near pCR rates that may translate to prolonged clinical benefit.
