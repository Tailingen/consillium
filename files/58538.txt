Phase 1 Study of Vorinostat and Bortezomib in Multiple Myeloma (MK-0683-015 EXT 1 (AM1))
The purposes of this study are:

* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of oral vorinostat and bortezomib in participants with advanced multiple myeloma
* To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen and to document the participant's clinical status (by anti-tumor activity) for this combination, as determined per standard of care.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: vorinostat|DRUG: bortezomib
Mean Duration of Treatment With Vorinostat, Event causing discontinuation from the study was defined as (1) progressive disease OR (2) intolerable toxicity.

Progressive disease was defined as:

* \>25% increase in the level of serum monoclonal paraprotein.
* 25% increase in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion.
* \>25% increase in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate or on trephine

biopsy.

* Development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas.
* Development of hypercalcemia.

Intolerable toxicity was based on the clinical judgment of the investigator., Day 1 to an event causing discontinuation from the study, assessed up to 29 months
Number of Participants With Dose Modifications of Either Vorinostat or Bortezomib Due to Adverse Experiences (AEs) After Treatment With Study Drug, An adverse experience (AE) was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, was also an adverse experience., Day 1 to disease progression, toxicity, or death, assessed up to 29 months|Mean Time to First AE Resulting in a Dose Modification in Either Vorinostat or Bortezomib, An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which was temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, was also an adverse experience., Day 1 to disease progression, toxicity, or death, assessed up to 29 months|Clinical AE Summary, An AE was defined as any unfavorable/unintended change in the structure/function/chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of study drug, or any worsening of a preexisting condition.

A serious AE (SAE) was any AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, resulted in or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was a new cancer, or was an overdose., Day 1 up to disease progression, toxicity, or death, assessed up to 30 days after end of treatment (up to 30 months)|Laboratory AE Summary, An AE was defined as any unfavorable/unintended change in the structure/function/chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of study drug, or any worsening of a preexisting condition.

A SAE was any AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, resulted in or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was a new cancer, or was an overdose.

A lab (S)AE was any lab value considered clinically significant in the investigator's judgment., Day 1 up to disease progression, toxicity, or death, assessed up to 29 months
