WTX-330 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
A first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of WTX-330 administered as a monotherapy to patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

DRUG: WTX-330
Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), 4 weeks|Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, 24 months|Incidence of changes in clinical laboratory abnormalities, 24 months|Investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1 and immune ORR by iRECIST (for solid tumors) or response by Lugano criteria (for lymphomas), 24 months
Plasma concentrations of WTX-330 and free IL-12, 24 months|Changes in circulating immune cell populations, 24 months|Changes in soluble cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-Î³ and IP-10, 24 months|Changes in tumor immune cell profile by immunohistochemistry (IHC), 24 months|Investigator-assessed ORR by RECIST 1.1 and immune ORR by iRECIST (for solid tumors) or response by Lugano criteria (for lymphomas) in patients who have progressed on CPIs or who have tumor indications for which CPIs are not approved, 24 months|Antidrug antibody (ADA) occurrence, 24 months|Duration of response, 24 months|Progression free survival, 24 months|Overall survival, 36 months|Identification of potential biomarkers of target engagement and immune pathway activation in tumor biopsies, 24 months
This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of WTX-330, a conditionally-activated IL-12 prodrug, when administered as a monotherapy to patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Dose escalation will be conducted in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors who are refractory to all standard of care therapies. Dose expansion will be conducted in two arms: Arm A will enroll patients with indications for which a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) is indicated/approved who demonstrate primary or secondary resistance to an anti-PD(L)1 treatment regimen, and Arm B will enroll patients with tumor types for which CPI therapy is not indicated/approved.
