Study of Dose-dense Adriamycin Plus Cytoxan (AC) Followed by Either ABI-007 (Abraxane) or Taxol With Bevacizumab as Adjuvant Therapy for Patients With Breast Cancer
The primary objective of this study was to compare the safety of dose-dense ABI-007 (Abraxane) 260 mg/m\^2 or Taxol 175 mg/m\^2 given every 2 weeks following dose-dense Adriamycin plus Cytoxan (AC) chemotherapy. Bevacizumab was administered at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks throughout chemotherapy, and then at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks following chemotherapy.

Participants With Treatment-Emergent Toxicities With a Frequency >=20% at 3 Months Post Chemotherapy, Toxicities are summarized using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) terms. Participants with treatment-emergent toxicities with a frequency of \>=20% in any treatment arm, and participants with at least one toxicity are reported.

Taxane subsets (ABI-007 subset and Taxol subset treatment arms) summarize participants with treatment-emergent toxicities defined as any AEs that begin or worsen in severity grade after the start of taxane treatment (cycle 5, week 9) through 30 days after the last dose of taxane (week 20) and were ongoing 3 months after chemotherapy (month 7).

Entire regiments (AC --\> ABI-007 and AC --\> Taxol treatment arms) summarize participants with treatment-emergent toxicities defined as any AEs that begin or worsen in severity grade after the start of chemotherapy (cycle 1, week 1) through 30 days after the last dose of chemotherapy (week 20) and were ongoing 3 months after chemotherapy (month 7)., Month 7|Participants With Treatment-Emergent Toxicities With a Frequency >=20% at 6 Months Post Chemotherapy, Toxicities are summarized using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) terms. Participants with treatment-emergent toxicities with a frequency of \>=20% in any treatment arm, and participants with at least one toxicity are reported.

The Cumulative Dose of Taxane Delivered During Study, The cumulative dose of taxane (Taxol or ABI-007) taken during the study (cycles 4-8 which is approximately weeks 9-16)., approximately week 9-16|Mean Taxane Dose Intensity Per Week, Cumulative taxane (ABI-007 or Taxol) dose divided by the number of weeks on taxane treatment., approximately week 9-16|Percent of Protocol Taxane Dose, Percent of the protocol-defined taxane (ABI-007 or Taxol) dose that was actually taken by study participants., approximately week 9-16|Summary of Participant Treatment Exposure, Dose Interruptions, Dose Reductions, and Dose Delays, Counts of participants who

* completed the protocol-defined treatment cycles,
* had a dose interruption
* had a dose reduction
* had a dose delay. A dose delay refers to the delay of all interventions in the cycle.

Dose modifications are typically caused by clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and /or treatment emergent adverse events/toxicities.

Use of pegfilgrastim is included in the summary., up to Week 46|Myelosuppression During Taxane Dosing Cycles, Myelosuppression represented by neutropenia (low absolute neutrophil counts (ANC)) with severity grades according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE).

* Grade 1 = \<lower limit of normal (LLN)-1.5\*10\^9/L
* Grade 2 = \<1.5 - 1.0\*10\^9/L
* Grade 3 = \<1.0 - 0.5\*10\^9/L
* Grade 4 = \<0.5\*10\^9/L

Values are reported across all severity grades without assessment of relationship to taxane treatment, and also by relation to taxane treatment as reported by investigators., Weeks 9-16|Change From Baseline in Percent Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (% LVEF) at the Final Evaluation, Decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is an indication of cardiotoxicity. Change from baseline measurements to the final evaluation are summarized., up to week 46|Summary of Participants' Most Severe Grade for Liver and Renal Function Laboratory Adverse Experiences During Study (All Treatment Cycles), Summary of the most severe grades using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) for the following liver and renal function tests.

Grade 0 = within normal range for all measurements.

Alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST):

* Grade 1 = \> upper limit of normal (ULN) - 2.5\*ULN
* Grade 2= \>2.5-5.0\*ULN
* Grade 3= \>5.0-20.0\*ULN
* Grade 4= \>20.0\*ULN

Bilirubin:

* Grade 1= \>ULN - 1.5\*ULN
* Grade 3= \>3.0 - 10.0\*ULN

Creatinine:

- Grade 1= \>ULN - 1.5\*ULN, Week 1 up to week 50
