COVID19-Convalescent Plasma for Treating Patients With Active Symptomatic COVID 19 Infection (FALP-COVID)
COVID-19 infection has spread worldwide causing several deaths in few months Convalescent Plasma from COVID 19 donors has shown huge activity in small series from Chinese patients and currently many centers from USA and the European Union are assessing its use looking to avoid mortality and prolonged hospitalizations COVID-19-related

This is a collaborative, 4 arms , non randomized clinical trial assessing the use of Convalescent Plasma from COVID-19 recovered donors to be used in oncological and non-oncological patients with current severe COVID-19 infection or in patients with risk factors of major complications secondary to COVID-19 infection
