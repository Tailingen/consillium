Study of H3B-6545 in Japanese Women With Estrogen Receptor (ER)-Positive, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of study is to determine tolerability and safety profile of H3B-6545 in Japanese women with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, and also to confirm the dose applicability to Japanese.

Up and about more than 50% of waking hours; Grade 3: Capable of only limited selfcare, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours; Grade 4: Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any selfcare. Totally confined to bed or chair; Grade 5: Dead., Baseline up to 36 months
