Ifosfamide/Carboplatin/Etoposide/Rituxan Followed by Zevalin in Relapsed/Refractory Intermediate Grade B-Cell Lymphoma
In this Multicenter trial, we will evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of treatment with 90Y Zevalin following a short course of salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory intermediate grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

complete response rate
progression-free survival|overall survival
Upon determination of eligibility, patients will receive:

* Ifosfamide + Carboplatin + Etoposide + Rituximab

Patients showing no response to this combination regimen will receive 90Y Zevalin after two cycles or when progression is clearly documented. In responding patients, four cycles will be administered, followed by 90Y Zevalin.
