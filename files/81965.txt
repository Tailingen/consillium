Docetaxel/Carboplatin Versus Docetaxel/Caelyx in Pretreated Patients With Ovarian Carcinoma
This trial will compare the efficacy of docetaxel/carboplatin versus docetaxel/liposomal doxorubicin in pretreated patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma and treatment free-interval of at least six months
Ovarian Cancer

The second-line treatment in advanced ovarian cancer has been proved effective in prolonging overall survival and improving quality of life. In patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (relapsed disease after 6 months from the end of first line chemotherapy) the combination of paclitaxel/carboplatin is considered the standard treatment. Generally, the combination platinum-based chemotherapy may well be associated with a survival benefit in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. Carboplatin, pegylated doxorubicin (caelyx) docetaxel, have been approved for second-line treatment of ovarian carcinoma and seem to be active in platinum-sensitive disease.
