Unesbulin in Women With Ovarian Cancer Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
This is an open-label Phase Ib dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Unesbulin when combined with and following conventional chemotherapy and as maintenance therapy as a capsule (weight based dosing) and a tablet (fixed dosing) in women with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer which is previously untreated.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Unesbulin
Maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of Unesbulin in combination with and following conventional chemotherapy and as maintenance as a capsule (weight-based dosing) and a tablet (fixed dosing). Standard chemotherapy will be comprised of carboplatin and weekly paclitaxel. The DLTs will be based on adverse events that occur during administration of the first 2 cycles of combination Unesbulin and chemotherapy (a cycle = 21 days)., 42 days|Number of patients able to tolerate drug combination, To examine the tolerability of the combination at the MTD of Unesbulinassessed in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy., 3 years|Phase 2 Dose, To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of Unesbulin in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy., 3 years

For all cohorts, the study drug Unesbulin will be orally administered prior to chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin), twice a week of each 21-day cycle. Chemotherapy will be administered on day 1 of each cycle by vein. Dose escalation levels for Unesbulin will occur per protocol and doses may be de-escalated for management of toxicity. Patients will receive a total of 3 cycles of Unesbulin and chemotherapy. Surgery will be performed within 6 weeks after the last dose of Cycle 3. An additional 3-7 cycles of Unesbulin and chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) may be given as maintenance therapy for up to two years at the discretion of the treating physician.
