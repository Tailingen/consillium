Strides for Life I: Increasing Physical Activity in Stage 1 Lung Cancer Patients
This randomized controlled trial will evaluate, among 54 stage early stage lung cancer patients, whether a behavioral intervention versus an educational Control group results in improved function at 6-months.
Lung Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Physical activity plus positive affect|BEHAVIORAL: Physical activity plus education
Kilocalories/week assessed by 6-minute walk test, 1 month to 6 months
Forced expiratory volume (FEV1), Pulmonary function test, 1 month to 6 months|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Lung (FACT-L14), Disease-specific quality of life, 1 month to 6 months|Activity expenditure (assessed by the Fit Bit Zip accelerometer), 1 month to 6 months|Maximal Oxygen Consumption (VO2 max), Pulmonary function test, 1 month to 6 months
This is a two arm randomized controlled trial that will evaluate, among 54 stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer patients, whether induction of positive affect vs. an educational Control group, results in improved function as assessed by the 6-minute Walk Test. Our primary outcome will be a within-patient change in the 6-Minute Walk Test at 6 months.
