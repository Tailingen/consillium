CAPOX, Bevacizumab and Trastuzumab for Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic Esophagogastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a combination of chemotherapy, capecitabine and oxaliplatin, plus the antibodies bevacizumab and trastuzumab. Trastuzumab (also called Herceptin) is an antibody that attacks HER2 protein in tumor cells. Bevacizumab (also called Avastin) works by slowing or stopping the growth of cells in cancer tumors by decreasing the blood supply of the tumors. If blood supply is decreased, oxygen and nutrients that are needed for tumor growth are decreased. The chemotherapy used in this trial is called CAPOX, which is an abbreviation of capecitabine and oxaliplatin.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) on treatment based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions., Patients received a median of 19 cycles of therapy (Interquartile range (IQR): 8 - 34.5 cycles). Median duration of follow-up of 23.2 months (IQR: 11.0 - 46.9 months ).
Median Overall Survival, Overall survival based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from randomization to death. Participants alive are censored at the last date of contact (including lost-to-follow-up) or at the date of withdrawal of consent, if relevant., 23.2 months (IQR: 11.0 - 46.9 months ).|Median Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from date of first documented confirmed objective response to date of first documented progressive disease (PD). Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least 5 mm absolute increase. For non-target lesions, progression-free means no new lesions or unequivocal progression on existing non-target lesions or not evaluated., 23.2 months (IQR: 11.0 - 46.9 months ).|Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) requiring removal from the study or death. Participants alive without PD were censored at the earliest of the date of the last disease evaluation or start of new anticancer therapy. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least 5 mm absolute increase. For non-target lesions, progression-free means no new lesions or unequivocal progression on existing non-target lesions or not evaluated., Patients received a median of 19 cycles of therapy (Interquartile range (IQR): 8 - 34.5 cycles). Median duration of follow up of 23.2 months (IQR: 11.0 - 46.9 months ).
* We recommend that the participants have a vascular access device, more commonly known as a PORT, inserted prior to starting chemotherapy. A port is a small device that is inserted under the skin (usually near the collar bone) by a minor surgical procedure and is then connected to one of the large veins inside the chest. The port will be used to give the intravenous medications.
* During the first cycle, the participant will receive trastuzumab intravenously on Day 1. Cycle 2 will then start one week later. On this day, bevacizumab will be given intravenously first followed by trastuzumab and then oxaliplatin. The participant will then start taking capecitabine tablets orally twice a day for 14 days. Each treatment cycle is 21 days long.
* Participants will have the following tests and procedures at specific time points during study treatment; physical exam, blood tests, CT scan, MUGA scan or echocardiogram, and urine test.
