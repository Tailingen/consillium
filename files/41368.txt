Study of Preoperative Therapy With Pazopanib (Votrient®) to Treat High-risk Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The purpose of this study is to examine if a short-term treatment with pazopanib, an oral drug inhibiting the growth of blood vessel, can reduce the metabolism of soft-tissue sarcomas and thus facilitate their resection when given prior to surgery. Moreover, the study assesses the prognostic and predictive value of several new biomarkers (endothelial progenitor cells, soluble vascular epithelial growth factor),
Sarcoma, Soft-tissue
DRUG: pazopanib
Metabolic response rate, Metabolic response rate is defined as the proportion of patients achieving a metabolic response, i.e. a 50% reduction of the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) in the post-treatment compared to the pre-treatment FDG-PET-CT, day 22-28 (time of post-treatment PET-CT)
