Gemcitabine Hydrochloride, Cisplatin, Nab-Paclitaxel, and Durvalumab in Treating Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Gallbladder Cancer
This phase II trail will evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining gemcitabine hydrochloride, cisplatin, nab-paclitaxel (paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation), with durvalumab in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic gallbladder cancer.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Durvalumab is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody, which selectively blocks PD-L1 binding to PD-1. This anti-PD-L1 treatment works by allowing the immune system to detect your cancer and reactivates the immune response.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), Disease assessments based on investigator assessments were determined by using RECIST version 1.1 guidelines. The ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR). The CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. The PR was defined as ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new non-target lesion. A confirmed CR or PR was defined as 2 CRs or 2 PRs with no evidence of progression in-between. Patients who discontinued randomized treatment without progression, received a subsequent anti-cancer therapy and then responded were not included as responders for ORR., Tumor assessments (per RECIST 1.1) every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks relative to the date of randomization and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Assessed up to maximum of approximately 36 months.
Progressive-free survival (PFS), PFS based on investigator assessments according to RECIST version 1.1 was defined as time from date of treatment until date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression), regardless of whether the patient withdrew from therapy or received another anticancer therapy prior to progression. Progression (i.e., PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (TLs) and an absolute increase of ≥ 5mm, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters since treatment started including the baseline sum of diameters, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Median PFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., Tumor assessments every 6 weeks after treatment for the first 24 weeks and then every 8 weeks thereafter until date of RECIST 1.1 defined radiological progressive disease or death. Assessed up to maximum of approximately 36 months.|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of treatment until death due to any cause. Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive. Median OS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier technique., From date of treatment until death due to any cause. Assessed up to maximum of approximately 36 months.|Duration of Response (DoR), The DoR was defined as the time from the date of first documented OR (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) until date of documented progression (PD) based on investigator assessments by using RECIST version 1.1 or death in absence of disease progression. A confirmed CR was defined in above outcome measures. The PD was defined at least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions or new lesion. For participants who were alive and no documented PD at the time of data cutoff for analysis, DoR was censored at the last evaluable disease assessment date. Median DoR was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method., Tumor assessments (per RECIST 1.1) every 6 weeks for first 24 weeks relative to the date of treatment and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Assessed up to maximum of approximately 36 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate based on investigator assessments according to RECIST version 1.1 was defined as the rate of best objective response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)., Tumor assessments (per RECIST 1.1) every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks relative to the date of treatment and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Assessed up to maximum of approximately 36 months.
