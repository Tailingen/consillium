IRESSAâ„¢ (Gefitinib) With Cisplatin Plus Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Previously Untreated Unresected Late Stage III/IV Non-Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of ZD1839 250 mg and 500 mg when given either concomitantly or as maintenance to a standard therapy of radiotherapy (X-rays) plus chemotherapy (cisplatin) in terms of local disease control (progression-free) rate at 2 years.

DRUG: gefitinib (Iressa)|DRUG: cisplatin|RADIATION: radiotherapy|DRUG: Gefitinib (Iressa)
Local Disease Control Rate at 2 Years, A patient demonstrated local disease control at 2 years if there was no evidence of failure of treatment. Failure was defined as the patient having objective disease progression (as per RECIST) inside the original irradiated area, at an isodose level (between 20% and 95%), or death., Assessed at 2 yrs. Tumour assessments (clinical & by CT/MRI) were carried out during screening & regularly throughout the study until disease progression (as defined by Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST)).
Local Disease Control Rate at 1 Year, A patient demonstrated local disease control at 1 year if there was no evidence of failure of treatment. Failure was defined as the patient having objective disease progression (as per RECIST) inside the original irradiated area, at an isodose level (between 20% and 95%), or death., Assessed after 1 year. Tumour assessments (clinical and by CT/MRI) were carried out during screening & regularly throughout the study until disease progression (as defined by RECIST).|Complete Response, A patient was deemed to be a complete responder if the RECIST criteria for complete response were satisfied at any time during the study., Assessed at 2 years. Clinical tumour assessments and tumour assessment by CT/MRI were carried out during screening and regularly throughout the study until disease progression.|Tumour Response (Complete Response + Partial Response), A patient was deemed to be have a tumour response if the RECIST criteria for complete response or partial response were satisfied at any time during the study., Assessed at 2 years. Clinical tumour assessments and tumour assessment by CT/MRI were carried out during screening and regularly throughout the study until disease progression|Progression Free Survival, Percentage of participants who are progression free at 2 years (calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, which allows for censored observations for example those lost to follow-up). A patient is said to have progressed if they have progression of target or non-target lesions or evidence of any new lesions (as defined by RECIST)., Clinical tumour assessments and tumour assessment by CT/MRI were carried out during screening and regularly throughout the study until disease progression (as defined by RECIST)|Overall Survival, Percentage of participants who are alive at 2 years (calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, which allows for patients who do not have complete follow-up (censored observations))., Overall survival assessed at 2 years|Safety and Tolerability, Assessed over two years
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of ZD1839 250 mg and 500 mg when given either concomitantly or as maintenance to a standard therapy of radiotherapy (X-rays) plus chemotherapy (cisplatin) in terms of local disease control (progression-free) rate at 2 years.
