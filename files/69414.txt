PD-1 Antibody in Addition to BACE in Patients With NSCLC: A Randomised Controlled Trial
This is a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of PD-1 Antibody in addition to Bronchial Arterial Chemoembolization in stage III-Ⅳ NSCLC patients who failed, refused or ineligible to receive standard treatments.
NSCLC
DRUG: PD-1 Antibody|DEVICE: BACE
Progression-free survival (PFS), Time from the first BACE treatment to either radiological progression or death, Time from the first BACE treatment to either radiological progression or death or up to 12 months]
Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients with reduction in stable in tumor burden of a predefined amount, Time Frame: 2, 4, 6 months after the first BACE treatment, up to death or 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of patients with reduction or keeping in stable in tumor burden of a predefined amount, 2, 4, 6 months after the first BACE treatment, up to death or 12 months|Overall survival (OS), ime from the first BACE treatment to death from any cause or the end of the study, 1 years
Bronchial artery chemoembolization (BACE) is a technique of drug delivery and embolization performed via injecting anti-tumor drugs with drug carriers and implanting the embolization agents into the tumor feeding artery, promoting the clinical outcomes of patients and providing a palliative treatment option for patients with NSCLC. while the short-term effect of BACE is good, it is easy to relapse and metastasize.

The rapid development of immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors represented by PD-1/L1 monoclonal antibody has changed the treatment pattern of NSCLC. The publication of early research data repeatedly verified the long-term survival benefit characteristics of PD-1/L1 in NSCLC.

Based on this research and clinical practice, we designed this trial to determine the efficacy and safety of PD-1 antibody in addition to Bronchial Arterial Chemoembolization in stage III-Ⅳ NSCLC patients who failed, refused or ineligible to receive standard treatments.
