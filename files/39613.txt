Dietary Fish Oil Intervention in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
The primary objective in this proposed study is to determine the effect of dietary fish oil supplementation compared to standard care metformin treatment, and fish oil in combination with metformin on plasma lipids and apoB-remnant lipoprotein metabolism in overweight-obese young women with PCOS.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|Lipid Metabolism Disorders
DRUG: Metformin|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Fish Oil and Metformin|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Fish Oil
Plasma Triglycerides and apoB-lipoprotein remnants in non-fasting and fasted state, reported as mean +/- SEM, At baseline and postintervention at 12 weeks
Plasma insulin and glucose, reported as mean +/- SEM, At baseline and postintervention at 12 weeks|Plasma hormones, testosterone, SHBG, Estrogen, reported as mean +/- SEM, At baseline and postintervention at 12 weeks
Specific Objectives;

1. To determine the effect of dietary fish oil supplementation, metformin, and fish oil in combination with metformin on fasting and non-fasting plasma TG, apoB48 and apoB100-lipoprotein concentrations.
2. To determine the physiological mechanisms associated with the effect of dietary fish oil supplementation and metformin on in vivo plasma lipid and apoB-lipoprotein kinetics. We will quantitate the in vivo production and kinetics of plasma TG, apoB48 and apoB100-lipoproteins in plasma and isolated lipoprotein fractions, using established methods.
3. To explore the effects of dietary fish oil supplementation, metformin and fish oil in combination with metformin, on plasma insulin and testosterone, and the association with changes in plasma lipids and apoB-lipoprotein metabolism.
