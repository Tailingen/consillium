Phase II 177Lu-DOTATATE Study in Metastatic NPC With a Safety Run-in
This study is the first phase II study of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate in metastatic NPC. Patients whom have failed 2 or more lines of therapy or exhausted standard therapy and are avid on 68Ga-DOTATATE imaging will be eligible to receive up to 4 cycles of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate. The primary outcome will be progression free survival at 6 months.

Progression Free Survival (PFS)., PFS is defined as the time from the date of initiating study treatment to the date of documented disease progression as determined by RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1 or death from any cause.

Point estimates for median PFS and PFS rate at 6 month, with corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs), will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method., Within 76 weeks of start of study treatment.
Objective Response Rate (ORR)., ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who had a partial response or complete response according to RECIST 1.1.

The ORR and 95% CI will be calculated., Within 76 weeks of start of study treatment.|Time to Tumour Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the time (number of days) from start of study treatment to objective tumour progression., Within 76 weeks of start of study treatment.|Overall Survival (OS)., OS is defined as the time from the date of start of study treatment to the date of death due to any cause or the date of last contact (censored observation) at the date of data cut-off., Within 76 weeks of start of study treatment.
This would be an open label, single arm, single centre, phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate in Metastatic NPC.

Patients will first need to go for a 68Ga-DOTATATE scan to determine if they are suitable for 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate therapy. A'Hern single stage phase II design (A'Hern, 2001) will be used for conducting the trial. The null hypothesis that the true PFS rate at 6 months is 10% will be tested against the alternate hypothesis of 25%. A total number of 25 patients will be recruited. If there are 5 or more patients who are alive and progression free among these 25 patients at 6 months, we reject the null hypothesis and claim that the treatment is promising.

The design controls the type I error rate at 9.8% and yields a power of 78.6% when the true PFS rate at 6 months is 25%. The first 5 patients will receive 180mCi of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate for the first cycle followed by 200mCi for the remaining 3 cycles if there are no \> Grade 2 toxicities after the first cycle. If there are \>G2 toxicities, the remaining cycles will proceed at 180mCi. A safety review will be done after the first 5 patients. If there are no significant toxicities, the remaining patients will receive 200mCi for 4 cycles. If there are significant toxicities in patients receiving 200mCi for the 2nd to 4th cycle, the remaining patients will receive 180mCi for 4 cycles. If there are significant toxicities in patients receiving 180mCi for the 2nd to 4th cycle, the remaining patients will receive 160mCi for 4 cycles. Dosimetry scans will be done after each cycle of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate at 1h and 96h. Safety and tolerability of 177LuDOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate will be assessed for the duration of study treatment.

FDG PET/CT scan and 68Ga-DOTATATE scan will be performed at baseline and after cycle 1 (week 4) and cycle 4 (week 28). CT scans will be done at week 12, 24, then 3-monthly starting from week 40. 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, dose adjustment is permitted. A treatment cycle is eight weeks (56 days) and will be repeated without therapy interruption for 4 cycles unless there is dose limiting toxicities.
