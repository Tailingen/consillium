A Study of Bendamustine in the Treatment of Chinese Participants With Indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Refractory to Rituximab Treatment
The primary objective of the study is to determine the overall response rate (ORR), which includes complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), to bendamustine treatment in participants with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that has progressed after rituximab or a rituximab-containing therapy.
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Bendamustine hydrochloride
Overall Response Rate (ORR) (Assessed by Independent Review Committee [IRC]), The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during the study based on the modified International Workshop Response Criteria. CR: disappearance of all evidence of disease; nodal masses regression on normal size on computed tomography (CT); spleen and liver not palpable and nodule disappeared; bone marrow infiltrate cleared on repeat biopsy. PR: Regression of measurable disease and no new sites; nodal masses ≥50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 largest dominant masses and no increase in size of other nodes; spleen and liver ≥50% decrease in SPD of nodules and no increase in size of liver or spleen., From the date of the first administration of bendamustine to the first documentation of disease progression/relapse, new anticancer therapy, or death (regardless of cause), whichever occurred first (up to 2.5 Years)
Duration of Response (DOR) (Assessed by IRC), Duration of response was defined as the time from the date of first documentation of response to the first documentation of disease progression, new anticancer therapy, or death (regardless of cause), whichever occurred first for participants with a best response of CR or PR determined by the modified International Workshop Response Criteria. CR: disappearance of all evidence of disease; nodal masses regression on normal size on CT; spleen and liver not palpable and nodule disappeared; bone marrow infiltrate cleared on repeat biopsy. PR: Regression of measurable disease and no new sites; nodal masses ≥50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 largest dominant masses and no increase in size of other nodes; spleen and liver ≥50% decrease in SPD of nodules and no increase in size of liver or spleen. Disease progression: any new lesion or increase by ≥50% of previously involved sites from nadir., From the date of first documentation of response to the first documentation of disease progression, new anticancer therapy, or death (regardless of cause), whichever occurred first (up to 2.5 Years)|Progression-Free Survival (Assessed by IRC), Progression free survival was defined as the time from the date of the first administration of bendamustine to the first documentation of disease progression/relapse, new anticancer therapy, or death (regardless of cause), whichever occurred first for all participants. Disease progression/relapse: appearance of any new lesion or increase by ≥50% of previously involved sites from nadir., From the date of the first administration of bendamustine to the first documentation of disease progression/relapse, new anticancer therapy, or death (regardless of cause), whichever occurred first (up to 2.5 Years)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Bendamustine, Prior to the start of infusion on Day 1 for up to 24 hours after the end of infusion during Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Time to Reach Cmax (Tmax) of Bendamustine, Prior to the start of infusion on Day 1 for up to 24 hours after the end of infusion during Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Measurable Drug Concentration (AUC0-t) of Bendamustine, Prior to the start of infusion on Day 1 for up to 24 hours after the end of infusion during Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity (AUC0-∞) of Bendamustine, Prior to the start of infusion on Day 1 for up to 24 hours after the end of infusion during Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Rate Constant for Elimination (λz) of Bendamustine, Prior to the start of infusion on Day 1 for up to 24 hours after the end of infusion during Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Percentage of the AUC0-∞ Based on Extrapolation (%AUCext), Prior to the start of infusion on Day 1 for up to 24 hours after the end of infusion during Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Half-Life (t½) of Bendamustine, Prior to the start of infusion on Day 1 for up to 24 hours after the end of infusion during Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in the 'Reported AE section'., From first administration of bendamustine through 30 days after the last administration (up to 2.5 Years)|World Health Organization (WHO) Performance Status, Number of participants with WHO performance status (improved, stayed the same, and deteriorated) at the end of treatment have been reported., At the end of treatment (up to 2.5 years)|Number of Participants Who Need At Least 1 Hematologic Supportive Care (Plasma, Blood Cells, or Cytokines), From first administration of bendamustine up to the end of treatment (up to 2.5 Years)|Number of Participants With Concomitant Medication Usage, Concomitant medications included all medications taken while the participant received study drug., From first administration of bendamustine up to the end of treatment (up to 2.5 Years)
This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, single-agent clinical study conducted in China, and is designed to investigate the use of bendamustine in the treatment of Chinese participants with relapsed, rituximab-refractory indolent NHL. The study consists of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a treatment period of approximately 24 weeks (up to eight 21-day cycles), and a long-term follow-up period for up to 2 years after the last dose of study drug. Participants are expected to participate in this study for approximately 2.5 years.
