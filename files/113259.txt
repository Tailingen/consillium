Clinical Study of HMPL-653 in Treatment of Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors and TGCT
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of HMPL-653 in patients with advanced solid tumors who have failure of standard of care or can not tolerate standard of care or those with TGCT, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase II clinical study dose (RP2D) of HMPL-653 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
