Clinical Trial Comparing TACE With TACE + SABR in Stage BCLC B HCC (HepSTAR)
This will be multicentre a phase II randomized controlled and open-label trial. It will compare the 6-months objective response (CR+PR) rates obtained with Drug Eluting Bead Trans-Arterial Chemo-Embolization (DEB-TACE) alone versus DEB-TACE followed by Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with hepatocarcinoma stage BCLC B.

This trial will also include one substudy. This substudy will confront the immuno-histochemical results collected on tumoral biopsies to the biological and imaging (MRI) results. Every patient participating to the trial can also participate to this substudy.

Objective response rate at 6 months, Objective response rate including complete and partial response based on the MRI evaluation (mRECIST), 6 months after the completion of treatment
Time to progression, defined as the time between the end of treatment and the occurrence of a local recurrence. The diagnoses of another intra- or extra-hepatic lesion of HCC will not be considered as progression, 1 year after the treatment completion|Time to untreatable progression, defined as the time between the end of treatment and the occurrence of untreatable intra-hepatic disease, 1 year after the treatment completion|6-months overall survival, defined as survival rate of patients at 6months after the end of treatment, 1 year after the treatment completion|1-year overall survival, defined as survival rate of patients at 1 year after the end of treatment, 1 year after the treatment completion|Acute toxicities, Acute toxic events will have to be described and recorded in accordance with the CTCAE 4.03 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events)., 6 months after treatment completion|Late toxicities, Late toxic events will have to be described and recorded in accordance with the CTCAE 4.03 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events)., 6 months after treatment completion|Quality of life assessment by questionnaire at baseline, Quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires: EORTC QLQC30. The investigators will ask each patient to answer to these questionnaires once at randomization., baseline|Quality of life assessment by questionnaire at 2 months, Quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires: EORTC QLQC30.

The investigators will ask each patient to answer to these questionnaires 6 months after treatment completion, 6 months after treatment completion|Overall response rate based on the MRI evaluation in Child Pugh B7 patients, As the choice of the irradiation scheme will be influenced by the severity of the underlying cirrhosis with a Child Pugh score B7, the overall response rate in this specific kind of patients will be separately measured besides the overall response rate of the whole cohort., 6 months
Immuno-histochemical detection of tumoral markers on biopsy (AFP/CK19/DCP), Differents markers will be checked on biopsy (AFP = alpha foetoprotein/ CK19 = cytokeratin 19/ DPC= Des Carboxy prothrombin)., at time of biopsy|Baseline biological detection of tumoral marker(s) : AFP +/- DCP, Biological detection of tumoral marker(s) will be done for every patient included in this trial (at least for AFP = alpha fetoprotein) at baseline then repeated every 2 months after treatment, up to 6 months. Measurement of DCP (Des-Carboxy-prothrombin will not be mandatory)., at baseline|Biological detection of tumoral marker(s) (AFP +/- DCP) at 2 months after treatment, Biological detection of tumoral marker(s) will be done for every patient included in this trial (at least for AFP = alpha fetoprotein) at baseline then repeated every 2 months after treatment, up to 6 months. Measurement of DCP (Des-Carboxy-prothrombin will not be mandatory)., 2 months after treatment completion|Biological detection of tumoral marker(s) (AFP +/- DCP) at 4 months after treatment, Biological detection of tumoral marker(s) will be done for every patient included in this trial (at least for AFP = alpha fetoprotein) at baseline then repeated every 2 months after treatment, up to 6 months.

The patients will be randomized in 2 arms determining the treatment they will receive:

Arm A: actual standard treatment = TACE Arm B: experimental arm = TACE + SABR
