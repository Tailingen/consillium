AG vs mFOLFIRINOX as Neoadjuvant Therapy for Borderline Reseactable and Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This is a prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled phase â…¢ study.
Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer|Locally Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Nab paclitaxel plus gemcitabine|DRUG: mFOLFIRINOX
overall survival, To evaluate the overall survival of patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer after treated neoadjuvant chemotherapy, from randomization to death, up to 36 months
recurrence free survival, To evaluate the recurrence free survival of patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer after treated neoadjuvant chemotherapy, from randomization to recurrence, up to 36 months|objective response rate, To evaluate the objective response rate of patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer after treated neoadjuvant chemotherapy, up to 36 months|resection rate, The proportion of patients who become operable from inoperable after neoadjuvant chemotherapy., up to 36 months|R0 resection, The proportion of R0 resection among patients who undergo operations., up to 36 months|postoperative complications, The incidence of postoperative complications, up to 36 months
Three hundred patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer will be randomized 1:1 (150 :150) to the AG and mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy groups and to observe the overall survival.

The AG regimen: albumin-bound paclitaxel and gemcitabine are given intravenous infusion, repeated every 4 weeks for 1, 8, and 15 days, for a total of 4 to 6 cycles.

MFOLFIRINOX: Intravenous oxaliplatin for 2 hours, day 1;Intravenous infusion of calcium formyl tetrahydrofolate (LV) for 2 h, day 1;Irinotecan intravenous infusion is added 30 minutes later for 90 minutes, day 1;Intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) continued for 46 hours.Repeat every 2 weeks for a total of 4-6 cycles.

After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the surgery will be evaluated according to the patient's tumor and systemic condition.

The first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy begins 4-8 weeks after radical resection, and the choice of adjuvant chemotherapy regimen depends on the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.If neoadjuvant chemotherapy is effective, adjuvant chemotherapy maintains the original regimen.Adjuvant chemotherapy has 4 cycles of treatment.

Relevant examinations were performed before and after each cycle of medication to assess safety events, imaging review was performed every 2 cycles during the treatment period and every 3 months during the follow-up period.
