Bevacizumab and Irinotecan in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent, Progressive, or Refractory Glioma, Medulloblastoma, Ependymoma, or Low Grade Glioma
This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with irinotecan works in treating young patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory glioma, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or low grade glioma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of glioma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with irinotecan may kill more tumor cells.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor type (high-grade glioma \[closed to accrual as of 4/21/2009\] vs intrinsic brain stem tumor \[closed to accrual as of 4/21/2009\] vs medulloblastoma \[closed to accrual as of 10/27/2010\] vs ependymoma \[closed to accrual as of 7/29/2010\] vs low grade glioma \[closed to accrual as of 7/29/2010\]).

Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 16 or 17 for course 1. Patients receive bevacizumab and irinotecan hydrochloride on days 1 and 15 for all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients undergo MRIs of the brain, magnetic resonance perfusion/diffusion, and fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography at baseline and periodically during treatment.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.
