WashU DIEP Flap Video and Patient Understanding Improvement
Patients will complete a survey before and after watching the WashU DIEP Flap Video at their pre-operative standard of care visit, and a third survey at their post-operative standard of care visit. These surveys will use questions from SILS, APAIS, PEMAT, and AIM/IAM to assess the patient's health literacy, demographics questions, and questions concerning patient understanding and anxiety surrounding the procedure. The purpose of the post-op survey will be to assess how well the video set expectations of the procedure and recovery process and will repeat questions asked pre-operatively. Survey responses will be analyzed to determine if there are beneficial trends and improvement in patient understanding and anxiety due to adjunct video usage.

Primary Objective: The primary aim of the study is to determine if our animated video affects understanding and anxiety survey scores in patients undergoing DIEP breast reconstruction.

Change in understanding as measured by the Comprehension Assessment, The pre-op, pre-video survey includes a 10-question comprehension assessment. The pre-op, post-video survey repeats the comprehension assessment. Scores of the comprehension assessment will be compared before and after video watching per patient to determine change in understanding due to the video. It will be scored on a 10-point scale based on correct answers with a higher score meaning greater understanding of the procedure., Before video at pre-operative visit, after video at pre-operative visit, and at post-operative visit (estimated to be 2 months)|Change in anxiety as measured by the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS), Scores of the APAIS will be compared before and after video watching per patient to determine change in anxiety due to the video. Scoring of APAIS will be per the literature (6-30 with higher score meaning greater anxiety)., Before video at pre-operative visit, after video at pre-operative visit, and at post-operative visit (estimated to be 2 months)
Appropriate expectation setting as measured by The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT), Will be used to assess video quality. Validated scoring will be used (0-12 with higher score meaning better quality)., Before video at pre-operative visit and at post-operative visit (estimated to be 2 months)|Appropriate expectation setting as measured by the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), Validated survey which will be used per published scoring guidelines (8-40 with higher score meaning greater acceptability., At post-operative visit (estimated to be at 2 months)|Appropriate expectation setting as measured by the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), Validated survey which will be used per published scoring guidelines (8-40 with higher score meaning greater appropriateness., At post-operative visit (estimated to be at 2 months)
