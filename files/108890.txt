A Stool DNA-based SDC2 Methylation Test for the Early Detection of Colorectal Cancer
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the EarlyTect® CRC test for detecting CRC, using colonoscopy as the reference method.

The secondary objective is to compare the clinical performance of EarlyTect® CRC test with a commercially available Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT), with respect to CRC. By histopathological examination, lesions identified during colonoscopy will be confirmed as malignant or precancerous by histological examination.

DEVICE: EarlyTect® CRC test
Sensitivity and specificity of the EarlyTect® CRC test for detecting CRC compared to the colonoscopy, both in terms of detecting CRC., The reference method is the colonoscopy, and lesions will be assessed histopathologically.

EarlyTect® CRC test includes a measurement of SDC2 methylation and COL2A1 as a DNA control. SDC2 methylation in stool DNA will be assessed quantitatively by LTE/qMSP. The results will be dichotomized by the CT (cycle threshold) cutoff value as either positive or negative. Sensitivity = 100\*(positive SDC2 methylation test/positive colonoscopy), Specificity = 100\*(negative SDC2 methylation test/negative colonoscopy)., 18 months

A multicenter, single-blind, prospective clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the clinical performance of EarlyTect® CRC test. Subjects who are at high-risk (Asia Pacific Colorectal Screening Score ≥4.0) of developing CRC who are eligible for inclusion criteria will be asked to collect a stool sample and EarlyTect® CRC and FIT tests will be performed. For confirmation of the diagnosis and tumor staging, representative histopathology slides obtained from curative surgery and representative histopathology slides from tissue biopsied or excised during colonoscopy may be retrieved and examined by the central pathology laboratory. Methylation status of SDC2 in stool DNA is measured by a highly accurate and sensitive real time PCR that employs Linear Target Enrichment (LTE) and quantitative Methylation-Specific PCR (qMSP)(LTE-qMSP).
