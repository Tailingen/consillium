A Study of Duvelisib and Venetoclax in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, or Indolent or Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Who Have Not Previously Received a Bcl-2 or PI3K Inhibitor
This study is designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, and determine the recommended Phase 2 doses of co administered Duvelisib and Venetoclax in participants with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small lymphocytic lymphoma, or indolent or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, who have not previously received a Bcl-2 or Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. The Phase 2 portion of the study will preliminarily evaluate efficacy, and expand the toxicity evaluation.
