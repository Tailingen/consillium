Phase 1 Study of MRTX1719 in Solid Tumors With MTAP Deletion
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, study of the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and anti-tumor activity of MRTX1719 patients with advanced, unresectable or metastatic solid tumor malignancy with homozygous deletion of the MTAP gene.

DRUG: MRTX1719
Number of Patients who Experience Dose-Limiting Toxicity, 21 days|Number of patients who experience a treatment-related adverse event, Up to 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), 2 years|Progression free survival (PFS), 2 years|Overall survival (OS), 2 years
Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), Up to 4 days|Time to achieve maximal plasma concentration (Tmax), Up to 4 days|Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), Up to 4 days|Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), Up to 4 days|Apparent total plasma clearance when dosed orally (CL/F), Up to 4 days|Apparent volume of distribution when dosed orally (Vz/F), Up to 4 days
This first-in-human clinical trial will begin with an exploration of MRTX1719 dose and regimen. As potentially viable regimens are identified, Phase 1b expansion cohorts may be implemented to ensure sufficient safety experience, PK information, compare food effect and relative bioavailability between capsules and tablets, and early evidence of clinical activity are available.
