Identify microRNAs in Cachexia in Pancreatic Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of pancreatic patients who experience weight loss and cachexia, and to identify any differences in the genes between patient groups.
Resectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: Pancreatic cancer microRNA and messenger RNA expression.
Proportion of African American pancreatic cancer patients with weight loss and cachexia., Evaluate weight loss and the markers of cachexia, albumin and psoas cross-sectional area, to see if African Americans with pancreatic cancer patients experience Grade I-IV cachexia at a higher frequency than other racial groups., 1 - 12 months
Differences in microRNA and messenger RNA tumor expression profiles in all cancer patients undergoing pancreatic surgery., Assess fold-change expression differences in microRNA and messenger RNA tumor expression profiles in all cancer patients undergoing pancreatic surgery., 1 - 12 months|Differences in cachexia-associated RNA signatures in African American pancreatic cancer patients, and other racial groups., Assess fold-change expression differences in cachexia-associated RNA signatures in African American pancreatic cancer patients, and other racial groups., 1 - 12 months
This research study will retrospectively examine 1395 patients from the University of Alabama and the University of Oklahoma Stephenson Cancer Center (OU-SCC) pancreatic cancer cohorts. The prospective arm, will enroll a total of 100 eligible volunteers at the OU-SCC. The demographic and medical data from the retrospective and prospective arms will be combined (1495 patients) to ascertain any racial disparities in pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia. Perspective volunteers at the OU-SCC will undergo routine tests to determine if their cancer is operable. Pancreatic tumors will be removed from the eligible patients, as part of their normal standard of care and will be examined for genes that may be related to unexplained muscle loss and compared to tumor tissue from other patients with pancreatic cancer. An optional hand strength exam, and standing on a scale that measures weight, muscle, and body fat will be available to OU-SCC patients.
