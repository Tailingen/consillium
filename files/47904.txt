CART19 in Adult Patients With Minimal Residual Disease During Upfront Treatment for ALL
This is a single center, single arm, open-label phase 2 study to determine the efficacy of autologous T cells expressing CD19 chimeric antigen receptors expressing tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ/4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred to as "CART19" cells) in adults with minimal residual disease (MRD) during upfront treatment for CD19+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic
BIOLOGICAL: CART 19

Best Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of the first CART19 infusion to the date of death due to any reason., one year|Duration of Remission (DOR), Duration of remission (DOR) is defined as the duration from the date when the response criteria of CR or CRi is first met to the date of relapse or death due to ALL., one year|Relapse Free Survival (RFS), Relapse free survival (RFS) is defined as the duration between the date when the response criteria of CR or CRi is first met to the date of relapse or death due to any cause., one year|Event Free Survival (EFS), Event free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from start of the first CART19 infusion to the earliest of the following:

Death from any cause Relapse

Treatment failure: Defined as no response in the study and discontinuation from the study due to any of the following reasons:
