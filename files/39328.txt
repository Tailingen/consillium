Evaluation of the Metastasis and Recurrence of Prostate Cancer
This study aims to use the new molecular probe 18F-PSMA for the diagnosis,staging ,recurrence monitoring and evaluation of the prostate cancer.By compared with the conventional imaging methods (whole body bone scintigraphy and MRI) and molecular imaging methods (11C-choline PET/CT),we hope to find the advantages of 18F-PSMA PET/CT in the diagnosis and metastases of prostate cancer, and lay the foundation for the further clinical transformation.
Prostate Cancer (Diagnosis)|Prostate Cancer Metastatic|Prostate Cancer Recurrent|Prostate Cancer Stage
