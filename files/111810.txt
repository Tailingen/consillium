Daratumumab, Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide, and Dexamethasone Therapy for Patients with MIDD
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study in subjects with newly diagnosed monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease treated with daratumumab, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone.
Monoclonal Gammopathy of Renal Significance
DRUG: Dara-CyBorD
Rate of Hematologic Complete Response at the completion of 6 cycles, Hematologic complete response requires absence of monoclonal protein by immunofixation electrophoreses of both serum and urine as well as a normal FLC ratio (FLCr). CR is considered when FLCr was altered in favour of the non-amyloidogenic, uninvolved FLC (uFLC), even though the ratio may not have been normalised., 6 months

The current study aims to investigate daratumumab, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone regimen in patients with newly diagnosed monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease. Approximately 25 subjects will receive primary therapy with daratumumab-CyBorD. The primary endpoint is overall complete hematologic response (CHR) rate at 6 months.
