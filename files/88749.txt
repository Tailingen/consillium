Study of Acalabrutinib (ACP-196) in Combination With Venetoclax (ABT-199), With and Without Obinutuzumab (GA101) Versus Chemoimmunotherapy for Previously Untreated CLL
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib in combination with venetoclax and acalabrutinib in combination with venetoclax with and without obinutuzumab compared to chemoimmunotherapy in subjects with previously untreated CLL
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Acalabrutinib|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Chemoimmunotherapy|DRUG: Obinutuzumab
To evaluate the efficacy of acalabrutinib with venetoclax (Arm A) compared to chemoimmunotherapy fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab [FCR] or bendamustine/rituximab [BR] (Arm C): PFS, Progression-free survival (PFS) after randomization, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2018 criteria, 6 years
To evaluate the efficacy of acalabrutinib with venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab (Arm B) compared with FCR or BR (Arm C): PFS, PFS after randomization, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the IRC assessment and investigator assessment, 6 years|To evaluate the efficacy of acalabrutinib with venetoclax (Arm A) compared with FCR or BR (Arm C): PFS defined the same as above per investigator assessment., PFS after randomization, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the IRC assessment and investigator assessment, 6 years
This randomized, global, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of AV and AVG versus chemoimmunotherapy (FCR or BR) in subjects with previously untreated CLL without del(17p) or TP53. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 arms through a block stratified randomization procedure.

The study includes screening (35 days), treatment (from randomization until study drug discontinuation) and follow-up phase.
