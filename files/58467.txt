Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Summary tables of serious AEs (SAEs) and all other non-serious adverse events (AEs) are located in the Reported Adverse Event Module., baseline up to 24 months
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of IC83/LY2603618, Cmax was estimated from the plasma concentration data of LY2603618 versus time profiles., Day 1 and Day 9 of Cycle 1|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Area Under the IC83/LY2603618 Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC[0-∞]), AUC\[0-∞\] was calculated from the plasma concentration data of LY2603618 versus time profiles., Day 1 and Day 9 of Cycle 1|Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response, Percentage of participants with tumor response (best confirmed overall response) assessed as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease (PD)=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) =small changes that do not meet above criteria. Best Overall Response (%)=number of participants with CR+PR/number of participants in treatment arm \* 100., baseline up to 24 months
