ASPIRES (Activating Cancer Survivors and Their Primary Care Providers to Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening) Study
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the best method for encouraging high-risk cancer survivors to get screened for colorectal cancer at the recommended age.

Proportion of patients who report completing a colonoscopy or Cologuard test (Cologuard test plus colonoscopy if Cologuard is positive) within 12 months of randomization, This will be measured by self-report on a questionnaire given at 12 months., 12 months
Proportion of patients who complete the colonoscopy or Cologuard test (Cologuard test plus colonoscopy if Cologuard is positive) within 12 months of randomization as measured in medical record reports, The study team will confirm if participants had a colonoscopy or cologuard test by reaching out to the medical site where the participant was screened, and requesting the medical record confirmation., 12 months|Potential barriers and facilitators to the uptake of the intervention at both the patient and provider level as measured by CFIR questions, Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) questions are included in the 12-month questionnaire for participants, the 12-month questionnaire for their primary care providers, and the end of study interviews for the participants, primary care providers, and other medical office staff. CFIR questions are meant to measure 5 domains: intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of individuals, and process., 14 months|Other potential barriers and facilitators to the uptake of the intervention at both the patient and provider level, In this study, the potential moderators include patient characteristics, such as age, gender, educational attainment, health insurance coverage, types of insurance, chronic health conditions, and race/ethnicity as well as PCP factors such as knowledge, years in practice, and practice setting. The potential mediators in this study may include the patient's perception of involvement in decision making, health insurance coverage, and whether the patient reviewed the study resources and videos. This will be measured through data collected via the baseline and 12 month questionnaires as well as data previously collected via the St. Jude Childhood Cancer Survivor Study., 12 months|Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, We will collect data on the replication costs of the intervention and health services from the intervention per participant. The costs of the intervention (e.g. intervention materials, personnel time, and texting costs) will be collected by the University of Chicago team via a cost spreadsheet. The cost of the health services will be collected via the 12-month questionnaire; participants will be asked to share information about the types of medical visits they have had since joining the study., 12 months
This is a 12-month, 3-arm randomized controlled trial of 315 Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) survivors using a text message intervention with data collected at baseline and 12 months through patient and provider surveys and interviews and a medical record review. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, patient activation (PA) using a text message/video intervention, or patient activation + primary care provider activation (PA + PCP) which will include providing primary care providers with resources about colorectal cancer risk in this population. All participants will receive electronic resources about their previous cancer treatment and colorectal cancer screening recommendations.

The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who complete the colonoscopy or Cologuard test (Cologuard test plus colonoscopy if the Cologuard is positive) within 12 months of enrolling on the study, as measured via self-report questions in the end of study questionnaire. The study will test the hypothesis that, compared to controls, survivors randomized to the PA and PA + PCP activation groups will have significantly higher rates of completion of colorectal cancer screening.
