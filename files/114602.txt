IO102-IO103 in Combination With Pembrolizumab Versus Pembrolizumab Alone in Advanced Melanoma (IOB-013 / KN-D18)
Phase 3, multicenter, international, open-label, randomized, 2-arm trial investigating the safety and efficacy of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic (advanced) melanoma.

Patients will be stratified on the basis of the following factors; Disease stage: Stage III (unresectable) and IV M1a-b versus stage IV M1c-d and BRAFV600 mutation status: mutated vs wild type.

All patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of 35 cycles (up to 2 years treatment). Patients randomized to IO102-IO103 dual-antigen, immunotherapeutic arm will also be given IO102-IO103 Q3W with an additional dose given during the induction period on Day 8 of cycles 1 and 2. IO102 IO103 will thereafter be administered subcutaneous every 3 weeks during the maintenance period. Each patient can be treated for a maximum of 37 administrations in total (up to 2 years of treatment).

The primary objective is to investigate the efficacy of IO102-IO103 in combination with pembrolizumab (compared with pembrolizumab alone) in terms of progression free survival.
