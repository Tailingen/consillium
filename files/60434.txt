A Phase II Clinical Study of Sintilimab Combined with Chemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Unresectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) (NICE-CS)
This is a prospective, single-arm, phase II clinical study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab combined with chemotherapy, followed by sequential concurrent chemoradiotherapy as conversion therapy, in treatment-naïve esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients with cT4bN-/+M0 and/or cTanyN+M0 staging (including those with extracapsular invasion of mediastinal lymph nodes).
