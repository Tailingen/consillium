Seocalcitol Versus Placebo in Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of the study is to determine whether seocalcitol is effective in the treatment of advanced primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma \[HCC\]).
Liver Neoplasms
DRUG: Seocalcitol
Overall survival, defined as the time from start of treatment to death
HCC-specific survival from start of treatment|Time to response from start of treatment (complete or partial response)|Proportion of patients who achieve partial/complete response|Time to progression measured from start of treatment|Duration of complete response in patients showing a complete response, measured from the first date when absence of disease was recorded until the first date of disease progression was recorded|Duration of partial response in patients showing partial response, measured from first date when partial response was recorded until the first date at which disease progression was observed|Duration of stable disease measured from start of treatment until the first date where either progression or partial/complete response was observed|Change(s) in tumour size|Change in tumour marker|Number of days of hospitalisation (in-patient care)|Quality of life|Adverse events|Change in laboratory values|Dose of seocalcitol (seocalcitol treated patients)
