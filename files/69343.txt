Study of Biomarkers in Gynecological Cancers
In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in understanding the biology of cancer and this information has been used to improve cancer care and patient outcome.

Research has shown that changes in some genes and/or proteins may be important indicators for certain cancers and response to treatments. Genes are molecules made up of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA contain instructions for the development and functioning of the cells in the body and are passed down from parent to child. RNA is involved with producing proteins in the body. Further research is needed to better understand the changes found in cancer cells and how to target them to stop or reduce cancer growth.

A drug that may be able to block certain specific cancer cell changes is called "targeted therapy". Different people with the same type of cancer receiving the same drug could have different responses to it. For example, one person may experience a reduction of their tumor while another person's cancer may worsen. The reason for this is still not well understood and could lie in gene changes.

Understanding these changes may allow researchers to predict how treatments may work in guiding decisions around choice of drugs.

The purpose of the study is to learn more about gene changes or protein expression (levels) of tumors to better understand the behavior of gynecological diseases and, if possible, better address participants' cancer care now or in the future.
