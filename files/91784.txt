A Combination Study to Determine the Safety and Efficacy of Panzem NCD With Avastin in Metastatic Carcinoid Tumors
This single center, open-label study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Panzem (2-methoxyestradiol, 2ME2) Nanocrystal Dispersion (NCD) administered orally with recombinant human monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (bevacizumab) administered intravenously, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic carcinoid tumors.
