Evaluation of Nexpowder Application to Prevent Delayed Bleeding After Colorectal Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
Delayed bleeding is the most frequent (5 to 15%) and challenging complication after large colorectal polypectomy. Different preventive treatments, such as the prophylactic use of clips, have been tried to prevent the occurrence of delayed bleeding, but to date, no treatment has clearly shown its effectiveness. In addition, preventive hemostasis with clips is difficult and costly. A newly developed endoscopic hemostatic powder generating gelation effect (Nexpowder) may be an effective alternative to prevent post polypectomy bleeding in patients treated by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) for large superficial colorectal lesions.
