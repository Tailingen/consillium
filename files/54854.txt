In Turkey, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths in women. Because of the heterogeneity of NSCLC or SCLC, it is crucial to characterize the biology of the tumor as exact as possible, to predict the course of disease as accurate as possible, and to determine the optimal therapeutic algorithm as early as possible after initial diagnostic work-up.

These efforts are an obligatory part of the initial diagnostics, since thorough knowledge of the biology of the disease and the resulting therapeutic options ensure optimal care of Volunteers with NSCLC or SCLC. The aim of REGISTURK is to set up a national clinical research platform to document molecular testing, treatment and course of disease of patients with NSCLC or SCLC.
