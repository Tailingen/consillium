Docetaxel Ethanol-induced Symptoms; The Incidence and Risk Forecating Factor
To determine the incidence and risk factors of ethanol-induced symptoms, this multicenter, prospective, observational study is designed to include patients in Korea who are receiving chemotherapy with ethanol-containing docetaxel alone or in combination. Subjects who voluntarily provide written informed consent to provide information for this study and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be given an enrollment number and will be followed during the observation period to collect study-related data in the Case Report Forms (CRFs) as predefined in the study protocol. Patients' decision to participate (or not) in this study will not affect their treatment (physician's prescriptions or diagnostic/therapeutic decisions).

Incidence of ethanol-induced symptoms as a whole, An increase from baseline in the number of ethanol-induced symptoms during or after treatment, Time Frame : From the time of treatment started until the end of follow-up(24hours after the treatment)
Incidence of each ethanol-induced symptom, Any increase from baseline in the number of each ethanol-induced symptom during or after treatment, Baseline visit - before, during, and within 30 minutes after treatment, Follow-up visit - 24 hours after the treatment|Incidence of ethanol-induced symptoms as a whole during and at each time point after treatment, The incidence of ethanol-induced symptoms as a whole will be calculated at each post-dose time point (during, within 30 minutes after treatment, and 24 hours after treatment) compared with baseline values, Baseline visit - during, and within 30 minutes after treatment, Follow-up visit - 24 hours after the treatment|Incidence of each ethanol-induced symptom during and at each time point after treatment, The incidence of ethanol-induced symptoms as each will be calculated at each post-dose time point (during, within 30 minutes after treatment, and 24 hours after treatment) compared with baseline values, Baseline visit - during, and within 30 minutes after treatment, Follow-up visit - 24 hours after the treatment
Ethanol-induced symptoms questionnaire will be administered three times during the baseline visit (Visit 1) - before, during, and within 30 minutes after treatment with docetaxel - and then during the follow-up visit (or phone call) at 24 hours after the treatment. There will be no restrictions as to what concomitant medications can be used before and after treatment with ethanol-containing docetaxel, and investigators will determine the manufacturer, preparation method, and dosage regimen of docetaxel as per routine care at their study site.

The following data will be collected:

* Demographics (gender, age, drinking history)
* Height, body weight and body mass index (BMI)
* Cancer-related data (diagnosis, date of diagnosis)
* ECOG PS
* Underlying diseases
* Prior and concomitant medications
* Data on docetaxel therapy (timing of initiation of the chemotherapy, monotherapy/combination therapy, intervals between chemotherapy treatments, product name, dose (mg), administered ethanol dose (g), blood alcohol content (BAC\*), type and volume of intravenous (IV) fluid administered before and after treatment and fluid mixed with docetaxel, duration of injection)

  \* Blood alcohol content (BAC): Widmark formula = administered ethanol dose (g) / body weight (kg) Ã— gender constant (0.68 for males and 0.55 for females)
* Ethanol-induced symptoms questionnaire
