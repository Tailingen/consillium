PM8002 in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of PM8002, a PD-L1/VEGF bispecific antibody, as a single agent in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Malignant Neoplasm
DRUG: PM8002
Number of participants with DLTs, DLTs will be assessed during the dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first cycle (3weeks) of treatment., During the first three weeks of treatment with PM8002|Treatment related adverse events (TRAEs), The incidence and severity of TRAEs graded according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 30 days after last treatment|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years
Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or stable disease(SD) based on RECIST v1.1., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression (based on RECIST v1.1). for subjects with no documented disease progression, the deadline is the data of the last examination., Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from the date of first dosing date to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with PM8002 until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 2 years|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), To evaluate the incidence of ADA to PM8002., Up to 30 days after last treatment
