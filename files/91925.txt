17-N-Allylamino-17-Demethoxygeldanamycin in Treating Patients With Metastatic Malignant Melanoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin works in treating patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.
Melanoma (Skin)
DRUG: tanespimycin
Disease stabilization at 6 months
Toxicity profile as measured by NCI CTCAE version 3|Response duration|Survival|Pharmacodynamic effects as measured by western blot, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during course 1|B-RAF and RAS mutation status at baseline
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the antitumor activity of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.
* Determine the progression-free rate in patients treated with this drug.

Secondary

* Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the survival of patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 3 courses of treatment, disease response is assessed. Patients with stable or responding disease receive additional courses of treatment.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28 days and then every 3 months thereafter.
