Phase I-II Study in CD30 Positive Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Patients Refractory to First Line Chemotherapy or in First Relapse
Patients with CD30 positive DLBCL, primary refractory or in first relapse after R-CHOP or R-CHOP-like therapy will receive brentuximab vedotin in combination with R-DHAP, followed in responsive patients by high dose chemotherapy and ASCT.

Patients with primary refractory or relapse diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after R-CHOP have a dismal prognosis. Only 25% long term survivors are observed after salvage with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). CD30 expression is observed in 30% of refractory/relapse DLBCL.

Monotherapy with brentuximab vedotin is effective in relapse CD30 positive DLBCL. The addition of brentuximab vedotin to R-DHAP might improve the prognosis of these patients.

Treatment will consist of 3 cycles of brentuximab-vedotin in combination with R-DHAP. During the phase I part the recommended dose level for this combination will be established. Cycles will be given every 3 weeks.

Responsive patients will be treated with BEAM followed by ASCT. Total treatment duration is approximately 16 weeks.

Subsequently patients will be followed until 5 years after registration.
