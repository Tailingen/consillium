Peri-Operative Immune Checkpoint Inhibition and Cryoablation in Women with Triple-negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of pre-operative cryoablation, and immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) on on 3-year Event Free Survival (EFS), in women with residual hormone receptor negative, HER2-negative ("triple negative") resectable breast cancer after taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|PROCEDURE: Core Biopsy/Cryoablation|PROCEDURE: Breast Surgery|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab
Event-Free Survival, * Time (in months) between randomization and first occurrence of progression of disease that precludes surgery
* Time (in months) between randomization and first occurrence local or distant disease recurrence
* Time (in months) between randomization and date of death attributable to any cause including breast cancer, non-breast cancer, or unknown cause, 36 Months
Invasive Disease-Free Survival, * Time (in months) between randomization and ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence (i.e. an invasive breast cancer involving the same breast parenchyma as the original primary lesion); or
* Time (in months) between randomization and ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer (i.e. an invasive breast cancer in the axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall and/or skin of the ipsilateral breast); or
* Time (in months) between randomization and distant recurrence (i.e. evidence of breast cancer in any anatomic site - other than the two abovementioned sites - that has either been histologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed as recurrent invasive breast cancer); or
* Time (in months) between randomization and contralateral invasive breast cancer; or
* Time (in months) between randomization and second primary non-breast invasive cancer; or
* Time (in months) between randomization and date of death, 36 Months|Distant Disease-Free Survival, -Time (in months) between randomization and the date of the first occurrence of distant recurrence (i.e. evidence of breast cancer in any anatomic site - other than local regional sites - that has either been histologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed as recurrent invasive breast cancer), 36 Months|Overall Survival, -Time (in months) between randomization and death attributable to any cause. Patients who are alive, including lost to follow-up, at the time of the analysis will be censored at the last known alive date., 36 Months|Overall Safety, Number of related adverse events based on CTCAE v.5.0, 36 Months
The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of pre-operative cryoablation, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) on 3-year Event Free Survival (EFS), in women with triple negative breast cancer after taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our strategy combines two interventions: induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens via local destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation. Second, we administer Pembrolizumab, an antibody that inhibits lymphocyte programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptors and interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling; and was recently US FDA approved as curative-intent standard-of-care treatment for triple negative breast cancer. Women with residual triple negative resectable breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be treated with tumor cryoablation and pre-operative immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Women undergoing either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery are eligible.
