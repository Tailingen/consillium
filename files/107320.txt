First in Human Study of M4344 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of single-agent M4344 administered twice-weekly (BIW), twice daily (BID) or once daily dose schedule in participants with advanced solid tumors. This investigation is a three part study examining M4344 alone and in combination with carboplatin to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of single-agent M4344 administered twice-weekly (BIW), twice daily (BID) or once daily dose schedule in participants with advanced solid tumors. This investigation is a three part study examining M4344 alone and in combination with carboplatin to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose.
