Clinical Study of HMPL-689 for Relapsed/Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma and Follicular Lymphoma
A Multi-center, Single-arm, Open-label Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of HMPL-689 in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) and Follicular Lymphoma (FL)
Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: HMPL-689
Overall response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR, Baseline up to the last patient has completed 12 months after treatment.
Complete response (CR) rate, Defined as the proportion of patients with CR., Baseline up to the last patient has completed 12 months after treatment.|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the first dose of HMPL-689 to occurrence of PD or death, whichever comes first., Baseline up to the last patient has completed 12 months after treatment.|Time to response (TTR), Defined as the time from the first dose of HMPL-689 to the first objective response., Baseline up to the last patient has completed 12 months after treatment.|Duration of response (DoR), Defined as the time from the initial objective response to disease recurrence, progression or death., Baseline up to the last patient has completed 12 months after treatment.|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from the first dose with HMPL-689 to death from any cause., Baseline up to the last patient has completed 12 months after treatment.
This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label clinical study to evaluate the oral therapy with HMPL-689 in patients with relapsed / refractory MZL and FL. Relapse / refractory is defined as such a situation when a patient has not achieved response (CR or PR) after the latest line of systemic treatment, or has disease progress (PD) or relapse after achieving response. Two (2) cohorts of patients will be enrolled in this study:

Cohort 1: approximately 81 patients with histologically confirmed MZL

Cohort 2: approximately 104 patients with histologically confirmed FL (pathological grade 1-3a)

All patients are to receive monotherapy of HMPL-689 30 mg once a day (QD) continuously in 28-day treatment cycles until PD / recurrence, patient death, intolerable toxicity, initiation of other antitumor therapy, the patient unable to further benefit from the study treatment as judged by the investigators, the patient or his/her legal representative's request to withdraw from the clinical study treatment, the patient lost to follow-up or end of the study, whichever comes first.
