Study Comparing Pancreatic EUS-FNB With the 20-gauge Procore® and the 22-gauge Acquire® Needles
Multicenter randomized prospective study

Criteria for inclusion:

Patients admitted for EUS-FNB of a pancreatic mass

Goals of the study:

To compare the results of blinded punctures for suspicion of pancreatic tumor performed under endoscopic ultrasound in our center (Digestive Endoscopy Unit of the Digestive Pole Paris Bercy, PDPB), in terms of diagnosis and quality of histopathological material obtained with the help of 20G Procore, Cook and 22G Acquire needles, Boston Scientific.

Main criterion:

- Biopsy core length of target tissue obtained by needle pass

Number of patients:

60 patients

Duration of the study:

1 year
