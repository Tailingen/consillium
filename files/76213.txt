Phase II Study Using CHFR Methylation Status in Patients With Metastatic Esophageal, Gastroesophageal, Gastric Cancer.
To estimate and compare the response rates in patients treated with mDCF based on methylation status of CHFR.
Metastatic Esophageal Cancer|Gastroesophageal Cancer|Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Fluorouracil|DRUG: Cisplatin
Response, Number of participants treated with mDCF with progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), non-complete response and non-progressive disease (non-CR/non-PD), and partial response with progressive disease clinically (PR/PD) as defined by RECIST criteria. Response is compared based on CHFR-methylation status., 4 months
CHFR Methylation Status, Number of participants with advanced esophagogastric cancer that are CHFR-methylated or unmethylated at baseline., Baseline|Overall Survival, Number of participants alive at 2 years., 2 Years
To estimate and compare the response rates in patients treated with mDCF based on methylation status of CHFR. The overall response rates in the un-methylated and methylated patient groups will be reported with a exact 95% binomial confidence interval. A chi-square test will be used for comparison.
