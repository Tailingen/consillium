Radiomic Analysis for Predicting Treatment Response and Clinical Outcomes in Malignancies
In this study, the investigators aim to undertake a retrospective analysis of CT and MRI scans for patients undergoing radiation treatment to develop radiomic signatures to predict treatment response and clinical outcomes.

Imaging in oncology has widespread application with modalities like ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) having a well-established role particularly in diagnosis, staging, assessment of treatment response, and surveillance. With the applications of radiomics in oncology, the potential of imaging as a non-invasive biomarker in treatment response, as well as genotypic characterization, has been recognized. Radiomics has the potential to tailor way towards precision oncology with the development of biomarkers that can guide personalized treatments. In this study, the investigators aim at developing CT and MRI radiomic signatures as potential biomarkers to predict treatment response and clinical outcomes for patients treated with radiation having breast, brain, head and neck, and gynecological malignancies.
