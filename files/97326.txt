A Phase III Clinical Trial of High-dose Rituximab (500mg/m²) Combined With CHOP Regimen in the Treatment of Male Patient With Newly Diagnosed Advanced DLBCL
Comparison of MODIFIED progression-free survival (Modified-PFS) in high-dose rituximab (500mg/m²) plus CHOP versus standard-dose rituximab plus CHOP in previously untreated (TN) stage III-IV male DLBCL patients
Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse
DRUG: Rituximab
MODIFIED-PFS, To investigate the preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, From the date of enrollment until the date of the first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months
Overall survival (OS), To investigate the preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, From the date of enrollment until the date of death from ant cause, assessed up to 48 months|Complete response rate (CRR), To investigate the preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, Up to 8 cycles (each cycle is 21 days)|Objective response rate (ORR), To investigate the preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, Up to 8 cycles (each cycle is 21 days)
This study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled Phase III clinical trial that primarily evaluates the modified progression-free survival (MODIFIED-PFS) in previously untreated male DLBCL patients treated with high-dose rituximab (500mg/m²) combined with the CHOP regimen compared to standard-dose rituximab combined with the CHOP regimen. After signing the informed consent and before randomization, all participants must provide sufficient tumor tissue biopsy samples for confirmation of DLBCL via central laboratory tests such as HE staining and IHC. Eligible participants are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the experimental group (rituximab 500 mg/m2) or the control group (rituximab 375 mg/m2) and will receive 6 cycles of R-CHOP treatment (21 days per cycle), followed by 2 additional cycles of maintenance therapy with rituximab (21 days per cycle).
