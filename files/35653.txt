BAFFR-targeting CAR T Cells for Patients with Relapsed or Refractory B-NHL
A Phase 1 Study Evaluating BAFFR-targeting CAR T Cells for Patients with Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL)
Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: BAFFR-CAR T cells
Incidence of adverse events, Assess the safety of administering BAFFR-CAR T cells in participants with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL) and it's subtypes. Toxicity will be graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0, Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity which use the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Consensus Criteria (ASTCT) and Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) criteria. Toxicities will be followed from the start of lymphodepletion until the end of the study., Up to 1 year post treatment|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BAFFR-CAR T cells. The highest dose with â‰¤ 1/6 participants with DLT will be considered the MTD., The DLT evaluation period is defined as 28 days following BAFFR CAR-T infusion.
Disease Response, Defined as achieving a best response of complete response or partial response per Lugano Criteria, Up to 1 year post treatment|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), Negative MRD is defined by malignant cells \< 0.01% by flow cytometry or clonoSEQ., Up to 1 year post treatment|B Cell Quantification, Measured by flow cytometry, Up to 1 year post treatment|Progression-free survival (PFS), Kaplan-Meier product limit method with log-log transformation for the confidence interval will be used to estimate PFS., From CAR T cell infusion to the first observation of disease relapse/progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 15 years.|Overall Survival (OS), Kaplan-Meier product limit method with log-log transformation for the confidence interval will be used to estimate OS., From the day of BAFFR-CAR T cell infusion to death from any cause assessed, up to 15 years.
This phase I trial evaluates the side effects and best dose of BAFFR-CAR T cells in treating patients with B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL) that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill cancer cells. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and will have a new gene put in them that makes them able to recognize BAFFR, a protein on the surface of cancer cells. These BAFFR-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill BAFFR+ cancer cells.
