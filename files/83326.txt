Primary Plasma Cell Leukemia: a Prospective Phase 2 Study Incorporating Daratumumab to Chemotherapy and Stem Cell Transplantation
Single-Arm phase 2 trial evaluating efficacy of incorporating Daratumumab to treatment of newly diagnosed primary plasma cell leukemia. Treatment will be based on Dara-VRd induction followed by first ASCT, Dara-VRd for first consolidation, second ASCT, Dara-VRd for 1 year as second consolidation and Lenalidomide for 1 year.
