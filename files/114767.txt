Long Term Safety Study of SyB L-1101 in Patients With Recurrent/Relapsed or Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) - Extension Study
This is an extension study study to investigate long term safety of SyB L-1101 when administered intravenously every 4 weeks to the patients who have completed 8 cycles in the study 2011005 whose purpose is to investigate tolerability of SyB L-1101 when administered intravenously in patients with recurrent/relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome. Antitumor effects will also be investigated in this study.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: SyB L-1101
Adverse Events, Total number affected by any adverse events (details are presented in adverse event section), Up to 20 weeks
Disease Response Assessment, Disease progression

According to the International Working Group 2006 response criteria for Myelodysplastic Syndrome, "disease progression" is defined as no evidence of complete remission (CR), partial remission, marrow CR, stable disease, or failure, and as meeting one of the following conditions.

1. when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts \< 5%: ≥ 50% increase to \> 5%.
2. when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts 5 to 10%: ≥ 50% increase to \> 10%.
3. when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts 10 to 20%: ≥ 50% increase to \> 20%.
4. when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts 20 to 30%: ≥ 50% increase to \> 30%.
5. other: at least one of the following: decrease to ≤ 50% of neutrophil or platelet count at maximum response, ≥ 2 g/dL decrease in Hgb or transfusion dependence (in the absence of other factors, such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemolysis)., Up to 20 weeks|Serious Adverse Events, Total number affected any serious adverse events, Up to 20 weeks|Hematologic Improvement, NCA (not considered assessable)

no evidence of hematologic improvement -erythroid, -platelet, -neutrophil, progressive disease, or relapse, defined in the International Working Group 2006 response criteria for myelodysplastic syndrome., Up to 20 weeks|Cytogenetic Response, NCA (not considered assessable)

no evidence of cytogenetic response, defined in the International Working Group 2006 response criteria for myelodysplastic syndrome., Up to 20 weeks
