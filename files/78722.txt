A Study Of SIBP-01 Or CN-Trastuzumab Plus Docetaxel And Carboplatin In HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
The study will compare PK, efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of SIBP-01 (Trastuzumab Biosimilar) in combination with Docetaxel and Carboplatin versus Herceptin® (CN-Trastuzumab) approved in the CN in combination with Docetaxel and Carboplatin in patients with operable HER2 positive, with early or locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. The hypothesis to be tested in this study is the tpCR of patients with Cycle 6 of SIBP-01 is similar to CN-approved trastuzumab, using a 90% bilateral confidence interval between 0.74 and 1.5.
HER2-positive Early Breast Cancer
DRUG: SIBP-01|DRUG: Herceptin|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Total pathologic complete response (tpCR), Total Pathologic Complete Response (tpCR) Defined as the Absence of Invasive Neoplastic Cells in the Breast and Lymph Nodes(ypT0/is, ypN0). Following surgery after treatment completion, tumors were assessed as Complete Pathological Response, Partial Pathological Response, or No Pathological Response..The tpCR was assessed by the Independent Response Evaluation Committee (IREC), at the end of Cycle 6(each cycle is 3 weeks)
Breast pathologic complete response (bpCR), Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Defined as the Absence of Invasive Neoplastic Cells in the Breast and Lymph Nodes(ypT0/is). Following surgery after treatment completion, tumors were assessed as Complete Pathological Response, Partial Pathological Response, or No Pathological Response., at the end of Cycle 6(each cycle is 3 weeks)|Proportion of patients with steady-state trough concentration (Ctrough, ss) > 20 μg/mL, proportion of patients with Ctrough, ss\> 20 μg/mL after 5 cycles of administration (before cycle 6) accounting for all subjects with PK blood samples collected in each treatment group, after 5 cycles of treatment ( before cycle 6, each cycle is 3 weeks)|PK Evaluation After Multi-Dose Administration, Samples of blood were taken pre-dose on Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and at 0, 2, 4, 8, 72, 168, 336 hour post dose on Cycles 5 and 21 days post dose on cycle 6 for pharmacokinetic evaluation., Cycles 1 through 6 ( each cycle is 3 weeks )
