This is retrospective study. The patients treated with oral propranolol at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg per day. Growth parameters (height and weight) were measured at the beginning, the end of treatment and 2 years after treatment. The weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) and weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) calculated by the WHO Anthro software were used to assess physical development, and the WHO Child Growth Standards were used as the standards.
