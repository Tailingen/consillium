Neoadjuvant Camrelizumab With Dalpiciclib for Resectable Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas
The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and feasibility of anti-programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1) immunotherapy, Camrelizumab, combined with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 blockade, Dalpiciclib, as a new neoadjuvant treatment regimen for patients with resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCC).

Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) as determined by number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Maximum tolerated dose will be determined by the maximum dose at which the least number of participants experience dose-limiting toxicity. The dose limiting toxicity is defined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., Through the study completion, an average of 12 weeks|Major Pathologic Response, Major Pathologic Response (MPR) was defined as fewer than 10% viable tumor cells., Time of surgery|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of participants with measurable disease at baseline and have been re-evaluated after at least 1 cycle of therapy with observed reduction in tumor burden as defined by RECIST and iRECIST criteria after 2 doses of Proportion of participants with measurable disease at baseline and have been re-evaluated after at least 1 cycle of therapy with observed reduction in tumor burden as defined by RECIST and iRECIST criteria after 2 doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab., Through the study completion, an average of 12 weeks|Progression free survival(PFS), Proportion of participants who achieve progression free survival post treatment, Up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Proportion of participants who achieve survival post treatment, Up to 2 years
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common malignancies of the head and neck, accounting for 90% of head and neck cancer. The 5-year survival rate under standard treatment is only 50%. 70%\~80% of first diagnosed patients already developed into locally advanced status (stage II-Iva). In recent years, the use of neoadjuvant therapy (NAC) followed by surgery or radiotherapy has been advocated because of its higher probability of local/regional failure and distant metastasis after treatment. TPF (Docetaxel + Cisplatin + Fluorouracil) regimen is considered as the standard regimen of induced chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (especially in laryngeal cancer), which can significantly reduce the patient's distant metastasis rate and prolong overall survival (OS). However, the therapeutic effect of neoadjuvant therapy on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has reached a bottleneck. In recent years, PD-1 inhibitors have achieved significant effects in the field of tumor therapy and have been approved for the treatment of various tumors including recurrent metastatic head and neck tumors. There are also several prospective clinical research attempting to combine ICB with targeted therapeutic drugs for neoadjuvant therapy of HNSCC. The efficacy and safety results show potential synergy between these drugs.

Recent preclinical studies have shown that CDK4/6 inhibitors promote efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors through tumor antigen presentation enhancing, suppressed proliferation of regulatory T (Treg) cells, effector T- cell activation enhancing, and induction of T- cell memory. The previous study confirmed that CDK4/6 inhibitor combined with ICB can be administered safely in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma(HNSCC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma(NSCC).

In summary, the investigators designed this study to explore the safety and efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy, Camrelizumab, combined with CDK4/6 inhibitor, dalpiciclib, as a new neoadjuvant treatment regimen for patients with resectable HNSCC. It will also provide new ideas, strategies, and experimental evidence for the development of immunotherapy.
