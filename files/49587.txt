Early Detection of Prostate Cancer by FACS
Early detection of prostrate cancer and development of metastases. The research will attempt to match the SCM test (structuredness of the cytoplasmic matrix) in lymphocytes as an early cancer detection test using Florescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) as a replacement for the CellScan instrument. The test is based on measurement of cellular changes in response to the specific prostate antigen, PSA.
