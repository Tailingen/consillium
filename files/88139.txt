Study of the Weekly Oral RAD001 in Combination With Oral Topotecan in Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Endometrial Cancers
Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive tract. The majority of patients with endometrial cancer are diagnosed at an early stage and cured with surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy. However, a significant number of patients present with metastatic disease outside of the pelvis or develop recurrent disease after primary therapy.

mTOR inhibitors have been shown to be promising agents in reducing tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, in several solid cancers. Inhibitors of mTOR are primarily cytostatic in cancer cells; combination therapy with cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and other biologic agents may prove to be the most advantageous use of these drugs. mTOR inhibition with a rapamycin analogue demonstrated in vitro antiproliferative activity on endometrial AN3 CA and HEC-1-A tumor cells, and this inhibition of proliferation was found to be concentration dependent. Topotecan is an active agent in the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial cancers.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Topotecan|DRUG: RAD001
To determine the safety, dose-limiting toxicities,and maximum tolerated dose of daily oral RAD001 in combination with oral topotecan given on days 1-5 q 21 days in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancers, Upon completion of study
To determine if daily administration of RAD001 changes the pharmacokinetic profile of oral topotecan, and if oral topotecan changes the pharmacokinetic profile of oral RAD001., Upon completion of study|To determine the anti-tumor effect of the combination using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Upon completion of study
