Evaluation of Pancreatic Pseudocyst Drainage With a Metal Stent
The purpose of this study is to study the evaluation of the effectiveness of endoscopic Pancreatic Pseudocyst drainage using a metal stent.
Pancreatic Pseudocysts
PROCEDURE: Endoscopy
Technical Success of Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Single-access Pseudocyst Drainage With a Fully Covered Self-expanding Metal Stent ; Anchored With a Double Pigtail Plastic Stent Inserted Through the Metal Stent Lumen, Technical success was evaluated by the ability to achieved pseudocyst drainage after endoscopically placing a Fully Covered Self-expanding Metal Stent in the pseudocyst .

Technical failure was evaluated by the inability to fully drain the pancreas pseudocyst after endoscopically placing a Fully Covered Self-expanding Mental Stent in the pseudocyst., baseline
Resolution of Pancreatic Pseudocyst After Placement of Fully Covered Self-expanding Metal Stent (CSEMS)., 6 to 12 weeks after baseline|Adverse Events, 1 year
The purpose of this study is to study the evaluation of the effectiveness of endoscopic Pancreatic Pseudocyst drainage using a metal stent.
