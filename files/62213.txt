Monosialoganglioside(GM1) Preventing Neurotoxicity Induced by Cisplatin Contained Chemotherapy in NSCLC Patients
Evaluate the efficacy and safety of Monosialoganglioside(GM1) to prevent the neurotoxicity induced by cisplatin
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Monosialoganglioside(GM1)|DRUG: normal saline
incidence rate of neurotoxicity adverse events, up to 19 weeks after cisplatin chemotherapy
neurotoxicity adverse events alleviation time, up to 19 weeks after the cisplatin based chemotherapy
the quality of life of patients, up to 19 weeks after the cisplatin based chemotherapy
NSCLC patients received a cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy are included in this trial. Patients are randomly assigned into the experimental group and control group based on segmented block randomized method. After enrollment, patients should complete four or six chemotherapy and GM1/placebo injection. During the 3w per cycle chemotherapy, cisplatin injection is conducted in D1/D1-3, GM1/placebo (80mg+250ml N.S) is injected from D0 to D3. Neurotoxicity evaluation and quality of life (FACT-NTX and EROTC scale) assessment will be conducted every cycle and 3w/11w/19w after the chemotherapy.
