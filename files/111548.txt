Construction of Molecular Diagnostic Marker Model for Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Based on Pancreatic Cystic Fluid Samples
The goal of this observational study is to test in patients with cystic tumor of pancreas. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Screening of molecular diagnostic markers for pancreatic cystic tumors by cfDNA methylation sequencing of pancreatic cystic fluid and proteomic assays to distinguish benign from malignant and mucinous/non-mucinous, correlate with pathological features, and find molecular features associated with the degree of malignancy.

Participants will Provide post-operative cyst fluid specimens.

Patients with pancreatic cystic tumors were divided into control, mucinous tumor and non-mucinous tumor groups, and cfDNA molecules and protein molecules that were significantly altered between different groups were found by cfDNA methylation sequencing of pancreatic cystic fluid and proteomic detection techniques. Multi-omics analysis was performed to construct a more efficient molecular diagnostic marker model. Correlating models with pathological features to find molecular features associated with the degree of malignancy.
