PU-H71 in Patients With Solid Tumors and Low-Grade Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma That Have Not Responded to Standard Treatment
Background:

- PU-H71 is an experimental drug used to treat cancer. It works by blocking a protein in tumors. When this protein is blocked, it affects other proteins inside the cell that cancers need to grow. Researchers want to study whether PU-H71 is a safe and effective way to treat solid tumors and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Objectives:

- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of PU-H71 in solid tumors and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that have not responded to standard treatments.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that have not responded to standard treatments.

Design:

* Patients will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, and imaging studies.
* Patients will receive PU-H71 as a 1-hour dose on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle of treatment. The first treatment cycle will be done in the hospital so that patients can be monitored. The next treatment cycles will be done on an outpatient basis.
* Patients will have blood and urine tests and eye exams.
* Patients will provide tumor samples for study.
* Patients will have imaging studies to monitor tumor response to treatment.
* Patients will continue to take PU-H71 for as long as side effects remain tolerable and their tumor or lymphoma does not worsen. Study researchers may adjust the dose if needed.

DRUG: PU-H71
Number of Participants With Cycle 1 Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT was defined as an adverse event that occurred during cycle 1, was thought to be related to study drug administration, and met one of the following criteria: grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicities (except diarrhea, nausea, vomiting without maximal supportive therapy; alopecia), grade 4 hematologic toxicities (except lymphopenia), and grade 2 ocular toxicity that did not resolve to ≤ grade 1 within 2 weeks. Occurrence of a DLT resulted in a dose reduction following resolution to grade ≤ 2. No more than 2 dose reductions were allowed per patient on study., Cycle 1 (21 days)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events Possibly, Probably, or Definitely Related to Study Drug, Severity of adverse events were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Grade 1 Mild adverse event (AE), Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, and Grade 5 Death related to AE., 3 years and two months and 11 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of PU-H71, The MTD is the dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experience DLT during the first cycle of treatment, and the dose below that at which at least 2 (of ≤ 6) patients have DLT as a result of the drug., Cycle 1 (21 days)

Background:

-PU-H71 is a synthetic HSP90 inhibitor which can bind both open and closed conformations of HSP90. It demonstrates extended tumor retention and client protein degradation, while being rapidly cleared from normal tissues. It has shown complete tumor responses and retained sensitivity to retreatment in vivo.

Primary Objectives:

* To establish the safety and tolerability of PU-H71 administered on a once weekly, 2 weeks out of 3 schedule, in patients with refractory solid tumors and lowgrade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
* To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PU-H71 administered on a once weekly, 2 weeks out of 3 schedule, in patients with refractory solid tumors and low-grade NHL.
* To determine the pharmacokinetics of PU-H71 administered on a once weekly, 2 weeks out of 3 schedule, in patients with refractory solid tumors and low-grade NHL.

Secondary Objectives:

* To perform pharmacodynamic studies to ascertain PU-H71 effect on HSP70 in tumor tissue, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at the MTD.
* To perform pharmacodynamic studies to ascertain PU-H71 effect on HSP90 client proteins in tumor tissue at the MTD.

Eligibility:

-Study participants must have histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy or low-grade non-Hodgkin s lymphoma that has progressed or recurred after at least one line of chemotherapy or for which no standard treatment option exists; no therapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study; age greater than or equal to 18 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) less than or equal to 2; life expectancy \> 3 months; and adequate organ and marrow function. Patients entering on the expansion cohort at the MTD must have disease amenable to biopsy with willingness to undergo pre- and post-treatment biopsies.

Study Design:

* This study will follow a modified accelerated titration design (Simon et al., 1997).
* The accelerated phase ends when 1 patient experiences a dose-limiting toxicity or 2 patients experience Grade 2 drug-related toxicity during the first cycle; after which the study will follow the standard 3 + 3 design.
* PU-H71 will be administered intravenously over one hour, once weekly, 2 weeks out of 3, (i.e., on days 1 and 8) every 21 days.
* Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) studies will be conducted during cycle 1. Up to 10 additional patients will be entered at the MTD to further define toxicity and perform PD studies at this dose; pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies will be mandatory for these patients.
* Computed tomography (CT) scans will be performed at baseline and every 2 cycles (6 weeks) for restaging.
* Up to 100 patients may be treated.
