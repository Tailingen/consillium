Effect of I/R Injuries by Pringle Manoeuvre on the Prognosis of HCC Patients After Curative Hepatectomy
This is a multi-centre prospective randomized controlled trial to explore the influence of ischemia-reperfusion injuries elicited by pringle manoeuvre during radical excision on the prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Until now there are two popular procedures during the radical excision of primary liver cancer in our country.One is to give a pringle manoeuvre to control the operative blood loss,the other is using a combination of CUSA and Tissue-link to control the bleeding while without liver ischemia.According to the recent experimental studies in rats,we know that the ischemia and reperfusion injury may contribute to the metastasis of the tumor.In order to test the actual contribution of ischemia on human,we conduct this prospective clinical trial to compare the two popular procedures' effect on the prognosis of liver cancer patients undergoing radical excision.
