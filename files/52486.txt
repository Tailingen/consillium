A Phase 1 Dose-Escalation Study in Advanced Solid Tumors, Lymphomas or Multiple Myeloma
Phase 1 study to determine safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and recommended Phase 2 dose of AV-299 administered IV as monotherapy to patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. The study will also determine the safety, tolerability and DLTs of AV-299 in combination with erlotinib in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.
