An Observational Study on The Correlation Between Time of Initiation of Avastin (Bevacizumab) Treatment And Progression-Free Survival in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer (CRONOS 2)
This single arm, prospective, observational study will assess the correlation between the time from start of chemotherapy to the start of Avastin (bevacizumab) treatment with progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated metastatic breast cancer. Patients will be followed for up to 12 months after progressive disease occurs.
