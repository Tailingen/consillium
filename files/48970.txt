Colorectal Cancer Treated With Adjuvant Regorafenib Versus Placebo After Curative Treatment of Liver Metastases in a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase-III STudy
To evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of regorafenib versus placebo in subjects with colorectal cancer (CRC) after curative resection of liver metastasis and completion of all planned chemotherapy.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: Regorafenib (Stivarga, BAY73-4506)|DRUG: Placebo
Disease Free Survival (DFS) as Assessed by the Investigator, Disease free survival was evaluated by CT / MRI scans as assessed by the investigator, which was defined as the time (in days) from date of randomization to date of first observed radiographic disease recurrence (RECIST 1.1 criteria for measurable and non-measurable disease) or death due to any cause, if death occurred before disease recurrence was documented. For subjects without documented disease recurrence or death at the time of analysis, the DFS time was censored at the date of the last evaluable CT / MRI scan., From date of randomization to date of first observed radiographic disease recurrence (RECIST 1.1 criteria for measurable and non-measurable disease) or death due to any cause, if death occurred before disease recurrence was documented.
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time (days) from randomization to death due to any cause. The OS time for subjects alive at the time of analysis was censored at their last date known to be alive., Subjects who experienced disease recurrence (either during treatment or during Active Follow-up), or otherwise withdrew from the study for any reason other than death, were followed for overall survival unless consent was withdrawn.
