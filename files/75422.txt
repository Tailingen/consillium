Physical Exercise Therapy vs Relaxation in Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (PETRA)
The PETRA-Study is a randomized, controlled trial and designed to examine the effects of an one-year physical exercise intervention on prognosis, side-effects and complications after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

The exercise intervention includes both, resistance and endurance training. Patients assigned to the control group perform a relaxation program (progressive muscle relaxation - Jacobsen) and have the same frequency of social contact.
