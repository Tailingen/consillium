5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA) to Enhance Visualization of Malignant Tumor
In support of the US marketing application for 5-ALA, this single arm trial is being conducted to establish the efficacy and safety of Gliolan® (5-ALA) in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant gliomas. The hypothesis of the study is Gliolan® (5-ALA), as an adjunct to tumor resection, is safe and that real-time tissue fluorescence correlates with malignant histopathology. The primary objective in this single arm study is to define the positive predictive value (PPV) of Gliolan®-induced PPIX fluorescence for malignant tumor at the time of initial resection and first use of FGS by taking a biopsy of tissue presenting with red fluorescence when observed during the course of resection of new or recurrent malignant gliomas. The functionality and performance reliability of the blue light excitation microscope platforms will be assessed.
Malignant Gliomas
DRUG: Gliolan®|PROCEDURE: Fluorescence-Guided Surgery
Incidence of diagnostic tissue presence, Pathologic confirmation of tumor type will be made by a pathologist who will not be informed of the fluorescence status of the tissue samples., 6 weeks
Presence of malignant glioma tumor cells, Pathologic confirmation of tumor type will be made by a pathologist who will not be informed of the fluorescence status of the tissue samples., 6 weeks|WHO tumor type with grading, Pathologic confirmation of tumor type will be made by a pathologist who will not be informed of the fluorescence status of the tissue samples., 6 weeks|Ki-67 proliferation index, Ki-67 is a prognostic marker for cancer, 6 weeks|Karnofsky Performance Scale, Scale from 0-100, function from low to high, with 100 being normal, 6 weeks
Primary Objectives

* To determine whether Gliolan® (5-ALA)-induced PPIX fluorescence correlates with malignant tumor histopathology (in a minimum of 3-5 serial biopsies taken from the red fluorescent region of tissue resection).
* To determine the patient safety profile of both oral Gliolan® (5-ALA), as well as use of the fluorescence operative microscope. These will include use of commonly accepted toxicity measures as well as recording surgically-related neurological deficits within the six weeks after surgery.
* To determine functionality and performance reliability of the blue light excitation microscope platforms (Zeiss Pentero, Leica OH4, Leica OH6 and others).

Secondary Objectives

* To correlate PPIX-containing extracellular microvesicles recovered from blood (at multiple time points prior to and following tumor resection) with the pre-operative MRI tumor volume.
* To characterize the presence and longitudinal changes in microvesicle biomarkers recovered from blood evaluating EGFRvIII, IDH1/2 wt and mutations and others. These microvesicular blood genes will be identified and correlated with the same microvesicular genes identified in tissue at the time of surgery.
