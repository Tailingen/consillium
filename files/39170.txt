HTA of NIVATS Based on RWE
This research focuses on a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for lung nodules. Lung cancer, one of the most prevalent malignancies globally, has a high incidence and mortality rate, particularly in China. Traditional treatments like thoracotomy are highly invasive, while conventional thoracoscopic surgery can induce anesthesia-related complications. Non-intubated VATS offers a promising alternative by avoiding intubation and mechanical ventilation, thus reducing complications, anesthesia burden, and recovery time.

The study aims to comprehensively assess the clinical effectiveness, safety, and economic viability of non-intubated VATS for lung cancer treatment through systematic literature reviews, real-world evidence (RWE), and cost-effectiveness analysis. The research will also explore patient preferences using discrete choice experiments (DCE).

By evaluating this technology from a Chinese perspective, the study seeks to provide evidence-based recommendations for the broader adoption of non-intubated VATS in clinical settings.
Lung Cancer
Patient-reported Outcomes, The primary outcome will be assessed using two validated instruments: the Anderson Symptom Inventory (lung cancer-specific module) and the EQ-5D. The Anderson Symptom Inventory will measure symptom severity (e.g., pain, fatigue, nausea, sleep disturbance) and the impact of symptoms on daily functioning, while the EQ-5D will evaluate overall health-related quality of life, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The scores will provide insight into patients' recovery and well-being following non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) compared to traditional intubated thoracic surgery., Measured within 3 days post-surgery|Postoperative hospitalization time, The secondary outcome will measure the duration of the postoperative hospital stay. This will be assessed as the number of days from the completion of surgery to the patient's discharge. The goal is to compare the efficiency of recovery between patients undergoing non-intubated video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and those receiving traditional intubated thoracic surgery., Measured in days from surgery completion to hospital discharge.
