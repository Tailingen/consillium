By Using Adoptive Transfer of Autologous NK Cells to Prevent Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Curative Therapy
To prove that the efficacy and safety of 'NK group' is superior to 'non-treatment group(Control group)' in patient undergone curative resection(RFA or operation) for hepatocellular carcinoma in China.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: NK cells|OTHER: Curative therapy
Recurrence Free Survival(RFS) :RFS was measured from the date of randomization to the first recurrence or to death from any cause., 3 years|Overall Survival(OS) :Overall survival was measured from the date of randomization until death from any cause., 3 years
No adjuvant therapy has been shown to extend the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving curative treatment.We investigated whether injections of NK cells prolongs recurrence-free survival of patients after curative therapy.
