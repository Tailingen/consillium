Medication Adherence and Non-adherence in Adults With Rare Disease
The purpose of this study is to use the Medication Adherence Reasons Scale (MAR-Scale) to determine the extent of non-adherence to specific medications indicated to treat cystic fibrosis, hemophilia (A or B), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, myasthenia gravis, and sickle cell disease, and to identify the top patient-reported reasons for non-adherence. Internal reliability of the MAR-Scale will also be assessed in each condition.
