Role of Proton Pump Inhibitors on the Postoperative Course Following Pancreaticoduodenectomy
The purpose of this study is to prospectively determine the effects of administering proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) following pancreaticoduodenectomy on postoperative outcomes. The findings of this study will help in avoiding the widespread use of PPIs during the immediate postoperative period following pancreatic surgery.
