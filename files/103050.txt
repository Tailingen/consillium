S0801 Iodine I 131 Tositumomab, Rituximab, and Combination Chemotherapy in Previously Untreated Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Follicular Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as iodine I 131 tositumomab, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody together with rituximab and combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving iodine I 131 tositumomab together with rituximab and combination chemotherapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with previously untreated stage II, stage III, or stage IV follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Percentage of Participants With 3-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), Measured from date of registration to date of first observation of progressive disease or death due to any cause. Progressive disease is ≥ 50% increase in the sum of products of greatest diameters (SPD) of target measurable nodal lesions over the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease during therapy), or ≥ 50% increase in the greatest transverse diameter (GTD) of any node \> 1 cm in shortest axis, or ≥ 50% increase in the SPD of other target measurable lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules) over the smallest sum observed. Appearance of any new bone marrow involvement; appearance of a new lesion/site; lymph nodes with the long axis is \> 1.5 cm, or if the both the long and short axes are \> 1 cm; in patients with no pretreatment PET scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, lesions should be PET positive; or death due to disease without prior documentation of progression., 0-3 years
5-year Progression-free Survival, Measured from date of registration to date of first observation of progressive disease or death due to any cause. Progressive disease is ≥ 50% increase in the sum of products of greatest diameters (SPD) of target measurable nodal lesions over the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease during therapy), or ≥ 50% increase in the greatest transverse diameter (GTD) of any node \> 1 cm in shortest axis, or ≥ 50% increase in the SPD of other target measurable lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules) over the smallest sum observed. Appearance of any new bone marrow involvement; appearance of a new lesion/site; lymph nodes with the long axis is \> 1.5 cm, or if the both the long and short axes are \> 1 cm; in patients with no pretreatment PET scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, lesions should be PET positive; or death due to disease without prior documentation of progression., 0-5 years|5-year Overall Survival, Measured from date of registration to date of death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive and are censored at date of last contact., 0-5 years|Response Rate, Complete (CR), complete unconfirmed (CRU) and partial responses (PR). CR is complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease with the exception of the following. Positron emission tomography (PET) must be negative if no pre-treatment PET scan or when the PET was positive before therapy. If the PET scan was negative before therapy, all nodal masses must have regressed. no new lesions; previously enlarged organs must have regressed in size; and if bone marrow positive at baseline, it must be negative. PR is ≥ 50% decrease in sum of products of greatest diameters (SPD) for up to six identified dominant lesions identified at baseline; no new lesions; no increase in the size of liver, spleen or other nodes; and splenic and hepatic nodules must have regressed in size by at least 50% in SPD. In patients with no pre-treatment PET scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, PET should be positive in at least one previously involved site., up to 5 years (1 year induction + 4 years maintenance therapy) or time of disease progression|Number of Patients With Grade 3 Through Grade 5 Adverse Events That Are Related to Study Drug, Adverse Events (AEs) are reported by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. For each patient, worst grade of each event type is reported. Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening, Grade 5 = Fatal., up to 5 years (1 year induction + 4 years maintenance therapy) or time of disease progression.
OBJECTIVES:

* To evaluate the response rate in patients with previously untreated stage II-IV follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone (R-CHOP) in combination with iodine I 131 tositumomab.
* To evaluate the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* To estimate the 3-year progression-free survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.
* To estimate the 5-year progression-free and overall survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.
* To assess the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

* Induction therapy: Patients receive R-CHOP\* comprising rituximab IV, cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 and oral prednisone once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with at least stable disease then proceed to consolidation therapy.

NOTE: \*Patients receive R-CHOP in courses 1-4 and CHOP alone in courses 5 and 6.

* Consolidation therapy: Within 12 weeks after completion of induction therapy, patients receive tositumomab IV over 1 hour followed by a dosimetric dose of iodine I 131 tositumomab IV over 20 minutes. Patients then undergo whole body gamma camera scans over a 1-week period to determine the rate of total body clearance of radioactivity and the therapeutic dose of iodine I 131 tositumomab. Within 7-14 days after the dosimetric dose, patients receive tositumomab IV over 1 hour followed by a therapeutic dose of iodine I 131 tositumomab IV over 20 minutes. Patients with at least stable disease then proceed to maintenance therapy.
* Maintenance therapy: Beginning approximately 1 year after study entry and no more than 28 days after restaging, patients receive rituximab IV every 3 months for up to 4 years (16 courses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of maintenance therapy, patients are followed annually for up to 7 years. Patients who do not complete maintenance therapy are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for up to 7 years.
