PTK and Letrozole in Post-menopausal Women With Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of PTK787/ZK222584 and Letrozole when given in combination, and to see what effects they have on breast cancer that has metastasized.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: PTK787/ZK222584|DRUG: Letrozole
Assess the effect of the combination of letrozole & PTK787/ZK222584 on disease progression., 24 weeks after starting PTK787/ZK222584
Evaluate the response rate (CR and PR), Completion of treatment|Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of drugs, 30 days after completion of study treatment|Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of the combination of drugs, Cycle 3 Day 1|Evaluate the modulation of tumor blood flow and blood vessel permeability in response to PTK787/ZK222584 when administered in combination with letrozole using Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cycle 1 Day 28|Evaluate the effect on circulating tumor cells, Determined by the commerical Immunocon cell search assay, Completion of treatment|Compare outcome of patients receiving letrozole and PTK787/ZK222584 (cases) with control patients from pivotal trials of letrozole in the first and second line setting., Matching the cases and controls for line of therapy, sites of disease and duration of prior aromatase inhibitor therapy before the study patient initiates PTK787/ZK222584 treatment., 30 days after completion of study treatment|Evaluate polymorphisms in relevant drug metabolism genes to determine the molecular basis for interactions between letrozole and PTK787/ZK222584 should they occur., Completion of treatment|Correlate serum LDH level with clinical response, Completion of treatment|With additional patient consent, collect peripheral blood cells, serum, plasma, and representative tumor tissue specimens for future correlative science studies, Baseline visit
