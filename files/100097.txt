Gene Expression Profiling of Metastatic Breast Cancer Predict the Therapeutic Response to Chemotherapy
The investigators want to develop a gene expression profile the for prediction the chemotherapeutic response of patients with metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasms|Neoplasm Metastasis
Chemotherapy response, Response to chemotherapy is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST) guidelines, four-months
Time to disease progression, Time to disease progression is measured from the date therapy is initiated to the date of documented disease progression., six months|Overall survival, Overall survival is measured from the date therapy is initiated to the date of death or final follow-up., one year|clinical benefit response, clinical benefit response include CR,PR,SD, six months to one year
1. Metastatic breast cancer tissue is obtained from core needle biopsies pretreatment and is flash frozen and stored at -70â„ƒ until processing.
2. After patients received docetaxel combination thiotepa for two cycles, response is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST) guidelines. Degree of response is used to divide the cancers into two groups-sensitive and resistant tumours.
3. The gene expression in metastatic breast cancer tissue sample is detected by microarray to screen gene markers that are differently expressed between groups
4. Statistical analysis is performed using unsupervised hierarchical cluster.
