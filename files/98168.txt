Clinical Study of Anlotinib in Maintenance Treatment of Advanced NSCLC
Based on the need of clinical practice of maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC and the reliable data of third-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the investigators designed a clinical study of antinil hydrochloride versus pemetrexed in maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of antinil hydrochloride in maintenance therapy for advanced NSCLC. Value, to provide a scientific basis for prolonging the survival time of patients with advanced NSCLC, improving the quality of life of patients in the course of treatment, and optimizing treatment strategies to a greater extent.
Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Anlotinib
PFS, Progression free survival, 5 month
OS, Overall survival, through study completion, an average of 18 month
This study is planned to be carried out in Jiangsu regional multi-center. 83 cases are preliminarily expected to be included. The study started in December 2018 and ended in December 2019. It is expected that the trial will end in December 2020.
