A Study to Evaluate PK, Efficacy, and Safety of BAT3306 Plus Chemo and Compare With Keytruda®(EU/US) in Participants With IV nqNSCLC
To compare the pairwise PK similarities between BAT3306, EU-Keytruda, and US-Keytruda, all administered with pemetrexed and carboplatin.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: BAT3306|DRUG: EU-Keytruda®|DRUG: US-Keytruda®|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin
clinical equivalence, To compare the efficacy of BAT3306 and pooled EU-Keytruda® and US-Keytruda® given with chemotherapy as first line treatment using ORR assessed by BIRC to show clinical equivalence in participants with nsNSCLC. Confirmed best overall tumor response rate as assessed by BIRC according to RECIST Version 1.1 (tumor assessments after initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment are excluded), Week 3,5,7,9,12,15,EOT
safety of BAT3306, The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AE that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or the study, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study., From signed ICF to 90days after the last drug administration
This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized study that includes PK and clinical equivalence comparisons, aimed at comparing BAT3306 with Keytruda® in previously untreated participants with Stage IV nsNSCLC.
