Phase 1/2 Study of Enzastaurin in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) and Gliosarcoma (GS) Patients
There will be 2 phases in this study. Patients will either be enrolled to the first phase or to the second phase, depending upon when they enroll into the study.

The first phase of this study is done to evaluate the safety of enzastaurin in patients. This is done by gradually increasing the dose of the drug in small groups of patients and watching closely for side effects.

In the second phase of the study, the dose determined to be safe will be used with temozolomide during and following radiation therapy to see if the combination can help patients with brain tumors live longer.

DRUG: enzastaurin|DRUG: temozolomide|RADIATION: radiation therapy
Phase 1- Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Enzastaurin, Phase 1- dose escalation of enzastaurin in 2 cohorts up to 6 participants each in order to assess MTD. After radiation/enzastaurin 250 mg per day/temozolomide 75 mg/m\^2 therapy, if no more than 1 of 6 patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) or tumor progression, participants completed one 28-day cycle. If no significant toxicity after the first cycle, participants received subsequent cycles. If no more than 1 of the 6 patients treated at 250 mg of enzastaurin experienced a DLT, up to 6 more patients could be entered at escalated dose cohort of enzastaurin (500 mg)., Until MTD can be determined (up to 12 cycles, 28 days per cycle)|Phase 1 and Phase 2 - Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from surgical diagnosis to the date of death from any cause. For participants who were alive, OS was censored at the last contact., Baseline to death from any cause (Up to 48 weeks)
Phase 1 - Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Summaries of serious AEs (SAEs) and all other non-serious AEs are located in the Reported Adverse Event Module., Every cycle (up to 12 cycles, 28 days per cycle)|Phase 1 and 2: Association Between Biomarkers and Clinical Outcome, Phosphorylated-S6 (pS6) ribosomal protein is a biomarker that's being investigated as a potential marker for clinical outcome using 2211 or 2215 antibody to pS6. Reported here are the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for participants for whom an pS6 immunohistochemistry (IHC) score was available. The IHC assays were scored using a 0 to +3 scoring system (no positive staining was scored 0; at least 25% immunoreactivity of cells was scored +1; 26% to 75% was scored +2; and 76% or greater was scored +3). Hazard ratio (HR) \> 1 indicates worse outcome for that IHC score., Baseline, Cycle 2, end of study (up to 12 cycles, 28 days per cycle)|Phase 1 - Response Rate With Macdonald Criteria, Response categories: complete response (CR): disappearance of all enhancing tumor on consecutive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at least 1 month apart, off steroids, and neurologically stable or improved. Partial response (PR): 50% reduction in size of enhancing tumor on consecutive MRI scans at least 1 month apart, steroids stable or reduced, and neurologically stable or improved. Progressive disease (PD): \>25% increase in size of enhancing tumor or any new tumor on MRI scans, or neurologically worse, and steroids stable or increased. Stable disease (SD): all other situations., Baseline, following radiation, every other cycle (up to 12 cycles, 28 days per cycle)|Phase 2 - Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Summaries of serious AEs (SAEs) and all other non-serious AEs are located in the Reported Adverse Event Module., Every cycle (28 days per cycle)|Number of Participants Undergoing Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) for Clinical Evaluation at Baseline, Number of patients having MRI/MRS for clinical evaluation with baseline assessment., Each radiologic assessment (up to 12 cycles, 28 days per cycle)|Phase 1 and 2 - Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of disease progression, or death due to any cause., Baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 12 cycles, 28 days per cycle)|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACT-Br), Total FACT-Br score includes physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and additional concerns related to brain tumors. The score ranges 0 to 200, with a higher score representing better quality of life., Every cycle (up to 12 cycles, 28 days per cycle)|M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory - Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT), General and brain tumor-specific symptoms each assessed on a scale of 0 to 10, with a higher score representing higher symptom burden. The 4 symptom scales reported as changing over the course of the study are listed here., Every cycle (up to 12 cycles, 28 days per cycle)|Phase 1- Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Observed Drug Concentration During 1 Dosing Interval at Steady State (Cmax,ss) for Enzastaurin, LY326020, and Total Analyte (Enzastaurin + LY326020) When Enzastaurin Administered With or Without Temozolomide, Cmax,ss was calculated using concentration versus time data of enzastaurin, LY326020, and Total Analyte (enzastaurin + LY326020) when 250 mg or 500 mg enzastaurin was administered alone or with 75 mg/m\^2 temozolomide. Data are reported as Geometric Mean and Geometric Coefficient of Variation (%)., Cycle 1 Day 22, Cycle 2 Day 5, 28 days per Cycle|Phase 1 and 2- Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve During 1 Dosing Interval at Steady State (AUCτ,ss) for Enzastaurin, LY326020 and Total Analyte (Enzastaurin + LY326020) When Enzastaurin Administered With or Without Temozolomide, AUCτ,ss was calculated using concentration versus time data of enzastaurin, LY326020, and total analyte (enzastaurin + LY326020). Data are reported as Geometric Mean and Geometric Coefficient of Variation (%)., Phase 1, Cycle 1 Day 22, Cycle 2 Day 5 of a 28 day Cycle; Phase 2, Cycle 1 Day 22 of a 28 day Cycle
