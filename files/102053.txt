Early Recovery After "Wedge Resection" Surgery to Remove Lung Mestastasis Secondary to Bone Cancer.
After "wedge resection" surgery, the physiotherapy programs proposed in the literature are heterogeneous and there are few data on the outcomes of such treatments in an oncological population for bone cancer.

The aim of the study is to describe the early rehabilitation process after wedge resection surgery secondary to bone tumor pulmonary mestasasis, highlightining the possible functional recovery in the short and medium term after surgery and indentifying the possible prognostic factors.

In Italy, the incidence of primary bone tumors is around 0.8-1 case per 100,000 inhabitants, therefore an estimated 500 new cases of primary malignant bone tumors are estimated each year, affecting more frequently in children and young people. The presence of pulmonary metastasis occurs in 30% of the population with bone cancer and is the most common site of metastasis. Where possible, the elective treatment of lung metastases is ablative surgery and the wedge resection technique is also commonly used in the event of repeated metastasis over time. Pulmonary wedge resection surgery does not follow the anatomical limits of the lung but it is customized according to the metastatic area to be removed, thus differentiating itself from lobectomies and other thoracotomy surgical techniques.

The trend of vital capacity (CV) and forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), after wedge resection surgery, significantly decrease at 3 months compared to the preoperative evaluation, while at 12 months the CV returns to values close to the preoperative ones and FEV1 remains significantly lower. Rehabilitation treatment is part of the multidisciplinary approach for this type of patient in order to prevent post-surgical respiratory complications (PPC) and shoulder girdle dysfunctions, in the treatment of pain and in the recovery of respiratory volumes. Several authors, describing the physiotherapy treatment techniques, include breathing exercises (Active Cycle Breathing Techniques), early mobilization exercises for the lower limbs and the use of volume incentives. The physiotherapy treatment programs proposed in the literature are heterogeneous and there are no data on the feasibility of such treatments in an oncological population for bone cancer.

Patients are enrolled consecutively in a ward of an italian hospital specialized in bone tumor surgery.
