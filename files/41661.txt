A Phase II Study of Cetuximab Plus Irinotecan in Patients With EGFR-detectable Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma
To evaluate the response rate of cetuximab plus irinotecan combination therapy in subjects with EGFR-detectable metastatic colorectal carcinoma who have documented progressive disease to irinotecan-based chemotherapy and who have failed (progressive disease or intolerance) previous oxaliplatin-based and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapies.
Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: Cetuximab
Response according to the RECIST criteria accessed every 6 weeks
Time to progression, duration of achieved response, and the disease control rate will be accessed in all patients who received Cetuximab. The worst toxicity grades per patients will be tabulated for adverse events and laboratory measurements.
