A Study to Evaluate the Safety , Tolerability and Efficacy of IBI939 in Combination With Sintilimab in Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer
This study is an open-label, phase I clinical study to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of recombinant fully human anti-TIGIT antibody (IBI939) in combination with recombinant fully human anti-programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) antibody (sintilimab) in subjects with advanced lung cancer.
