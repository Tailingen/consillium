Development of MRF for Characterization of Brain Tumors After Radiotherapy
The purpose of this study is to discover the potential convenience and ease of using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique, named Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (or MRF), to achieve high-quality images within a short scan time of 5 min for viewing the entire brain. This is an advanced quantitative assessment of brain tissues. This method is being applied with IVIM MRI to be able to tell the difference between a brain with radiation necrosis and a brain with tumor recurrence. Participants will consist of individuals who have received radiation therapy in the past and were diagnosed with radiation necrosis, individuals with recurrent tumors, individuals with previously untreated tumors, and healthy individuals who have no brain diseases and have not had radiation treatment to the brain. Participants will undergo an MRI scan at a one-time research study visit; no extra tests or procedures will be required for this research study.

The primary objectives of this study are:

* To demonstrate the clinical feasibility of combining MRF with state-of-the-art parallel imaging techniques to achieve high-resolution quantitative imaging within a reasonable scan time of 5 min for whole brain coverage.
* To apply the developed quantitative approach in combination with IVIM MRI for differentiation of tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis.
* To investigate the effect of radiation dose on the development of radiation necrosis and tumor recurrence.

Comparison of T1 relaxation times, The primary objective is to use MRF and IVIM MRI to demonstrate clinical feasibility and differentiation of tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis. This will be measured by the 3D-MRF T1 relaxation times. The difference in mean T1 between each cohort of participants will be measured., Within the total 30-45 minute scan time|Comparison of T2 relaxation times, The primary objective is to use MRF and IVIM MRI to demonstrate clinical feasibility and differentiation of tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis. This will be measured by the 3D-MRF T2 relaxation times. The difference in mean T2 between each cohort of participants will be measured., Within the total 30-45 minute scan time|Comparison of proton density maps, The primary objective is to use MRF and IVIM MRI to demonstrate clinical feasibility and differentiation of tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis. This will be measured by comparing the MRF proton density maps of each cohort of participants. This will be compared using a t-test., Within the total 30-45 minute scan time|Comparison of water diffusion in brain tissues, The primary objective is to use MRF and IVIM MRI to demonstrate clinical feasibility and differentiation of tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis. This will be measured by comparing the diffusion parameters measured by the IVIM method between the three cohorts of participants. This will be compared using a t-test., Within the total 30-45 minute scan time|Comparison of blood perfusion in brain tissues, The primary objective is to use MRF and IVIM MRI to demonstrate clinical feasibility and differentiation of tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis. This will be measured by comparing the perfusion parameters measured by the IVIM method between the three cohorts of participants. This will be compared using a t-test., Within the total 30-45 minute scan time|Comparison of MRF imaging tool in different participant populations, The objective is to compare the effects of radiation dose on development of radiation and necrosis and tumor recurrence by comparing participants in all cohorts (healthy participants with no brain disease, participants with brain tumors (treated), participants with brain metastases or primary gliomas (previously untreated)). The predictive ability will be assessed by comparing univariable ROC analysis, quantified using area under the curve (AUC)., Within the total 30-45 minute scan time
Although Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is utilized as an effective treatment method, after several months to over 1 year following SRS, 33% of treated brain metastases increase in size on imaging, which is suspicious for tumor progression. However, based on findings in follow-up biopsies, the majority of newly detected metastases on imaging are radiation treatment effects instead of active tumor. So far, the only gold standard to differentiate active tumor and radiation necrosis is surgical resection for pathologic confirmation, which is invasive, not favored for poor surgical candidates, and should be avoided in cases of necrosis. The existing clinical imaging techniques have poor sensitivity or specificity in differentiating these two types of tissues. Recently, a novel MRI data acquisition approach, namely MR Fingerprinting (MRF), has been introduced for the simultaneous measurement of multiple important parameters in a single MRI scan. In addition, quantitative diffusion MRI, such as the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) technique, can provide a noninvasive and powerful tool to quantify microstructural information by measuring water diffusion and microcirculation perfusion in vivo. This study aims to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of combining MRF with state-of-the-art parallel imaging techniques to achieve high-resolution quantitative imaging within a reasonable scan time of 5 min for whole brain coverage. It also aims to apply the developed quantitative approach in combination with IVIM MRI for the differentiation of tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis. The multi-parametric quantitative measures developed in this study could establish a new fundamental biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of brain tumors.
