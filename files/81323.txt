An Exploratory Study on the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors by Fast CAR T Cells
This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of fast autologous mesothelin (MSLN)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (MSLN-CAR) T cells secreting PD-1 nanobodies in patients with solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: Fast CAR T cells
Dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), Safety, 28 days
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Tolerability, 28 days|Objective response rate (ORR), Clinical response will be assessed by RECIST 1.1, Month 12|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS of patients receiving Fast CAR T cells, Month 12|Overall survival (OS), OS of patients receiving Fast CAR T cells, Month 12|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetics (PK), Month 12|AUC, Pharmacokinetics (PK), Month 12|Pharmacodynamics (PD), D of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IFN-γ, TNF-α and MCP1 will be analysed after CAR T cell infusion, Day 28
The main aim of this study is to determin the safety and efficacy of BZT2312 in patients with solid tumors. BZT2312 is an autologous mesothelin (MSLN)-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (MSLN-CAR) T cells secreting PD-1 nanobodies.

This study comprises of a screening phase(less than or equal to 28 days prior to apheresis) followed by apheresis(will occur upon enroiiment); Apheresis phase(less than or equal to 10 days prior to infusion ) followed by lymphodepletion. lymphodepletion phase (from day -5 to day -3) followed by infusion.Treatment Phase including infusion of BZT2312 on Day0 and then post-infusion assessments from Day1 to Day 28; and a Post-treatment Phase(Day 29 and up to end of the study). Efficacy will be explored to assessed and safety will be closely monitored during the study.
