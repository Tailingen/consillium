Study of BC3195 Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase I study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Preliminary Efficacy of BC3195 in Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: Drug: BC3195 for Injection
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) ., Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) will be assessed At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days).
This is a phase I study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Preliminary Efficacy of BC3195 in Patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors.

The patients in whom standard treatment has failed (either due to disease progression or intolerance), who meet the criteria will receive BC3195 via intravenous (IV) in 21-day treatment cycles.

A Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be established to decide the dose levels to be administered and dose regimen during dose escalation based on a thorough review of all the safety, PK (if applicable), and other relevant data from the previous dose cohort, and to determine the MTD and the putative RP2D for dose expansion.
