Patient-derived Organoids Predicts the Clinical Efficiency of Colorectal Liver Metastasis
Accumulating evidence indicates that patient- derived organoids (PDOs) can predict drug responses in the clinic. Metastasis is the main cause of death in colorectal cancer patients, and the treatment of patients with liver metastasis remains poor. Tumor heterogeneity is the cause of treatment failure. In this study, we aim the investigate the consistency of drug sensitivity for the matched primary and metastatic tumor in patients with liver metastasis.
Explore the Consistency of Drug Sensitivity Between Primary Colorectal Cancer and Liver Metastases
The consistency of drug sensitivity, To test the consistency of drug sensitivity of primary tumor and its matched liver metastasis, 3 years
The establishment of PDO, To test the rate of PDO derived from primary and matched metastatic colorectal cancer ., 3 years
