LISH Trial for the Hepatic Flexure and Proximal Transverse Colon Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the long-term outcomes of Laparoscopic Ileocecal-Sparing Right Hemicolectomy(LISH) compared to traditional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy(TRH) in the treatment of hepatic flexure colon cancer and proximal transverse colon cancer.
Hepatic Flexure Colon Cancer|Proximal Transverse Colon Cancer
PROCEDURE: LISH （Laparoscopic Ileocecal-Sparing Right Hemicolectomy）|PROCEDURE: TRH（Traditional Laparoscopic Right Hemicolectomy）
3-year disease free survival, the time from enrollment until disease relapse or death from any cause 3 years after surgery, 3 years
Postoperative complications, Complications occurring within 30 days after surgery, classified according to the Clavien-Dindo system, including intraoperative, short-term, and long-term postoperative complications.Index (CCI) will be recorded, up to 30 days after surgery|Metastasis rate of harvested lymph nodes, according to the pathological report, up to 2 weeks after surgery|Quality of CME (complete mesocolic excision), After the specimen had been harvested, photographs of the anterior and posterior aspects of the specimens were uploaded to the electronic data capture system. On the basis of the anterior and posterior photographs, the specimens were classified into three groups of the quality of CME: grade I, intact mesocolon; grade II laceration in the mesocolon; and grade III laceration in the mesocolon reaching the bowel., up to 2 weeks after surgery|Length of resected specimen, On the basis of the anterior and posterior photographs, the length of resected specimen were measured., up to 2 weeks after surgery|Resection margins distance, On the basis of the anterior and posterior photographs, the distal and proximal resection margins distance of the resected intestinal specimen were measured., up to 2 weeks after surgery|Vascular pedicle length of resected specimen, On the basis of the anterior and posterior photographs, the vascular pedicle length of the resected intestinal specimen were measured., up to 2 weeks after surgery|Positive margin rate, positive margin rate of resected specimen according to the pathological report, up to 2 weeks after surgery|Incidence rates of polyps, the incidence rates of polyps as seen on colonoscopy at 1, 3 and 5 years after surgery respectively., 5 years|Incidence rates of adenomas, the incidence rates of adenomas as seen on colonoscopy at 1, 3 and 5 years after surgery respectively., 5 years|Scores from the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), scores from the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) at 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery respectively., 3 years|Scores from the EQ-5D-5L Quality of Life Scale, scores from the EQ-5D-5L Quality of Life Scale at 1, 2, and 3 years after surgery respectively., 3 years|5-year overall survival rate (OS), The proportion of patients who survived 5 years after surgery, taking into account any cause of death., 5 years
Conversion Rate from Laparoscopic to Open Surgery, The proportion of laparoscopic surgeries that are converted to open surgeries due to intraoperative complications, technical challenges, or other clinical reasons., Intraoperative period|LISH Surgery Completion Rate, The proportion of patients in whom the LISH procedure is successfully completed without conversion to TRH or other alternative surgical approaches., Intraoperative period|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) via Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA), Detection of MRD using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker., Preoperative (7 days), postoperative (7 days), and 3 months post-surgery|Short- and Long-Term Changes in Gut Microecology, Analysis of gut microbiota, epithelial cells, stromal cells, immune cells, and metabolic products using fecal samples and intestinal biopsy tissues., Preoperative, postoperative 3 months, 6 months and 12 months|Glycemic Metabolic Indicators - Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), Measurement of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels to assess long-term glycemic control., Preoperative, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-surgery|Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), Evaluation of glucose metabolism by measuring blood glucose and insulin levels at 0, 30, 60, 120 minutes after oral glucose administration., Preoperative, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-surgery|Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Calculation of insulin sensitivity using fasting glucose and insulin levels, Preoperative, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-surgery
This study is a prospective, multicenter, open-labeled, randomized controlled clinical trial. The enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to either the LISH or TRH group in a 1:1 ratio and will receive the corresponding surgery. The primary endpoint: 3-year disease free survival. The second endpoint: (1)90-day postoperative complications; (2)Pathology-related indicators, including positive margin rate, number of harvested lymph nodes and lymph node metastasis rate;(3) 5-year overall survival rate (OS)
