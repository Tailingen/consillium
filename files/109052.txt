A Phase II Study of Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer using a tissue collection component.
Resectable Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: FOLFIRINOX
Percentage of Patients With Pathologic Complete Response, Pathologic complete response was evaluated using MRI or CT and Evan's criteria for pathologic response following neoadjuvant therapy:

I: \<10% to no tumor cells destroyed IIa: 10-50% of tumor cells destroyed IIb: 50-90% of tumor cells destroyed III: \>90% of tumor cells destroyed IIIM: sizable pools of cellular mucin IV: No viable tumor cells (complete pathologic response) IVM: Acellular pools of mucin, Up to 4 months
Number of Patients With Treatment-Related Adverse Events Grade 3 or Above, Number of unique patients who had a treatment-related (possible, probable, or definite) adverse event with grade 3 or greater using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0., Every 15 days for approximately 6 months|Percentage of Patients Who Successfully Underwent Surgery After Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX, The percentage of patients who successfully underwent surgery after neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX and its 95% confidence interval will be provided., Up to 4 months|Rate of R0 Resection, The percentage of patients with a final margin status of R0 after resection of their primary tumor and its 95% confidence interval will be provided. R0 resection indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no cancer cells seen microscopically at the primary tumor site., Up to 4 months|Disease Free Survival, Disease free survival is defined as the time from on study date to evidence of tumor recurrence or death from any cause. Patients who remained alive and disease free were censored at their date of last disease evaluation., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from on study date to death due to any cause. Patients who remained alive were censored at their last known alive date. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the median and 95% confidence interval., Up to 4 years|Objective Response Rate (Percentage of Patients With Complete Response or Partial Response), Measured by RECIST v1.1 Complete response: Disappearance of all target lesions Partial response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter

The percentage of patients with objective response and its 95% confidence interval will be provided., Up to 4 months|Disease Control Rate (Percentage of Patients With Complete Response, Partial Response, or Stable Disease), Measured by RECIST v1.1

Complete response: Disappearance of all target lesions Partial response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter Stable disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started

The percentage of patients with objective response and its 95% confidence interval will be provided., Up to 4 months
