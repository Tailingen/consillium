Study on the Efficacy of Treatment by Radiotherapy and Pembrolizumab in Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Head & Neck Cancers
Study to evaluate the efficacy of treatment by radiotherapy and pembrolizumab in newly diagnosed metastatic head \& neck cancers
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Loco-regional radiotherapy|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression-free survival (PFS), The progression-free survival is the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 3 years.
Overall survival (OS), The overall survival is the length of time from randomization that patients enrolled in the study are still alive. The outcome is to evaluate whether the radiotherapy improves overall survival compared to standard of care., From randomization to death from any cause, up to 5 years.|Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials. The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., At baseline, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years|Quality of Life Questionnaire - Head & Neck Cancer Module (QLQ-H&N35), The head \& neck cancer module is a 35-item questionnaire designed for use among a wide range of patients with head \& neck cancer, varying in disease stage and treatment modality. It includes 7 multi-item scales that assess pain (4 items), swallowing (4 items), senses (2 items), speech (3 items), social eating (4 items), social contact (5 items), and sexuality (2 items). There are also 11 single items. Using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = "not at all", 2 = "a little", 3 = "quite a bit", and 4 = "very much"), patients indicate the degree to which they have experienced symptoms. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems., At baseline, 4 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years|Objective response rate (ORR), The Objective response rate is defined as the presence of a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) observed at week 18 and at week 27 after randomization. The investigator will evaluate the objective response using RECIST v1.1., At 18 weeks and 27 weeks|Loco-regional progression, Locoregional disease progression is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented locoregional progression evaluated by RECIST v1.1., From randomization to loco-regional progression, up to 5 years.|Distant progression, Distant progression is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented distant disease progression evaluated by RECIST v1.1., From randomization to distant progression, up to 5 years.|Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), Progression-free survival 2 is defined as time from randomization to a second tumor progression (according to RECIST V1.1) on next-line treatment (given after a first progression) or death from any cause. Patients who did not have a progression after the initial treatment are counted as an event at the time of death if they died whatever the cause of death or are censored at the time of last news if they are alive. Patients who had a progression after the initial treatment are counted as an event when they progressed again under or after the treatment of the first progression (if they start a new treatment, i.e. a third treatment, they are also counted as an event) or when they died whatever the cause of death or they are censored at the time of last news if they are alive without new progression after the first progression., Up to 5 years after randomization.|Incidence of Treatment Adverse Events, The tolerance and safety will be evaluated by toxicity (acute \[\<1 months after the end of pembrolizumab\] and late \[â‰¥1 month after the end of pembrolizumab\]), assessed using the Common terminology criteria for adverse events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0)., Throughout study completion, up to 5 years.|Compliance to treatment, Compliance to treatment is defined by the difference on received study regimen compared to the planned study regimen., Throughout study treatment, up to 5 years
Comparative interventional prospective phase 3, randomised, open-label, multicentric trial comparing the combination of radiotherapy and pembrolizumab alone or with chemotherapy to systemic treatment as first line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with synchronous metastases.
