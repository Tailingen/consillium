COntinue the SaMe Systemic Therapy After Local Ablative Therapy for Oligo Progression in Metastatic Breast Cancer - the COSMO Study
Patients with oligoprogression of metastatic breast cancer during palliative treatment that is amenable to local therapy will be included. The local ablative therapy (LAT) may consist of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also known as stereotactic body radiation therapy, surgery or radiofrequency ablation (RFA).
