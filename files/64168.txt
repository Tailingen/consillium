A Study of Perioperative mFOLFOX6 Plus Pembrolizumab in Patients With Potentially Resectable Adenocarcinoma of the Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) and Stomach
This research study is being down to find what, effects, good and/or bad, adding Pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy mFOLFOX before and after surgery have on the patient and the patient's cancer.
