Basal Ganglia Local Field Potentials in Gait and Speech
Electrid activity of the basal ganglia will be recorded with an implantable deep brain stimulation device (supplied by Medtronic Inc).

Study hypothesis is that these activities differ according to what the patient does, i.e. are different during gait and speech.
