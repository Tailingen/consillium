Oral Stent Device for Radiation Treatments of Oral Cancers
The purpose of this study is to examine that ability of the experimental oral stent device to reduce the volume of mandible receiving \>55 Gy by 50%during radiation treatment as assessed duri radiation treatment planning. Patients will have CT scans at three time-points during their standard of care radiation treatment. During these visits patients will receive scans via CT or cone beam CT scan, with both the standard and experimental oral stent devices.

During radiation treatment patients will receive the standard oral stent device.
