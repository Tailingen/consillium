A Study Of Crizotinib Plus VEGF Inhibitor Combinations In Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.
Despite the success of anti-angiogenic therapy in multiple treatment settings, a fraction of patients are refractory to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor treatment while the majority of patients will eventually develop evasive resistance and exhibit disease progression while on therapy. It is proposed that mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF or scatter factor) contribute significantly to VEGF inhibitor resistance such that combining a c-MET inhibitor with a VEGF inhibitor will provide additional clinical activity compared to VEGF inhibitor alone. This hypothesis will be tested using the cMET/ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, in combination with individual VEGF inhibitors. Three combinations will be prioritized, namely crizotinib plus axitinib, crizotinib plus sunitinib and crizotinib plus bevacizumab, with a fourth combination, crizotinib plus sorafenib to be tested only if crizotinib does not combine with either axitinib and/or sunitinib.
