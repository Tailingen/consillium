Randomized Phase Lll Study of Imatinib Dose Optimization vs Nilotinib in CML Patients With Suboptimal Response to Imatinib
There is no available data on the clinical benefit of dose escalation for patients with suboptimal response to imatinib, and patients may still improve their response with continuation of therapy at the standard dose as shown in the IRIS trial after 5 years of follow-up. However, there is no data yet regarding the potential benefit of using nilotinib in the group of patients with suboptimal response. In this study, the efficacy of nilotinib 400mg BID will be compared to imatinib 600mg QD.
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: nilotinib|DRUG: imatinib
Percentage of Participants With Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR), CCyR was assessed from bone marrow samples. CCyr was defined as having 0% Philadelphia positive (Ph+) chromosome metaphases in bone marrow., 6 months
Percentage of Participants With Major Molecular Response (MMR), MMR was defined as having a fusion gene of the Bcr and Abl genes of (BCR-ACL) less than or equal to 0.1% on the International Scale (IS)., 12 and 24 months|Percentage of Participants With CCyr, CCyR was assessed from bone marrow samples. CCyr was defined as having 0% Philadelphia positive (Ph+) chromosome metaphases in bone marrow., 12 and 24 months|Time to CCyR, Time to CCyR was defined as time from date of randomization to date of first documented CCyR., 24 months|Duration of CCyR, Duration of CCyR was defined as time from the date of ransomization to the date of first loss of CCyR or death, whichever came first., 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of documented disease progression to accelerated phase or blast crisis (AP/BC), or death due to any cause., 24 months|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first occurrence of any of the following: loss of Complete Hematological Response (CHR), loss of Partial Cytogenetic Response (PCyR), loss of CCyR, death on treatment or progression to AP/BC., 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as time from date of randomization to the date of the death., 24 months
The comparative efficacy between imatinib dose escalation (600 mg QD) and nilotinib (400 mg BID), in terms of CCyR after 6 months, for patients with CML in chronic phase with suboptimal response to imatinib standard dose will be determined.
