IBD Neoplasia Surveillance RCT
We will conduct a multicenter, parallel-group, non-inferiority RCT in persons with IBD undergoing colorectal neoplasia screening with high-definition white light colonoscopy, comparing a strategy of sampling visible lesions alone to a conventional strategy of sampling both visible lesions as well as normal-appearing mucosa using non-targeted biopsies. The primary outcome is the neoplasia detection rate. The required sample size to demonstrate non-inferiority is 1952 persons.
