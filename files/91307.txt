Developing Screening Clinical Breast Examination Implementation Strategies in South Africa
The goal of this observational study is to engage with multilevel stakeholders to collaboratively and to systematically develop a suite of strategies for implementing breast cancer screening using clinical breast examination (CBE) in the primary health centers within the catchment area of Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (Bara Hospital), Johannesburg, South Africa.

The main questions it aims to answer are: What barriers and facilitators exist to conducting screening CBE in Soweto's primary care setting and what implementation strategies would support CBE in primary care clinics?

Participants will:

* Allow observation of study clinic workflows
* Participate in focus group discussions regarding screening CBE implementation
