Artificial Intelligence Performance in Colonoscopy in Daily Practice
randomized, controlled single center, single investigator study mainly in colorectal screening population in daily practice with and without artificial intelliegence (AI) named DiscoveryTM from Pentax medical. Patient randomly are allocated to one of four groups: Pentax i10 colonoscopes without any additional device, Pentax i 10 with DiscoveryTM (AI), Pentax i 10 with EndocuffTM and Pentax i10 with EndocuffTM and DiscoveryTM (AI).

The different groups are compared in terms of the different parameters: e.g. time of endoscopy, polyps (PDR) and adenoma detected (ADR).
Colonic Polyp|Adenoma
DEVICE: Discovery TM of Pentax medical on/off in colonoscopy
Endoscopy time, measurement of ascent, descent and intervention time during colonoscopy, within 45 minutes of examination
polyp and adenoma detetction rate PDR and ADR, counts of polypes and their location in the colon and their histology, within 45 minutes of examination
Medication dosage, Dosage of Propofol and Buscopan, withn 45 minutes of examination
From August 2021 through August 2022 all patients undergoing a colonoscopy in a gastroenterologist's private practice are assigned using randomization tables to one or the other above mentioned groups. Time of the endoscopy (ascent, descent and intervention time), polyps detected and their histology are written down real time with a tablet computer anonymized with the patient number. Furthermore dosage of sedatives and over all satisfaction is traced.

1. endpoint is time gain in the different phase of the colonoscopy
2. endpoint is adenoma detection rate (ADR)
