This trial is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, phase II clinical study aimed at investigating the efficacy and safety of Cadonilimab combined with Gemcitabine and Nab-palitaxe in short-course radiotherapy neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients. Patients will receive Gemcitabine and Nab-palitaxe combined with Cadonilimab treatment for one cycle, followed by sequential short-course radiotherapy and then Gemcitabine and Nab-palitaxe combined with Cadonilimab treatment. If feasible, radical surgery will be performed to assess efficacy. A total of 8 cycles of chemotherapy will be administered, followed by Cadonilimab maintenance for up to 1 year.
