Assessment of Nipple Sparing Mastectomy as a Treatment Option for Breast Cancer
Nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) is a form of mastectomy that achieves optimal disease control and facilitates reconstruction. The study aimed to assess the oncological safety and aesthetic outcomes of nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction.

35 female patients with breast cancer were included in the study. The investigators categorized the incisions into radial, inframammary, and periareolar incisions with planned reconstruction types; direct to implant (DTI), transversus rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, latissimus dorsi myocutaneous (LD) flap, or LD with implant.
