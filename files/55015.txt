Evaluation of a Pre-surgical Virtual Reality Simulation for Cancer Surgery Patients
This study will pilot test and explore the feasibility of a virtual reality simulation of the operating room environment to reduce anxiety/distress in cancer surgery patients. Study objectives are to evaluate recruitment and data collection procedures, outcome measures, participant feedback on the virtual reality operating room intervention, and the inclusion of a treatment as usual group, and effects of the intervention on symptoms of anxiety/distress. Results of this study will inform the design of an upcoming larger-scale RCT to assess the efficacy of this intervention
