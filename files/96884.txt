Acalabrutinib Real World Italian obSErvational Study -ARISE
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in the adults in the Western world, with an annual incidence of approximately 5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Italy.

Acalabrutinib (CalquenceTM), a selective second-generation Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) inhibitor developed by AstraZeneca, has been assessed for the treatment of CLL in three phase III clinical trials, ELEVATE-TN (treatment-naïve CLL), ASCEND and ELEVATE R/R (relapsed and refractory CLL). These pivotal randomized clinical trials established the efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib in patients with CLL and based on these data CalquenceTM received EMA approval in November 2020 for the treatment of CLL in adult patients and received AIFA (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco) reimbursement as monotherapy in December 2021. However, further data are still required to evaluate the use of acalabrutinib in the real-life conditions of post-marketing authorization.

The primary aim of ARISE study is to evaluate the time to treatment discontinuation and reasons for discontinuation for acalabrutinib in a real world setting of patients with CLL. This study will provide the first real-world data on the use of acalabrutinib in the treatment of CLL in Italy.

Study design:

This is an Italian non-interventional / observational, multicenter, longitudinal secondary data usage study based on a retrospective cohort of patients with CLL, who initiated treatment with acalabrutinib between 1st May 2021 and 30th April 2022 (index date), regardless of the treatment status at the time of inclusion. Each patient will be followed-up up to 5 years since the last enrolled patient index date (therefore for a maximum of 72 months). Five data extraction timepoints are planned for the investigators to proceed with secondary data extraction from patients' medical records and data entry into the electronic case report form (eCRFs).

Data Source(s):

Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time as part of patients' path of care (e.g., patient's hospital records, pharmacy dispensing records).

A standardized, validated eCRF will be developed to capture data extracted from source documents at each participating site.

Study Population:

All consecutive adult patients with CLL who initiated treatment with acalabrutinib over the period between 1st May 2021 and 30th April 2022, according to Italian legislation dlg 219/2006 art.125.

Outcome(s):

The primary outcome is the time to acalabrutinib discontinuation (defined as time in days from start date of acalabrutinib treatment to end date of acalabrutinib treatment).

Secondary outcomes include: Time from diagnosis to start of acalabrutinib, immunophenotype, CLL clinical stage (Binet), FISH profile, mutations, karyotype, CLL treatments before acalabrutinib, socio-demographic characteristics at baseline, medical history, concomitant treatments, COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatments, constitutional symptoms, patient clinical status, ECG/TTE, complete blood count with differential, serum chemistry, HIV and Hepatitis serology, active haemolysis, time to acalabrutinib discontinuation, acalabrutinib treatment (dosage, relative changes, temporary interruption/permanent discontinuation).

Exploratory outcomes include: Time to progression, Time to death, CLL status (according to iwCLL), Time to Next Treatment, Time to progression on next line treatment, reasons for ending of CLL treatments following acalabrutinib discontinuation, visits and hospitalizations due to CLL or suspected ADR during acalabrutinib treatment.
