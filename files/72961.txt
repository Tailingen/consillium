TST001 is a recombinant humanized anti-Claudin 18.2 (CLDN18.2) IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2) protein is one of the family of tetraspanning proteins expressed at epithelial tight junctions and primarily expressed only in normal gastric tissues . CLDN18.2 protein is a pancancer target expressed in primary lesions and metastases of variouscancer types, including gastric cancer, biliary tract cancer and others. Current available information indicates that CLDN18.2 is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of solid tumors.

This is an open-label, single-arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TST001 for patients with CLDN18.2 positive previously treated unresectable advanced or metastatic Biliary Tract Cancer. Eligible patients will be treated with TST001 until disease progression or other discontinuation criteria met. If there is â‰¥ one objective response among the first 15 enrolled patients, then the trial continues to enroll a total of 40 patients; if not, then the trial discontinues.
