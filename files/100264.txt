A Multi-Center Observational Trial of Symptomatic, High-Risk Bone Metastases Treated with Percutaneous Ablation and Palliative Radiation Therapy
The objective of this study is to evaluate real-world outcomes (e.g., pain, patient reported outcomes, skeletal related events, healthcare utilization, etc.) in patients treated with both percutaneous ablation and palliative radiation therapy (RT).
Bone Cancer Metastatic
DEVICE: Percutaneous Ablation|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Pain Response, Combined partial and complete pain response rate using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), worst pain 24-hour recall, at 3 months following percutaneous ablation and palliative RT as defined by International Consensus on Palliative Radiotherapy Endpoints in clinical trials (ICPRE).

• Partial response is defined as pain reduction of 2 or more at the treated site on a scale of 0 to 10 scale without analgesic increase, or analgesic reduction of 25% or more from Baseline without an increase in pain.

• Complete response is defined as a pain score of 0 at the treated site with no concomitant increase in analgesic intake (stable or reducing analgesics in daily OMED)., 3 Months
