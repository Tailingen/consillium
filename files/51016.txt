MB-CART19.1 r/r CD19+ B-cell Malignancies (BCM)
This is a phase l/ll multi-centric, single arm, prospective open, dose-escalation study in patients with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive B cell malignancies (ALL, NHL, CLL). The trial will include adult and pediatric patients. The trial consists of 2 parts: Part I and Part II. In total approximately 48 patients will be included in Part I of the trial. There will be three individual cohorts, defined by disease biology: pediatric ALL and aggressive pediatric NHL (Cohort 1), adult ALL (Cohort 2) and adult NHL/CLL (Cohort 3).

BIOLOGICAL: MB-CART19.1
Phase I - Determination of the recommended dose of MB-CART19.1, Determined on the basis of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD); MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which \< 33% of patients experience Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT).

The Part I (Phase I) will evaluate the safety of the MB-CART19.1 and determine the recommended dose levels for the Part II (Phase II) efficacy evaluation in each of the three disease cohorts.

Dose evaluation will start in Cohorts 1 and 2 with Dose Level 1 and in Cohort 3 with Dose Level 2, sparing Dose Level 1 (see figure 1). Each of the cohorts will evaluate the safety of MB-CART19.1.

In each dose level of each of the three cohorts three 3 + 3 patients will be treated. A particular dose level will be expanded to 6 patients if one patient out of 3 patients treated at that particular dose level develops DLT. Once this occurs, further dose-escalations are halted until the dose has proven to be safe in the expanded cohort. If 2 or more in a cohort of 6 patients develop DLT no further dose escalation is allowed, and the next lower dose level will be expanded to 6 patients in total. The highest dose among the dose levels tested at which no more than one out of six patients experiences DLT will be considered the MTD. In Dose Level 3, three additional patients will be treated, if no DLT occurred. Dose Level 0 will be tested only if Dose Level 1 is not tolerable.

Cohort 3 will Start with Dose Level 2. If Dose Level 2 is not tolerated, Dose Level 1 will be tested. DLT will be evaluated within 4 weeks after the infusion of MB-CART19.1. An interval of at least 28 days between the treatment of the first and the second patient in each dose level (and in each cohort) is mandatory.

Part II (Phase II) will evaluate the efficacy and safety in patients treated with the recommended dose in Cohorts 1 to 3, respectively. After review of completed day 28 safety and efficacy data within Part I (Phase I) by the SMB, the design of Phase II, specifically the number and types of Phase II cohorts and the recommended dose level(s) for Phase II will be determined and thus, the number of patients to be treated will be calculated.
