Sequence and Time-of-day Infusion of immunoCHemotherapy Affect Response in Oesophageal Cancer in the NeOadjuvant Setting
It is reported that compared to chemotherapy alone, immunochemotherapy has significantly improved the overall survival of patients with advanced metastatic ESCC. However, there are still more than 30% of patients who cannot benefit from this treatment modality. In addition to these factors, the time-of-day infusion and administration sequence of immunochemotherapy have been reported to be associated with tumor responses and overall survival. In this study, The investigators aimed to explore the roles of infusion time and administration sequence of immunochemotherapy in predicting tumor responses and overall survival in patients with advanced ESCC.
Esophagus Cancer
Overall survival, Overall survival rate, from the date of diagnosis to the date of death, assessed up to 100 months
Pathologic complete response rate (pCR), The rate of pathologic complete response rate after the combined treatment of chemotherapy and immunotherapy following surgery, Three to five working days after surgery
