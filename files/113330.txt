Consolidation Therapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Guided by Leukemia Stem Cell Behavior
The primary objective of the trial is to compare the two-year relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), presumed to be at high risk for relapse due to the presence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in their bone marrow at first complete remission (CR1), who receive either standard cytarabine-based chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).
