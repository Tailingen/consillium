The Neoadjuvant Treatment of Locally Advanced Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
In this study, We investigated the efficacy and safty of camrelizumab combined with S-1 maintenance after first-line induction chemotherapy for GC. Patients without progressive disease after 4-6 weeks of first-line chemotherapy with SOX will be treated with camrelizumab combined with S-1.
Efficacy and Safty of Camrelizumab Plus S-1 Maintenance After First-line Induction Chemotherapy for GC
DRUG: Camrelizumab+S-1
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time (in months) from date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause in the absence of documented PD (whichever occurs first). PFS will be determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) based on investigator response assessment., From the start of randomization to a minimum of 42 months
Number of Subjects With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) According to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 5.0, TEAEs will be defined as the adverse events (AEs) that occur between first dose of study drug administration and 28 days after the last dose of study drug administration that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state., From the the first dose of study drug administration up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug administration, assessed up to 3.5 years|Objective Response Rate（ORR）, Assess ORR, defined as Investigator-assessed CR + PR, per RECIST 1.1., From the start of randomization to a minimum of 42 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Percentage of patients with CR/PR/SD in the number of patients that whose tumour can be evaluated., Time Frame: From the start of randomization to a minimum of 42 months|Overall Survival（OS）, OS is defined as the time (in months) from randomization to the date of death, regardless of the actual cause of the subject's death., From the start of randomization to a minimum of 42 months
