Her2-negative Metastatic Breast Cancer|Her2-negative Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Vinorebine, Everolimus|DRUG: Vinorelbine
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the time from randomization to the time of disease progression or relapse or death., Assessment over 36 months, minimum 12 month
Safety and tolerability, Capture all adverse events, serious adverse events, all side effects of the study medication, serious side effects, adverse events that lead to temporary or complete discontinuation of the study treatment and the Rates and causes of death.

A safety interims analysis is planned, as soon as 60 subjects have finished at least two treatment cycles., Assessment over 36 months|Rate of Progression Free Survival after 6 months (6 months PFSR), descriptive Evaluation, for the monotherapy (arm 2) a median PFS of 4 months is assumed. It is expected that the combination therapy will prolong the median PFS to 6.5 months., Assessment over 36 months|Overall survival (OS), The duration of overall survival (OS) will be determined by measuring the time interval from randomization to the date of death or last observation., 36 months|Response rate (CR, PR), The tumour status of patients will be evaluated nine weekly during the treatment until detection of progression., 36 months
