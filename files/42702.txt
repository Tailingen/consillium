A Study of CUSP06 in Patients With Platinum-Refractory/Resistant Ovarian Cancer and Other Advanced Solid Tumors
This phase 1 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of CUSP06 in patients with platinum-refractory/resistant ovarian cancer and other advanced solid tumors.
Ovarian Cancer|Solid Tumor
DRUG: CUSP06
Characterize the safety and tolerability of CUSP06 (Phase 1a and 1b), Type, incidence, and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) using the NCI CTCAE v.5.0.

Frequency and duration of dose interruptions and reductions., 36 months|Determine the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of CUSP06 (Phase 1a), 15 months|Evaluate preliminary efficacy of CUSP06 as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (Phase 1b), ORR: proportion of patients achieving a best overall response of confirmed partial or complete response (PR+CR), 16 months
Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CUSP06 - maximum concentration (Cmax) (Phase 1a and 1b), 36 months|Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CUSP06 - time to Cmax (Tmax) (Phase 1a and 1b), 36 months|Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CUSP06 - area under the curve (AUC) (Phase 1a and 1b), 36 months|Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CUSP06 - terminal half-life (t1/2) (Phase 1a and 1b), 36 months|Objective response rate (ORR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (Phase 1a), ORR is defined as proportion of patients achieving a best overall response of confirmed partial or complete response (PR+CR), 18 months|Disease control rate (DCR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (Phase 1a and 1b), DCR is defined as disease control rate based on best overall response., 36 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (Phase 1a and 1b), CBR is defined as proportion of subjects achieving a best overall response of confirmed partial or complete response, or durable stable disease., 36 months|Duration of response (DoR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (Phase 1a and 1b), DoR is defined as time from the date of the first documented CR/PR until first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever comes first., 36 months|Time to progression (TTP) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (Phase 1a and 1b), 36 months|Progression free survival (PFS) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (Phase 1a and 1b), PFS is defined as time from the date of the first dose to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever comes first., 36 months|Overall survival (OS) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (Phase 1a and 1b), OS is defined time from the first dose date to the date of death from any cause., 42 months|For PRROC patients: proportion of patients with a change from baseline CA-125 level â‰¥50% for at least 28 days (Phase 1a and 1b), 36 months|Evaluate the immunogenicity of CUSP06 (Phase 1a and 1b), Assessment of antidrug antibodies (ADAs), 36 months
This phase 1 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of CUSP06 in patients with platinum-refractory/resistant ovarian cancer and other advanced solid tumors.
