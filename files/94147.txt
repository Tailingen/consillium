Unfavorable MRI But Favorable 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI for Primary Prostate Cancer Detection
This perspective cohort study aims to assess the detection rate of prostate cancer through prostate biopsy within suspicious patients harboring unfavorable multiparametric MRI but favorable 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI who have had no prior prostate biopsy.

Multiparametric MRI (MpMRI) is currently regarded as the best imaging method to noninvasively identify and characterize prostate cancer (PCa) with the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2. However, there are diagnostic difficulties for suspicious patients with PI-RADS score 3 and not all PCa are equivalently visible on mpMRI. For such patients, other alternative imaging techniques are required to properly characterize and detect PCa.

It has been widely reported that 68Ga-PSMA PET imaging offers excellent performance in detecting primary PCa and is able to noninvasively characterize the aggressiveness of PCa. Recently, integrated PET/MRI, which combines the strengths of both modalities, has been shown to have great potential for influencing clinical practice by providing a more certain map of localized PCa to aid targeted biopsies and therapy.

This perspective cohort study aims to assess the detection rate of PCa through prostate biopsy within suspicious patients harboring unfavorable mpMRI but favorable 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI who have had no prior prostate biopsy.
