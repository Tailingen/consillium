A Two-Step Approach to Reduced Intensity Bone Marrow Transplant for Patients With Hematological Malignancies
The purpose of this research study is to compare the survival rates of patients with better risk disease undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) to the survival rates reported in the medical literature of similar patients undergoing reduced intensity HSCT from matched related donors.

Overall Survival (OS) in patients with haploidentical family donors with hematological malignancies in morphological or radiographic remission or with chemosensitive, indolent diseases, The primary null hypothesis is that 2 year OS rate is at most 35%. This hypothesis will be rejected if the 95% confidence interval for year OS rate computed from the estimated Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be entirely above 0.35., At 2 years
Treatment Related Mortality (TRM), To compare the treatment related mortality rate (TRM) for patients treated on this study to the historical TRM rates of patients undergoing reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) matched-sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) as reported in the literature, At 2 years|Incidence and severity of GVHD, graded according to standard criteria, The estimates of incidence rates will be presented with corresponding 95% confidence intervals using the exact method, Assessed up to 2 years|Relapse Rate, Evaluated by estimating Kaplan-Meier survival curves. From these curves, the 95% confidence interval for 2 year rates will be computed., At 2 years|Engraftment Rates, The estimates of incidence rates will be presented with corresponding 95% confidence intervals using the exact method., Assessed up to 2 years|Incidence of Treatment Related Mortality (TRM), The estimates of incidence rates will be presented with corresponding 95% confidence intervals using the exact method., At 100 days|Relapse Related Mortality, Evaluated by estimating Kaplan-Meier survival curves. From these curves, the 95% confidence interval for 2 year rates will be computed., At 2 years|Lymphoid Reconstitution, To evaluate lymphoid reconstitution in patients treated on the Two Step approach, 100 days post-transplant
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare the overall survival (OS) rate at 2 years post treatment using the Jefferson 2 step reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) approach in patients with haploidentical family donors with hematological malignancies in morphological or radiographic remission or with chemosensitive, indolent diseases to historical OS rates in similar populations after RIC matched donor HSCT as reported in the literature.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare the treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate at 2 years for patients treated on this study to the historical TRM rates of patients undergoing RIC matched-sibling HSCT as reported in the literature.

II. To compare the 2 year relapse rates and relapse related mortality of patients with myeloid diseases to that of patients with lymphoid diseases who are treated on this Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) RIC 2 step approach.

III. To determine the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients undergoing treated on the TJU RIC 2 step approach.

IV. To evaluate engraftment rates and lymphoid reconstitution in patients treated on the TJU RIC 2 step approach.

V. To evaluate the incidence of TRM at 100 days in patients treated on the TJU RIC 2 step approach.

OUTLINE:

REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days -11 to -8 and bulsufan IV over 3 hours on days -10 to -9. Patients undergo total body irradiation (TBI) on day -6. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.

TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on day -6 and cluster of differentiation (CD)-34+ allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) on day 0.

GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Beginning on day -1, patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) with taper beginning on day 42. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV twice daily (BID) on days -1 to 28.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
