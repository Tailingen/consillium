A Phase III Trial of Carboplatin as Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This study is designed to investigate the efficacy of carboplatin, as a post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy for triple negative breast cancer patients who have pathologic residual cancer after the preoperative chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: carboplatin
Disease-free survival (DFS), To compare DFS between carboplatin and observation within non-pCR (complete remission) patients, up to 3 years
overall survival, To compare overall survival (OS) between carboplatin and observation within non-pCR patients., up to 5years|pCR rate, To assess the pCR rate (no residual invasive carcinoma in primary breast and axillary lymph node) within total TNBC patients., up to 3 years|The percentage of patients who receive breast conserving surgery., To assess the percentage of patients who receive breast conserving surgery within total triple negative breast cancer patients, up to 3years|Number of adverse events, Number of adverse events in patients with non-pCR., up to 3years
difference in gene expression pattern, up to 5 years
In Neo-adjuvant period Four cycles of 60 mg/m2 doxorubicin and 600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide therapy at 3-week intervals followed by four cycles of 100 mg/m2 docetaxel at 3-week intervals.

In POST Neo-adjuvant period

Randomization:

At the time of post neo-adjuvant period, the patients will be assigned to each treatment group in a 1:1 ratio i.e. carboplatin AUC 6 group vs. observation group. Six cycles of carboplatin (AUC=6) on the first day of every 21 days.
