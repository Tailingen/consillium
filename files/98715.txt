To Assess the Effect of Itraconazole (a CYP3A4 Inhibitor) on the Pharmacokinetics of Olaparib, and the Effect of Olaparib on QT Interval Following Oral Dosing of a Tablet Formulation to Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is a 3-part study in patients with advanced solid tumours: Part A will assess the effect of itraconazole on the PK parameters of olaparib and will determine the effect of olaparib on the QT interval following single oral dosing; Part B will determine the effect of olaparib on the QT Interval following multiple oral dosing; Part C will allow patients continued access to olaparib after the PK and QT phases and will provide for additional safety data collection. A total of 48 patients are planned to be enrolled; at least 42 evaluable patients will be required to complete the study. Patients will participate as a single cohort in all parts of the study.
