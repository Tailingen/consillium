Toripalimab Adjuvant Therapy in Subjects With Resected Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Who Achieved Pathological Complete Response (pCR)
The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the 1-year DFS rate of toripalimab adjuvant therapy in participants with resected esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who achieved pCR. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The toripalimab adjuvant therapy could impove the 1-year DFS rate in participants with rescted ESCC who achieved pCR?
* Is this treatment regimen safe? Researchers will compare toripalimab adjuvant therapy to clinical observation to see if toripalimab could improve the 1-year DFS rate.

Participants will receive toripalimab 240 mg IV once every 3 weeks for one year or clinical observation.
