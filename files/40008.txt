A Phase I Study of Decitabine, Lisaftoclax, and Olverembatinib in Patients With Advanced Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia
To find the recommended doses of lisaftoclax and olverembatinib that can be given in combination with decitabine to participants with advanced CML and Ph+ AML.
Advanced Chronic Myeloid Leukemia|Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Listaftoclax|DRUG: Olverembatinib
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives

â€¢ To establish the minimum safe and biologically-effective dose of lisaftoclax and olverembatinib in combination with decitabine

Secondary Objectives

* To determine the rate of conversion to CML-CP for participants with advanced phase CML or complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematology recovery (CRi) for participants with Ph+ AML, within 4 cycles of combination therapy
* To assess other efficacy endpoints (CR rate, measurable residual disease negativity by flow cytometry, rates of CCyR, MMR, MR4 and MR4.5, relapse-free survival, overall survival)
* To assess proportion of participants proceeding to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
* To determine the safety of the combination regimen

Exploratory Objectives

* To evaluate the impact of olverembatinib monotherapy on signaling pathways and apoptotic protein expression
* To assess relationship between baseline signaling pathway activation and apoptotic protein expression on response and long-term outcomes such as overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS).
