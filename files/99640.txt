Exercise Training as a Novel Primary Therapy for Men With Localised Prostate Cancer
Study design: The study is a two arm randomised controlled trial (randomisation ratio 1:1) comparing an aerobic exercise training intervention to usual care plus exercise advice. The primary outcome is the feasibility of the intervention as novel primary therapy in men with localised prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Aerobic exercise training|BEHAVIORAL: Placebo surveillance and written exercise guidelines
Feasibility as measured by rate of recruitment, The rate of recruitment will be measured by comparing the number of patients screended to the number of patients recruited. This will allow us to asses if a future full-scale trial is feasible., 36 months
Feasibility as measured by Intervention adherence, Intervention adherence will be assessed using an exercise log book and heart rate monitor to objectively record independent exercise behaviour and support adherence and compliance., 36 months
