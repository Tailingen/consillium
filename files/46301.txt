Longitudinal Screening for Financial Hardship to Improve Outcomes in Patients With Advanced Cancer
The study aims to determine whether monthly remote digital financial hardship screening among adults with advanced/metastatic cancer, undergoing outpatient systemic therapy with non-curative intent, improves patient-centered outcomes, including financial worry, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), symptom burden, patient-reported cancer treatment adherence, and exploratory outcomes of overall survival, patient-reported economic burden, patient-reported support received, patient-reported financial coping strategies, and health insurance literacy.
Advanced Cancer|Metastatic Cancer
OTHER: Financial Hardship Screening|OTHER: Enhanced Usual Care
Financial Worry, Patient-reported financial worry will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (FACIT-COST) total scale.

Possible score range: 0 to 44, with higher scores indicating better outcomes, 6 months
Health-related quality of life, Patient-reported health-related quality of life will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) total scale.

Possible score range: 0 to 108, with higher scores indicating better outcomes, 6 months|Symptom burden, Patient-reported symptom burden will be measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) physical well-being scale.

Possible score range: 0 to 28, with higher scores indicating better outcomes, 6 months|Cancer treatment adherence, Patient-reported cancer treatment adherence will be measured by the Domains of Subjective Extent of Nonadherence-Cancer (DOSE-Nonadherence-Cancer) extent of nonadherence scale, with patients classified as adherent (i.e., all responses of "none of the time" on the DOSE-Nonadherence-Cancer items for missing, skipping, or not taking a dose of medicine) versus nonadherent, 6 months
Financial hardship is a common problem that affects patients treated for advanced cancer and leads to poor outcomes related to financial worry, health related quality of life (HRQoL), symptom burden, treatment adherence, and overall survival. Prior studies have shown that financial navigation may be an effective strategy to attenuate the impact of financial hardship. However, patients and clinicians have identified communication as a key barrier that prevents patients from being connected to sources of financial assistance. To address this critical gap in patient care, and based on strong preliminary data that financial hardship screening may improve patient outcomes, this financial hardship screening intervention will help connect patients to financial navigation resources. It is hypothesized that by connecting patients experiencing financial hardship with financial navigation resources, this intervention will lead to improved patient-centered outcomes.
