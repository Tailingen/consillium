Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy in Stage IIIB/IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of maintenance therapy with daily low dose lenalidomide in patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after first line chemotherapy. Investigators expect this treatment approach will delay disease progression by boosting the patient's anti-tumor immune response. Investigators hypothesize that 10 mg/day of lenalidomide can be administered safely as maintenance therapy and improve progression free survival time.

Progression free survival, Progression free survival is defined as the duration of time from the date starting lenalidomide to the date of documented radiographic progression or death., up to 6 months from the date of registration
Number of participants with adverse events, From date of registration to end of study, up to 3 years|Change in circulating immune cells, Change from baseline at 1 week|Change in circulating immune cells, Change from baseline at 5 weeks|Change in circulating immune cells, Change from baseline at 9 weeks|Change in circulating immune cells, Change from baseline at 13, 17, 21 and 25 weeks|Change in circulating immune cells, Change from baseline to 6 months, 9 months and 1 year|Change in circulating immune cells, Change from baseline to 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 years
For patients with stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer, who did not progress after first line chemotherapy, lenalidomide 10mg/day orally will be administered as maintenance therapy until disease progression or death.
