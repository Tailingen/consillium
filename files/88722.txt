Patient Self-sampling of HPV to Screen for Cervical Cancer
The purpose of this study is to validate a patient self-sampling vaginal collection kit and laboratory testing for the detection of HPV (human papillomavirus) infection. Researchers will compare the laboratory results of self-collected vaginal swab samples to usual healthcare provider-collected cervical swab samples to determine the laboratory HPV testing accuracy of the self-collection swab.
Human Papilloma Virus
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Swab kit (COBAS HPV 4800 Assay -Evalyn brush)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Clinician-collection of cervical sample for HPV testing
Concordance of patient-collected and clinician-collected samples to detect HPV infection, Patient-collected vaginal swab HPV results compared with gold standard of clinician-collected cervical swab) to accurately detect HPV infection, Anticipate 6-8 months to collect number of samples needed
Patient-reported acceptability and feasibility of using the Evalyn brush, Patient survey to evaluate acceptability and feasibility of using the Evalyn brush, Patient will complete survey after using the Evalyn brush (same day)
