The first part of the study, Part 1 dose escalation, was designed to assess the safety and tolerability of increasing dose levels of IV or SC administered PF-06801591 to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) design. Part 2 expansion is designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of 300 mg of PF-06801591 administered SC once every 4 weeks in patients with NSCLC or urothelial carcinoma as well as confirm the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part 1 enrollment has completed, enrollment will only be allowed for Part 2.
