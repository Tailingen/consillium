A Survey of Physician and Molecular Tumor Board Perspectives on the Clinical Utility and Usability of Cellworks Singula™ and Ventura™ Reports in Facilitating Patient Treatment Decisions for Pan-Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine the benefit of Cellworks Singula™ and Ventura™ reports on physician and molecular tumor board treatment recommendations across a large set of pan-cancer indications. Cellworks reports aim to provide NGS-based therapy recommendations to aid the decision-making of patients, physicians, and molecular tumor boards.
Pan-cancer
OTHER: Cellworks Singula and Ventura reports
Physician satisfaction on Cellworks reports, A questionnaire will be administered following receipt of the Cellworks report. Survey questions will be performed using a 6-point forced response Likert scale. Simple descriptive statistics, including medians, mode and range of the resulting Likert scores, will be reported but can lead to incorrect effect size estimates, inflated error rates, and other issues (Bürkner \& Vuorre, 2019).

For hypothesis testing purposes, the proportion of physicians and MTB's with a favorable response (i.e., Likert score of 4 or above) will be estimated along with exact (Clopper-Pearson) 95% two-sided confidence intervals., 2022.1 - 2023.1
