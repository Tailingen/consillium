The Role of Inflammation in Ocular Tumours
This prospective, non-therapeutic study will determine whether a novel imaging technique can identify presumptive tumour associated macrophages (TAMs) in patients with ocular tumours.

The investigators will evaluate 5 groups:

1. Choroidal nevus
2. Choroidal indeterminate melanocytic lesion
3. Choroidal melanoma
4. Suspected metastatic tumour (ie, primary tumour elsewhere)
5. Locally treated ocular tumours
