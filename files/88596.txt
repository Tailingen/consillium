Trial of Gemcitabine With or Without MSC1936369B in Pancreatic Cancer
The research trial is testing the experimental treatment MSC1936369B in combination with Gemcitabine, in subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The study will be run in two parts:

Safety Run-In: Will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase II dose of MSC1936369B, when combined with gemcitabine, in subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Phase II: Will assess the anti-tumor activity of MSC1936369B combined with gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine alone as first line treatment in subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
