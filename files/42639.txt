Pilot Study Using Molecular Profiling to Find Potential Targets & Select Treatments for Pts With Met br ca
The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate, that is the % of patients with non-progression of their metastatic breast cancer after 4 months on treatment that was selected by molecular testing and proteomics.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Approved therapy will be assigned based on molecular profile and RPMA results
Growth Modulation Index (GMI) Greater Than or Equal to 1.3, The primary objective was to determine the % of patients with refractory breast cancer where MMP-informed selection of approved cancer therapies could change the clinical course of their disease to produce a Growth Modulation Index (GMI) greater than 1.3. The GMI was calculated as the PFS with MMP-selected therapy/time to progression (TTP) on last prior therapy. A GMI of 1.3 was selected because 30% or greater improvement in PFS with MMP-selected therapy compared to previous TTP would be considered clinically meaningful., 6-20 weeks
To determine the percent of patients with refractory breast cancer where molecular profiling and RPMA-based protein pathway activation analysis of their tumor, can change the clinical course of their disease (i.e. produce a Growth Modulation Index (GMI) â‰¥1.3). The GMI is calculated as the ratio of Progression-free survival (PFS) under molecular profiling and RPMA analysis selected treatment to the time to progression (TTP) for the most recent regimen the patient has progressed on.
