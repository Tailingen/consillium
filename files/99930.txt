A Study of NOV140201 (JPI-547) in Subject With Advanced Solid Tumors
To assess the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic Profile and efficacy of JPI-547 in patients with advanced solid tumor.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: JPI-547
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), subjects will be treated and observed for DLT through the end of the first cycle, 21days
Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of JPI-547, to observe pharmacokinetic parameter, 1 and 15 days|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of JPI-547, to observe pharmacokinetic parameter, 1 and 15 days|Time at maximum concentration(Tmax) of JPI-547, to observe pharmacokinetic parameter, 1 and 15 days|Half-life of JPI-547, to observe pharmacokinetic parameter, 1 and 15 days|Accumulation ratio of JPI-547, to observe pharmacokinetic parameter, 1 and 15 days
This is an open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study of NOV140201 (JPI-547) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and the anti-tumor efficacy of JPI-547 in patients with advanced solid tumors after failure of standard of care.

Patients will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an expansion phase. DLTs will be assessed as the primary endpoint in this trial.
