Exploratory Study of Advanced Breast Cancer in HER2 Positive Patients With Failure of Multi-line Therapy Treated by Combination of Inetetamab (Cipterbin) + PD-1 Inhibitor Combined With Utidelone.
This study plans to explore the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with inetetamab and PD-1 inhibitors in HER2 positive advanced breast cancer who failed to receive trastuzumab and TKIs, and explore the dominant population of dual antibody combination to further guide the precise and individualized treatment of advanced HER2 positive breast cancer.
