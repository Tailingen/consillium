Broad Spectrum HPV Vaccine Dose Escalation Study (V502-002)
This study will examine the safety and tolerability of octavalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) L1 Virus-Like Particle (VLP) vaccine formulated with amorphous aluminum hydroxysulfate (AAHS) and ISCOMATRIX™ (IMX). Reviews of safety and tolerability will be used to select the dose(s) of IMX for further studies of the octavalent HPV L1 VLP vaccine.

BIOLOGICAL: Octavalent HPV with 15 mcg IMX / AAHS|BIOLOGICAL: Octavalent HPV with 30 mcg IMX / AAHS|BIOLOGICAL: Octavalent HPV with 60 mcg IMX / AAHS|BIOLOGICAL: Octavalent HPV with 120 mcg IMX / AAHS|BIOLOGICAL: Comparator: Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine (qHPV), (GARDASIL™)
Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) to Each of the HPV Types Contained in the Vaccine for Phase A, The quadrivalent HPV (GARDASIL™) vaccine has types 6, 11, 16, 18, and the octavalent HPV has types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 45, 52, and 58. Serum antibody titres to the HPV type were obtained using a competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) after vaccination with GARDASIL™ or the octavalent HPV vaccine. GMTs were calculated and are reported as the antibody concentration in milli-Merck Units per milliliter (mMU/mL) of neutralizing monoclonal antibody equivalent., 4 weeks postdose 3 (Phase A)|Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) to Each of the HPV Types Contained in the Vaccine for Phase B, The quadrivalent HPV (GARDASIL™) vaccine has types 6, 11, 16, 18, and the octavalent HPV has types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 45, 52, and 58. Serum antibody titres to the HPV type were obtained using cLIA after vaccination with GARDASIL™ or the octavalent HPV vaccine. GMTs were calculated and are reported as the antibody concentration in milli-Merck Units per milliliter (mMU/mL) of neutralizing monoclonal antibody equivalent., 4 weeks postdose 3 (Phase B)|Number of Participants Who Seroconverted to Each of the HPV Types Contained in the Vaccine During Phase A, A vaccinated participant was considered seropositive for a given HPV type if her serum antibody titer by cLIA for the HPV type was greater than the serostatus cutoff. The serostatus cutoffs for HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 45, 52, and 58 were 20, 20, 20, 20, 16, 16, 20, and 16 mMU/mL, respectively., 4 weeks postdose 3 (Phase A)|Number of Participants Who Seroconverted to Each of the HPV Types Contained in the Vaccine During Phase B, A vaccinated participant was considered seropositive for a given HPV type if her serum antibody titer by cLIA for the HPV type was greater than the serostatus cutoff. The serostatus cutoffs for HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 45, 52, and 58 were 20, 20, 20, 20, 16, 16, 20, and 16 mMU/mL, respectively., 4 weeks postdose 3 (Phase B)
The study was performed in 2 staggered phases, Phase A and Phase B. In Phase A, participants were randomized to qHPV, Octavalent HPV with 15 mcg IMX/AAHS, or Octavalent HPV with 30 mcg IMX/AAHS. After the safety for Phase A was reviewed, Phase B was initiated. In Phase B, participants were randomized to qHPV, Octavalent HPV with 60 mcg IMX/AAHS or Octavalent HPV with 120 mcg IMX/AAHS.
