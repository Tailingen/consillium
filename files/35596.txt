Safety and Efficiency of γδ T Cell Against Non Small Lung Cancer ( Without EGFR Mutation)
In this study, effects of γδT cells on human non small lung cancer ( without EGFR mutation) in combination with tumor reducing surgery, for example cryosurgery going to be investigated.
Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: DC-CIK|BIOLOGICAL: γδ T Cell|BIOLOGICAL: γδ T/DC-CIK cells
Reduced size of the tumor., Up to one year
Non small lung cancer will be removed using tumor reducing surgery such as cryosurgery. PBMC of the patient will be separated from peripheral blood. After making them potential cancer killer γδ T Cell and DC-CIK, they will be infused to the patients as immunotherapy.
