ctDNA-based MRD Assessment in Local Advanced Esophageal Carcinoma
To analyze the relationship between the dynamic changes of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and tumor relapse of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Relationship between ctDNA status after chemoradiotherapy and relapse., To assess if recurrent esophageal cancer is detectable earlier by ctDNA positive in plasma., ctDNA will be tested within 1 year after chemoradiotherapy
Changes of ctDNA status., To dynamically evaluate the ctDNA status at baseline, during treatment and follow-up., before and at the end of radiotherapy (+1 week); at the end of consolidation chemotherapy (+1 week); at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year after dCCRT.|Overall survival (OS)., To compare OS in ctDNA(+) patients and ctDNA(-) patients., through study completion, an average of 2 years.|Relapse-free survival (RFS) and progression-free survival (PFS)., To compare RFS and PFS in ctDNA(+) patients and ctDNA(-) patients., through study completion, an average of 2 years.|Relationships between radiomics features, ctDNA status and relapse., To assess if recurrent esophageal cancer is detectable earlier by ctDNA positive in plasma compared to traditional radiographic methods., through study completion, an average of 2 years.
To analyze the relationship between the dynamic changes of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and tumor relapse of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated by concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
