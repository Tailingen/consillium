Therapy for Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma
With the success of current chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, the goal of this protocol is to maintain the currently successful cure rate and reduce treatment related side effects and long term toxicity. The main purpose of this study is to estimate the event free survival of patients treated with risk-adapted therapy compared to historical controls.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: 12 Week Stanford V Chemotherapy|DRUG: 4 cycles of VAMP chemotherapy|DRUG: 2 alternating cycles of VAMP/COP chemotherapy|DRUG: 3 alternating cycles of VAMP/COP chemotherapy
Event-free Survival Probability by Risk Group, Event-free survival (EFS) is based on the time from protocol enrollment to the occurrence of first event (relapse or progressive disease, subsequent malignancy, or death from any cause). Patients not experiencing an event are censored at their last follow-up date. Event-free Survival Probability will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) method with a 95% confidence interval calculated using the Greenwood's formula., Median 6.4 year follow-up
Correlation of Agreement Between Patient Physical QoL and Parent Proxy Physical QoL at Multiple Time Points., Assess and compare the patient reported and parent proxy physical quality of life across multiple time points using the Peds Quality of Life version 4.

This study will evaluate the following objectives:

Primary Objectives:

1. To evaluate the efficacy of 4 cycles of VAMP chemotherapy alone in patients with favorable risk Hodgkin's disease who achieve a complete response after 2 cycles of VAMP chemotherapy.
2. To evaluate the efficacy of 4 cycles VAMP chemotherapy plus low dose RT in patients with favorable risk Hodgkin's disease who achieve a partial response after 2 cycles of VAMP chemotherapy.
3. To evaluate the efficacy of 2 alternating cycles of VAMP/COP chemotherapy (total 4 cycles of chemotherapy) plus low-dose, involved-field RT in children with intermediate risk Hodgkin's disease.
4. To evaluate the efficacy of 12 weeks of Stanford V chemotherapy plus low-dose, involved-field RT in children with unfavorable risk Hodgkin's disease.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To evaluate patient quality of life during and after treatment from the patient and parent perspective.
2. To compare patient and parental ratings of treatment-related symptoms and patient physical, psychological, social and cognitive functioning before the first treatment (T1 - baseline); after Cycle 2 or after 8 weeks of Stanford V (T2 - Evaluate Response); after cycle 4 or after 12 weeks of Stanford V and before or on the first day of radiation (as applicable) (T3); at the conclusion of radiation or within a few days following the end of radiation (as applicable) (T4); and at 3 to 6 months after completion of therapy follow-up evaluation (T5).
