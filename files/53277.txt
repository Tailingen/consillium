Remote Electronic Patient Monitoring in Gastrointestinal Cancer
The goal of this research study is to evaluate a program that involves remote electronic monitoring of vital signs and symptoms of patients with gastrointestinal cancer who were recently hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital or presented to the oncology clinic for an unplanned, urgent visit.

Patients with gastrointestinal cancer often experience troublesome symptoms and side effects related to the cancer and its treatment. Unfortunately, patients commonly require hospital admission or urgent clinic visits to help manage uncontrolled symptoms. For this study, the investigators seek to determine if a program that entails remote electronic monitoring may improve the overall care experience of patients with gastrointestinal cancer who have urgent care needs.

The investigators are asking the participants to take part in this research study because the participants are currently hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital or recently presented to the oncology clinic for an urgent visit, and are receiving treatment at the Cancer Center. The goal of this study is to test a program that involves remote electronic monitoring of vital signs and patient-reported health outcomes. This study is a pilot study, and the investigators are evaluating the feasibility of delivering the program, the acceptability and satisfaction with the program, changes in the quality of life and symptoms of patients who receive the program, as well as the frequency of urgent hospital visits while the patient is in the program.
