68Ga-FAPI PET/CT for the Detection of Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma(ACC)
This study was used to study the diagnostic value of 68Ga-FAPI, a novel fibroblast activating inhibitor, in metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma（ACC）
68Ga-FAPI PET/CT|Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
DRUG: 68Ga-FAPI
Standardized uptake value of 68Ga-FAPI in ACC, The maximum and mean standard uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) were measured in the background of lesion, liver, muscle and mediastinal blood pool, respectively., 1 year
lesions detected by 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT, The number of target lesions in each organ system was calculated by 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT, 1 year
compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT or other imaging like CT and MRI, The number of lesions detected by 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT was compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT or other imaging like CT and MRI, 1 year
68Ga-FAPI is a positron labeled inhibitor of fibroblast activating protein, which has been widely used in malignant tumor imaging in recent years. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare epithelial malignant tumor, which usually originates from salivary glands. Its typical characteristics are long clinical course and high rate of distant metastasis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical value of 68Ga Fapi pet/ct in metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma.
