Phase I/II Trial of a Long Peptide Vaccine (LPV7) Plus TLR Agonists
The purpose of this study is to learn what effects (good and bad) an experimental vaccine (LPV7) plus tetanus peptide and other substances called polyICLC, resiquimod, and Montanide ISA-51 have on you and your melanoma. We will also look at whether the experimental vaccine and these drugs cause any changes in your immune system.

BIOLOGICAL: Peptide Vaccine (LPV7) + Tetanus peptide|OTHER: PolyICLC|OTHER: Resiquimod|OTHER: IFA
Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events Per Study Arm, Safety and toxicity following vaccination with 7 long peptides in melanoma patients with and without TLR agonists.

Patients are evaluated by safety labs and physical exams to assess for toxicity., 6 months|T Cell Response in Peripheral Blood Over Duration of Study Participation, Levels of peptide-reactive CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood: number of participants with T cell response to minimal epitope for CD8 T cells. This was assessed by direct (ex vivo) IFN-gamma ELIspot assay for reactivity to known minimal epitopes. To be considered positive, there had to be an increase compared to the maximum negative control target by at least 2-fold and by at least 20 IFN-gamma secreting cells per 100,000 CD8 T cells evaluated., 6 months
T Cell Response and Function in Peripheral Blood, CD4+ T cell responses to peptides in the vaccine, and their function, 6 months
