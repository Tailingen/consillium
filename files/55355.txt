Effects of Fenofibrate on Metabolic and Reproductive Parameters in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
This is a prospective randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 6 months' duration evaluating the effect of fenofibrate (200 mg/day) in females with polycystic ovary syndrome and mild hypertriglyceridemia. The investigators primary objective will be to determine whether fenofibrate will reduce hepatic adiposity as measured using MRI, and our secondary outcomes will be to delineate the impact of fenofibrate on biochemical or clinical parameters for insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, and reproductive status.
