A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs or worsens in the period extending from the first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose of study drug in this study or start of a new anticancer therapy/procedure, whichever comes earlier. Clinically significant changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory results, and electrocardiogram were reported as AEs., Up to 3 years|Number of Participants Who Experienced At Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE), An SAE is defined as any adverse event (AE) that:

* results in death.
* is life threatening.
* requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (hospitalization for elective procedures or for protocol compliance is not considered an SAE).
* results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
* is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
* important medical events that do not meet the preceding criteria but based on appropriate medical judgement may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Clinically significant changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory results, and electrocardiogram were reported as AEs., Up to 3 years|Number of Participants With ECOG Performance Status Score of 0-3 at the End of Trial (EOT), The ECOG Performance Status is a scale used to asses a person's level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themselves, daily activity, and physical ability.

Participants are asked to mark an "X" on the VAS to indicate their own health and then to report the score in a text box. Positive changes from Baseline represent an an improvement in heath., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 15 (one cycle = 21 days) and EOT (up to 3 years)|Change From Baseline in HRQoL as Measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lymphoma (FACT-Lym), The FACT-Lym consists of a 27-item general core questionnaire (i.e., Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General \[FACT-G\]) and a 15-item disease-specific questionnaire (Lymphoma Subscale). The FACT-G includes 4 domains: physical well-being, social/family well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being. The total FACT-Lym score (0-168) was obtained by summing individual subscale scores. Higher scores for the scales indicate better quality of life. Change was calculated as the value at the last observation minus the value at baseline., Baseline, Day 1 of Cycles 2 to 15 (one cycle = 21 days) and EOT (up to 3 years)
This is a phase 2, multi-center, open-label, single-arm study of efficacy and safety of Camidanlumab Tesirine (ADCT-301) in participants with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. This study will enroll approximately 100 participants.

Camidanlumab Tesirine (ADCT-301) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC), composed of the human monoclonal antibody, HuMax®-TAC, which is directed against human CD25. The antibody is conjugated through a protease cleavable linker to SG3199, a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin.

For each participant the study will include a screening period (of up to 28 days), a treatment period (cycles of 3 weeks), and a follow-up period (approximately every 12-week visits) for up to 3 years after treatment discontinuation.

Participants may continue treatment for up to 1 year or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria, whichever occurs first.

Additionally, patients benefiting clinically at 1 year may continue treatment after a case by case review with the Sponsor.
