Metformin Hydrochloride in Mitigating Side Effects of Radioactive Iodine Treatment in Patients With Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
This pilot clinical trial studies how will metformin hydrochloride works in mitigating the side effects of radioactive iodine treatment in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Metformin hydrochloride may reduce the metabolic activity of cancer cell and of surrounding supportive tissues.
Thyroid
DRUG: Metformin Hydrochloride|OTHER: Radioactive Iodine|OTHER: Placebo
Complete blood count, Longitudinal measures of CBC will be modeled using mixed effects linear regression. Will use a linear contrast to test the null hypothesis that change from pre-resection to post-resection is the same in the control and metformin groups., Up to 36 months of study duration|Serum and salivary exosome profile, Will be modeled using mixed effects linear regression, Up to 36 months of study duration|Incidence of adverse events assessed by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, Up to 36 months of study duration
Xerostomia assessed by modified Vanderbilt Head and Neck Cancer Symposium Survey (version 2.0), Up to 36 months of study duration|Xerophthalmia assessed by modified Vanderbilt Head and Neck Cancer Symposium Survey (version 2.0), Up to 36 months of study duration|Dysgeusia assessed by modified Vanderbilt Head and Neck Cancer Symposium Survey (version 2.0), Up to 36 months of study duration
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate if treatment with metformin hydrochloride (metformin) inhibits radioactive iodine (RAI)-induced myelosuppression and induces faster recovery of white blood cell count to baseline values, the blood counts will be compared in the pre- and post-treatment samples.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Assess safety and tolerability of metformin treatment in subjects undergoing RAI treatment for differentiated thyroid cancer.

II. To assess the effect of metformin treatment on symptoms of xerostomia, xerophthalmia and dysgeusia as assessed by the Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ), the modified Vanderbilt Head and Neck Cancer Symposium Survey (version 2.0), University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTCQLQ)-Head and Neck (H\&N)35.
