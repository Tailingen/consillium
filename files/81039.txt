Clinical Study on the Safety and Efficacy of CAR-T/CAR-NK Cells in the Treatment of Recurrent Refractory or Unresectable Solid Tumors
To investigate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T/CAR-NK cells in patients with recurrent or unresectable solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, glioma, etc

To investigate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T/CAR-NK cells in patients with recurrent or unresectable solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, glioma, etc.

The study was divided into five stages: screening period, single harvest period, pretreatment chemotherapy period, treatment period, observation and follow-up period after treatment.

Subjects were pretreated with FC regimen before transfusion, and the subjects who met the infusion conditions were given CAR-T/CAR-NK cell infusion 1 \~ 2 days after the completion of eluent chemotherapy. The CAR-T/CAR-NK dose is calculated according to the patient's body weight, and the total number of cells transfused is about 1-2x106 /kg. Single intravenous infusion.

The efficacy was evaluated according to the evaluation criteria for solid tumors (RECIST1.1 selection).
