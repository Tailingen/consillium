Secondary Interval Cytoreductive Surgery in Platinum-sensitive Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
About 80% of advanced ovarian cancer patients recurred in 2-3 years. Secondary cytoreduction benefits selected patients who have high chance of complete resection. Whether secondary interval surgery can be used at recurrence is not known.
Recurrent Ovarian Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Carboplatin or cisplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel, gemcitabine or liposomal doxorubicin with or without bevacizumab or biosimilar|DRUG: Bevacizumab or biosimilar|PROCEDURE: Cytoreductive surgery
Complete resection rate, Rate of complete resection at the time of operation, 12 months
12-month progression-free survival rate, The time from the first dose of chemotherapy to the first documentation of objective tumor progression (PD) or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 12 months|12-month overall survival rate, Overall survival is defined as the time from the first dose of chemotherapy to the date of death due to any cause., 12 months|Surgical complication rate, Complications are graded by the Clavien-Dindo classification, 12 months|Quality of life scale, Different functional scales will be assessed by questionnaires like the EORTC questionnaires where all scales range from 0-100. The higher the score, the greater the intensity of that particular item is., 12 months
Our study aims to evaluate the complete resection rate at interval cytoreductive surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer patients, and to determine the safety and survival outcomes of this approach.
