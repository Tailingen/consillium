Benchmarking Intra-tumor Heterogeneity In Ovarian Cancer: Linking In-vivo Imaging Phenotypes With Histology And Genomics
The purpose of this research study is to learn if differences seen in scans before surgery match differences seen when looking at tumor samples with pathology and genetic tests. In this study we will use Magnetic Resonance Imaging \[MRI\] and Positron Emission Tomography \[PET\] scans. No direct clinical benefits will come from the results of this study.
Ovarian Cancer
PROCEDURE: PET/CT Scan|PROCEDURE: MRI
Genomic markers of spatial heterogeneity, by evaluating spatially explicit phenotypic clusters based on a combination of perfusion, diffusion and metabolic tumor profiles (maps) in both ovarian tumors and metastatic peritoneal/omental implants of patients with HGSOC undergoing primary debulking surgery (PDS)., 1 year
Histological and immunohistochemical features, The analyses involving the bioinformatic algorithms will be handled by the Bioinformatics Core. Previously validated bioinformatic algorithms (5, 13, 38) will be used to determine the clonal compositions of the imaging-based phenotypically distinct clusters of HGSOCs, and phylogenetic trees based on allelic frequencies of mutations and copy number aberrations of the primary ovarian tumor and matched metastatic implant will be constructed for each case, 1 year
