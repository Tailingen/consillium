Phase II Study in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Mucinous Melanoma
This is a randomized, controlled, multicenter Phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of toripalimab injection combined with axitinib in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced mucosal melanoma. The target population is the patients with previously untreated, histopathologically confirmed, unresectable or metastatic mucosal melanoma. At the randomization, patients are randomized 1:1:1 into three groups with approximately 33 subjects in each group to receive toripalimab injection plus axitinib, toripalimab injection monotherapy (subjects who meet the criteria after disease progression may cross over to receive toripalimab plus axitinib), or axitinib monotherapy (subjects who meet the criteria after disease progression may cross over to receive toripalimab plus axitinib); when the patient has disease progression or intolerable toxicity, the treatment is terminated, and the survival follow-up will be initiated.

the progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 criteria: Time from the date of randomization to the first documented disease progression (per RECIST 1.1 criteria), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 36 months
INV-ORR, INV-ORR in crossover subjects is the number of subjects with DOR of CR or PR based on INV assessment divided by the number of crossover subjects. DOR is defined as the best response recorded as measured by INV from the date of the first crossover dose to the date of objective documentation of progression per RECIST 1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy, including tumor-directed radiotherapy and tumor-directed surgery, whichever occurs first. For subjects without documented progression or subsequent treatment, all available response designations will be assigned to the DOR evaluation. Baseline tumor assessments for crossover subjects are based on the last tumor assessment for monotherapy prior to the combination crossover. Exploratory endpoints will be analyzed at the time of primary endpoint analysis if data are available., 36 months|ORR, Objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1;, 36 months|PFS, Progression-free survival (PFS) according to RECIST 1.1;, 36 months|DOR, Duration of response (DOR) according to RECIST 1.1;, 36 months|TTR, Time to response (TTR) according to RECIST 1.1;, 36 months|DCR, Disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST 1.1;, 36 months|OS, Overall survival (OS): Time from the date of randomization to death from any cause.
