Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute (MAHI) EchoGo Discovery 1 Protocol
This study aims to compare conventionally acquired Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction (LVEF) and Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS) data to Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven automated processing of 2 dimensional contrast and 2 dimensional non-contrast resting transthoracic echocardiograms for application in the assessment of patients undergoing chemotherapy with cardiotoxic drugs. This is a single-centre retrospective study which utilizes echocardiographic DICOM image and meta-data datasets received from a Canadian site. Data processed using the AI driven automated processing will be compared to conventionally acquired LVEF and GLS measurements and results will be analysed to determine accuracy and precision.

Compare the performance of automated EF and GLS measurements in resting transthoracic echocardiograms against conventional measurement acquisition., Measurements shall be compared using bias and 95% confidence intervals on bias. Regression coefficients and comparative statistics will be employed for this objective., Baseline|Compare the performance of automated EF and GLS measurements in resting transthoracic echocardiograms against conventional measurement acquisition., Measurements shall be compared using bias and 95% confidence intervals on bias.
