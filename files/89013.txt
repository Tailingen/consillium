A Study of Olverembatinib in SDH-deficient GIST.
An international multicenter, open, single-arm pivotal registration phase III study to determine the efficacy and safety of olverembatinib in patients with SDH-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who have previously been treated with one-line therapy, and to evaluate the progression-free survival and clinical benefit rate of olverembatinib in patients with SDH-deficient GIST.

DRUG: Olverembatinib
Progression-free survival(PFS) rate, Proportion of subjects who do not experience disease progression or death after the first dose of treatment as assessed by Independent Review Committee., 36 months
Plasma concentrations of olverembatinib, Blood samples will be collected to measure the plasma concentration of olverembatinib., Cycle 2 to Cycle 3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., According to CTCAE v5.0, the number and frequency of adverse events of test drug were assessed., Through study completion,an average of 2 years.
