Paclitaxel Plus Pembrolizumab vs. Paclitaxel Weekly in ER+ Luminal B Metastatic Breast Cancer
PELICAN is a randomised phase II trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab relative to paclitaxel alone, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative, Luminal B breast cancer who have received no prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease.

Patients will be randomised (2:1) to one of the two treatment arms:

* Pembrolizumab plus Paclitaxel
* Paclitaxel
