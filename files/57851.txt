Epigenetic Nucleosomes in Plasma for Pulmonary Nodule Differentiation
We aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Nu.Q blood test for lung cancer in the Taiwanese population and compare its diagnostic performance with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) or computed tomography (CT). Additionally, we will investigate the potential role of Nu.Q in lung cancer prevention and its impact on survival outcomes.

Study Method:

We plan to collect 20 mL of blood samples from individuals undergoing chest LDCT/CT, isolate plasma for Nu.Q™ analysis, and compare the results with corresponding lung cancer pathology findings. The estimated sample size is 500 participants.

Currently, early lung cancer screening primarily relies on low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) of the chest. However, blood tests offer a more convenient alternative. Despite this, existing blood tests lack sufficient accuracy and sensitivity for lung cancer screening. Developing a reliable blood-based screening tool could significantly enhance the detection rate and accuracy of early lung cancer screening.

Previous studies have shown that nucleosomes undergo variations during early cancer development. The Belgian company Volition has developed a blood test method based on chemiluminescence immunoassay (ChLIA) to measure nucleosomes in the blood, branded as Nu.Q™. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that Nu.Q™ can detect abnormal nucleosome biomarkers associated with early lung cancer.

This study, in collaboration with Volition, will collect 20 mL of blood samples from individuals undergoing chest LDCT. Plasma will be isolated and analyzed using Nu.Q™ at the National Taiwan University Center for Genomics and Precision Medicine. The test results will be compared with corresponding lung cancer medical records, LDCT findings, and pathological diagnoses. The study aims to enroll 500 participants.

The objectives of this study are to validate the diagnostic accuracy of the Nu.Q™ blood test for lung cancer in the Taiwanese population, compare its diagnostic performance with LDCT, and explore its potential role in lung cancer prevention and improved survival outcomes. This study is conducted as an industry-academic collaboration project with National Taiwan University.
