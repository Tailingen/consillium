A Study of Lazertinib as Monotherapy or in Combination With Amivantamab in Participants With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to confirm the tolerability of recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Lazertinib (Phase 1), to determine the tolerability and identify the recommended Phase 2 combination dose of Lazertinib when combined with Amivantamab (JNJ-61186372) (Phase 1b), to characterize the safety and tolerability of Lazertinib and Amivantamab combinations at the RP2CD in participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with documented advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (Phase 1b expansion cohorts A, B, C, D and E), to estimate the antitumor activity of Lazertinib and Amivantamab combinations at the RP2CD in participants with advanced NSCLC with documented advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation (Phase 1b expansion cohorts A, B, C, and D), to validate the biomarker identified in Phase 1b expansion Cohort D as a predictor of antitumor activity of Lazertinib and Amivantamab combination (Cohort E) or Amivantamab monotherapy (Cohort F) in participants with osimertinib-relapsed, chemotherapy-naÃ¯ve, EGFR Exon19del or L858R mutated NSCLC, to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2ChD) of Lazertinib when combined with Amivantamab and standard of care chemotherapy and to determine the tolerability of the Lazertinib, Amivantamab, and platinum-doublet chemotherapy (LACP) combination (Phase 1b LACP combination cohort) and to characterize the safety and tolerability of Lazertinib at the RP2ChD and Amivantamab and standard of care chemotherapy in participants with advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC (Phase 1b LACP combination cohort), to assess 2 potential biomarker strategies to identify participants at increased, or decreased, probability of tumor response with JNJ-61186372 and lazertinib combination in participants with EGFR Exon19del or L858R mutated NSCLC progressed on or after osimertinib (Phase 1b expansion Cohort D).

Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and is also the most common cause of death from cancer. NSCLC accounts for 85 percent (%) to 90% of lung cancers. Lazertinib is an oral, highly potent, mutant-selective, and irreversible EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting both, the T790M mutation and activating EGFR mutations while sparing wild type EGFR. JNJ-61186372 (also referred to as amivantamab), is a low fucose, fully human immunoglobulin G1(IgG1)-based bispecific antibody. As a third generation EGFR-TKI targeting activating EGFR mutations, lazertinib has a distinct mechanism of action from JNJ-61186372, which targets the extracellular domains of both the EGFR and cMet proteins. The distinct mechanisms of action of lazertinib and JNJ-61186372 suggests potential to improve clinical outcomes through the combination of these two molecules. Phase 1 and 1b lazertinib + amivantamab, and Phase 1b LACP combination cohort are divided into 2 periods: screening and treatment period whereas Phase 1b expansion cohorts are divided into 3 periods: screening, treatment, and post-treatment follow up period. Safety assessment will include adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), physical examinations, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria for performance status, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, chest x-ray, baseline ophthalmologic examination (Phase 1b Expansion Cohorts), echocardiography or multigated acquisition, and concomitant medication usage. The overall duration of the study will be up to 5 years and 2 months.
