Fluorescent Probe VGT-309 to ID Cancerous Colorectal Lesions During Augmented Colonoscopy
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of VGT-309 for the visualization of colorectal tumors in real-time using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence endoscopy. In addition, signatures of 50+ biomarkers will be evaluated in biopsies using CODEX multi-plexing.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: VGT-309
Safety Profile of VGT309, Safety profile will be measured by assessing number of Grade 2 or higher adverse events which have been determined to be clinically significant and definitely, probably or possibly related., 18 days|Feasibility of VGT-309, Feasibility to visualize colorectal tumors using NIR-endoscopy will be measured by the tumor-to-background ratio (fluorescence intensity of tumor tissue divided by the fluorescence intensity of normal surrounding tissue) and the concordance between white-light endoscopy assessment, histopathological examination and NIR imaging assessment., 18 days
