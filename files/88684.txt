Cancer
DRUG: MEDI-573
Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AEs were any unfavorable and unintended signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with the use of MEDI-573, whether or not considered related to MEDI-573. A SAE was any AE that resulted in: death; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability or incapacity; was life-threatening; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant; or was an important medical event that may not have resulted in death, threatened life, or required hospitalization and that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may have jeopardized the participant and may have required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes above. TEAEs were defined as AEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of MEDI-573, or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of MEDI-573, up to 30 days after the last dose., From the start of study treatment through 30 days after the last dose of MEDI-573, up to 3.5 years|Number of Participants With Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities Reported as TEAEs, An abnormal laboratory finding that was judged by the investigator to be medically significant was reported as an AE.

Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) After the First Dose, The Cmax was the maximum observed serum concentration of MEDI-573., For weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); For 3 weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); and on Days 8 and 15|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Concentration (Tmax) After the First Dose, The tmax was defined as actual sampling time to reach the maximum observed serum concentration of MEDI-573., For weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); For 3 weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); and on Days 8 and 15|Trough Serum Concentration (Ctrough) After the First Dose, The Ctrough was the lowest serum concentration of MEDI-573 within a dosing interval., For weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); For 3 weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); and on Days 8 and 15|Dose Normalized Cmax (Cmax/Dose) After the First Dose, The Cmax/dose was the dose-normalized maximum serum concentration of MEDI-573., For weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); For 3 weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); and on Days 8 and 15|Area Under the Serum Concentration-time Curve Over the First Dosing Interval (AUCτ), Area under the serum concentration-time curve over the first dosing interval., For weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); For 3 weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); and on Days 8 and 15|Dose-normalized Area Under the Serum Concentration Time Curve Over the First Dosing Interval (AUCτ/Dose), The AUCtau/dose was a measure of dose-normalized area under the serum concentration-time curve over the first dosing interval., For weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); For 3 weekly dosing: Pre- and post-infusion (0, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours post-infusion); and on Days 8 and 15|Number of Participants With Positive Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) to MEDI-573, Two methods were used to assess the immunogenicity data: an ECL-based method and measurement of neutralizing ADA. The titer was calculated by multiplying the minimum assay dilution factor by the reciprocal of the highest dilution factor which yielded an ECL multiple equal to or greater than the screening assay cut-point factor., Pre-infusion on Day 1 of each cycle, end of treatment, and 90 days after last dose MEDI-573 (up to 3.5 years)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the RECIST criteria The CR was defined as disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions and no new lesions; and PR was definded as \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline \[screening\]) and no new lesions., From study entry through the end of the study, up to 3.5 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the duration from the start of treatment with MEDI-573 until the documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., From study entry through the end of the study, up to 3.5 years|Time to Progression, Time to disease progression (TTP) was defined as the duration from the start of treatment with MEDI-573 until the documentation of disease progression., From study entry through the end of the study, up to 3.5 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the start of treatment with MEDI-573 until death., From study entry through the end of the study, up to 3.5 years|Time to Response (TTR), Time to response was defined as the duration from the start of treatment with MEDI-573 to the first documentation of objective response (confirmed CR or PR) and was only assessed in participants who had achieved objective response., From study entry through the end of the study, up to 3.5 years|Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response (confirmed CR or PR) to the first documented disease progression., From study entry through the end of the study, up to 3.5 years|Suppression Profiles of IGF-I and IGF-II Post-Administration of MEDI-573, The suppression profiles of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 post administration of MEDI-573 in relation to time course of antibody concentrations in serum were evaluated during treatment., From the start of study treatment through 30 days after the last dose of MEDI-573, up to 3.5 years
