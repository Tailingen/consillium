Survival Among Patients With Pancreatic Cancer Depending on Surgical Resection Rate
The primary aim of this population-based study is to investigate how a high resection rate of pancreaticoduodenectomy affects overall survival among patients aged ≥70 years with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The secondary aim is to determine if a high resection rate of pancreaticoduodenectomy increases perioperative morbidity.
