This is a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial to prove efficacy of S-1 and Oxaliplatin as Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Advanced Gastric Cancer Patients who undergo D2 gastrectomy.

The primary endpoint is three-year free disease and the second primary includes five-year overall survival, safety and R0 resection rate.
