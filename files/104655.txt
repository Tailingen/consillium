Study of Clinical Outcomes of Thyroid Cancer
The Italian Thyroid Cancer Observatory (ITCO) repository was established to collect data on thyroid cancer management in a prospective and consecutive series of newly-diagnosed patients, enrolled in centers uniformly distributed across the nation.
Thyroid Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Standard treatment
Disease persistence or recurrence, Composite event of disease persistence or recurrence during clinical follow-up, detected by any of the available imaging tools (neck sonography, computed tomography \[CT\], magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\], or positron emission tomography \[PET\]), Up to 10 years from the primary treatment
Disease persistence after 12-18 months from the primary treatment, Rate of disease persistence after 12-18 months from the primary treatment, detected by any of the available imaging tools (neck sonography, radioiodine whole body scan, computed tomography \[CT\], magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\], or positron emission tomography \[PET\]), 12-18 months from the primary treatment|Disease recurrence after 3, 5 and 10 years from the primary treatment, Rate of disease recurrence after 3, 5 and 10 years from the primary treatment, detected by any of the available imaging tools (neck sonography, radioiodine whole body scan, computed tomography \[CT\], magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\], or positron emission tomography \[PET\]), 3, 5 and 10 years from the primary treatment|Response to primary therapy, Response to primary treatment, evaluated according to the American Thyroid Association guidelines response to treatment: excellent response, biochemical incomplete response, indeterminate response, or structural incomplete response (combination of serum tumor markers and imaging tools, such as neck sonography, radioiodine whole body scan, computed tomography \[CT\], magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\], or positron emission tomography \[PET\]), 1, 3, 5 and 10 years after therapy|Response to secondary treatments, Response to secondary treatments, evaluated according to the American Thyroid Association guidelines response to treatment: excellent response, biochemical incomplete response, indeterminate response, or structural incomplete response (combination of serum tumor markers and imaging tools, such as neck sonography, radioiodine whole body scan, computed tomography \[CT\], magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\], or positron emission tomography \[PET\]), 1, 3, 5 and 10 years after therapy
Little information is available on current practices in the treatment of thyroid cancer: a web-based thyroid cancer database was created to collect real-life data. The participants' network include tertiary referral centers operating at the national level, as well as smaller hospital-based units with local or regional recruitment areas.
