Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants achieving complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), or partial remission (PR) as their best response per investigator assessment based on the T-PLL consensus criteria 2019.

CR: All of the following response criteria must be met:

Group A:

* all lymph nodes \< 1 cm;
* spleen \< 13 cm;
* no constitutional symptoms;
* circulating lymphocyte count \< 4 × 10\^9/L;
* bone marrow T-PLL cells \< 5% of mononuclear cells;
* no other specific site involvement

Group B:

* platelets ≥ 100 × 10\^9 /L;

* neutrophils ≥ 1.5 × 10\^9 /L.

CRi: All of the CR response criteria in Group A met; at least 1 parameter in Group B not achieved, unrelated to T-PLL, but related to drug toxicity.

PR: At least 2 of the parameters in Group A and 1 parameter in Group B need to improve if previously abnormal. If only 1 parameter of both Groups A and B is abnormal prior to therapy, only 1 parameter needs to improve., Clinical response was assessed at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 for ORR assessment
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose of any study drug to the date of earliest disease progression or death. PFS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods.

TTP was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods.

Clinical response (laboratory and physical examination assessments) was assessed by the investigator according to the T-PLL consensus criteria 2019.

Progressive disease is defined as meeting at least one of the criteria of Group A or Group B below:

Group A:

* lymph nodes increase in \> 20% in SLD from nadir;

EFS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods.

Clinical response (laboratory and physical examination assessments) was assessed by the investigator according to the T-PLL consensus criteria 2019.

Progressive disease is defined as meeting at least one of the criteria of Group A or Group B below:

Group A:

* lymph nodes increase in \> 20% in SLD from nadir;

Stable disease is defined as meeting all of the following criteria for at least 3 months:

* lymph nodes change of -29% to +20% in SLD;
* spleen change of -49% to +49% beyond normal from baseline;

OS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods., From first dose of study drug to end of study; median time on study was 30.1 weeks.|Number of Eligible Participants Reaching Autologous or Allogeneic Transplantation, Participants eligible for autologous or allogeneic transplantation were transplant-naïve participants who achieved CR., From first dose of study drug to end of study; median time on study was 30.1 weeks.|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Treatment-emergent AEs are any event with onset after the first dose of study drug and no more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug.

A serious AE was an event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or an important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent a serious outcome.

The Investigator rated the severity of each AE according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0, where grade 1 = mild, grade 2 = moderate, grade 3 = severe, grade 4 = life-threatening and grade 5 = death.

The Investigator assessed the relationship of the AE to the use of study drug., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last dose; median time on treatment was 13.86 weeks (range 1.0 to 44.4 weeks)
This study is planned as an adaptive 2-stage design as follows:

Stage 1: Enroll 14 participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) T-PLL and move to Stage 2 if 4 or more participants meet protocol-specified response criteria. Response assessment will be performed on a continued basis until all 14 participants have enrolled into Stage 1 and have completed the Week 24 disease assessment.

Stage 2: Enroll up to an additional 23 participants.

The study was stopped after Stage 1. Stage 2 was not conducted.
