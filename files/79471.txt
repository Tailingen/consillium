Registry Study on Patient Characteristics, Biological Disease Profile and Clinical Outcome in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Related Neoplasms - The Biology and Outcome (BiO)-Project
This is a registry study in adult patients with newly diagnosed or refractory/relapsed myeloid neoplasms

Investigator's sites: 80-90 sites in Germany and Austria

Estimated duration of observation of an individual patient:

10 years maximum

Objectives

* To register all patients with AML and related neoplasms, newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory in all AMLSG participating centers (completeness)
* To perform rapid analyses of disease-related genetic markers (incidences, treatment recommendations)
* To assess patient and family history, as well as patient characteristics
* To evaluate treatment response (CR, CRh, CRi) and outcome data (event-free survival \[EFS\], relapse-free survival \[RFS\], cumulative incidence of relapse \[CIR\], cumulative incidence of death \[CID\], overall survival \[OS\])
* To evaluate the impact of measurable residual disease (MRD) by different methods
* To assess biological disease features and correlate with clinical outcome data (prognostic and predictive markers)
* To store biosamples from all patients (e.g., bone marrow, blood, plasma, normal tissue; e.g., skin biopsy, finger nails, hairs, sputum, or urine)
