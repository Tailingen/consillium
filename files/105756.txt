Local Therapy for Oligometastatic ESCC Patients Treated With PD-1 Inhibitor
Patients with oligometastatic squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either PD-1 inhibitor +/- chemotherapy combined with local therapy or PD-1 inhibitor +/- chemotherapy alone.

The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary end points included overall survival, side effects and local control.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Oligometastatic Disease|Radiotherapy
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: PD-1 inhibitor+/- chemotherapy combined with local therapy|DRUG: systemic therapy alone
Progression-free survival difference of PD-1 inhibitor+radiotherapy and PD-1 inhibitor alone, The time between the start of the study treatment(day 1) and progression disease(PD), 3-year
overall survival difference of PD-1 inhibitor+radiotherapy and PD-1 inhibitor alone, The time between the start of the study treatment(day 1) and death from an cause or last follow-up for patients alive at the end of the study, 3-year|treatment related side effect, Record the treatment related side effects including acute and late side effects, acute side effects within 3 months, late side effects for 3 months later|local control rate, the portion of patients who do not develop progression disease or exacerbation of clinical symptoms despite stable disease, 1-year, 3-year
Patients with oligometastatic squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled and 2:1 randomly assigned to receive either PD-1 inhibitor +/- chemotherapy combined with local therapy (radiotherapy, surgery, radiofrequency/microwave ablation, etc.) or PD-1 inhibitor +/- chemotherapy alone. Different local therapy techniques are allowed to be used on different lesions in the same patient.All suspected malignant lesion should be included in local treatment planning in principle.

The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). The second end points included overall survival, side effects and local control.
