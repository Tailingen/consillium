Survival Outcome After Minilaparotomy for the Treatment of Colorectal Cancer
The primary aim of this study is

- to determine the difference of survival outcome (3-year overall survival, 3y OS) between after minilaparotomy and after laparoscopy..

Other aims include to determine the data below when minilaparotomy and laparoscopy are compared with each other.

* 3-year disease free survival, 3y DFS
* 5-year overall survival, 5y OS
* 5-year disease free survival, 5y DFS
* Local recurrence rate, LRR
* Postoperative complications Incidence and mortality at 30 days
