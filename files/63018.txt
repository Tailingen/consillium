A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Activity of RO7496353 in Combination With a Checkpoint Inhibitor With or Without Standard-of-Care Chemotherapy in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RO7496353 when administered in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) with or without standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer (GC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The study will be conducted in 2 stages: an initial safety run-in stage and an expansion stage.
