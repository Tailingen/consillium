CPRIT: Patient Adherence to Lung Cancer Screening
To understand participants' barriers to lung cancer screening and their experience with scheduling lung cancer screening.
Lung Cancer Screening
BEHAVIORAL: Lung Cancer Screening
Safety and Adverse Events (AEs), Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives/Aims

1. Determine rates of lung cancer scheduling and screening at the UTMB and UT Tyler LCS programs.
2. Using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) approaches, develop prediction models for adherence to screening guidelines for newly eligible and established patients. Investigators will leverage data from BRFSS, UT Tyler and UTMB to develop and validate the prediction model, ensuring its generalizability and accuracy.
3. Survey participants in the LCS programs about their impressions and experience with the scheduling and completing screening; conduct interviews with participants who receive an order for LCS but do not complete screening by their due date.
4. Interview LCS program directors and staff about barriers and facilitators of increasing screening rates in their programs.
