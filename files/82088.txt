Immunotherapy Combined With Y-90 SIRT Therapy in Advanced Stage Intrahepatic Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC)
A multicenter Phase II, randomized, prospective, open-label Trial investigating the clinical impact on combining Specific Internal Radiotherapy (SIRT) with the PD1-L Inhibitor Durvalumab and the CTLA-4 Inhibitor Tremelimumab in patients with intrahepatic Biliary Tract Cancer
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab
Objective Response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1, Proportion of allocated subjects with best response of complete or partial response, 20 months
Safety (rate of adverse events), Type, incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, From first patient included until study closure (approx. 43 months after First Patient Included)|Duration of response (DoR), Time from that the measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that the PD is objectively documented or death, From first measurement of CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 until disease progression occurs (up to 43 months until Study Closure)|Progression free survival (PFS), Time from the date of randomization to the date of first observed disease progression (investigator assessment according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, From date of randomization until disease progression occurs (up to 43 months until Study Closure)|Overall Survival (OS), time from the date of treatment allocation to the date of death., Date of enrollment until date of death if applicable (up to 43 months until Study Closure)
Translational research, Exploratory: Predictive biomarkers that with a potential effect on Objective Response Rate, Duration of Response, Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival via blood sample collection + genetic subset analysis. The following translational research is currently planned, but may be adapted taking into account new research data: Tumors will be tested for mRNA expression of PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression, Immune cell infiltrates (IGHM, CD3, CD8, FOXP3, CD68, CD205), Chemokines (CXCL9. CXCL10, CXCL13) and invasion markers (MMP7, MMP9), 3 months
IMMUWHY Phase II Clinical Trial will test the Addition of the immunotherapeutic agents Durvalumab and Tremelimumab after an initial Standard of Care SIRT in patients suffering from non-resectable intrahepatic Biliary Tract Cancer. Patients will be randomized into two experimental arms, one receiving Durvalumab only, the other one receiving Durvalumab + Tremelimumab. Clinical Outcomes will be compared vs. historical datasets.
