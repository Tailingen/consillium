A Study of YL202 in Selected Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is a multicenter, open-label, phase II study of YL202 in China to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK characteristics of YL202 in the following selected patients with advanced solid tumors.
NSCLC|Breast Cancer|HNSCC|Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: YL202 should be intravenously infused
ORR assessed according to RECIST v1.1, ORR: defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., By the end of trial date, approximately within 36 months|Determination of the recommended dose of YL202 in the pivotal clinical study, By the end of trial date, approximately within 36 months
Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed according to RECIST v1.1, approximately within 36 months|Clinical benefit rate (CBR) assessed according to RECIST v1.1, approximately within 36 months|depth of response (DpR) assessed according to RECIST v1.1, Approximately within 36 months|disease control rate (DCR) assessed according to RECIST v1.1, Approximately within 36 months|duration of response (DOR) assessed according to RECIST v1.1, Approximately within 36 months|time to response (TTR) assessed according to RECIST v1.1, Approximately within 36 months|Evaluate the overall survival (OS), Approximately within 36 months|Adverse event (AE), described in terms of type, frequency, severity, time, and relationship with study treatment, Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter AUC, steady-state area under curve (AUC), Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter Cmax, peak concentration (Cmax), Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter Ctrough, trough concentration (Ctrough), Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter CL, clearance (CL), Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter Vd, volume of distribution (Vd), Approximately within 36 months|Characterize the PK parameter t1/2, half-life (t1/2), Approximately within 36 months|Incidence of anti-YL202 antibody, approximately within 36 months|Establish a POP PK model for exposure-response relationship analysis, approximately within 36 months|Evaluate the relatonship between different levels of HER3 expression and the sum of CR rate, PR rate and SD rate, approximately within 36 months
