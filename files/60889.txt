A Study of hSTC810 in Combination With Paclitaxel in Relapsed or Refractory Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the safety and efficacy of hSTC810 and paclitaxel combination therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Phase Ib will evaluate the safety of the combination of hSTC810 with a standard dose of paclitaxel using a 3+3 dose escalation design. Phase II will evaluate the efficacy of hSTC810 + paclitaxel combination therapy using a Simon 2-stage method.
