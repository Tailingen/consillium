Evaluation of Prognosis With Integrated MRI/PET in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
The aim of this study was to evaluate MR/PET with both functional and molecular imaging on the prediction of prognosis in patients with suspected pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
DEVICE: The imaging biomarkers determined by MR-PET
The tumor recurrence rate after operation at 6 months, 6 months
The overall survival after operation at 6 months, 6 months
The results of MR/PET will be compared prospectively to dedicated MDCT or MR imaging, pathologic results, and clinical outcomes to assess the value of MR/PET in pancreatic cancers.
