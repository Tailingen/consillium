Analysis of T Cell Metabolism in Relapsed AML Patients With DLIs and Bicanorm Treatment
In this study, the outcomes of relapsed AML patients receiving DLIs and Bicanorm (Sodium bicarbonate) were analyzed including T cell metabolism and immune phenotype.

Serum pH, Measurement of serum pH, 2 months
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients suffering from relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) have a poor survival outcome. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) to induce graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects have a limited survival benefit.

Extensive preclinical studies have shown a beneficial effect of sodium bicarbonate on metabolic fitness of leukemia-reactive T cells in GvL AML models. Therefore, the investigators aimed to investigate a potential benefit of Bicanorm (Sodium bicarbonate) treatment accompanying DLIs in relapsed AML patients. The investigators determined the metabolic and immune phenotype of T cells isolated from patients receiving DLIs before and after Bicanorm (Sodium bicarbonate) treatment.
