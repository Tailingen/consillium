CCCG-ALCL-2020 for Chinese Children and Adolescents with Newly Diagnosed High-risk ALCL

Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) accounts for 15% of pediatric and adolescent non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). In our historical study (retrospective multicenter study), the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was 65% for 80 eligible patients treated in 10 centers between January 2009 and June 2014.

The ALCL99 trial reported a 2-year overall survival of 92% and 2-year event-free survival of 74% then become the current standard frontline treatment for pediatric ALCL. The recent long-term follow-up data from ALCL99 trial highlighted its excellent outcome. A less toxic schedule of methotrexate (MTX) 3g/m2 in a 3-hour infusion without intrathecal therapy reproduced the favorable results from previous reports of NHL-BFM90 protocol with MTX at 1g/m2 in a 3-hour infusion. Additionally, a prospective ALCL-Relapse trial by the European Inter-Group for Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma demonstrated 80% of patients with a late relapse can be cured by 24 months of vinblastine monotherapy. However, vinblastine would not be advised as a treatment option in mainland China due to its inaccessibility. A pilot experience using single-drug vinorelbine in 4 pediatric patients with relapsed ALCL with satisfactory outcome provides the rational for studying vinorelbine as a front line drug option.
