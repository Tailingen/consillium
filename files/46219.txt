The study enrols patients from four different NHL subtypes: follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and other indolent NHL (iNHL). The study will employ a two-stage design where the decision to further enrol any NHL subtype in stage 2 will depend on best responses after two or three cycles in stage 1.
