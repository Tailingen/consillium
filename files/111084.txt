Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Extent Evaluation: Radiologic, Laparoscopic and Pathologic.
pathologically proved ovarian cancer patients that underwent contrast enhanced abdomino-pelvic CT and diagnostic laparoscopy before cytoreductive surgery (CRS) will be included in the study. Calculation of PCI (peritoneal cancer index) using Sugarbaker's method, peritoneal carcinomatosis extent will be categorized into low, moderate and large. Agreement in general and in each category between CT, laparoscopy, surgery and pathology will be assessed using kappa agreement.
Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: laparoscopy
peritoneal carcinomatosis, Agreement in general and in each category between CT, laparoscopy, surgery and pathology was assessed using kappa agreement., one year
surgical decision making., correlation of peritoneal carcinomatosis categorization with surgical decision, one year
we will search medical records of primary ovarian cancer patients underwent CT abdomen, laparoscopy followed by cytoreductive surgery to calculate peritoneal carcinomatosis extent by each modality.

Regional PCI was calculated in each of the 13 anatomical abdominopelvic regions, then total PCI by summation of the lesion size score, it ranged from 0 to 39. Categorization of peritoneal carcinomatosis was classified into 3 categories low if PCI \< 10, moderate if 10-20, and large if \>20.
