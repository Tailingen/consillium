Study of ASTX029 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, Phase 1-2 study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of ASTX029 administered orally to subjects with advanced solid malignancies who are not candidates for approved or available therapies.

ASTX029 is a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) 1/2. ASTX029 has not been previously evaluated in human subjects. The Phase 1 portion of this study will assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the recommended dosing regimen of ASTX029 administered orally. The Phase 2 portion will assess preliminary clinical activity in tumors characterized by gene aberrations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway that may confer sensitivity to ASTX029.
