Botulinum Toxin for Stomach Cancer Treatment
Preclinical studies at our institution, using a genetic mouse model of gastric cancer, strongly suggest that innervation of the stomach wall is required not only for the development, but also for the progression of gastric cancer, and that denervation of the stomach either by vagotomy or by injection of botulinum toxin (Botox®) in the stomach wall may represent an effective therapeutic intervention. New treatment options for inoperable cancer in the stomach are urgently needed, and local treatment with botulinum toxin seems to be an attractive possibility. In this pilot study Botox injections will be given by gastroscopy in both the tumor and the surrounding stomach wall. The purpose of the study is to obtain data needed to calculate sample size in a larger controlled trial.
