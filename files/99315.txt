Total Body Irradiation (TBI) is an oncological radiotherapy technique that has been used for several decades in patients undergoing bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation.

The role of TBI is:

To suppress the recipient's immune system to prevent rejection of the donor's bone marrow, whether familial or non-familial.

To eradicate residual neoplastic cells following chemotherapy treatments.

TBI is typically employed in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic disorders affecting blood cell elements (e.g., acute and chronic leukemias, aplastic anemia, lymphomas, etc.), as well as other conditions such as neuroblastoma, Ewing's tumor, and pediatric sarcomas with a poor prognosis.

Treatment choice is usually established following multidisciplinary discussions, based on disease characteristics and stage, concurrent pathologies and pharmacological treatments, patient preferences, and functional aspects. Data collection related to radiotherapy plays a crucial role in understanding various clinical aspects of the treatment itself. The availability of data from an increasing number of patients will allow the identification of clinical situations or technical parameters of radiotherapy correlated with treatment tolerance and effectiveness, aiming to identify the best treatment for these oncological pathologies.

This project aims to collect data related to total body irradiation treatments for scientific dissemination with the goal of establishing the basis for evaluating achieved results over time and deriving from these elements useful for guiding the most effective treatment strategies and appropriate operational protocols.
