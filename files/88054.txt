A Study of RO5509554 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Paclitaxel in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study will assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RO5509554 in participants with advanced solid tumors which are not amenable to standard treatment. In Part I (Dose Escalation), multiple ascending doses of RO5509554 will be administered as monotherapy in participants with solid tumors. Participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic ovarian (including fallopian tube) and breast carcinoma will receive multiple ascending doses of RO5509554 in combination with paclitaxel. In Part II (Expansion Cohort), RO5509554 will be administered as monotherapy to participants with locally advanced and/or metastatic Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS)/Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor (TGCT), soft tissue sarcoma or malignant mesothelioma, ovarian (including fallopian tube), endometrial or breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. Participants with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)/neu negative breast cancer will receive RO5509554 in combination with paclitaxel. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or participant refusal, whichever occurs first.
