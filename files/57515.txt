Addition of P1101 to Imatinib Treatment in Patients With Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia Not Achieving a Complete Molecular Response
In this phase I pilot study, it is planned to investigate the feasibility and safety of adding an interferon therapy to an preexisting imatinib treatment in patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukaemia. The participating patients have already reached a response during their imatinib therapy (CCyR) but have still a detectable disease (no molecular response MR 4.5 or better).
Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: P1101
Number and seriousness of adverse events to evaluate safety and tolerability, The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of the addition of P1101 to the pre-study established dose of imatinib., 30 months
Efficacy (Number of patients achieving an improvement of remission status), Secondary objective is to determine the rate of achievement of â‰¥ 1 log reduction from the initial BCR-ABL transcript level at study entry and the achievement of molecular remission 4.5 or undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts., 30 months
