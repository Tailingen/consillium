A Study of Dulanermin in Combination With Rituximab in Subjects With Follicular and Other Low Grade, CD20+, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas
This Phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter trial is designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of dulanermin when combined with rituximab in subjects with follicular, CD20+, B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) that has progressed following a response of ≥ 6 months duration to a prior rituximab-containing therapy. The multicenter, international, randomized Phase II part of this study will commence only after the safety and available pharmacokinetic data from the Phase Ib part of the study have been evaluated by the Sponsor and have been provided to participating investigators and the FDA.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Dulanermin|DRUG: Rituximab
Phase Ib: Number of Participants With a Dose-limiting Toxicity, A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as a National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v3.0 Grade ≥ 3 hematologic or major organ toxicity that was related to study drug (i.e., dulanermin). Although a patient may have experienced a DLT at any time during the study, only events that occurred within the DLT assessment window were considered for dose-escalation decisions and determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)., The DLT assessment window was defined as the duration required to complete two full cycles of treatment with dulanermin (2 * 21 days) and four doses of rituximab (usually through Day 28).|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Severity Grade, Safety was assessed through summaries of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs); AEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0, according to the following guidelines: Grade 1 (Mild); Grade 2 (Moderate); Grade 3 (Severe); Grade 4 (Life-threatening or disabling) and Grade 5 (Death related to AE)., From Baseline through Study Termination (up to a maximum of approximately 13 months for phase Ib and up to approximately 33 months for phase II)|Phase II: Objective Response as Assessed by the Independent Review Facility (IRF), Objective response was defined as a confirmed or unconfirmed complete response (CR, CRu) or partial response (PR) assessed on the basis of clinical, radiographic (computed tomography (CT) scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and inguinal region), and pathologic (i.e., bone marrow) criteria and according to the modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria. All radiographic and clinical data for the evaluation of objective response were submitted to an IRF for blinded and impartial assessment.

Patients without a post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders., From Baseline through Study Termination (up to approximately 33 months)|Vital Signs: Change From Baseline in Diastolic and Systolic Blood Pressure at Treatment Termination Visit, Blood pressure was measured at baseline and throughout the study. Change from baseline was calculated using the patient's last recorded measurement at the completion of treatment visit - baseline measurement., Baseline and Treatment Termination visit (8 weeks for Rituximab arm and 12 weeks for combination and Dulanermin arms)|Vital Signs: Change From Baseline in Heart Rate at Treatment Termination Visit, Heart rate was measured at baseline and throughout the study. Change from baseline was calculated using the patient's last recorded measurement at the completion of treatment visit - baseline measurement., Baseline and Treatment Termination visit (8 weeks for Rituximab arm and 12 weeks for combination and Dulanermin arms)|Vital Signs: Change From Baseline in Body Temperature at Treatment Termination Visit, Body temperature was measured at baseline and throughout the study. Change from baseline was calculated using the patients last recorded measurement at the completion of treatment visit - baseline measurement., Baseline and Treatment Termination visit (8 weeks for Rituximab arm and 12 weeks for combination and Dulanermin arms)|Number of Participants With a Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormality, Laboratory Parameters were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE). A clinically significant abnormality was defined as a Grade 3 (severe) or Grade 4 (very severe, life threatening, or disabling) laboratory toxicity according to the NCI CTCAE v3.0., Baseline and Treatment Termination visit (8 weeks for Rituximab arm and 12 weeks for combination and Dulanermin arms).|Mean Serum Concentration of Dulanermin, The dulanermin serum concentration was measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., Blood samples were taken 0.5, 1.5, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 24 hours after the start of the infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1.
Phase II: Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first and was based on the investigator's assessment using the modified IWG criteria. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate median time to PFS. Data for patients without disease progression or death on study were censored at the time of the last tumor assessment., From Baseline through Study Termination (up to approximately 33 months)|Phase II: Overall Survival, Median overall survival could not be estimated because of the low number of deaths at the time of study termination., From Baseline through Study Termination (up to approximately 33 months)|Phase II: Objective Response as Assessed by the Investigator, Objective response was defined as a confirmed or unconfirmed complete response(CR, CRu) or partial response (PR) assessed on the basis of clinical, radiographic (computed tomography (CT) scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis and inguinal region), and pathologic (i.e., bone marrow) criteria and according to the modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Patients without a post-baseline tumor assessment were considered non-responders., From Baseline through Study Termination (up to approximately 33 months)|Phase II: Duration of Response as Assessed by the Investigator, An event was defined as documented disease progression or death on study, whichever occurred first. Duration of objective response was defined only for patients with an objective response as determined by the investigator and was the time from the initial response to disease progression or death on study.

Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate median, percentiles, and range of duration of response., From Baseline through Study Termination (up to approximately 33 months)
