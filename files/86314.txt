Preliminary Anti-tumour Activity of mTor Kinase Inhibitor in Advanced Tumours
To investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD8055 intermittent dosing schedules when given orally to patients with advanced solid malignancies and lymphomas. Two intermittent dosing schedules will be explored with increasing doses until a maximum tolerated dose is determined for each schedule.
