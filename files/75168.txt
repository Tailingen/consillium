Single or Triple Uterine Tourniquet at Myomectomy
The aim of study is to compare triple tourniquet vs. single tourniquet to reduce blood loss at open myomectomy.
Uterine Myoma
PROCEDURE: Single tourniquet|PROCEDURE: Triple tourniquet
Estimated blood loss at the end of myomectomy, Surgical blood loss will be estimated by sum of the volume of suction fluid and blood loss quantitated by gravimetric method.

Suction fluid will be measured at the end of operation and volume of irrigation fluid will be subtracted from total suction volume.

â—¦Surgical drapes, sponges and towels will be weighted before and just after surgery. The blood loss will be estimated as differences in gram by weighing when 1ml blood supposed as 1.06 gr., 15 minutes postoperatively
The amount of transfusions, Erythrocyte transfusions will be allowed when haemoglobin dropped below 8 g/dL., 7 Days|A change in hemoglobin, At baseline and 48 hours after surgery|Volume in drains, Drain will be removed when discharge drops below 50 ml/day, 7 days|Peri-operative complications, Including but not limited to fever, pelvic infections, wound infections., 6 weeks|Total operation time, Skin to skin operation time, 5 minutes post operatively|Tourniquet time, 5 minutes after tourniquet removed
Anti-Mullerian Hormone levels variation, Anti-Mullerian Hormone levels before surgery, 6 months and 12 months after surgery, One year postoperatively
The aim of study is to compare triple tourniquet vs. single tourniquet to reduce blood loss at open myomectomy.
