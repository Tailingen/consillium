Phase 1 Study of IBR854 in Locally Advanced Or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This study is an open-label, phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of IBR854 cell injection in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: IBR854 Cell Injection
Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLTs), To collect dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurring within 21 days after the first dose, From day1 to day 21|The incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), To evaluate the safety of IBR854 cell injection, From day 1 to day 90 after the first dose
Objective response rate (ORR), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of IBR854 cell injection, 1 year|Disease control rate (DCR), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of IBR854 cell injection, 1 year|Duration of remission (DOR), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of IBR854 cell injection, 1 year|Progression-free survival (PFS), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of IBR854 cell injection, 1 year|Overall survival (OS), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of IBR854 cell injection, 1 year|The number of IBR854 cells, Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to detect the number of IBR854 cells in peripheral blood, 1 year|Anti-CAR antibodies, Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to detect anti-CAR(anti-5T4 mAb) antibodies, 1 year
This study is a dose escalation study which adopts the 3+3 dose escalation design protocol. The dose is respectively 3.0×10\^9 cells, 5.0×10\^9 cells and 7.0×10\^9 cells. The administration is performed on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle (21 days). 3-6 subjects will be enrolled at every dose level. The first and second subjects in the same group shall be enrolled at an interval of at least 7 days, for the purpose of ensuring their safety. Only when the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of all subjects in the previous dose group was observed can the enrollment of the next dose group get started.
