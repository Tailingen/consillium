Low-dose Temozolomide for 2 Weeks on Brain Tumor Enzyme in Patients With Gliomas (P04602 AM1) (Completed)
The main purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a two-week pre-surgery treatment with low-dose temozolomide (TMZ) on brain tumor methylguanine-DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) methyltransferase (MGMT) activity in patients with gliomas.
Glioma
DRUG: temozolomide
MethylGuanine-DNA MethylTransferase [MGMT] Activity Measured From the Tumor Tissue During Surgery, An experimental assay was developed to measure MGMT levels., 14 days
Safety: Number of Participants Who Experienced Grade 3 or 4 Toxicities, Grade 3 was defined as severe per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

Grade 4 was defined as life-threatening per CTCAE., 12 months|Tolerability: Number of Participants Discontinuing Treatment Due to Adverse Events (AE), An AE was defined as any event which was adverse, including what were commonly described as adverse or undesirable experiences, adverse events, adverse reactions, side effects, or death due to any cause associated with, or observed in conjunction with the use of a drug, biological product, or device in humans, whether or not considered related to the use of that product. Additionally, any event which was associated with, or observed in conjunction with product overdose whether accidental or intentional, or product abuse and/or withdrawal was also considered an AE., 12 months|Concentrations of Temozolomide in the Serum, Cerebrospinal Fluid, and Brain Tumor, No data available: at the time of tumor collection, the temozolomide levels were below the detection limits of the assay., 14 days|MGMT Activity in the Brain Tumor Tissues by Temozolomide Levels, No data available: at the time of tumor collection, the temozolomide levels were below the detection limits of the assay., 14 days
