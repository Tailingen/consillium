Impact of Systematic Shaving on Margins
The objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the reduction of positive margins in the definitive pathology of patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery with the systematic shaving technique compared to conventional surgery, and the reduction of second interventions for margin enlargement.
Margin, Tumor-Free|Breast Cancer|Surgery
PROCEDURE: Margin shaving
Margin involvement, To compare the number of cases with affected margins in the definitive pathological anatomy, of the cases with intraoperative systematic shaving versus the group of no shaving, 3 weeks after each surgery|Re-interventions, Demonstrate the reduction of second surgeries to widen affected margins in breast conserving surgery with the shaving technique, 3 weeks after each surgery
Shaving versus intraoperative pathological study, Assess the possibility of replacing the intraoperative study of the margins with systematic shaving, 3 weeks after each surgery
Patients with breast cancer who undergo breast-conserving surgery are randomized in the operating room after lumpectomy into 2 groups of 117 patients each: shaving/no-shaving (standard surgery).
