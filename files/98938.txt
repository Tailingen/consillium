Secondary Endolymphatic Hydrops and Vestibular Schwannomas on 3 Tesla MRI
Endolymphatic hydrops is well known of the lay public in its primary form that is Ménière disease. Nowadays, the best w ay to approach it in vivo, is to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

However, endolymphatic hydrops don't limit itself to its primary form but cover a whole range of pathologies.

The hypothesis is that patients with vestibular schwannomas are more likely to develop secondary saccular hydrops.

The aim is to compare high-resolution T2-weighted images of the saccule in patients followed up for vestibular schwannomas with healthy volunteers and histological sections from cadavers in order to identify its changes.

The secondary purpose of The protocol is to determine if vestibular and audiometric abnormalities could be related to this secondary hydrops more specifically than to the tumor size and localisation.
