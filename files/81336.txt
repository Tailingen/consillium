The ctDNA for Evaluating Whether to Use Adjuvant Therapy After SBRT in Patients With Early Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether ctDNA could help to evaluate whether to use drug adjuvant therapy after SBRT in patients with early lung cancer.
Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
DRUG: drug adjuvant therapy
PFS, progression-free survival, 3-year
PFS, progression-free survival, 5-year|OS, overall survival, 3-year|OS, overall survival, 5-year
This is a prospective study. The purpose of this study is to determine whether MRD could help to evaluate whether to use drug adjuvant therapy after SBRT in patients with early lung cancer. The ctDNA was detected for early stage lung cancer patients before and after SBRT. If a high level of ctDNA was detected after SBRT, the patients were randomly divided into observation group and adjuvant treatment group.
