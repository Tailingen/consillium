Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy Protocol in Cervix Cancer
Definitive treatment protocol for high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with intracavitary radiotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer: A phase II trial
Radiation
RADIATION: High-dose Intensity-modulated radiotherapy
Progression-free survival, Progression means locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, and local tumor pregression, 30 months
Overall survival, 30 months|Treatment-related adverse events are assessed by CTCAE v4.0., Toxicity, acute within 3 months and chronic after 3 months after radiotherapy
Radiotherapy

1. intensity-modulated radiotherapy of whole pelvis: 60 Gy in 30 fx Re-simulation with pelvic Magnetic resonance imaging at 46 Gy in 23 fx and intensity-modulated radiotherapy on the gross cervical and nodal tumor (initially Positron emission tomography-positive), 14 Gy in 7 fx
2. intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost of gross cervical tumor or Intra-cavitary radiotherapy (ICR)

   * Re-staging pelvic Magnetic resonance imaging , if complete response occurs Intra-cavitary radiotherapy to A point, 25 Gy in 5 fx for 2 weeks
   * Re-staging pelvic Magnetic resonance imaging I, partial response or stable disease occurs intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost , 10 Gy in 4 fx to the gross cervical tumor for 1 week
