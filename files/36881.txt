A Study of LY3023414 in Japanese Participants With Advanced Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability of an investigational drug known as LY3023414 in Japanese participants with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to another part(s) of the body. The study will also explore the safety of the drug. It will measure how much of the drug gets into the blood steam and how long the body takes to get rid of it. It will investigate anti-cancer activity.
