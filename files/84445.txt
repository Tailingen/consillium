Assessment of [18F]FLT-PET Imaging for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Brain Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the radiopharmaceutical 3'-deoxy-3'-\[F-18\]fluorothymidine, \[F-18\]FLT, a tracor of cell proliferation, using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging for the tumor diagnosis and prognosis in a group of 50 patients with different type of brain tumors.\[F-18\]FLT PET imaging will be compared to the current used imaging techniques of MRI, spectroscopy imaging, PET imaging using \[11C\]MET tracer, immunohistochemical analysis and clinical parameters.

To evaluated the aggressive potential of brain tumors related to cell proliferation index measured by [18F]FLT, Day 10
To compare the efficiency of [18F]FLT with [11C]MET, Day 15|To define relations between [18F]FLT uptake and clinical, histological and radiological parameters, Day 90|To define relations between [18F]FLT uptake and patient survival, J90
