A Phase II Study of T-DXd Plus SRT in HER2-positive Breast Cancer Brain Metastases
This research study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) combined with Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan (T-DXd; DS-8201a) in HER2-positive Breast Cancer Patients with newly diagnosed or progressing Brain Metastases.

DRUG: Combination use of SRT with T-DXd
Intracranial objective response rate(IC-ORR), Proportion of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for intracranial tumors as defined by response assessment in neuro-oncology brain metastases (RANO-BM) criteria., 2 years
Intracranial CNS Progression Free Survival(IC-PFS), Time from treatment until the first date of intracranial disease progression or death due any cause. For participants whose disease has not progressed at the time of the analysis, censoring will be performed using the date of the last valid disease assessment., 2 years|Progression Free Survival(PFS), Time from treatment until the first date of intracranial or extracranial disease progression or death due any cause. For participants whose disease has not progressed at the time of the analysis, censoring will be performed using the date of the last valid disease assessment., 2 years|Overall survival(OS), Time from the treatment until to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death, 3 years|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Treatment-related adverse events were assessed and graded according to CTCAE v. 5.0, 2 years|Health-related quality of life per FACT-BR, Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the QLQ-C30 questionnaires to assess Health-related quality of life was evaluated using the FACT-BR questionnaires to assess the quality of life, 2 years|Local control rate, The percentage of participants who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease according to RANO-BM criteria after treatment, 2 years|Neurocognitive function per HVLT-R, Neurocognitive function was evaluated using HVLT-R test, 2 years
