Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapeutic Treatment (XELOX) Followed by Chemoradiotherapy (XELOX/RT) and Surgery Versus Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Surgery and Chemotherapy in Patients With High Risk Rectal Cancer
Primary:

* To assess complete pathological response rate of both strategies.

Secondary:

* Safety profile
* To assess downstaging rate of both strategies.
* To compare relative dose intensity of oxaliplatin and capecitabine of both strategies
* To compare time to progression and overall survival of both strategies.
