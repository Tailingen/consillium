This is an open-label, multicenter, phase II study of DP303c injection in patients with HER2-expressing advanced ovarian cancer with two parts. In part 1, patients will be treated with DP303c injection at two dose levels (2.0 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg) every 3 weeks to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Once the RP2D has been established in part 1, patients will be enrolled into 2 cohorts in part 2.
