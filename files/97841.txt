A Biomarker-driven Therapeutic Strategy for Esophageal Cancer Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With Resectable Adenocarcinoma of the ESophagus and Esophagogastric Junction
Preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery has been accepted as the standard of care for resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction (EGJ). However, in a large part of the cases the tumor is extremely resistant to chemoradiotherapy, and those patients do not benefit from this treatment but are exposed to its negative consequences such as toxicity and delayed surgical therapy. The hypothesis is that a biomarker-driven therapeutic strategy in which patients will receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy or upfront surgery based on the basal tumor expression of BIRC3 could improve the R0 resection rate if compared with a standard strategy in unselected patients.

BoRgES trial is a multicenter, randomized phase II study of BIRC3-expression directed preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and EGJ. The main objective of this proposal is to provide evidence for a novel therapeutic strategy with enormous significance for patients affected by this disease.

Only a part of the patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma benefit from neoadjuvant therapy, and the clinical efficacy of chemoradiotherapy is reduced by the pre-existence of cellular drug resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify patients who could not benefit from preoperative treatment. The study will define an innovative therapeutic strategy directed by the expression of BIRC3 as a predictive marker for discriminating patients who will most likely be resistant to preoperative chemoradiotherapy.
