Breast Ultrasound Image Reviewed With Assistance of Deep Learning Algorithms
This study evaluates a second review of ultrasound images of breast lesions using an interactive "deep learning" (or artificial intelligence) program developed by Samsung Medical Imaging, to see if this artificial intelligence will help the Radiologist make more accurate diagnoses.

Concordance rate, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System descriptors suggested by S-Detect for Breast are in good agreement with those selected by experts. In other words, the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Lexicon values generated by S-Detect for Breast are not statistically different from the consensus of experts.

Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Assessment Category Score: The user makes the final decision on the Assessment Category Score. Using this Score, S-Detect displays the assessment description.

Category 0: Incomplete - Need Additional Imaging Evaluation Category 1: Negative Category 2: Benign Category 3: Probably Benign Category 4a: Low suspicion for malignancy Category 4b: Moderate suspicion for malignancy Category 4c: High suspicion for Malignancy Category 5: Highly Suggestive of Malignancy Category 6: Known Biopsy-Proven Malignancy, 2 days
Reporting time, Measure reporting time of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Lexicon value in Breast imaging by radiologists without S-Detect for Breast and also measured report time by radiologists with S-Detect for Breast., 2 day|Consensus, Evaluate the consensus between manually reading of Breast Imaging without assistance and Automatically detection results(Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Lexicons). Average of consensus is evaluated in both of Expert group and non-expert group., 2 day|Accuracy, Comparing to the Breast Biopsy results, The accuracy of Breast Imaging results by radiologists with CADx will be evaluated., 7 day|Sensitivity, Comparing to the Breast Biopsy results, The sensitivity of Breast Imaging results by radiologists with CADx will be evaluated., 7 day|Specificity, Comparing to the Breast Biopsy results, The specificity of Breast Imaging results by radiologists with CADx will be evaluated., 7 day|Area Under Curve, Comparing to the Breast Biopsy results, Area Under Curve (ROC analysis) of Breast Imaging results by radiologists with CADx will be evaluated., 7 day
Using ultrasound images prospectively acquired, the purpose of this study entails a second review of ultrasound images with suspicious breast lesions using an interactive "deep learning" (or artificial intelligence) program developed by SamsungMedison Co.,Ltd.

The images will be reviewed by the radiologists twice: first without, and then with assistance of artificial intelligence program by SamsungMedison Co., Ltd.

BIRADS system will be used in this study.

The objectives of the study are twofold: to quantify the statistical equivalence of radiologists' opinion and AI's output (CADe), and to check BIRADS score-based diagnostic accuracy (CADx) that is gained by the Radiologists' use of this interactive tool
