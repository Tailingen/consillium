Construction of the "Patient-Centered"Molecular Pathology Diagnostic Center
The investigators want to achieve the goal of diagnosis in early phase, accurate treatment and existence for a long period in order to screen in early phase, diagnose in clinical trial, choose treatment and evaluate prognosis of cancers by establishing molecular pathology tools.
Cancer
This research is going to discuss the biomarker expression of common malignant neoplasm (tumor)among Taiwanese, such as large intestine rectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate gland cancer, lung cancer, oral cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, cancer of the womb, ovarian cancer, carcinoma of urinary bladder, kidney cancer and so on.

The investigators hope to find the biomarker of common tumors among Taiwanese in order to develop the tools of tumor screening, diagnosis, treatment methods and prediction prognosis
