Conversion Therapy of Sintilimab in Combination With Fruquintinib and Chemotherapy Versus Sintilimab and Chemotherpay in Stage IV Gastric Cancer
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 2 clinical study aiming to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of sintilimab (PD-1 inhibitor) in combination of fruquintinib and chemotherapy (S-1 plus nab-paclitaxel) versus sintilimab and chemotherapy as conversion therapy in patients with stage IV gastric cancer in China.
