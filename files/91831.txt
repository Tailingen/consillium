Evaluation of CMV/EBV-CMI in Haploid HSCT
The purpose of this prospective, open-label, Single Arm, single-center study is to evaluate the cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus specific immune reestablishment for patients with hemopathy undergoingin prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus in haploid hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(haplo-HSCT) .
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|Cytomegalovirus Infections|Epstein-Barr Virus Infections
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: CMV/EBV-CMI
CMV-CMI, CMV specific immune reconstitution from pre-HSCT to 180 days after HSCT, 6 months after transplantation|EBV-CMI, EBV specific immune reconstitution from pre-HSCT to 180 days after HSCT, 6 months after transplantation
Cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation, The cumulative incidences of CMV reactivation after transplantation., 1 years after transplantation|Cumulative incidences of EBV reactivation, The cumulative incidences of EBV reactivation after transplantation, 1 years after transplantation|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death resulting from any cause., 1 years after transplantation|Non-relapse mortality (NRM), Non-relapse mortality (NRM) is defined as the time from enrollment to death of any causes other than hematologic disease relapse., 1 years after transplantation|Relapse-related mortality (RRM), Relapse-related mortality (RRM) is defined as the time from enrollment to death of relapse., 1 years after transplantation|GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (GRFS), GRFS is defined as the time from graft infusion to the onset of grades 3 to 4 aGVHD, moderate to severe cGVHD, or relapse/disease progression/death., 1 years after transplantation|Cumulative incidences of aGVHD, The diagnosis and grading of aGVHD are based on the modified Glucksberg grading standard., 100 days after transplantation
