A Comprehensive Study to Isolate Tumor-initiating Cells From Human Epithelial Malignancies
We hypothesize that all human malignancies harbour a subpopulation of tumor initiating cells/cancer stem cells (CSCs) that drives tumor development and potentially recurrence or metastasis of the disease. The primary aim of this study is to develop strategies for prospective isolation/enrichment of CSCs from human tumors of different tissue origins. In addition, we will characterize the signaling pathways and/or tumor specific antigens that are specific for CSCs, in order to specifically target these CSCs as the endpoint of this study.

Measurement of cancer stem cells (CSCs), The current study does not include the active involvement of patients. Our study involves the collection of tumor samples from patients after surgical procedures.
