MILES-4: Study Comparing Gemcitabine and Pemetrexed, With or Without Cisplatin, in Patients With Nonsquamous Lung Cancer
The purposes of this study are to test whether the addition of cisplatin to single agent chemotherapy (either gemcitabine or pemetrexed) prolongs survival in elderly patients with non squamous non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to test whether pemetrexed prolongs survival as compared to gemcitabine in elderly patients with non squamous NSCLC.
