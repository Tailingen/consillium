Intra-Operative Lymphatic Mapping in Patients With Invasive Carcinoma of the Cervix or Endometrial Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to learn if a surgical technique called intraoperative lymphatic mapping can accurately identify the lymph node that is at greatest risk if endometrial or cervical cancer spreads to the lymph nodes.

Early cervical cancer is usually treated by removing the cervix, tissue around the cervix, and the upper vagina. If needed, the uterus is also removed. The treatment also includes removing lymph nodes from the pelvis. Endometrial cancer is usually treated by removing the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries.

The treatment also includes removing lymph nodes from the pelvis.
