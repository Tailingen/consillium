Study of Acalabrutinib and Rituximab in Untreated Elderly and/or Frail Patients With DLBCL
The study will measure the safety, tolerability, and efficacy with acalabrutinib in combination with rituximab in treatment-naïve elderly and/or frail patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), who are otherwise unsuitable for standard front line chemoimmunotherapy treatments.

Treatment-naïve elderly and/or frail patients with DLBCL will be treated with acalabrutinib in combination with rituximab in a single arm.

Study details include the following:

* The study duration will be up to 108 weeks for each patient, including up to 28 days for screening and 104 weeks of treatment and follow-up.
* The treatment duration will be up to 8 cycles for rituximab and 28 cycles for acalabrutinib both beginning at cycle 1.
