A Study on Neoadjuvant Therapy for Her-2 Positive Breast Cancer and the Prognosis by Detecting CTCs
Docetaxel plus carboplatin and trastuzumab has been a standard treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2（HER-2）positive. The investigators witnessed a higher pathological complete remission(pCR) rate but no obvious increase in cardiac toxicity when used the anthracycline instead of carboplatin. The investigators expect to carry out a large sample size clinical research to optimize the existing therapeutic regimen
