Biomarkerscreening in Cervical Cancer and Its Preinvasive Lesions
The following trial is a multicenter and prospective research trial of the colposcopy unit of luebeck university and the national research center in Borstel, Germany.

The study is to identify and evaluate new biomarkers in human papilloma virus (HPV) associated malignancies and its preinvasive lesions of the cervix uteri. Fresh tissue samples being removed during conizations and/or hysterectomies are to be fixed in HOPE's solution and analyzed according to their transcriptomes and methylosome. The hereby found candidates are to be validated using immunohistochemistry and RT \[real-time\] -PCR \[polymerase chain reaction\].

The project is meant to be followed by continuous studies developing a new test describing the malignant potential of HPV associated genital lesions.
