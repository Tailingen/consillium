T-DXd Therapy for HER2-low Breast Cancer Patients With Brain Metastases
TUXEDO-4 is an international, multicentric, single arm, phase II study aiming to gather additional solid evidence of Trastuzumab-Deruxtecan (T-DXd) activity in patients with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-low breast cancer with active brain metastases.

This study will analyze the efficacy of T-DXd as determined by overall response rate (ORR) at any timepoint as judged by best CNS response according to RANO-BM criteria.

Changes from baseline is fitted to a repeated measures model including subjects as a random effect, baseline, and post-baseline evaluations. Time to Improvement and Deterioration Analysis Using a threshold value for improvement and deterioration specific to the measures of interest, time to improvement and time to deterioration could be estimated. Distributions of time-to-event variables will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Time to Improvement and Deterioration Analysis Using a threshold value for improvement and deterioration specific to the measures of interest, time to improvement and time to deterioration could be estimated. Distributions of time-to-event variables will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median times to event with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be estimated., From baseline until approximately 11 months after the last patient included in the study starts treatment.|Evaluation of the quality of life (QoL) in all patients (QLQ-BR45 questionnaire)., Assessment of QoL with the BC specific questionnaire (QLQ-BR45). Changes from baseline is fitted to a repeated measures model including subjects as a random effect, baseline, and post-baseline evaluations. Time to Improvement and Deterioration Analysis Using a threshold value for improvement and deterioration specific to the measures of interest, time to improvement and time to deterioration could be estimated.

The NANO is an objective clinician-reported outcome of neurologic function that consists of 9 neurologic domains: gait, strength, ataxia (upper extremity), sensation, visual fields, facial strength, language, level of consciousness, and behavior.

Each domain is subdivided into 3 or 4 levels of function with scores based on discrete quantifiable measures. Levels of function for each domain range from 0 to 2 or 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates normal function, while the highest score indicates the most severe level of deficit for that domain., From baseline until approximately 11 months after the last patient included in the study starts treatment.
This is an international, multicentric, single arm, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of T-DXd in HER2-low breast cancer with newly diagnosed or progressing brain metastases with or without untreated type II leptomeningeal disease (LMD).

Upon meeting all selection criteria, a total of 27 patients will be enrolled as follows: 13 patients will be accrued in stage 1 to receive T-DXd and additional 14 patients will be accrued in stage 2 according to the number of responses seen in stage 1.

The main objective is to analyze the efficacy of T-DXd as determined by ORR at any timepoint as judged by best CNS response according to RANO-BM criteria.

End of study is estimated to occur approximately 11 months after the last patient included in the study starts treatment, unless premature termination of the study.
