Maintenance Therapy With Toripalimab and Capecitabine Versus Capecitabine Alone in High-risk Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
N3 classification, rENE positivity is a high-risk type of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV DNA remaining at detectable levels after induction chemotherapy is also a characteristic of high-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Based on the available evidence, patients with high-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma are recommended to receive oral maintenance therapy to reduce the risk of failure.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a prospective, multicenter, randomized phase III clinical trial to determine whether maintenance therapy with triprilimab combined with capecitabine is better than maintenance therapy with capecitabine alone in high-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma (N3+, rENE+, Detectable EBV DNA after 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy).
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|High-Risk Cancer|Maintenance Therapy
DRUG: Maintenance Therapy with Toripalimab and Capecitabine|DRUG: Maintenance Therapy with Capecitabine
Progression-free Survival, Time from date of start of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause., 3 years
Distant Metastasis-Free Survival, Time from date of start of treatment to documented distant metastasis or death from any cause, patients with locoregional relapse as a first event will be censored at date of locoregional relapse., 3 years|Overall Survival, Time from date of start of treatment to death from any cause, where patients lost to follow-up were censored at the date of last follow-up., 3 years|Loco-Regional Recurrence-Free Survival, Time from date start of treatment to documented locoregional relapse or death from any cause, patients with distant metastasis as a first event will be censored at the date of distant metastasis., 3 years
The study randomly divided these three types of high-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma into two groups. The experimental group received maintenance therapy with toripalimab and capecitabine, while the control group received maintenance therapy with capecitabine alone. The maintenance treatment period of the two groups was 1 year.
