A Study of AUR104 in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoid Malignancies (VIJAY-1)
This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of AUR104 in adult patients with select Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Lymphoid Malignancies. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug AUR104.In this study, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of AUR104 will be evaluated in dose escalation manner.

This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study of AUR104 in adult patients with select Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Lymphoid Malignancies. The dose escalation will be conducted in a rule-based manner in patients who do not have any available curative treatment options and have exhausted all effective therapies available locally. At a minimum, the patients must have relapsed or refractory disease to at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapies for NHL or CLL, or Hodgkin's disease. The main objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug AUR104. In this study, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of AUR104 will be evaluated in dose escalation manner.
