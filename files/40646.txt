Liver Infusions of Fluorouracil in Treating Patients With Dukes' A, Dukes' B, or Dukes' C Colon Cancer Undergoing Surgery
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether giving fluorouracil into the liver is more effective than no further treatment for patients with colon cancer undergoing surgery.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving infusions of fluorouracil into the liver in treating patients with Dukes' A, Dukes' B, or Dukes' C colon cancer undergoing surgery.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: fluorouracil|OTHER: Observation|DRUG: sodium heparin
Disease free interval, Evidence of treatment failure (presence of tumor in local/regional or distant sites, confirmed by either biopsy or other acceptable evidence., From randomization up to 4 years.|Survival, From randomization up to 4 years.
OBJECTIVES: Determine whether adjuvant therapy with portal hepatic perfusion of 5-fluorouracil and sodium heparin effectively prolongs the disease-free interval and increases survival in patients undergoing curative resection of adenocarcinoma of the colon.

OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients are randomized preoperatively; those randomized to Arm 1 begin therapy intraoperatively or within 6 hours of colonic resection. Arm 1: 5-Fluorouracil plus sodium heparin. Those randomized to Arm 2 receive no adjuvant therapy. Arm 2: observation (no further treatment).

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 1,334 patients will be entered over a 4-year period.
