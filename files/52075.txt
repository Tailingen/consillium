Prebiotics in Rectal Cancer
A significant racial disparity in the incidence and mortality of CRC exists in the U.S. with African Americans having CRC incidence and mortality rates that are 20% and 40% higher than the general U.S. population. It has been demonstrated that the gut microbiome impacts tumor development and progression through multiple mechanisms, including impacting the tumoral immune response. However, it is unknown if microbiome modulating treatment can have an impact on CRC outcomes.

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Soluble Corn Fiber|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Maltodextrin
Gut Flora modulation, fiber supplements with prebiotic effects modulate the gut and tumor associated microbiome leading to improved outcomes in stage II and III rectal cancer patients, 1 year
Microbiome changes, To characterize the changes in the gut and tumor associated microbiome, 6 months|Immune Profile, To evaluate the impact of prebiotic fiber treatment and microbiome changes on the tumor immune profile known to be associated with favorable outcomes, 6 months

This is a pilot project to see if any changes are detected in stool and/or tissue samples in rectal cancer patients who receive a soluble corn fiber supplement during their neoadjuvant treatment.
