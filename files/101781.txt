Dose Escalation Safety Study of TL32711 in Adults With Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
A Phase 1 open-label, non-randomized dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and characterize the safety and tolerability of Birinapant (TL32711).
Cancer
DRUG: Birinapant (TL32711)
Define the MTD, 4 weeks (Cycle 1)
Tumor burden according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)/Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphoma, Every 8 weeks (2 cycles) while on treatment|Translational biomarkers and pharmacokinetics, First and third dose of Cycle 1 and after every two cycles (biomarkers only) while on treatment
The purpose of this Phase 1 open-label, non-randomized dose escalation study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and characterize the safety and tolerability of Birinapant (TL32711) when administered as a 30 minute intravenous infusion once weekly for three weeks per repeated 4 week intervals in subjects with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. Additionally study will assess anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory biomarkers as a measurement of pharmacodynamic effects.
