Preoperative Combined Radiochemotherapy for Patients With Rectal Carcinoma
Rate of T-downstaging (Reduction of the T-stadium) at the time of final surgery following the preoperative combined radiochemotherapy (chemotherapy: Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine) Evaluation of the toxicity grade III and IV of the therapy scheme
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Rate of T-downstaging (Reduction of the T-stadium), surgery following the preoperative combined radiochemotherapy (chemotherapy: Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine), at the time of final surgery
Evaluation of the toxicity grade III and IV of the therapy scheme, from Visit 1 till surgery: weekly visits (visit 1 to visit 5) followed by final examination (performed 1 to 2 weeks after visit 5) before surgery followed by hospital admission (performed 1 to 2 weeks after final examination) followed by surgery ((performed 1 to 2 weeks after hospital admission), week 1 to max. week 10
About 60 patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma (cT3, Nx, M0) of the lower and middle rectum will be recruited.

The radiotherapy is an essential part of therapy of the advanced rectal carcinoma and the additional administration of a chemotherapy will positively influence the effect of the therapy (downstaging-rate, rate of distant metastases, survival-rate). Probably a downsizing and downstaging (as per literature and by own experience) can be reached with an preoperative combined radiochemotherapy.
