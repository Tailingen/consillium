Study of Vidaza (Azacitidine) Versus Support Treatment in Patients With Low Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (Low and Intermediate-1 IPSS) Without the 5q Deletion and Transfusion Dependent Anaemia
Primary Outcome Measures:

• To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with Azacitidine in patients with transfusion-dependent, low risk International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) 0 int-1, Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) without chromosome 5 (5q) deletion. The main objective will be based on the erythroid haematologic response according to International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria.

Secondary Outcome Measures:

* Haematologic response, bases on the following parameters: platelets, and neutrophils according to International Working Group (IWG) Criteria.
* Medullary and cytogenetic response according to International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria.
* The effect of treatment response on quality of life, through the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-an) questionnaire.
* Overall survival, Event-Free Survival and the Acute Leukaemia Transformation Rate.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
DRUG: Azacitidine
Erythroid haematologic response, To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with Azacitidine in patients with transfusion-dependent, low risk International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) 0 or int-1, Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) without chromosome 5 (5q) deletion. The main objective will be based on the erythroid haematologic response according to International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria., Approximately the primary outcome is measured on days 0, 252 and 504 (basal, cycle 9 and 18 (each cicle has 28 days +/-3 days))
Haematologic response, Haematologic response, bases on the following parameters: platelets, and neutrophils according to International Working Group (IWG) Criteria., The secondary outcome is measured on days 0, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168, 196, 224, 252, 280, 308, 336, 364, 392, 420, 448, 476 and 504 (the measurement is performed at basal line and in every cycle (every 28 days +/-3 days) up to a maximum of 18 cycles).|Medullary and cytogenetic response, Medullary and cytogenetic response according to International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria., Approximately this secondary outcome is measured on days 252 and 504 (basal, cycle 9 and 18 (each cicle has 28 days +/-3 days)).|Quality of life, The effect of treatment response on quality of life, through the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) questionnaire., Approximately this secondary outcome is measured on days 252 and 504 (basal, cycle 9 and 18 (each cicle has 28 days +/-3 days)).|Overall survival, Overall survival, The secondary outcome is measured from basal line until day 504 (average of days for 18 cycles), or until progresion, or until exitus... (from basal line until the end of the study)|Event-Free Survival, Event-Free Survival, The secondary outcome is measured from basal line until day 504 (average of days for 18 cycles), or until progresion, or until exitus... (from basal line until the end of the study)|Acute Leukaemia Transformation Rate, Acute Leukaemia Transformation Rate, The secondary outcome is measured from basal line until day 504 (average of days for 18 cycles), or until progresion, or until exitus... (from basal line until the end of the study)
