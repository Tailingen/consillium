A Two-part Study to Assess the Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Givinostat in Patients With Polycythemia Vera
This is a two-part, multicenter, open label, non-randomized, phase Ib/II study to assess the safety and tolerability, Maximum Tolerated Dose and preliminary efficacy of Givinostat in patients with JAK2V617F positive Polycythemia Vera. Part A is the dose finding part while Part B is assessing the preliminary efficacy. Patients will be enrolled either in Part A or Part B and transition from one part to the other is not allowed.

Eligible patients for this study will have a confirmed diagnosis of Polycythemia Vera according to the revised World Health Organization criteria. Only if the enrolment in Part A is slow (i.e. \< 5 patients enrolled in 3 months), eligibility for this part of the study may be expanded to all patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Study therapy will be administered in 28 day cycles (4 weeks of treatment). Disease response will be evaluated according to the European LeukemiaNet criteria after 3 and 6 cycles (i.e. at weeks 12 and 24, respectively) of treatment with Givinostat for both parts of the study. All phlebotomies performed in the first 3 weeks of treatment will not be counted to assess the clinico-haematological response.

The study will last up to a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment. However, after completion of the trial, all patients achieving clinical benefit will be allowed to continue treatment with Givinostat (at the same dose and schedule) in a long-term study.

Safety will be monitored at each visit throughout the entire duration of the study. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis and patients will be followed regularly with physical and laboratory tests, as specified in the protocol; in case of hospitalization, the treatment will be continued or interrupted according to the Investigators' decision.
Polycythemia Vera
DRUG: Givinostat
Number of Patients Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in Part A of the Study, Evaluations were performed on the type, incidence and severity of TEAEs, graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.03, following administration of givinostat for up to 6 cycles of treatment in Part A. Grades 1 through 5 were as follows: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening or requiring hospitalisation; Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; Grade 5: Death related to AE. Results are reported as number of patients with TEAEs for each of the indicated categories. Definitions: drug-related TEAE / treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE) corresponded to reasonable suspicion that the TEAE / TESAE was associated with the use of the study drug, according to investigator assessment; discontinuation refers to discontinuation from treatment., 168 days (up to Cycle 6 Day 28 in Part A).|Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) After 1 Cycle in Part A of the Study, The MTD of givinostat was based only on Cycle 1 DLTs. A DLT was defined as the following drug-related toxicity:

* Grade 4 hematological toxicity, or
* Grade 3 febrile neutropenia, or
* Grade ≥3 non-hematological toxicity (with the exception Grade 3 diarrhea without adequate supportive care lasting less than 3 days, and Grade 3 nausea or vomiting without adequate supportive care lasting less than 3 days), or
* Any drug-related serious AE, or
* Any toxicity clearly not related to disease progression or intercurrent illness requiring interruption of dosing for more than 3 days during first cycle.

At end of Cycle 1, for the third patient in each DL, the safety of the 3 patients treated for 1 cycle was reviewed and it was decided if the dose should be escalated or not. Results are reported as the number of patients with DLT events for Cycle 1 in Part A., 28 days (up to Cycle 1 Day 28 in Part A).|Number of Patients Experiencing TEAEs After 3 Cycles in Part B of the Study, Evaluations were performed on the type, incidence and severity of TEAEs, graded according to CTCAE v. 4.03, following administration of givinostat at the MTD for up to 3 cycles of treatment in Part B. Grades 1 through 5 were as follows: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening or requiring hospitalisation; Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; Grade 5: Death related to AE. Results are reported as number of patients with TEAEs for each of the indicated categories. Definitions: drug-related TEAE / TESAE corresponded to reasonable suspicion that the TEAE / TESAE was associated with the use of the study drug, according to investigator assessment; discontinuation refers to discontinuation from treatment., 84 days (up to Cycle 3 Day 28 in Part B).|Overall Response Rate (ORR) (i.e. Complete Response [CR] and Partial Response [PR]) After 3 Cycles in Part B of the Study, ORR, CR and PR following administration of givinostat at MTD for 3 cycles in Part B, reported as percentage of patients with a response. Response was evaluated according to the clinico-hematological European LeukemiaNet (ELN) response criteria. If Investigator's clinical response assessment (taking into account the overall medical judgment of the specific patient's case) was not in agreement with exact application of the ELN response criteria, the Investigator's assessment superseded the mathematical application of these criteria and was used for analysis.

CR defined as:

1. Hematocrit (HCT) \<45% without phlebotomy, and
2. Platelets ≤400 x10\^9/litre (L), and
3. White Blood Cell count ≤10 x10\^9/L, and
4. Normal spleen size, and
5. No disease-related systemic symptoms (i.e. pruritus, headache, microvascular disturbances).

PR defined as: Patients not fulfilling CR and

1. HCT \<45% without phlebotomy, or
2. Response in ≥3 other criteria., 84 days (up to cycle 3 Day 28 in Part B).

This is a two-part, multicenter, open label, non-randomized, phase Ib/II study to assess the safety and tolerability, MTD and preliminary efficacy of Givinostat in patients with JAK2V617F positive PV.

Part A is the dose escalation portion of the study and, once the MTD has been established, Part B will commence where the preliminary efficacy of Givinostat in PV patients will be established. Patients will be enrolled either in Part A or Part B and transition from one part to the other is not allowed. Only PV patients from Part A assigned to the dose selected for Part B (MTD) may be counted towards the efficacy assessment in Part B.

Eligible patients for this study will have a confirmed diagnosis of PV according to the revised WHO criteria and the JAK2V617F positivity. Only if the enrolment in Part A is slow (i.e. \< 5 patients enrolled in 3 months), eligibility for this part of the study may be expanded to all patients with cMPN.

After providing informed written consent before undertaking any protocol-related procedure, a unique patient identification code (i.e. patient screening ID which will be a combination of his/her site ID, study part ID and patient screening number, e.g. IT01-A01) will be assigned to each patient and it will identify the patient within his/her enrolment confirmation by Italfarmaco S.p.A. or its designee and never be reused in case of screening failure. After the enrolment confirmation and the assignation of the dose level before the first drug intake, a unique patient identification code (i.e. patient ID which will be a combination of patient screening number ID and dose level ID, e.g. IT01-A01-DL1) will be assigned to each patient and it will identify the patient throughout his/her participation in the study and never be reused in case of premature drop-out.

Study therapy will be administered in 28 day cycles. In fact, the "cycle" is defined as 4 weeks of treatment.

Disease response will be evaluated according to the clinico-haematological ELN criteria after 3 and 6 cycles (i.e. at weeks 12 and 24, respectively) of treatment with Givinostat for both parts of the study. All phlebotomies performed in the first 3 weeks of treatment will not be counted to assess the clinico-haematological response.

The study will last up to a maximum of 24 weeks of treatment. However, after completion of the trial, all patients achieving clinical benefit will be allowed to continue treatment with Givinostat (at the same dose and schedule) in a long-term study (Study N.: DSC/11/2357/44).

Safety will be monitored at each visit throughout the entire duration of the study. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis and patients will be followed regularly with physical and laboratory tests, as specified in the protocol; in case of hospitalization, the treatment will be continued or interrupted according to the Investigators' decision.
