Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Older Patients With Solid Tumour,
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works in treating older patients with solid tumour.
Solid Tumor Regardless of Localization and Stage
OTHER: chemotherapy
chemotherapy feasibility, ability to deliver at least 3 months of the planned regimen therapy., from inclusion to 3 months|Number of patients receiving therapeutic dose-intensive therapy (doses must be at least equivalent to two-thirds the dose that is usually administered according to AMM recommendations), dose reduction \< 33%, 3 months
Grade 3-4 toxicities according to NCI-CTCAE version 3, from inclusion to 3 months
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine a prognostic scale of the feasibility of chemotherapy (at least two-thirds of the dose intensity usually administered) in patients aged 75 years or older with solid tumour.

Secondary

* To evaluate the efficacy, in terms of clinical and/or biological response, of treatments administered.
* To evaluate the incidence of severe (grade 3-4) toxicity.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive one of the following regimens according to cancer diagnosis and principal investigator preference. All regimens last 3 months.
