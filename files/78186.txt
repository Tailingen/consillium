CALLS: CML and Ph+ALL Low Level Mutation Prevalence Survey
A multicenter, prospective cohort study of the mutation status of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) who are being treated with first or subsequent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in the UK, Ireland, or France.
