A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of ESO-T01 in Treating Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.
This is a single center, single arm, open-label, dose escalation, phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy and immunogenicity of ESO-T01 for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: ESO-T01 Injection
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS), Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) would be graded according to the ASTCT consensus., up to Day 28 post-infusion|Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are evaluated between the infusion and 28 days post-infusion.|immune cell-associated immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), ICANS would be scored according to Immune Effector Cell-Associated Encephalopathy (ICE), and then graded by the ASTCT consensus., up to Day 28 post-infusion|Treatment-associated adverse effects (AEs), All other AEs would be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 5.0)., up to 2 years after treatment of ESO-T01
Overall response rate (ORR), Clinical efficacy can be evaluated according to the 2016 International Myeloma Working Group consensus criteria., Day 14, Day 28, Month 2 , Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month24 after the treatment of ESO-T01.|Complete response (CR) rate, sCR/CR can be evaluated according to the 2016 International Myeloma Working Group consensus criteria., Day 14, Day 28, Month 2 , Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month24 after the treatment of ESO-T01.|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the interval between the first sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR after infusion and the disease progression or death., Through study completion, an average of 2 year|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the interval between a subject's receipt of ESO-T01 infusion and the first assessment of disease progression or death., up to 2 years after treatment of ESO-T01.|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval between a subject's receipt of ESO-T01 infusion and death from any cause., up to 2 years after treatment of ESO-T01|Cmax, CAR-T kinetics would be detected by flow cytometry and droplet digital PCR in peripheral blood and bone marrow at each important time points. Cmax is the peak expansion value of CAR-T cells., Baseline, Day 2, Day 4, Day 6, Day 8, Day 10, Day 12, Day 14, Day 17, Day 21, Day 24, Day 28, Month 2 , Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month24 after the treatment of ESO-T01|Tmax, CAR-T kinetics would be detected by flow cytometry and droplet digital PCR in peripheral blood and bone marrow at each important time points. Tmax is the time of the occurrence of expansion peak., Baseline, Day 2, Day 4, Day 6, Day 8, Day 10, Day 12, Day 14, Day 17, Day 21, Day 24, Day 28, Month 2 , Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month24 after the treatment of ESO-T01|AUC(0-day 28), CAR-T kinetics would be detected by flow cytometry and droplet digital PCR in peripheral blood and bone marrow at each important time points. Cmax is the peak expansion value of CAR-T cells. AUC(0- day28) refers to the area under curve of CAR-T cell expansion between infusion and day 28 post infusion. They all reflect the pharmacokinetics., Baseline, Day 2, Day 4, Day 6, Day 8, Day 10, Day 12, Day 14, Day 17, Day 21, Day 24, Day 28 after the treatment of ESO-T01
Immunogenicity of ESO-T01, Anti-drug antibody (ADA) would be detected by ELISA., Baseline, Day 14, Day 28, Month 2 , Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, Month 12, Month 18, Month24 after the treatment of ESO-T01
This investigator-initiated clinical study aims to evaluate ESO-T01, the third-generation self-inactivating lentiviral vector that carries a BCMA-targeted CAR, in patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The study employs a dose-escalation design to assess safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy.
