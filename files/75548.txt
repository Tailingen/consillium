Assessment of Response to nCRT for GEJ Cancer Using a Fully Integrated PET/MRI
Evaluate the potential role of PET/MRI as a predictor of esophageal and junctional cancers in response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT).
Esophageal Cancer|Esophageal Neoplasms
OTHER: hybrid PET/MRI
Response to neoadjuvant treatment -MRI, MRI component including Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE); quantitative evaluation and delta between timepoints, 0-36 months|Response to neoadjuvant treatment -PET, PET component -quantitative evaluation and delta between timepoints, 0-36 months|Response to neoadjuvant treatment - Histology, Evaluate degree of tumor regression after neoadjuvant therapy according to the Mandard Tumour regression grade ; integrated Immunohistochemistry, 0-36 months|Response to neoadjuvant treatment -Radiomics, Radiomic features extracted from hybrid imaging, 0-36 months|Imaging parameters as potential predictors of tumor response, Select imaging parameters that can be considered potential predictors of the responder/non-responder status assessment, 0- 48 months
Early regression model (ERI), Evaluate the ERI model as a predictor of histological response (TRG grade) based on MRI tumor volume assessment, 0- 60 months
This is a prospective, observational single center study which plans to enroll patients with biopsy proven potentially resectable esophageal or junctional cancer scheduled to receive nCRT (CROSS regimen) prior to surgery.

The study aims to evaluate Routine pre-treatment work-up includes PET to stage the tumour extension.

* PET/MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) will replace the PET component of CT(computed tomography)
* An additional intermediate 18-FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) PET/MRI will be performed during nCRT
* Post nCRT imaging, as required prior to surgery, will be PET/MRI six weeks after treatment completion.
* 8-12 weeks post nCRT completion surgery will be performed, based on each patient's performance status and response to nCRT
* Histopathological samples of the excised tumor and lymph nodes will be used for diagnosis, staging and description of qualitative and quantitative parameters Routine clinical and radiological follow-up for 24 months (for the scope of this study) will follow the standard clinical workflow assigned to this group of patients.
