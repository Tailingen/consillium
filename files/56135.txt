Analysis of the Resistance and Sensitivity Mechanisms to Teclistamab by Focusing on Single Immune Cell Examination
The aim of this study is to discover the immune and oncogenomic features that distinguish patients who respond to teclistamab from patients who are primarily resistant. Moreover, phenotypic and genotypic characteristics that occur with secondary resistance to teclistamab will be analyzed.
Multiple Myeloma
OTHER: Bone marrow sampling
Response to teclistamab at 12 weeks, response according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria, at day 1 Cycle 4 (each cycle is 28 days)
