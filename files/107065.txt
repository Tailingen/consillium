Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of LGH447 and BYL719 in Patients With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a Phase Ib/II study with the primary purpose of the Phase Ib part being to estimate the MTD and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of LGH447 and BYL719 when administered orally to adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Once the MTD and/or RP2D is determined for the combination of LGH447 and BYL719, additional patients will be enrolled in the Phase II part to determine whether the combination of LGH447 and BYL719 exhibits improved anti-multiple myeloma activity compared to single agent LGH447. This trial never made it to the Phase II part of the this trial.
Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: LGH447|DRUG: BYL719
Phase Ib: Number of Total Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT), Using a Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) to guide dose escalation and predict MTD or determine the RP2D for LGH447 in combination with BYL719 in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. The frequency and characteristics of DLTs will be assessed., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Phase II: Overall Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by Investigators, The proportion of patients with a confirmed best overall response of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) as assessed by Investigators using the International Myeloma Working group (IMWG) Criteria with modifications.

End of Study (defined as the time when all patients have completed at least 6 cycles of treatment or discontinued treatment, or have been lost to follow up, whichever occurs first., 29 months (End of Study)
Phase II: Percent change of ORR (Overall Response Rate) between the two arms, The ORR percent change between the two arms, LGH447 in combination with BYL719 and LGH447 alone, is the parameter of interest. Both observed and Bayesian estimates of ORR percent change along with 80% confidence intervals and credible intervals will be calculated. End of Study (defined as the time when all patients have completed at least 6 cycles of treatment or discontinued treatment, or have been lost to follow up, whichever occurs first., 29 months (End of Study)|Number of participants with adverse events, serious adverse events, changes in laboratory values, and electrocardiograms (ECGs), as a measure of safety and tolerability., Assessments consisted of recording all adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), the regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, and coagulation parameters, as well as electrocardiograms., 23 months|Determine single and multiple dose Pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles, To determine the single and multiple dose PK profiles of the LGH447 and BYL719 combination (Phase Ib and II) and LGH447 alone (Phase II), by measuring plasma concentrations of LGH447 and BYL719 respectively at different timepoints prior and post study drug combination dosing on several days within cycle 1 and subsequent cycles for all patients in the Phase 1b and for the first 15 patients in each arm in the Phase 2 portion of the study. PK parameters including but not limited to Cmax, AUCinf, AUClast, AUCtau,T1/2, Tmax, Racc, CL/F, and Vz/F, Approximately 8 months|Changes between pre- and post-treatment levels of pS6RP and 4EBP1 levels in bone marrow aspirates and 4EBP1 in peripheral blood, Cycle 2 = 28 days; LGH447-mediated target modulation of the PIM pathway will be assessed from the collection of bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirates by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or other methods as deemed appropriate. Decreases in the phosphorylation of markers (eg. S6RP and 4EBP1) will be measured in both pre- and post-dose bone marrow aspirate samples and peripheral blood samples., baseline, Cycle 2 Day 1|Phase II: Absolute difference in ORR, Both observed and Bayesian estimates of absolute difference in ORR between the two arms will be calculated. The 80% confidence intervals and credible intervals for the difference will be provided. End of Study (defined as the time when all patients have completed at least 6 cycles of treatment or discontinued treatment, or have been lost to follow up, whichever occurs first., 29 months (End of Study)|Disease Control Rate, Proportion of patients with a best overall response of sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR, or SD, using International Myeloma Working Group Criteria with modification. End of Study (defined as the time when all patients have completed at least 6 cycles of treatment or discontinued treatment, or have been lost to follow up, whichever occurs first., 29 months (End of Study)|Progression Free Survival, Defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented PD/relapse, or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. End of Study (defined as the time when all patients have completed at least 6 cycles of treatment or discontinued treatment, or have been lost to follow up, whichever occurs first., 29 months (End of Study)|Time to response, The time between date of randomization until first documented best overall response (sCR, CR, VPGR or PR). End of Study (defined as the time when all patients have completed at least 6 cycles of treatment or discontinued treatment, or have been lost to follow up, whichever occurs first., 29 months (End of Study)|Duration of Response, Defined as the duration from the first documented onset of PR or better response to the date of documented PD/relapse or death due to multiple myeloma. End of Study (defined as the time when all patients have completed at least 6 cycles of treatment or discontinued treatment, or have been lost to follow up, whichever occurs first., 29 months (End of Study)
