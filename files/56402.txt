Study of Cabazitaxel in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Taxanes
The purpose of this study is to determine whether cabazitaxel is effective in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cabazitaxel
Objective response rate (ORR)., At an average of 24 months for each patient
Duration of response., From the time measurement criteria are first met for partial or complete response until the first date of documented progressive disease or death from any cause without prior documentation of progression assessed up to 30 months.|Evaluation of progression-free survival (PFS), From study entry until the first date of documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause without prior documentation of progression, assessed up to 30 months.|Evaluation of overall survival (OS), Defined as the time in months from study entry until the time of death, assessed up to 30 months.|Assessment of safety and tolerability., Distribution of adverse events according to severity grade., Evaluation of Adverse Events will be performed every 21 days (per cycle) during treatment assessed up to 30 months.|Value of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers measured in tissue and blood samples, βΙ,βΙΙ,βΙΙΙ,βIVb, βV-tubulin isotypes,HIF1α,microtubule-associated proteins such as Tau,MAP2,MAP4 \& microtubule-sequestering proteins such as stathmin, will be assessed. Moreover, evaluation of p53,BCL2,BIM,γ-actin,LIMK2, TGFBI,Aurora-A,as well as the expression of the enzyme CYP3A and multidrug transporters such as P-glycoprotein. The abovementioned factors will be assessed by immunohistochemistry at the protein level and by quantitative real-time PCR at the RNA level.

Also, given the clinical significance of the anti-angiogenic effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy,we will investigate the effect of treatment on surrogate biomarkers of angiogenesis, such as VEGF-A as well as the effect of chemotherapy on kinetics of soluble biomarkers,using ELISA.

In addition,genetic polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, such as the CYP3A and ABCB1 genes, will be explored in blood DNA and their association with the toxicity and efficacy of cabazitaxel will be assessed., Tumor blocks and blood DNA will be collected at study entry and plasma at study entry, on week 3 and week 6 of treatment.
The purpose of this study is to determine whether cabazitaxel is effective in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
