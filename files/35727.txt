First Strike Event Free Survival, Participants who choose the first strike treatment will have event free survival assessed at 3 years after initiating treatment. Event free survival is defined as time from treatment initiation to event which includes (1) any recurrence (local or regional, or distant) and (2) death due to any cause., Baseline to 3 years|Second Strike Event Free Survival, Participants who choose the second strike treatment will have event free survival assessed at 3 years after initiating treatment. Event free survival is defined as time from treatment initiation to event which includes (1) any recurrence (local or regional, or distant) and (2) death due to any cause, Baseline to 3 years|Adaptive Therapy Event Free Survival, Participants who choose the adaptive therapy will have event free survival assessed at 3 years after initiating treatment. Event free survival is defined as time from treatment initiation to event which includes (1) progression that does not respond to additional VAC dosing and (2) death due to any cause, Baseline to 3 years
Overall Survival, The time to event endpoint of overall survival is defined as the duration of time from diagnosis to death or last follow-up, where event would be death from any cause, 5 years|Treatment-related adverse events of a certain grade or higher, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events of a certain grade or higher and hematological/biochemical toxicities based on laboratory measurements as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Baseline to 5 years
