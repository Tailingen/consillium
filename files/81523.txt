A Multi-Reader Multi-Case Pivotal Trial
The purpose of this pivotal reader study is to assess the comparative accuracy of Fujifilm FFDM plus DBT versus FFDM alone in the detection of breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: FFDM Plus DBT|DEVICE: FFDM Alone
Correct Lesion Localization: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC) for FFDM + DBT Versus FFDM Alone Based on Probability of Malignancy (POM) Scores and Requiring Correct Lesion Localization., The study will be considered to have successfully demonstrated safety and effectiveness of the Fujifilm Aspire Cristalle: FFDM +DBT system if the per-subject average AUC for FFDM+DBT is statistically significantly superior to the average AUC for FFDM alone at the alpha = 0.05 significance level. Per-subject BI-RADS, POM and recall scores requiring correct lesion localization were derived. The general principle is that even at the subject level, credit was only given for identifying a subject with cancer if the reader marked findings in at least one location with cancer. When computing sensitivity and specificity based on BI-RADS, a score of 4 or 5 constituted a positive test result., 1 month
The safety and effectiveness of FFDM + DBT are both linked to the ability of radiologists interpreting FFDM + DBT images to accurately diagnose breast cancer. Each study endpoint therefore addresses both safety and effectiveness.
