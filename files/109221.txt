Ph1 Study of SL-172154 Administered Intratumorally in Subjects With Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck or Skin
This is a Phase 1 open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, PK, anti-tumor activity, and pharmacodynamic effects of SL-172154 administered by intratumoral injection in subjects with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN).

Objective response includes complete response (disappearance of all target lesions) and partial response (\>/= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions)., Approximately 18-24 months|Immunogenicity to SL-172154 When Administered by Intratumoral Injection (ITI), Proportion of participants with positive anti-drug antibody titer, Approximately 18-24 months|Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of SL-172154 When Administered by Intratumoral Injection (ITI), The Cmax is the maximum observed serum concentration of SL-172154 following single and multiple doses, Approximately 18-24 months|Time at Which the Maximum Concentration is Observed (Tmax) of SL-172154 When Administered by Intratumoral Injection (ITI), The Tmax is the time at which the maximum concentration of SL-172154 is observed following single and multiple doses, Approximately 18-24 months|Minimum Observed Concentration (Cmin) of SL-172154 When Administered by Intratumoral Injection (ITI), The Cmin is the minimum observed serum concentration of SL-172154 following single and multiple doses, Approximately 18-24 months|Area Under the Serum Concentration Time Curve (AUC) of SL-172154 When Administered by Intratumoral Injection (ITI), The AUC is the area under the serum concentration time curve following single and multiple doses of SL-172154, Approximately 18-24 months|Terminal Elimination Half-life (t1/2) of SL-172154 When Administered by Intratumoral Injection (ITI), Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of SL-172154, Approximately 18-24 months|Clearance (CL) of SL-172154 When Administered by Intratumoral Injection (ITI), Clearance of Sl-172154, Approximately 18-24 months|Volume of Distribution of SL-172154 When Administered by Intratumoral Injection (ITI), Volume of distribtion of SL-172154, Approximately 18-24 months
Changes From Baseline in Cell Counts to Assess Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers in Blood Prior to, On-treatment and Following SL-172154 When Administered by Intratumoral Injection (ITI), Circulating immune cells such as: T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and myeloid cells and circulating chemokine and cytokine levels, Approximately 18-24 months|Changes From Baseline in Cell Counts to Assess Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers in Tumor Tissue Prior to, On-treatment and Following SL-172154 When Administered by Intratumoral Injection (ITI), Presence of SL-172154 in tumor tissue, changes in T cells subsets, B cells and macrophages and assessment of SL-172154 in the tumor tissue, CD47 and CD40 expression and Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, Approximately 18-24 months|To Estimate Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS: time from first dose to progression by RECIST v1.1 or death, whichever comes first, Approximately 18-24 months
This Phase 1 trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, anti-tumor activity and pharmacodynamic effects of SL-172154 when administered as an intratumoral injection (ITI) and identify the dose and schedule i.e., recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for future development. Eligible subjects must have unresectable or recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or head and neck, that is not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy. The study design consists of four sequential dose-escalation cohorts and an optional pharmacodynamic cohort to obtain additional pharmacodynamic data at one or more dose levels that have completed evaluation for safety without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
