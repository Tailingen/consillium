DISCERN: Dual Versus Single ICB in PDL-1 Negative NSCLC
The purpose of this study, known as DISCERN, is to compare two different treatments for a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that does not show a marker known as PD-L1. This study will help us understand if using two types of immune therapy together with chemotherapy is better than using one type of immune therapy with chemotherapy. We're doing this by looking at changes in the subject's cancer's DNA in the blood after starting treatment.

Rate of Molecular Response in Patients with PD-L1 Negative Advanced NSCLC Treated with Dual vs. Single ICB Plus CT Regimens, To assess and quantify the rate of molecular response, defined as the complete disappearance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from baseline levels, by Cycle 4 Day 1 (C4D1). This study compares patients with PD-L1 negative advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are treated with a dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) plus chemotherapy (CT) strategy against those receiving a single ICB plus CT regimen. The objective explores whether the addition of a second ICB enhances the molecular response when integrated into standard chemoimmunotherapy protocols in this specific patient population., Baseline to 64 days (C4D1)
Efficacy Evaluation, To determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) in patients receiving dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) plus chemotherapy (CT) and those receiving single ICB plus CT. The ORR will be assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Baseline up to 24 months|Correlation Analysis, To investigate the correlation between ctDNA responses at Cycle 4 Day 1 (C4D1) and traditional RECIST v1.1 criteria in patients receiving dual versus single ICB plus CT. The analysis aims to validate ctDNA as a predictive biomarker for treatment response., Baseline up to 24 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), To evaluate the median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) among patients treated with dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) plus chemotherapy (CT) compared to those receiving single ICB plus CT. The aim is to evaluate the impact of the combined treatment strategy on disease progression., Baseline to 24 months|Median Overall Survival (OS), To evaluates the median Overall Survival (OS) in patients receiving dual ICB plus CT versus those treated with single ICB plus CT, offering insights into the long-term benefits of these treatment regimens., Baseline to 24 months|Tolerability Assessment, To assess the tolerability of dual versus single ICB plus CT strategies using patient-reported outcomes (PROs). The focus is on evaluating the patient experience and side effect profiles associated with these treatment options in patients with PD-L1 negative advanced NSCLC., Baseline to 24 months
