The Deep South Surgical Equity Research Network: Addressing Socioecological Determinants of Health
Rationale: Older African Americans undergoing surgery are a vulnerable and growing population at high risk for poor surgical outcomes and disparities. Few programs have focused on this population due to a fragmented understanding of the needs of this population.

Objectives: While socioecological determinants of health (SEDOH) such as health literacy and socioeconomic status are known drivers of surgical disparities, an estimated 36-47% of surgical disparities remains unexplained. This gap results from limitations of current clinical datasets in capturing SEDOHs. This pilot study aims to fill this gap by (i) collecting granular SEDOH data, (ii) identifying barriers to surgical care for older African Americans, and (iii) establishing a multi-institutional clinical database through a socioecological context. These findings will help understand how SEDOHs drive surgical disparities and inform development of interventions to eliminate them in elderly African Americans.

Design and Methods: Guided by the socioecological model of health, the investigators will use mixed-methods to achieve the objectives. First, the investigators will assess the acceptability and feasibility of a 58-item SEDOH survey based on the NIH PhenX toolkit. After distributing this survey to 36 elderly (≥65 years) African American patients undergoing surgery at 3 rural, UAB-affiliated hospitals (Alex-City, Greenville, Demopolis) the investigators will conduct detailed theory guided assessments of acceptability and feasibility (SA1). Second, the investigators will conduct key informant interviews of individuals from all 5 socioecological levels at each rural hospital (n=10) to identify additional barriers and facilitators to surgical care. The investigators will purposively sample 100% of participants at the patient and caregiver level (n=12) to be elderly African Americans (SA2). Finally, the investigators will link measured SEDOH data with standardized clinical data at each hospital to establish a novel database (SA3). These findings will establish a process to measure SEDOHs across the Deep South and set the foundation for a unique database to study surgical disparities.

Significance: Development of effective multilevel interventions to eliminate surgical disparities in older African Americans is dependent on a clearer understanding of the contextual drivers of these disparities. This pilot study will accelerate understanding of these mechanism(s) through SEDOHs. It will establish a process to measure SEDOHs, identify additional barriers to surgical care not captured by NIH instruments, and build the database to study these relationships. Such findings will have the potential to impact vulnerable surgical populations in the Deep South and support the Deep South RCMAR mission to promote health and optimize health outcomes for older and rural African Americans.

Feasibility and Acceptability of a multidimensional survey in measuring socioecological determinants of health at rural hospitals in the Black Belt of Alabama (Demopolis, Alexander City, Greenville)., Using a theory guided framework and previously published measures of acceptability and feasibility, a post survey will be administered to all participants in specific aim 1. Feasibility and acceptability scores will be calculated, with positive acceptability and feasibility being indicated by scores of 4 or greater on a likert scale. The investigators will ensure that the survey is found to be acceptable and feasible to \>70% of the target population, and will have areas for qualitative feedback and comments to adapt the survey as needed., 3 months|Barriers to surgical care for older African American patients in the Deep South., To identify barriers to surgical care for older African American patients in the Deep South the investigators will conduct qualitative interviews of participants at all socioecological levels at each site. These interviews will be transcribed and coded using NVivo software, and themes from this analysis will be compared with the domains assessed in the survey used in specific aim 1 in order to ensure that all relevant domains are captured and assessed., 6 months|A database linking socioecological determinants of health with nationally validated surgical outcomes., To establish a database linking socioecological determinants of health with nationally validated surgical outcomes the investigators will pair data obtained from the previously developed survey with chart abstracted clinical outcomes data. All data will be stored in a secure RedCap database, and entered only by trained abstractors., 12 months
