A Phase I, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of MEDI4736 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is a phase I, open-label, multicentre study of MEDI4736 administered intravenously with a standard 3+3 dose-escalation phase to evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in patients with advanced solid tumor followed by an expansion phase in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: MEDI4736|DRUG: tremelimumab
Number of participants experiencing dose-limiting toxicities, adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), Safety profile will be assessed through number of participants experiencing adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and physical examinations., 90 days after the last dose of MEDI4736
Area under the concentration of MEDI4736 time curve, If data allow, noncompartmental PK parameter (AUC) will be estimated., Up to 90 days after the last dose of MEDI4736|Percentage of participants who developed detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., The immunogenic potential of MEDI4736 or tremelimumab will be assessed by summarizing the number percentage of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., Up to 6 months after the last dose of MEDI4736 or up to 1 month after the last dose of tremelimumab where applicable.|Objective response rate (ORR), From first dose of study drug until death or up to 2 years|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose (OBD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose (OBD) of MEDI4736, if possible, 90 days after the last dose of MEDI4736|Maximum concentration of MEDI4736, If data allow, noncompartmental PK parameter (Cmax) will be estimated., Up to 90 days after the last dose of MEDI4736|Clearance, If data allow, noncompartmental PK parameter (CL) will be estimated., Up to 90 days after the last dose of MEDI4736|half-life after administration of MEDI4736, If data allow, noncompartmental PK parameter (tÂ½) will be estimated., Up to 90 days after the last dose of MEDI4736|Disease control rate (DCR), From first dose of study drug until death or up to 2 years|Duration of response (DoR), From first dose of study drug until death or up to 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Alive and progression free at 6 months (APF6) and 12 months (APF12) will be obtained using the Kaplan-Meier plot of PFS., From first dose of study drug until death or up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), The proportion of patients alive at 12 months will be obtained from the Kaplan-Meier plot of OS., From first dose of study drug until death or up to 2 years
