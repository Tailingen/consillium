Impact of Computerized Decision Support for ANTIBIOtic Prescription in Cancer Patients With Febrile NEutropenia in the Emergency Department on Treatment Failure.
Treatment of patients with febrile neutropenia (FN) attending Emergency Departments (EDs) relies on rapid antibiotic initiation in order to control a presumed infection. The choice of initial antibiotics is empirical and depends on patient's prior colonization or infection by multi-drug resistant pathogens (MDRPs) and risk stratification. Stratification of high-risk patients needing broad-spectrum antibiotics is debated. Thus, for non-specialist physicians, this choice may be challenging, leading to inappropriate initial antimicrobial regimens, potential risks for the patient and higher costs. Furthermore, international guidelines recommended to develop antibiotic stewardship programs and promoted an initial strategy based on escalation or de-escalation approaches, with early reassessment depending on patients' clinical course and microbiological results. Nevertheless, this interesting strategy may increase the level of complexity for the choice of the initial antibiotic regimen by non-specialist emergency physicians who are often the first prescribers in this context.

We developed an interactive computerized decision support app (CDSA) for initial antibiotic prescription and early revaluation in patients with FN. The first goal of this app is to assist non-specialized physicians in choosing initial antimicrobial regimen for patients with FN when they attend EDs. It uses an interactive algorithm based on international guidelines that takes into account patients' medical history and characteristics. Secondly, the app is also designed to propose an algorithm of antibiotic revaluation at day 3-4 for hospitalized patients, depending on patient clinical course, and biological and microbiological results. The revaluation suggests antimicrobial modification (escalation or de-escalation) or discontinuation and stopping rules with recommended duration of therapy also based on international guidelines.

We hypothesize that such a CDSA may improve the adherence to guidelines for the choice of initial antibiotic regimen for FN in the ED, favour early antibiotic reassessment for hospitalized patients, both decreasing the risk of treatment failure.

Treatment failure, Treatment failure will be defined by any escalation of the assigned empirical initial antibiotic treatment (e.g. adjunction of aminoglycoside, glycopeptide or other anti-gram positive or any broadening of the beta-lactam spectrum) during the 7 days following inclusion, in relation with at least one of the following reasons:

* microbiologic reason;
* clinical progression of the presumed infection defined as persistence, recurrence or worsening of clinical signs or symptoms of presenting infection (e.g. death due to the initial infection, occurrence of sepsis or septic shock, need for oxygen therapy (or increasing oxygen flow) or mechanical or non-invasive ventilation in case of pneumonia, neurological deterioration in case of central nervous system infection). Treatment failure outcome will be reviewed by at least 2 experts blinded to the arm., 7 days following inclusion

The EQ5D5L scale is composed of two parts: a descriptive system and the EQ Visual Analog Scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system has five dimensions. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, mild problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The descriptive system ranges from 1 to 25, the higher the score the worse the quality of life. The score goes from VAS 0 to 100, the higher the VAS score the better the quality of life., at inclusion|Health related quality of life., Quality of life will be assessed using the EQ5D5L scale.
