About This PDQ Summary
Executive Summary
This executive summary reviews the topics covered in this PDQ summary on the genetics of breast and gynecologic cancers.
Inheritance and Risk
Factors suggestive of a
genetic contribution to both breast cancer and gynecologic cancer
include 1) an increased incidence of these cancers among individuals with a family history of these cancers,  2) multiple family members affected with these and other cancers,  and 3) a pattern of cancers compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. Both males and females can inherit and transmit an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition gene.
Additional factors coupled with family history can influence an individual's risk of developing cancer. These factors include
reproductive history
,
contraceptive
and
hormone replacement use
,
radiation exposure
early in life,
alcohol consumption and smoking
, and
physical activity
.
Risk assessment models have been developed to clarify an individual's 1)
lifetime risk of developing breast and/or gynecologic cancer
, 2)
likelihood of having a pathogenic variant in
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
, and 3)
likelihood of having a pathogenic variant in one of the mismatch repair genes associated with Lynch syndrome
.
Associated Genes and Syndromes
Breast and ovarian cancer are present in several autosomal dominant cancer syndromes, although they are most strongly associated with highly penetrant germline pathogenic variants in
BRCA1 and BRCA2
. Other genes, such as
PALB2
,
TP53
(associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome),
PTEN
(associated with
PTEN
hamartoma tumor syndromes, including Cowden syndrome),
CDH1
(associated with diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancer syndrome), and
STK11
(associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), confer a risk to either or both of these cancers with relatively high penetrance.
Inherited endometrial cancer is most commonly associated with
Lynch syndrome
, a condition caused by inherited pathogenic variants in the highly penetrant mismatch repair genes
MLH1
,
MSH2
,
MSH6
,
PMS2
, and
EPCAM
. Colorectal cancer (and, to a lesser extent, ovarian cancer and stomach cancer) is also associated with Lynch syndrome.
CHEK2
,
BRIP1
,
RAD51C
,
RAD51D
, and
ATM
are moderate penetrance genes that are associated with increased breast and/or gynecologic cancer risk.
Genome-wide searches
are showing promise in identifying common, low-penetrance susceptibility alleles for many complex diseases, including breast and gynecologic cancers, but the clinical utility of these findings remains uncertain.
Clinical Management
Breast cancer screening strategies
, including breast magnetic resonance imaging and mammography, are commonly performed in carriers of
BRCA
pathogenic variants and in individuals at increased risk of breast cancer. Initiation of screening is generally recommended at earlier ages and at more frequent intervals in individuals with an increased risk due to genetics and family history than in the general population. There is evidence to demonstrate that these strategies have utility in early detection of cancer.  In contrast, there is currently no evidence to demonstrate that
ovarian cancer screening
using cancer antigen–125  testing and transvaginal ultrasound leads to early detection of cancer.
Risk-reducing surgeries, including
risk-reducing mastectomy
(RRM) and
risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy
(RRSO), have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer and improve overall survival in carriers of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants.
Chemoprevention strategies for breast cancer
and
chemoprevention strategies for ovarian cancer
have been examined in this population. For example,
tamoxifen
use has been shown to reduce the risk of
contralateral breast cancer
among carriers of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants after treatment for breast cancer, but there are limited data in the primary cancer prevention setting to suggest that it reduces the risk of breast cancer among healthy female carriers of
BRCA2
pathogenic variants. The use of
oral contraceptives
also has been associated with a protective effect on the risk of developing ovarian cancer, including in carriers of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants, with no association of increased risk of breast cancer when using formulations developed after 1975.
Psychosocial and Behavioral Issues
Psychosocial factors
influence decisions about genetic testing for inherited cancer risk and risk-management strategies.
Uptake of genetic testing
varies widely across studies. Psychological factors that have been associated with testing uptake include cancer-specific distress and perceived risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Studies have shown
low levels of distress
after genetic testing for both carriers and noncarriers, particularly in the longer term.
Uptake of RRM and RRSO
also varies across studies and may be influenced by factors such as cancer history, age, family history, recommendations of the health care provider, and pretreatment genetic education and counseling.
Patients' communication with their family members
about an inherited risk of breast and gynecologic cancer is complex; gender, age, and the degree of relatedness are some elements that affect disclosure of this information. Research is ongoing to better understand and address psychosocial and behavioral issues in high-risk families.

General Information
Among women in the  United States, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer after
nonmelanoma skin cancer, and it is the second leading cause of cancer deaths after
lung cancer.  In 2025, an estimated 319,750 new cases  of breast cancer (including 2,800 cases in men) will be diagnosed, and
42,680 deaths (including 510 deaths in men) will occur.[
1
] The incidence of breast cancer, particularly for estrogen receptor (ER)–positive  cancers occurring after age 50 years, is declining and has declined at a faster rate since 2003. This may be temporally related to a decrease in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after early reports from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI).[
2
] An estimated 20,890 new cases of ovarian cancer are expected in the United States in 2025, with an estimated 12,730 deaths. Ovarian cancer is the sixth most deadly cancer in women.[
1
] An estimated 69,120 new cases of endometrial cancer are expected in the United States in 2025, with an estimated 13,860 deaths.[
1
] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on
Breast Cancer Treatment
;
Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Treatment
;  and
Endometrial Cancer Treatment
for more information about breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer rates, diagnosis, and management.)
A possible genetic contribution to both breast and ovarian cancer risk is indicated by the
increased incidence of these cancers among women with a family history (refer to the
Risk Factors for Breast Cancer
,
Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer
, and
Risk Factors for Endometrial Cancer
sections below for more information), and by the observation of some families in which multiple family
members are
affected
with breast and/or ovarian cancer, in a pattern compatible with an inheritance of
autosomal dominant
cancer susceptibility. Formal studies of families (
linkage analysis
) have subsequently proven the
existence of autosomal dominant predispositions to breast and ovarian cancer and have led to the
identification of several highly
penetrant
genes
as the cause
of inherited cancer risk in many families.  (Refer to the PDQ
summary
Cancer Genetics Overview
for more information about linkage
analysis.)
Pathogenic variants
in these genes are rare in the general population and are estimated to account for no more
than 5% to 10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases overall.  It is likely that other
genetic factors contribute to the etiology of some of these cancers.
Risk Factors for Breast Cancer
This section discusses  factors that can modify an individual's  risk of developing breast cancer.  These risk factors can affect women  in the general population, women who have a family histories of breast cancer,  and women who carry pathogenic variants in breast cancer risk genes. For more information on breast cancer risk factors in the general population, see
Breast Cancer Prevention
, and for more information on risks associated with
BRCA1/2
pathogenic variants, see the
Cancer Risks, Spectrum, and Characteristics
section in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management.
The following breast cancer risk factors are discussed in this section:
Age
.
Family history of breast cancer
.
Benign breast disease, mammographic density, and background parenchymal enhancement
.
Parity, age at first birth, and breastfeeding
.
Contraceptives
.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
.
Radiation exposure
.
Alcohol and smoking
.
Physical activity
.
These  factors can increase or decrease  breast cancer risk in all women. However,  they may affect breast cancer risk differently in women with increased breast cancer susceptibility  (i.e., women who have high-risk family histories and/or pathogenic variants in hereditary breast cancer genes).    Factors that increase breast cancer risk in the general population may lower breast cancer risk, increase breast cancer risk more than expected, or have no effect on breast cancer risk in women with high breast cancer susceptibility.  In some cases, these risk factors may affect high-risk women in the same way that they affect average-risk women.  Furthermore, modifying risk factors has a greater effect on the absolute breast cancer risk in women with high breast cancer susceptibility than in women with low breast cancer susceptibility.[
3
] It is imperative that providers discuss breast cancer risk factors with high-susceptibility patients, since risk patterns deviate from those seen in women in the general population. Providers may also want to convey  whether these risk factors increase, decrease, or do not affect breast cancer risk in women with high breast cancer susceptibility, based on available evidence. This information may change how providers approach breast cancer risk management in women with high breast cancer susceptibility.
Age
Like other cancer types, breast cancer's  cumulative risk increases with age. As individuals age, they encounter more environmental exposures and accumulate genomic changes. Hence,  most breast cancers
occur after age 50 years.[
4
] Women with pathogenic variants in breast cancer risk genes often develop breast cancer at younger ages than women with
sporadic
breast cancers.
Family history of breast cancer
A family history of breast cancer is a well-established, consistent risk factor for breast cancer. Approximately 5% to 10% of women with breast cancer also had a
mother or sister with breast cancer in cross-sectional studies. About 10% to 20% of women had a
first-degree relative
(FDR) or a
second-degree relative
(SDR) with breast cancer.[
5
-
8
]  A pooled analysis of 38 studies showed that women had increased breast cancer risk when they had at least one FDR with breast cancer   (relative risk [RR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0–2.2).[
9
] A large population-based study that used the Swedish Family Cancer Database found that women had a significantly increased risk of breast cancer when they had a mother or a sister with breast cancer.[
6
,
7
,
9
-
11
]
The following factors can increase a woman's breast cancer risk:
Large number of affected relatives.
Family members who were diagnosed with breast cancer at young ages.
Family members with bilateral breast cancers.
Family members with multiple ipsilateral breast cancers.
Male relatives with breast cancer.
Furthermore, women with family histories of multiple breast cancers had higher hazard ratios (HRs) (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.6–2.9) than women who had a single breast cancer in their families (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.8–1.9). When women had multiple breast cancers in their families (with one breast cancer occurring before age 40 years), the HR was 3.8 (95% CI, 3.1–4.8).  However,  breast cancer risk also significantly increased when a relative was diagnosed with breast cancer at 60 years or older, suggesting that having a relative with breast cancer at any age can  increase risk.[
11
] Another study in women with unilateral versus contralateral breast cancer (CBC) evaluated CBC risk among family members.[
12
] Results indicated that  women with at least one affected FDR had an 8.1% chance of developing CBC after 10 years. Participants' risks also increased when relatives were diagnosed with breast cancer before age 40 years (10-year absolute risk [AR], 13.5%; 95% CI, 8.8%–20.8%) or if relatives had CBC (10-year AR, 14.1%; 95% CI, 9.5%–20.7%). These risks were similar to those seen among
BRCA
carriers (10-year AR, 18.4%; 95% CI, 16.0%–21.3%). These risk estimates remained unchanged when the analysis was restricted to women who tested negative for a pathogenic variant in
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
,
ATM
,
CHEK2
, or
PALB2
.
Albright et al. addressed how affected
third-degree relatives
(TDRs) can contribute to an individual's breast cancer risk.[
13
] These researchers used the Utah Population Database and the Utah Cancer Registry to estimate RRs for participants to develop breast cancer. They collected family histories with  FDRs, SDRs, and TDRs and included both paternal and maternal relatives. They  confirmed that individuals with affected FDRs had the highest breast cancer risk, particularly if the FDR was diagnosed with breast cancer early in life. When participants had five or more affected TDRs (and no FDRs/SDRs with breast cancer), they had an RR of 1.32 (95% CI, 1.11–1.57).
One of the largest studies of twins ever conducted examined 80,309 monozygotic twins and 123,382 dizygotic twins. This study had a
heritability
estimate of 31% for breast cancer  (95% CI, 11%–51%).[
14
]  If a monozygotic twin had breast cancer, her twin sister had a 28.1% chance of developing breast cancer (95% CI, 23.9%–32.8%), and if a dizygotic twin had breast cancer, her twin sister had a 19.9% chance of developing breast cancer (95% CI, 17%–23.2%).  These estimates suggest that monozygotic twins have  a 10% higher risk of developing breast cancer than dizygotic twins.  However, the high rate of discordance seen, even between monozygotic twins, suggests that environmental factors can also modify breast cancer risk.
Benign breast disease, mammographic density, and background parenchymal enhancement
Benign breast disease (BBD)
BBD is a broad group of conditions characterized by non-cancerous changes in  breast tissue. BBD can be divided into three categories: nonproliferative lesions, proliferative lesions without atypia, and atypical hyperplasias. BBD is a consistent risk factor for breast cancer in the general population.[
15
,
16
]
BBD is also an important risk factor in women who have high breast cancer susceptibility due to family histories of cancer or pathogenic variants in breast cancer risk genes. For example, a study of 17,154 women found that women with a history of BBD have an increased risk of breast cancer that is independent of their underlying familial and genetic risks.[
17
]  However, breast cancer risk associated with personal histories of BBD did not vary between women with
BRCA1
pathogenic variants (RR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.04–2.58), women with
BRCA2
pathogenic variants (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.78–2.3), and  women who only had family histories of breast cancer  (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.13–1.53). In women with high breast cancer susceptibility, BBD can further increase breast cancer risk,  because it multiplies their underlying familial and genetic risks.
Mammographic density
Women with  dense breast tissue (assessed by mammogram) also have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.[
15
,
18
,
19
] Studies have shown that breast density likely has a genetic  etiology.[
20
-
22
]
A systematic review reported that women who had dense breast tissue and an FDR with breast cancer had an increased chance of developing breast cancer.[
23
] Two retrospective studies also investigated the association between mammographic density and breast cancer risk in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
carriers.[
24
,
25
] These  retrospective studies had  samples  of 206 and 691
BRCA
pathogenic variant carriers. In these studies, 96 and 248  women developed breast cancer, respectively.[
24
,
25
] The studies found that mammographic density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer in both
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variant carriers. Associations between breast density and breast cancer risk were  similar to those observed in the general population (RR, 2.30 for density ≥50% vs. <50%).
Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE)
Like breast density (assessed by mammogram), BPE  (assessed by breast magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may increase  breast cancer risk. Data have shown that moderate BPE (odds ratio [OR], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0–2.6) and mild BPE (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5–3.0) can increase breast cancer risk in  women with high breast cancer susceptibility. However, an association between mild/moderate BPE and breast cancer risk was not found in  women with average breast cancer susceptibility.[
26
]
Parity, age at first birth, and breastfeeding
Parity
A large prospective study analyzed the relationship between parity and breast cancer risk in female
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
carriers. Results showed that parity affected breast cancer risk in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
carriers differently. Breast cancer risk increased in  uniparous
BRCA1
carriers and parous
BRCA2
carriers.[
27
] In
BRCA1
carriers, there was no overall association between parity and breast cancer risk when compared with nulliparity and breast cancer risk.  Uniparous
BRCA1
carriers were at an increased risk of breast cancer in the prospective analysis (HR
prospective
, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.09–2.62) when compared with nulliparous
BRCA1
carriers. The results also suggested  that uniparous women who breastfed may have decreased breast cancer risk when compared with those who did not breastfeed. In
BRCA2
carriers, being parous was associated with a 33% increase in breast cancer risk (HR
combined
, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05–1.69). Multiparity did not decrease breast cancer risk in
BRCA2
carriers,  unless they had at least four full-term pregnancies (HR
combined
, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54–0.98).
Age at first birth
In the general population, breast cancer risk increases when women have early menarche and/or late menopause. Breast cancer risk  decreases when a woman’s first full-term pregnancy occurs at a young age. However, these risk factors can affect women with high breast cancer susceptibility differently than women in the general population.
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variant
carriers
who become pregnant prior to age 30 years may have increased breast cancer risk. This effect is even more significant in
BRCA1
pathogenic variant carriers.[
28
-
30
]
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variant carriers who developed breast cancer during pregnancy or became pregnant after developing breast cancer did not experience adverse survival outcomes.[
31
]
Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding can reduce breast cancer risk in
BRCA1
(but not
BRCA2
) pathogenic variant carriers.[
32
] Breastfeeding for long periods of time was associated with decreased breast cancer risk in
BRCA1
carriers (
P
-trend = .0003).[
27
]
Reproductive history can also affect a woman's risk for ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. For more information, see the
Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer
and
Risk Factors for Endometrial Cancer
sections.
Contraceptives
Breast cancer risk is one of the factors to consider when prescribing contraceptives, which assist with pregnancy control,  abnormal bleeding, and other gynecological symptoms. Oral contraceptives (OCs) may slightly increase breast cancer risk in
long-term users, but this appears to be a short-term effect.[
33
]
Some studies show that OC use does not further increase breast cancer risk in women with high breast cancer susceptibility. For example, a meta-analysis
with data from 54 studies  showed that women with family histories of breast cancer did not have increased  breast cancer risk from OC use.[
33
] Although the data are not entirely consistent, a meta-analysis of
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant carriers concluded that breast cancer risk did not significantly increase when participants used OCs.[
34
] More specifically, the International
BRCA1/2
Carrier Cohort Study (IBCCS), the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer (kConFab) Follow-Up Study, and the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR) did not report associations between OC use and increased breast cancer risk in women with
BRCA1
pathogenic variants.[
35
] In fact, OCs are sometimes recommended for ovarian cancer prevention in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variant carriers. For more information, see the
Oral contraceptives
and
Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer
sections. However, in the prospective analyses of the IBCCS, kConFab, and BCFR studies mentioned above, women with
BRCA2
pathogenic variants had increased breast cancer risk when they took  OCs  (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.03–2.97).  Additionally, a systematic review of the published data concluded that it is unclear if OC use increases breast cancer risk in
BRCA1/2
carriers due to inconsistencies across studies.[
36
]
Some studies also suggest that the year an OC was made and a woman's age when beginning OC use may matter. For example,  OCs made before 1975 are associated with increased  breast cancer risk in
BRCA1/2
carriers (summary relative risk [SRR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.06–2.04).[
34
] A case-control study of 2,492 matched pairs of women with a
BRCA1
pathogenic variant also found that OC use significantly  increased breast cancer risk when women began using OCs prior to age 20 years (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20–1.75).[
37
]
Other contraceptive methods have not been studied in women with pathogenic variants in breast cancer risk genes. However, studies have investigated associations between intrauterine devices and breast cancer risk in the general population.  A meta-analysis and systematic review of seven studies examined the effect of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) on breast cancer risk. The meta-analysis included studies that controlled for family history of breast cancer, but associations were not separately evaluated or stratified by family history of breast cancer. In LNG-IUS users, breast cancer risk increased in all women (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06–1.28), in women younger than 50 years (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02–1.22), and in women 50 years and older (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.34–1.72).[
38
]
Hormone replacement therapy
Both observational studies and randomized clinical trials have examined the association between postmenopausal HRT and breast cancer. Short-term use of HRT for treatment of postmenopausal symptoms appears to
confer little or no breast cancer risk.[
39
,
40
] A meta-analysis with data from 51
observational studies found a 1.35 RR for breast cancer  (95% CI, 1.21–1.49)
in women who used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause.[
39
]  The
WHI
, a randomized, controlled trial  of about 160,000 postmenopausal women, investigated the risks and benefits of HRT. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the study, in which more than 16,000 women were randomly assigned  to receive combined estrogen and progestin or placebo, was halted early because health risks exceeded  health benefits.[
41
,
42
]  Significant increases in both total  breast cancer cases (245 in the estrogen-plus-progestin group vs. 185 in the placebo group) and invasive breast cancer cases (199 in the estrogen-plus-progestin group vs. 150 in the placebo group) prompted early closure of the study (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02–1.5;
P
< .001).  Risks for coronary heart disease, stroke,  and pulmonary embolism also increased in the estrogen-plus-progestin group. The WHI study did not stratify data by participants' family histories of breast cancer, and subjects were not systematically tested for
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants.[
42
] Similar findings were seen in the estrogen-progestin arm of the prospective,  observational Million Women’s Study in the United Kingdom.[
43
]   However, breast cancer risk was not elevated in women randomly assigned  to the estrogen-only group when compared with those in the placebo group in the WHI study (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59–1.01). Hysterectomy was required for women to qualify for the  estrogen-only arm of this study; 40% of these patients also had a bilateral oophorectomy,  which can potentially decrease breast cancer risk.[
44
]
Among women with family histories of breast cancer, the associations between HRT and breast cancer risk have not been consistent. Some studies suggested risk was particularly elevated among women with  family histories of breast cancer, while others  did not report an interaction between these factors.[
45
-
49
,
39
] 
A large meta-analysis found that women who used HRT had increased breast cancer risk. However, risk  did not differ significantly between subjects with or without family histories of cancer.[
49
]
The effect of HRT on breast cancer risk among carriers of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants has been studied in the context of  bilateral risk-reducing oophorectomy. Short-term HRT use does not  seem to alter an oophorectomy's protective effect on breast cancer risk.[
50
]  For example, a prospective, longitudinal cohort study recruited
BRCA1
carriers from 80 centers in 17 countries. This study found that HRT use after oophorectomy was not associated with increased breast cancer risk in
BRCA1
carriers.[
51
] The HR was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.62–1.52) for individuals who  used HRT when compared with individuals who had never used HRT. However, the effects of estrogen-only  HRT and estrogen-plus-progesterone HRT differed. After a 10-year follow-up period, the cumulative breast cancer incidence was 12% in women who used estrogen-only HRT and 22% in women who used estrogen-plus-progesterone HRT. These associations were stronger for women who underwent oophorectomy before age 45 years. The study concluded that using estrogen-only HRT after oophorectomy did not increase risk of
BRCA1
-associated breast cancers. However, the potential harmful effects of progesterone-containing HRT warrant further study.[
52
]  For more information, see the
HRT in Carriers of
BRCA1/BRCA2
Pathogenic Variants
section in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management.
HRT use may also increase a woman's chance of developing endometrial cancer. For more information, see the
Hormones
section.
Radiation exposure
Radiation exposure can increase an individual's breast cancer risk. This is demonstrated by the survivors of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and by women who have received
therapeutic radiation treatments to the chest and upper body.  However, it is unclear how much radiation exposure affects breast cancer risk in women with high breast cancer  susceptibility.
Early data suggested that carriers of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants may have increased sensitivity to
radiation, which may contribute to cancer susceptibility.[
53
-
56
] Studies have shown that individuals with germline
ATM
and
TP53
variants also have increased sensitivity to radiation.[
57
,
58
]
It is possible that radiation exposure from diagnostic procedures, including mammography, poses
a greater risk to  women with high breast cancer susceptibility than to women who are at average risk of developing breast cancer. 
Therapeutic radiation could also increase cancer risk in women with high breast cancer susceptibility.  However, a cohort study of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variant carriers treated with breast-conserving therapy did not show evidence of increased radiation sensitivity in participants. Sequelae were not observed in
the breasts, lungs, or bone marrow of
BRCA
carriers.[
59
]
Conversely,
tumors in women with  pathogenic variants in breast cancer risk genes may be more responsive to radiation treatment than tumors in women at average breast cancer risk.  Studies examining the impact of radiation exposure in carriers of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants have had conflicting results.[
60
-
65
] A large European study showed a dose-response relationship, in which breast cancer risk increased with total radiation exposure. However,   this occurred most often when patients had  nonmammographic radiation exposure before age 20 years.[
64
]  A significant association was not observed between prior mammography exposure and breast cancer risk in a prospective study of 1,844
BRCA1
carriers and 502
BRCA2
carriers without breast cancer diagnoses upon study entry. The average follow-up period in this study was 5.3 years.[
65
]
A retrospective cohort study estimated the effect of adjuvant radiation therapy (for primary breast cancer) on  CBC risk in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
carriers (N, 691; median follow-up period, 8.6 y).[

] An association was not found between radiation therapy  and CBC risk  (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.45–1.45). This was also true in patients who were younger than 40 years when they were diagnosed with their primary breast cancers (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.60–3.09). A study examined the impact of radiation therapy on CBC risk in
ATM
,
BRCA1/2
, and
CHEK2
1100delC carriers. CBC risk was not modified by radiation therapy,  even though these women  had a higher baseline risk of CBC than women in the general population (
BRCA1/2
pathogenic variant carriers without radiation therapy: RR, 3.52; 95% CI, 1.76–7.01;
BRCA1/2
pathogenic variant carriers with radiation therapy: RR, 4.46; 95% CI, 2.96–6.71).[
67
]  Thus, it is important to differentiate individuals with increased  CBC  risk due to pathogenic variants from individuals with increased CBC risk due to radiation therapy. For more information, see the
Mammography
section in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management.
Alcohol and smoking
The risk of breast cancer increases by approximately 10% for each 10 g of daily alcohol intake (approximately one drink or less) in the general population.[
68
,
69
]  Prior studies of
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant carriers have  not found an association between alcohol consumption and increased breast cancer risk.[
70
-
72
] The association between  cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk in women with
BRCA1/2
pathogenic variants is  inconclusive.[
73
,
74
]
Recent studies have evaluated the association between alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, and breast cancer risk in individuals  with
BRCA1/2
pathogenic variants or family histories of breast cancer. One study evaluated if tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption are associated with increased breast cancer risk in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
carriers  using pooled data from an international cohort.[
75
]  This study did not find an association between alcohol consumption and increased breast cancer risk in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
carriers. Parous
BRCA
carriers who smoked for more than 5 years before their first full-term pregnancy had a significantly increased  breast cancer risk when compared with parous
BRCA
carriers who did not smoke. A prospective study evaluating a cohort of women with  family histories of breast cancer found that alcohol consumption was associated with an increased number of ER-positive breast cancers in women at the lowest quantile of absolute breast cancer risk (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.07–1.99).[
76
]  Cigarette smoking was also associated with increased breast cancer risk in those at the highest quantile of absolute breast cancer risk.
Physical activity
Increased physical activity has been associated with reduced breast cancer risk in most epidemiological studies.  This risk  reduction has also been seen in studies of female
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variant carriers.  For example, one study reported a 38%  reduction in premenopausal breast cancer risk from moderate physical activity (OR for the top quartile of physical activity compared with the lowest level, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40–0.96).[
77
]  This reduction in breast cancer risk has been seen in women with varying levels of breast cancer susceptibility, including  women who  have family histories of breast cancer  but do not have known
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variants.[

Risk Factors for Ovarian Cancer
Refer to the PDQ summary on
Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancers Prevention
for information about risk factors for ovarian cancer in the general population.
Age
Ovarian cancer incidence rises in a linear fashion from age 30 years to age 50 years and continues to increase, though at a slower rate, thereafter.   Before age 30 years, the risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer is remote, even in hereditary cancer families.[
79
]
Family history including inherited cancer genes
Although reproductive, demographic, and lifestyle
factors affect risk of ovarian cancer, the single greatest ovarian cancer risk
factor is a family history of the disease.  A large meta-analysis of 15 published studies estimated an  OR of 3.1 for the risk of ovarian cancer associated with at least one FDR with ovarian cancer.[
80
]
Reproductive
history
Nulliparity is consistently associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, including among carriers of
BRCA
/
BRCA2
pathogenic variants, yet a meta-analysis identified a risk reduction only in women with four or more live births.[
30
]  Risk may also be increased among women who have used fertility drugs, especially those who remain nulligravid.[
81
,
82
] Several studies have reported a risk reduction in ovarian cancer after OC use in carriers of
BRCA
/
BRCA2
pathogenic variants;[
83
-
85
] a risk reduction has also been shown after tubal ligation in
BRCA1
carriers, with a statistically significant decreased risk of 22% to 80% after the procedure.[
85
,
86
]
  Breastfeeding for more than 12 months may also be associated with a reduction in ovarian cancer among carriers of
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
pathogenic variants.[
87
] On the other hand, evidence is growing that the use of menopausal HRT is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, particularly in long-time users and users of sequential estrogen-progesterone schedules.[
88
-
91
]
Surgical history
Bilateral tubal ligation and hysterectomy are associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk,[
81
,
92
,
93
] including in carriers of
BRCA
/
BRCA2
pathogenic variants.[
94
] Ovarian cancer risk is reduced more than 90% in women with documented
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variants who chose risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO).  In this same population, risk-reducing oophorectomy also resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in the risk of subsequent breast cancer.[
95
,
96
] While some studies have shown more benefit for breast cancer reduction in patients with
BRCA2
versus
BRCA1
pathogenic variants, others have shown no benefit for
BRCA1
carriers.  Additionally, many of the studies remain underpowered to demonstrate benefit.[
97
]  (Refer to the
Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for breast cancer risk reduction
section in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management for more information about these studies.)
Oral contraceptives (OCs)
Use of OCs for 4 or more years is associated with an approximately 50% reduction in ovarian cancer risk in the general population.[
81
,
98
] A majority of, but not all, studies also support OCs being protective among carriers of
BRCA
/
BRCA2
pathogenic variants.[
86
,
99
-
102
] A meta-analysis of 18 studies including 13,627 carriers of
BRCA
pathogenic variants reported a significantly reduced risk of ovarian cancer (SRR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33–0.75) associated with OC use.[

Chemopreventive agents for reducing ovarian cancer risk
section in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management.)
Risk Factors for Endometrial Cancer
Refer to the PDQ summary on
Endometrial Cancer Prevention
for information about risk factors for endometrial cancer in the general population.
Age
Age is an important risk factor for endometrial cancer.  Most women with endometrial cancer are diagnosed after menopause.   Only 15% of women are diagnosed with endometrial cancer before age 50 years, and fewer than 5% are diagnosed before age 40 years.[
103
]
 Women with Lynch syndrome tend to develop endometrial cancer at an earlier age, with the median age at diagnosis of 48 years.[
104
]
Family history including inherited cancer genes
Although the hyperestrogenic state is the most common predisposing factor for endometrial cancer, family history also plays a significant role in a woman’s risk for disease. Approximately 3%  to 5% of uterine cancer cases are attributable to a hereditary cause,[
105
] with the main hereditary endometrial cancer syndrome being Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic condition with a population prevalence of 1 in 300 to 1 in 1,000 individuals.[
106
,
107
] (Refer to the
Lynch Syndrome
section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer for more information.)
Non-Lynch syndrome genes may also contribute to endometrial cancer risk. In an unselected endometrial cancer cohort undergoing
multigene panel testing
, approximately 3% of patients tested positive for a
germline pathogenic variant
in non-Lynch syndrome genes, including
CHEK2
,
APC
,
ATM
,
BARD1
,
BRCA1
,
BRCA2
,
BRIP1
,
NBN
,
PTEN
, and
RAD51C
.[
108
] Notably, patients with pathogenic variants in non-Lynch syndrome genes were more likely to have serous tumor histology than were patients without pathogenic variants. Furthermore, although the overall risk of endometrial cancer after RRSO was not increased among carriers of
BRCA1
pathogenic variants, these patients seemed to have an increased risk of serous and serous-like endometrial cancer.[
109
]

These findings were supported by a Dutch multicenter cohort study in women with germline
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants. This study concluded that participants' AR for endometrial cancer was approximately 3%. Because some serous and p53-aberrant endometrial cancers may harbor germline or somatic
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
variants, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor  therapy may also be a therapeutic option.[
110
]
Reproductive history
Reproductive factors such as multiparity, late menarche, and early menopause decrease the risk of endometrial cancer because of the lower cumulative exposure to estrogen and the higher relative exposure to progesterone.[
111
,
112
]
Hormones
Hormonal factors that increase the risk of type I endometrial cancer are better understood. All endometrial cancers share a predominance of estrogen relative to progesterone. Prolonged exposure to estrogen or unopposed estrogen increases the risk of endometrial cancer.  Endogenous exposure to estrogen can result from obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, and nulliparity, while exogenous estrogen can result from taking unopposed estrogen or tamoxifen. Unopposed estrogen increases the risk of developing endometrial cancer by twofold to twentyfold,  proportional to the duration of use.[
113
,
114
]  Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, acts as an estrogen agonist on the endometrium while acting as an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue, and  increases the risk of endometrial cancer.[
115
]  In contrast, OCs, the LNG-IUS, and combination estrogen-progesterone HRT all reduce the risk of endometrial cancer through the antiproliferative effect of progesterone acting on the endometrium.[

Autosomal Dominant Inheritance of Breast and Gynecologic Cancer Predisposition
Autosomal dominant inheritance of breast and gynecologic cancers is characterized by transmission of
cancer
predisposition
from generation to generation, through either the mother’s or the father’s
side of the family, with the following characteristics:
Inheritance risk of 50%. When a parent carries an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition, each child has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the predisposition. Although the risk of inheriting the predisposition is 50%,  not everyone with the predisposition will develop cancer because of
incomplete penetrance
and/or gender-restricted or gender-related expression.
Both males and females can inherit and transmit an autosomal dominant   
cancer predisposition.  A male who        
inherits a cancer predisposition can still
pass the altered gene on to his sons and daughters.
Breast and ovarian cancer are components of several autosomal dominant cancer syndromes. The syndromes most strongly associated with both cancers are the syndromes associated with
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variants.  Breast cancer is also a common feature of
Li-Fraumeni syndrome
due to
TP53
pathogenic variants and of
PTEN
hamartoma tumor syndromes (including Cowden syndrome)
due to
PTEN
pathogenic variants.[
120
] Other genetic syndromes that may include breast cancer as an associated feature include heterozygous carriers of the
ATM
gene  and
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
. Ovarian cancer has also been associated with
Lynch syndrome
, basal cell nevus (Gorlin) syndrome, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.[
120
] Lynch syndrome is mainly associated with colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer, although several studies have demonstrated that patients with Lynch syndrome are also at risk of developing transitional cell carcinoma of the ureters and renal pelvis; cancers of the stomach, small intestine, liver and biliary tract, brain, breast, prostate, and adrenal cortex; and sebaceous skin tumors (Muir-Torre syndrome).[
121
-
127
]
Germline
pathogenic variants in the genes responsible for these autosomal dominant cancer syndromes produce different clinical
phenotypes
of characteristic malignancies and, in some instances, associated nonmalignant abnormalities.
The family characteristics that suggest hereditary cancer predisposition include the following:
Multiple cancers within a family.
Cancers typically occur at an earlier age than in
sporadic cases (defined as cases not associated with genetic risk).
Two or more primary
cancers in a single individual.  These could be multiple
primary cancers of the same type (e.g., bilateral breast cancer) or
primary cancer of different types (e.g., breast cancer and ovarian cancer in
the same individual or endometrial and colon cancer in the same individual).
Cases of male breast cancer. The inheritance risk for autosomal dominant genetic conditions is 50% for both males and females, but the differing penetrance of the genes may result in some
unaffected
individuals in the family.

and

This pedigree shows some of the classic features of a family with Lynch syndrome, including affected family members with colon cancer or endometrial cancer, a young age at onset in some individuals, and incomplete penetrance. Lynch syndrome families may exhibit some or all of these features. Lynch syndrome families may also include individuals with other gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and genitourinary cancers, or other extracolonic cancers. As an autosomal dominant syndrome, Lynch syndrome can be transmitted through maternal or paternal lineages, as depicted in the figure. Because the cancer risk is not 100%, individuals who have Lynch syndrome may not develop cancer, such as the mother of the female with colon cancer diagnosed at age 37 years in this pedigree (called incomplete penetrance).
There are no
pathognomonic
features distinguishing breast and ovarian cancers occurring in carriers of
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variants from those occurring in
noncarriers
. Breast cancers occurring in carriers of
BRCA1
pathogenic variants are more likely to be ER-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)–negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor two (HER2/neu)–negative (i.e.,
triple-negative breast cancers
[TNBC]), and have a basal phenotype.
BRCA1
-associated ovarian cancers are more likely to be high-grade and of serous histopathology.  (Refer to the
BRCA1/2
-associated breast cancer pathology
and
Pathologies of
BRCA1/2
-associated ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers
sections in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management for more information.)
Some pathologic features distinguish carriers of Lynch syndrome–associated pathogenic variants from noncarriers. The hallmark feature of endometrial cancers occurring in Lynch syndrome is mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies, including the presence of
microsatellite instability
(MSI), and the absence of specific MMR proteins. In addition to these molecular changes, there are also histologic changes including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, peritumoral lymphocytes, undifferentiated tumor histology, lower uterine segment origin, and synchronous tumors.
Considerations in Risk Assessment and in Identifying a Family History of Breast and Ovarian Cancer Risk
The accuracy and completeness of family histories must be considered when they are used to assess risk.  A reported family history may be erroneous, or a person may be unaware of relatives affected with cancer.  In
addition, small family sizes and premature deaths may limit the information
obtained from a family history.  Breast or ovarian cancer on the
paternal side of the family usually involves more distant relatives than does breast or ovarian cancer on the
maternal side, so information  may be more difficult to obtain.
When self-reported information is compared with independently verified cases, the
sensitivity
of a history of breast cancer is relatively high, at 83% to 97%, but lower for ovarian cancer, at 60%.[
128
,
129
] Additional  limitations of relying on family histories include adoption; families with a small number of women; limited access to family history information; and incidental removal of the uterus, ovaries, and/or fallopian tubes for noncancer indications.  Family histories will evolve; therefore, it is important to update family histories from both parents over time. (Refer to the
Accuracy of the family history
section in  Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling for more information.)
Models for Prediction of Breast and Gynecologic Cancer Risk
Models to predict an individual’s risk of developing breast and/or gynecologic cancer are available.[
130
-
133
]  Risk models are evaluated based on two key metrics:
Calibration
: How well the model predicts what will happen. When calibration statistics are close to 1, this means that the predicted value is similar to the actual value.
Discrimination
: How well the model can differentiate between those with and without the outcome. When only case-control data are available, the discrimination of the model (which is often assessed by measuring the area under the receiver operator curve, AUROC or AUC for short) can be assessed but the calibration cannot. An AUC of 1.0 means that the model has perfect discriminatory accuracy. AUCs closer to 0.50 show that the model is poor at discrimination. Generally, an AUC of 0.80 or higher is good to excellent, while AUCs between 0.70 and 0.80 are poor.
There are several items to consider when using models, including (1) time horizon for the prediction, (2) variables included in the model, and (3) whether models can also predict the probability of carrying a pathogenic variant in breast cancer susceptibility genes like
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
.
Time horizon of models:
Most models can predict an individual's lifetime risk of developing a specific cancer  over a short time horizon (e.g., 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years).  Although some clinical guidelines refer to lifetime risk cutoffs when assessing higher versus lower cancer risks, no model has been validated to predict  full lifetime risk, since that would require following cohorts for a lifetime.[
134
]  Using a shorter time horizon  improved model performance, particularly for women under age 50 years, since many factors for risk models change over time.[
135
] For example, data from a large family-based cohort  (n = 14,657 women; median follow-up of 10 years),  showed that the 5-year incidence for breast cancer almost always had a higher
specificity
(i.e.,  fewer false positives) than that of lifetime risk from birth. For women aged 20 to 39 years, 5-year risk performed better than lifetime risk from birth. For women aged 40 years or older, receiver-operating characteristic curves were similar or superior for 5-year risk than for lifetime risk in multiple breast cancer models.  Classifications based on remaining lifetime risk were inferior to 5-year risk estimates.
Variables included in models:
In addition to a lack of validation for lifetime risk, cancer risk models are limited by the factors added to   the models to help predict risk.  Unlike risk models for diseases with shorter induction times (e.g., cardiovascular disease), cancer's longer induction times   can make updating models  (based on known risk factors) lengthy, since prospective validation is needed to calibrate the models.  Most breast cancer risk models include established reproductive risk factors for breast cancer (e.g., age at menarche, parity, etc.).  Many risk models also include established risk factors like alcohol consumption and body size.  Few risk models assess whether cessation or change in risk factors over time lead to a change in cancer risk.
Prediction of cancer susceptibility genes:
In addition, models can predict an individual’s likelihood of having a pathogenic variant in
BRCA1
,
BRCA2
, or one of the MMR genes associated with Lynch syndrome. Not all models can be  applied to all patients.   Each model is  appropriate only when the patient’s characteristics and family history are similar to those from the study population  the model was based on.  Different models may provide widely varying risk estimates for the same clinical scenario, and validation of these estimates has not been performed for many models.[
131
,
136
,
137
]  For more information, see  the
Models for prediction of the likelihood of a
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variant
section.
Limitations of risk models:
Risk models  only use a subset of risk factors for breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer risk. Additionally, risk models  are limited by moderate discrimination for these cancer types.  Moderate discrimination means that when clinical cutoffs are used to define high- and low-risk individuals (e.g., individuals with >20% lifetime risk are defined as high-risk), people will be misclassified.  This means that there will be both false positives (people at lower risk who follow high-risk protocols) and false negatives (people at higher risk who follow low-risk protocols).
Breast cancer risk assessment models
In general, breast cancer
risk assessment
models are designed for two types of populations: (1) women without pathogenic variants in breast cancer susceptibility genes or strong family histories of breast/ovarian cancer, and (2) women at higher risk because of personal or family histories of breast/ovarian cancer.[
137
] These two types of models require inputs from both prior literature and model development from large epidemiological studies, which include nongenetic risk factors like reproductive history.  Some risk models also include information about prior breast biopsy and mammographic breast density. Only a few models include potentially modifiable factors, like alcohol use and exogenous hormone use.
Models of the first type designed for women (e.g., the Gail model, which is the basis for the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment 
Tool [BCRAT] [
138
], and the Colditz and Rosner model [
139
]) require only limited information about family history (e.g., number of FDRs with breast cancer). Although counting the number of FDRs is simpler to input into a model than the ages of all familial cancer diagnoses, risk may be overestimated in older individuals because  the number of FDRs increases with age.  Family histories of cancer in older individuals are also less predictive of  risk as one ages. Most models of the first type, however, include built-in assumptions about competing risks of other outcomes. These assumptions are particularly important after age 60 years, when risk of other outcomes, like cardiovascular disease, is higher.
Models designed for women at higher risk require more detailed information about personal and family cancer histories of breast and ovarian cancers, including ages at onset of cancer and/or carrier status of specific breast cancer-susceptibility
alleles
. The genetic factors used by the latter models differ, with some assuming one risk
locus
(e.g., the Claus model [
140
]), others assuming two loci (e.g., the International Breast Cancer Intervention Study [IBIS] model [
141
] and the BRCAPRO model [
142
]), and still others assuming an additional polygenic component in addition to multiple loci (e.g., the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm [BOADICEA]/CanRisk model [
143
-
145
]). Prior to formally measuring polygenic risk scores (PRS), the BOADICEA/CanRisk model was the only risk model that captured underlying polygenic risk to explain the variance in risk levels.  Now BOADICEA/CanRisk allows direct PRS inputs.[
146
] However, even with PRS included, as measured by individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), there is still a large portion of the polygenic risk component that is not explained by PRS.
The models also differ in whether they include information about nongenetic risk factors.   Three models (Gail/BCRAT, Pfeiffer,[
133
] and IBIS) include nongenetic risk factors but differ in the risk factors they include (e.g., the Pfeiffer model includes alcohol consumption, whereas the Gail/BCRAT does not).  The BOADICEA/CanRisk model has also been updated to include nongenetic risk factors.[
147
]  The nongenetic risk factors included in these models include age at menarche and reproductive factors (e.g., age at first birth, parity).  Some, but not all, models also include modifiable factors like alcohol consumption.  However,  cancer risk models do not include social determinants of health or environmental/chemical exposures.
Breast cancer risk models have limited the ability to discriminate between individuals who are affected or unaffected with cancer. A model with high discrimination would be close to 1, and a model with little discrimination would be close to 0.5. Model discrimination is rarely above an AUC of 0.70.[
148
]
Existing models  are generally more accurate  in prospective studies that have assessed how well they predict future cancers.[
137
,
149
-
151
]  Risk models now also include PRS and mammographic density.[
146
,
147
,
152
]  For women at higher risk,  an analysis comparing the 10-year performance of the BOADICEA/CanRisk, BRCAPRO, BCRAT, and IBIS models demonstrated that models with more detailed pedigree inclusion were superior—specifically, the BOADICEA/CanRisk and IBIS models.[
153
]
In the United States, the BRCAPRO, Claus,[
140
,
154
] and Gail/BCRAT models [
138
] are still widely used in clinical counseling, although the use of BOADICEA/CanRisk and IBIS models is becoming more common. Risk estimates derived from the models differ for an individual patient. Several other models that include more detailed family history information are also in use and are discussed below.
In addition to statistical and regression-based models, risk-assessment models are being developed based on artificial intelligence (AI), using imaging (primarily from mammography) and other clinical data from the electronic health record. Risk-assessment based on machine learning and AI algorithms (when applied to mammographic images) have produced AUCs in a similar or even higher range than some of the pedigree and regression-based risk models.[
152
]  One such model has been replicated and validated in many different settings and populations (e.g., Mirai model). AI-based models may be advantageous in the future when using a single mammography screening for risk assessment. However, AI-based models cannot yet replace pedigree-based models when determining cancer risk, particularly in younger women and in women without prior mammography imaging.
Additional considerations for clinical use of breast cancer risk assessment models
The Gail model is the basis for the
BCRAT
, a computer program available from the National Cancer Institute by calling the Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237). This version of the Gail model estimates only the risk of invasive breast cancer.  The Gail/BCRAT model has been found to be reasonably accurate at predicting breast cancer risk in women who undergo annual screening mammography; however, reliability varies depending on the cohort studied.[
155
-
160
]   Risk can be overestimated in the following populations:
Women who do not adhere to mammography screening recommendations.[
155
,
156
]
Women in the highest-risk strata (e.g., those with breast cancer family histories, particularly if FDRs are older when diagnosed with breast cancer).[
158
]
The Gail/BCRAT model is valid for women aged 35 years and older. The model was primarily developed for White women.[
159
] Extensions of the Gail model for African American women have been subsequently developed to calibrate risk estimates using data from more than 1,600 African American women with invasive breast cancer and more than 1,600 controls.[
161
] Additionally, extensions of the Gail model have incorporated high-risk
single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) and pathogenic variants; however, no software exists to calculate risk in these extended models.[
162
,
163
] Other risk assessment models incorporating breast density have been developed but are not ready for clinical use.[
164
,
165
]
Generally, the Gail/BCRAT model should not be the sole model used for families with one or more of the following characteristics:
Multiple affected individuals with breast cancer or ovarian cancer (especially when one or more breast cancers are diagnosed before age 50 y).
A woman with both breast and ovarian cancer.
Ashkenazi Jewish
ancestry with at least one case of breast or ovarian cancer (as these families are more likely to have a hereditary cancer susceptibility syndrome).
Commonly used models that incorporate family history include the IBIS, BOADICEA/CanRisk, and BRCAPRO models. The IBIS/Tyrer-Cuzick model incorporates both genetic and nongenetic factors.[
141
] A three-generation pedigree is used to estimate the likelihood that an individual carries either a
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant or a hypothetical low-penetrance gene. In addition, the model incorporates personal risk factors such as mammographic density, parity, body mass index (BMI), height, and age at menarche, first live birth, menopause, and HRT use. Both genetic and nongenetic factors are combined to develop a risk estimate. The BOADICEA/CanRisk model examines family history to estimate breast cancer risk and also incorporates both
BRCA1/BRCA2
and non-
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic risk factors.[
144
] The most important difference between BOADICEA/CanRisk and the other models using information on
BRCA1/BRCA2
is that BOADICEA/CanRisk assumes an additional polygenic component in addition to multiple loci,[
143
-
145
] which is more in line with what is known about the underlying genetics of breast cancer. The BOADICEA/CanRisk model has also been expanded to include additional pathogenic variants, including
CHEK2
,
ATM
, and
PALB2
.[
166
] However, the discrimination and calibration for these models differ significantly when compared in independent samples;[
149
] the IBIS and BOADICEA/CanRisk models are more comparable when estimating risk over a shorter fixed time horizon (e.g., 10 years),[
149
] than when estimating remaining lifetime risk.  As all risk assessment models for cancers are typically validated over a shorter time horizon (e.g., 5 or 10 years), fixed time horizon estimates rather than remaining lifetime risk may be more accurate and useful measures to convey in a clinical setting.
In addition, readily available models that provide information about an individual woman’s risk in relation to  the population-level risk depending on her risk factors may be useful in a clinical setting (e.g.,
Your Disease Risk
).  Although this tool was developed using information about average-risk women and does not calculate AR estimates, it still may be useful when counseling women about cancer prevention.   Risk assessment models are being developed and validated in large cohorts to integrate genetic and nongenetic data, breast density, and other biomarkers.
Although most breast cancer risk models have been shown to be well calibrated overall, model performance can be different for subgroups of women.  In particular, independent, prospective validation of risk models for women who tested negative for
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variants supported that the most commonly used clinical risk models underpredicted risk for this group of women.[
167
]  The performance also differed based on whether the test results of relatives were known. The models also underpredicted risk by 26.3% to 56.7% in women who tested negative but whose relatives had not been tested.
Risk models in older individuals:
As individuals age, the chance to have competing risks from other outcomes increases (e.g., cardiovascular disease).  Some risk models incorporate the concept of competing risk into their calculations (e.g., BCRAT), while others do not (e.g., BOADICEA/CanRisk).  Differences that occur due to competing risk are particularly important to consider, especially in older women with other comorbidities.
Ovarian cancer risk assessment models
Model development for prediction of ovarian cancer risk has been similar to that of breast cancer risk models with pedigree-based models and nonpedigree-based models.
BOADICEA/CanRisk
also can be used to predict ovarian cancer risk over a fixed time interval or an individual's remaining lifetime.  The Rosner and Pfeiffer risk models  were developed without using pedigrees.[
132
,
133
]
   The Rosner model [
132
]
 included age at menopause, age at menarche, oral contraception use, and tubal ligation. The concordance statistic was 0.60 (0.57–0.62).   The Pfeiffer model [
133
]
 included oral contraceptive use, menopausal HRT use, and family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer, with a similar discriminatory power of 0.59 (0.56–0.62).  Although both models were well calibrated, their modest discriminatory power limited their screening potential.  Variations on these regression-based models have  included interaction terms to account for modifications menopause can have on  several ovarian cancer risk factors, including endometriosis, family history of ovarian cancer in an FDR, and breastfeeding.[
168
] AI-based models have been used for risk-stratification in ovarian cancer and other gynecological cancers, but they have not been used to predict risk of cancer onset.[
169
]
Endometrial cancer risk assessment models
Endometrial cancer risk models also can be divided into regression-based models, pedigree-based models, and AI-based models. The Pfeiffer model has been used to predict endometrial cancer risk in the general population.[
133
] For endometrial cancer, the RR model included BMI, menopausal HRT use, menopausal status, age at menopause, smoking status, and OC use. The discriminatory power of the model was 0.68 (0.66–0.70). It overestimated observed endometrial cancers in most subgroups but underestimated disease in women with the highest BMI category, in premenopausal women, and in women taking menopausal HRT for 10 years or more. The Endometrial Cancer Consortium developed a regression-based model using data from 19 case-control studies and validated it in three cohorts.[
170
] This analysis found an AUC with a range of 0.62 to 0.67.
Regression-based models differ from   pedigree-based models, which require detailed information on the number of relatives with cancer, types of cancer, and ages of cancer diagnoses in family members. MMRpredict, PREMM5 (PREdiction Model for gene Mutations), and MMRpro are three quantitative predictive models used to identify individuals who may potentially have Lynch syndrome.[
171
-
173
] MMRpredict incorporates only colorectal cancer patients but does include MSI and immunohistochemistry (IHC) tumor testing results. PREMM5 is an update of PREMM (1,2,6) and includes each of the five genes associated with Lynch syndrome. PREMM5 is a clinical prediction algorithm that estimates the cumulative probability of an individual carrying a germline pathogenic variant in
MLH1
,
MSH2
,
MSH6
,
PMS2
, or
EPCAM
genes. It accounts for other Lynch syndrome–associated tumors but does not include tumor testing results.[
172
] MMRpro incorporates tumor testing and germline testing results, but is more time intensive because it includes affected and unaffected individuals in the risk-quantification process.  All three predictive models are comparable to the traditional Amsterdam and Bethesda criteria in identifying individuals with colorectal cancer who carry MMR gene pathogenic variants.[
174
]
However, because these models were developed and validated in colorectal cancer patients, the discriminative abilities of these models to identify Lynch syndrome are lower among individuals with endometrial cancer than among those with colon cancer.[
175
]
In fact, the sensitivity and specificity of MSI and IHC in identifying carriers of pathogenic variants are considerably higher than the prediction models and support the use of molecular tumor testing to screen for Lynch syndrome in women with endometrial cancer.
AI-based models have been used for risk-stratification and prognosis in endometrial cancer cases, but they have not been used to predict risk of endometrial cancer onset.[
176
]
Models for Predicting the Likelihood of a
BRCA1/BRCA2
Pathogenic Variant
Many models have been developed to predict the probability of identifying germline
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants in individuals or families. These models include those using logistic regression,[
142
,
177
-
182
] genetic models using Bayesian analysis (BRCAPRO and BOADICEA),[
142
,
144
] and empiric observations.[
183
-
188
]
In addition to BOADICEA, BRCAPRO is commonly used for genetic counseling in the clinical setting.  BRCAPRO and BOADICEA predict the probability of being a carrier and produce estimates of breast cancer risk (refer to
Table 1
).  The discrimination and accuracy (factors used to evaluate the  performance of prediction models) of these models are much higher for their ability to report on carrier status than for their ability to predict fixed or remaining lifetime risk.
BOADICEA is a polygenetic model that uses complex
segregation analysis
to examine both breast cancer risk and the probability of having a
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variant.[
144
] Even among experienced providers, the use of prediction models has been shown to increase the power to discriminate which patients are most likely to be carriers of
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants.[
189
,
190
]  Most models do not include other cancers seen in the
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
spectrum, such as pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. Interventions that decrease the likelihood that an individual will develop cancer (such as oophorectomy and mastectomy) may influence the ability to predict
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variant status.[
191
] One study has shown that the prediction models for genetic risk are sensitive to the amount of family history data available and do not perform as well with limited family information.[
192
] BOADICEA is being expanded to incorporate additional risk variants (
genome-wide association studies
[GWAS] and SNVs)  to better predict pathogenic variant status and to improve  the accuracy of  breast cancer and ovarian cancer risk estimates.[
193
]
The performance of the models can vary in specific ethnic groups. The BRCAPRO model appeared to best fit a series of French Canadian families.[
194
] There have been variable results in the performance of the BRCAPRO model among Hispanic individuals,[
195
,
196
] and both the BRCAPRO model and Myriad tables underestimated the proportion of carriers of pathogenic variants in an Asian American population.[
197
] BOADICEA was developed and validated in British women.  Thus, the major models used for both overall risk and genetic risk (
Table 1
) have not been developed or validated in large populations of racially and ethnically diverse women.  Of the commonly used clinical models for assessing genetic risk, only the Tyrer-Cuzick model contains nongenetic risk factors.
The power of several of the models has been compared in different studies.[
198
-
201
] Four breast cancer genetic-risk models, BOADICEA/CanRisk, BRCAPRO, IBIS, and eCLAUS, were evaluated for their diagnostic accuracy in predicting
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants in a cohort of 7,352 German families.[
202
]  The family member with the highest likelihood of carrying a pathogenic variant from each family was screened for
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants.  Carrier probabilities from each model were calculated and compared with the actual variants detected.  BRCAPRO and BOADICEA/CanRisk had significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than IBIS or eCLAUS.  Accuracy for the BOADICEA/CanRisk model was further improved when statuses of the tumor markers ER, PR, and HER2/neu were included in the model. The inclusion of these biomarkers has been shown to improve the performance of BRCAPRO.[

Genetic testing for
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants has been available to the public since 1996.  As more individuals have undergone testing, risk assessment models have improved.  This, in turn, gives providers better data to estimate an individual patient’s risk of carrying a pathogenic variant, but risk assessment continues to be an art.  There are factors that might limit the ability to provide an accurate risk assessment (i.e., small family size, paucity of women, or ethnicity) including the specific circumstances of the individual patient (such as history of disease or risk-reducing surgeries).
Considerations When Conducting Genetic Testing
Indications for hereditary breast and gynecologic cancers genetic testing
Several professional organizations and expert panels—including the American Society of Clinical Oncology,[
208
] the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN),[
209
] the American Society of Human Genetics,[
210
]  the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics,[
211
] the National Society of Genetic Counselors,[
211
] the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force,[
212
] and the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists [
213
] —have developed clinical criteria and practice guidelines that can be helpful to health care providers in identifying individuals who may have a
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variant.
In 2019, the American Society of Breast Surgeons published a recommendation to make genetic testing for “
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
, and
PALB2
, with other genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history” available to all breast cancer patients.[
214
]  This recommendation was based on a study that suggested similar pathogenic variant rates identified through an extended multigene panel in patients with breast cancer who did or did not meet the NCCN guidelines for genetic testing.[
215
]   This study had  important methodologic challenges that need to be considered, including exclusion of participants previously tested, uncertain accuracy of the reported risk criteria for study participants, inclusion of genes with uncertain management guidelines, and difference in the specific genes in which pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified across the two groups.  For example, there was a statistically significant difference between participants who met and who did not meet NCCN criteria in the detection of
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
variants.
Other studies have also found that the NCCN criteria have good sensitivity when predicting
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
variants; however, less is known about many other genes.  For example, one study showed that the NCCN criteria were able to detect 88.9% of the
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
pathogenic variant carriers [
216
] and others have found that, if more than one NCCN criterion is met, then the
positive predictive value
does pass the 10% threshold (e.g., 12% for more than two NCCN criteria).[
217
]
As the cost of genetic testing continues to decrease, there is a need for unbiased evidence to guide indications for testing, including the cost-benefit impact on screening, prevention, and treatment. Efforts to generate less biased evidence include a single institution study of 3,907 unselected women with breast cancer tested for nine breast cancer genes, including
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
,
ATM
,
CDH1
,
CHEK2
,
NF1
,
PALB2
,
PTEN
, and
TP53
.[
218
]  The study assessed the relative performance of NCCN genetic testing criteria as compared with the American Society of Breast Surgeons' recommendation to test all women aged 65 years or younger with breast cancer. The sensitivity of the criteria was defined as the proportion of individuals who met testing criteria and tested positive for a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant of the total population of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant carriers in the study, while the specificity was defined as the proportion of individuals who did not meet testing criteria and tested negative for a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant of the total population of noncarriers in the study. High sensitivity and specificity are both important considerations; however, higher sensitivity leads to lower specificity, so it is important to balance these two factors.
Detection of
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants based on NCCN criteria had a sensitivity of 87% with a specificity of 53.5%; when expanded to the nine genes included in the study, sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 53.2%. When including all women diagnosed with breast cancer at age 65 or younger, the sensitivity to detect
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants increased to 98%, while the specificity dropped to 22%.  Among those who did not meet NCCN criteria, 0.7% had pathogenic or likely pathogenic
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
variants.
Another study to assess frequency of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants among breast cancer patients included a nested case-control study conducted through the WHI cohort among women with (cases) and without (controls) invasive breast cancer. Participants were tested for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ten breast cancer–associated genes, including
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
.[
219
] The prevalence of pathogenic or likely pathogenic
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
variants among those diagnosed with invasive breast cancer before age 65 years was 2.21%, compared with 1.09% among those diagnosed at age 65 years or older. In comparison, the frequency of pathogenic or likely pathogenic
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
variants was 0.22% in the control group. Current genetic testing criteria detect
BRCA
pathogenic variants. Although higher sensitivity is always desired, it is at the expense of specificity. Lower specificity leads to higher costs to achieve one positive genetic test.
Benefits of offering genetic testing at the time of cancer diagnosis
At the time of a new cancer diagnosis, genetic testing for inherited cancer predisposition may guide patient care  including decisions about surgery, chemotherapy and other biologics, and radiation treatment.[
220
,
221
] Among high-risk patients, the option of genetic testing   is an important part of the shared decision-making process regarding cancer treatments at the time of diagnosis. Tools are available to facilitate decision making about genetic testing in this context.[
222
]
Breast cancer diagnosis
Benefits of offering genetic testing at the time of breast cancer diagnosis include, but are not limited to, the following:
Surgery
:  The identification of inherited susceptibility to breast cancer may influence surgical treatment decisions.  As an example, the high risk of a second primary breast cancer among
BRCA
pathogenic variant carriers, particularly those diagnosed at an early age, may influence their decision to choose a bilateral mastectomy (versus a lumpectomy or unilateral/subtotal mastectomy) for surgical treatment of their breast cancer.[
223
]   Discussion of RRSO is indicated,[
224
] and referral to a gynecologic provider may be considered.
Chemotherapy and other biologics
:  Medical treatments may be guided by the identification of a pathogenic variant in an inherited cancer predisposing gene.  As an example, among
BRCA
pathogenic variant carriers, breast cancer treatment may include the use of platinum-based agents.[
225
]  Furthermore, novel agents such as PARP inhibitors may be used in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.[
226
]
Radiation therapy
:  Decisions about the use of radiation treatment may be guided by the presence of a pathogenic variant in an inherited breast cancer
susceptibility gene
.  In particular, the poorer wound healing in irradiated breasts is an important consideration for those who may consider risk-reducing mastectomy with reconstruction.  As an example, individuals with a pathogenic variant in
TP53
may experience higher risks from radiation, including increased risks for subsequent new cancers.[
227
,
228
]  Thus, identification of
TP53
carriers in the context of an active breast cancer diagnosis may influence radiation treatment decisions and reconstruction options.
Ovarian cancer diagnosis
Benefits of offering genetic testing at the time of ovarian cancer diagnosis include, but are not limited to, the following:
Surgery
:  In most cases, the decision for ovarian cancer surgery is made on the basis of an adnexal mass or abdominal symptoms. When possible, considering the likelihood of a heritable genetic variant at the time of diagnosis may add value to surgical decision-making. The identification of inherited susceptibility to ovarian/fallopian tube cancer may influence surgical treatment decisions. For a questionable adnexal mass in a younger woman who is at risk of carrying a pathogenic variant of a highly penetrant ovarian cancer gene, knowledge of this information may help guide a decision for risk-reducing or therapeutic surgery.[
229
,
230
] For women who may be considering fertility preservation surgery, genetic knowledge may motivate consideration of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and in the case of carriers of
BRCA1
pathogenic variants, a more detailed discussion regarding aggressive uterine cancer risk.
Chemotherapy and other biologics
:  First-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer still relies on a backbone of platinum and taxane chemotherapy. Current treatment options for optimally resected stage III ovarian carcinoma include intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, dose-dense IV chemotherapy, and a combination of IV paclitaxel plus intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin, followed by IP paclitaxel 1 week later. Carriers of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants are considered more platinum sensitive, with longer progression-free survival times compared with
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
wild-type patients,[
231
,
232
] so it is unclear whether a particular treatment strategy is driven more by antiangiogenesis effects, peritoneal dose intensity, or platinum dose intensity. The advent of  PARP as a biologic target (in combination with chemotherapy or as maintenance) may also increase the armory of first-line treatment of ovarian cancer.[
233
] (Refer to the
Ovarian Cancer Treatment Strategies
section  in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management for more information about PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer treatment.)
Endometrial cancer diagnosis
Benefits of offering genetic testing at the time of endometrial cancer diagnosis include, but are not limited to, the following:
Surgery
: The most common treatment for a newly diagnosed endometrial cancer includes hysterectomy with removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes, as well as assessment of lymph nodes.[
234
] An exception to this practice might apply to a younger woman who wishes to retain fertility or retain her adnexa. IHC of endometrial sampling may allow for an assessment of the likelihood of a heritable genetic variant at the time of diagnosis, which may add value to the surgical decision-making process. For a young woman who is found to have Lynch syndrome, knowledge of this information may help guide a decision for hormonal management of endometrial cancer to allow future childbearing, or RRSO if her risk of ovarian cancer is deemed high enough on the basis of a specific genetic variant. For a young woman who is found to carry a pathogenic variant in
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
, or one of the other homologous recombination deficiencies increasing ovarian cancer risk, she may wish to decide between salpingo-oophorectomy or, at least, salpingectomy.
Chemotherapy and other biologics
: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are now approved for use in endometrial cancers that have MSI or MMR deficiency.[
235
] While MSI and MMR status can be assessed at either the time of diagnosis or recurrent disease, it may be beneficial to perform tumor testing at diagnosis with the primary pathology processing, usually at the time of hysterectomy.
Multigene (panel) testing
Since the availability of
next-generation sequencing
and the Supreme Court of the United States ruling that human genes cannot be patented, several clinical laboratories now offer genetic testing through multigene panels at a cost comparable to that of single-gene testing. Even testing for
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
is a limited panel test of two genes. Approximately 25% of all ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancers are caused by a heritable genetic condition. Of these, about one-quarter (6% of all ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancers) are caused by genes other than
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
, including many genes associated with the Fanconi anemia pathway or otherwise involved with homologous recombination.[
236
]

 In a population of ovarian cancer patients who test negative for
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants, multigene panel testing can reveal actionable pathogenic variants.[
237
-
239
]
In general, multigene panel testing increases the yield of non-
BRCA
pathogenic variants across a variety of populations.[
221
,
240
-
242
] In an unselected population of breast cancer patients, the prevalence of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants was 6.1%,  while the prevalence of pathogenic variants in  other breast/ovarian cancer–predisposing genes was 4.6%.[
243
] In an unselected population of endometrial cancer patients, the prevalence of Lynch syndrome pathogenic variants (
MLH1
,
MSH2
,
EPCAM-MSH2
,
MSH6
, and
PMS2
) was 5.8%; the prevalence of pathogenic variants in other actionable genes was 3.4%.[
108
] Similarly, in a study of 35,409 women with breast cancer tested with the Myriad 25-gene panel, a pathogenic variant was found in 9.3% of women.[
244
] Among that 9.3%, 48.5% of the women carried a pathogenic variant in
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
. The majority of other breast cancer genes with pathogenic variants identified included
CHEK2
(11.7%),
ATM
(9.7%), and
PALB2
(9.3%). The prevalence of pathogenic variants in the other breast cancer genes on the panel ranged from 0.05% to 0.31%. Pathogenic variants in Lynch syndrome genes accounted for 7.0% of variants identified; 3.7% were found in other genes included in the panel. The rate of pathogenic variants was higher in women with  TNBC diagnosed before age 40 years. A similar trend of identifying pathogenic variants in non-
BRCA
susceptibility genes in male breast cancer patients has also been described.[
245
] In two studies of women who had previously tested negative for
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
, reflex testing with a multigene panel identified pathogenic variants in additional genes among 8% to 11% of cases.[
246
,
247
] In a study of 77,085 patients with breast cancer and 6,001 patients with ovarian cancer, 24.1% and 30.9% had genetic testing, respectively.  Of those tested, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 7.8% of patients with breast cancer and 14.5% of patients with ovarian cancer. Prevalent non-
BRCA
pathogenic variants identified in patients with breast cancer included
CHEK2
(1.6%),
PALB2
(1.0%),
ATM
(0.7%), and
NBN
(0.4%). In patients with ovarian cancer, non-
BRCA
pathogenic variants included
CHEK2
(1.4%),
BRIP1
(0.9%),
MSH2
(0.8%), and
ATM
(0.6%).[
248
] The potential utility of genetic testing in patients with ovarian tumors of all histologies was suggested in a study using a 32-gene panel that found 13.2% of 4,439 tumors harbored a pathogenic variant. Rates were highest among those with serous ovarian carcinoma (14.7%), although likely pathogenic variants were also seen in those with other histologies (borderline, germ cell, and sex cord stromal tumors), the significance of which is unclear to clinical management or etiology of disease.[
249
]
Multi-gene panel testing was conducted as part of two large efforts led by the worldwide Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) [
250
]  and the United States–based CARRIERS consortium.[
251
] The BCAC study tested 113,927 women  for 34 inherited cancer genes, while the CARRIERS study  tested 64,791 women for 28 hereditary cancer genes. In both studies, significant associations were reported between  eight genes and breast cancer development (
BRCA1
,
BRCA2
,
PALB2
,
BARD1
,
RAD51C
,
RAD51D
,
ATM
, and
CHEK2
). Associations were only reported between
MSH6
and breast cancer development in the BCAC study. Similarly, associations were only reported between
CDH1
and breast cancer development  in the CARRIERS study. Both
TP53
and
PTEN
(which are established breast cancer risk genes that are linked to early-onset disease) were not significantly associated with breast cancer development in these studies. This is presumably because
TP53
and
PTEN
pathogenic variants are very rare.
NCCN recommends that women  diagnosed with TNBC  undergo
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
,
CDH1
,
PALB2
,
PTEN
,
STK11
, and
TP53
testing to guide treatment decisions at any age.[
209
]  A large study utilizing multigene (panel) testing comprising two separate cohorts reported that, in addition to
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
genes, six other breast cancer susceptibility genes were also related to a higher risk of TNBC.  Specifically, pathogenic variants in
BARD1
,
PALB2
, and
RAD51D
, in addition to
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
, were each associated with more than a fivefold increase in breast cancer.[
252
]  Pathogenic variants in three other genes —
BRIP1
,
RAD51C
, and
TP53
— were each associated with an increased TNBC risk of more than twofold.  Pathogenic variants in these eight genes were reported in 12% of the TNBC cases (8.3%
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
, 3.7% non-
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
).   The study was conducted in a clinical testing cohort of 140,449 individuals (8,753 TNBC cases) who received genetic testing using a 21-gene panel (sample A).  In addition, a second sample (sample B) examined gene frequency rates in a pooled consortium of 2,143 individuals using a 17-gene panel.  The overall frequency of pathogenic variants in the 21 genes examined in sample A was 14.4% (8.4%
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
, 6.0% non-
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
).  The two samples had very consistent findings with respect to the risk estimates despite differences in age, race, ethnicity, and family history of cancer with sample A being younger, more racially and ethnically diverse, and more likely to have a family history of cancer.   The pathogenic variant frequency detection in these 21 genes was also similar for White individuals (14% overall, 7.8%
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
, 6.2% non-
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
) and African American individuals (14.6% overall,  9.0%
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
, 5.6% non-
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
).
Multi-gene panel testing studies were conducted in women from the United States who had African ancestry, and results showed that certain genes were associated with increased breast cancer risk in this population. These genes were similar to the breast cancer risk genes found in individuals from the United States with European ancestry. A case-control study of 10,047 women with African ancestry found a pathogenic variant frequency of 10.3% in those with ER-negative breast cancer, 5.2% in those with ER-positive breast cancer, and 2.3% in  those without breast cancer.
BRCA1
(OR, 47),
BRCA2
(OR, 7.25) and
PALB2
(OR, 8.54) were associated with the highest breast cancer risks.[
253
] High ER-negative breast cancer risk was reported in individuals with pathogenic variants in
RAD51D
(OR, 7.82), while moderate ER-positive breast cancer risk was reported in individuals with pathogenic variants in
CHEK2
,
ATM
,
ERCC3
, and
FANCC
. Similarly, a case-control study of 3,286 women with African ancestry found significant associations between breast cancer risk and pathogenic variants in the following genes:
BRCA1
,
BRCA2
,
PALB2
,
ATM
,
CHEK2
,
TP53
,
NF1
,
RAD51C
, and
RAD51D
.[

There are caveats of multigene testing. Genes identified as part of multigene panel testing can be associated with varied breast cancer risk or confer no known risk.[
239
] There is also the possibility of finding a
variant of uncertain significance
(VUS). Even within a given gene, there may be differential risks on the basis of specific pathogenic variants.[
255
] A large population-based retrospective study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data from Georgia and Los Angeles, California, found that multigene testing led to a twofold increase in the detection of pathogenic variants compared with
BRCA
-only testing in women with breast cancer.[
256
]  VUS rates, however, were tenfold higher in the multigene panels, especially in African American women (44.5%) and Asian women (50.9%).  Many centers now offer a multigene panel test instead of just
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
testing if there is a concerning family history of syndromes other than hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, or more importantly, to gain as much genetic information as possible with one test, particularly if there may be insurance limitations.
(Refer to the
Multigene [panel] testing
section in Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling for more information about multigene testing, including genetic education and counseling considerations and research examining the use of multigene testing.)

[PUBMED Abstract]
Penetrance of Inherited Susceptibility to Hereditary Breast and/or Gynecologic Cancers
The proportion of individuals carrying a
pathogenic variant
who will manifest a certain disease is referred to as
penetrance
. In general, common
genetic variants
that are associated with cancer susceptibility have a lower penetrance than rare genetic variants. This is depicted in
Figure 4
. For adult-onset diseases, penetrance is usually described by the individual
carrier's
age, sex, and organ site. For example, the penetrance for breast cancer in female carriers of
BRCA1
pathogenic variants is often quoted by age 50 years and by age 70 years. Of the numerous methods for estimating penetrance, none are without potential biases, and determining an individual carrier's risk of cancer involves some level of imprecision.

Figure 4.  Genetic architecture of cancer risk. This graph depicts the general finding of a low relative risk associated with common, low-penetrance genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies, and a higher relative risk associated with rare, high-penetrance genetic variants, such as pathogenic variants in the
BRCA1/BRCA2
genes associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and the mismatch repair genes associated with Lynch syndrome.
Throughout this summary, we discuss studies that report on relative and absolute risks (ARs).  These are two important but different concepts.  Relative risk (RR) refers to an estimate of risk relative to another group (e.g., risk of an outcome like breast cancer for women who are exposed to a risk factor
relative
to the risk of breast cancer for women who are unexposed to the same risk factor). RR measures that are greater than 1 mean that the risk for those captured in the numerator (i.e., the exposed) is higher than the risk for those captured in the denominator (i.e., the unexposed).  RR measures that are less than 1 mean that the risk for those captured in the numerator (i.e., the exposed) is lower than the risk for those captured in the denominator (i.e., the unexposed).  Measures with similar relative interpretations include the odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio, and risk ratio.
AR measures consider the number of people who have a particular outcome, the number of people in a population who could have the outcome, and person-time (the period of time during which an individual was at risk of having the outcome). AR measures also reflect the absolute burden of an outcome in a population.  Absolute measures include risks and rates and can be expressed over a specific time frame (e.g., 1 year, 5 years) or overall lifetime. Cumulative risk is a measure of risk that occurs over a defined time period.  For example, overall lifetime risk is a type of cumulative risk that is usually calculated on the basis of a given life expectancy (e.g., 80 or 90 years). Cumulative risk can also be presented over other time frames (e.g., up to age 50 years).
Large RR measures do not mean that there will be large effects in the actual number of individuals at a population level because the disease outcome may be quite rare.  For example, the RR for smoking is much higher for lung cancer than for heart disease, but the absolute difference between smokers and nonsmokers is greater for heart disease, the more-common outcome, than for lung cancer, the more-rare outcome.
Therefore, in evaluating the effect of exposures and biological markers on disease prevention across the continuum, it is important to recognize the differences between relative and absolute effects in weighing the overall impact of a given risk factor. For example, the magnitude is in the range of 30% (e.g., ORs or RRs of 1.3) for many breast cancer risk factors, which means that women with a risk factor (e.g., alcohol consumption, late age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal body size) have a 30% relative increase in breast cancer in comparison with what they would have if they did not have that risk factor.  But the absolute increase in risk is based on the underlying AR of disease.
Figure 5
and
Table 2
show the impact of a RR factor in the range of 1.3 on AR. As shown, women with a family history of breast cancer have a much higher benefit from risk factor reduction on an absolute scale.[

With the increasing use of
multigene panel tests
, a framework for cancer risk management among individuals with pathogenic variants detected in novel
genes
has been described [
2
] that incorporates data on age-specific, lifetime, and absolute cancer risks. The framework suggests initiating screening  in these individuals at the age when their 5-year cancer risk approaches that at which screening is routinely initiated for women in the general population (approximately 1% for breast cancer in the United States). As a result, the age at which to begin screening will vary depending on the gene. (Refer to the
Multigene [panel] testing
section of this summary for more information on multigene panel tests.)

Lynch Syndrome
Lynch syndrome is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance of susceptibility to predominantly right-sided colon cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and other extracolonic cancers (including cancer of the renal pelvis, ureter, small bowel, and pancreas), multiple primary cancers, and a young age of onset of cancer.[
1
]  The condition is caused by germline variants in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes, which are involved in repair of DNA mismatch variants.[
2
]  The
MLH1
and
MSH2
genes are the most common susceptibility genes for Lynch syndrome, accounting for 80% to 90% of observed pathogenic variants,[
3
,
4
] followed by
MSH6
and
PMS2
.[
5
-
10
] (Refer to the
Lynch Syndrome
section in  Genetics of Colorectal Cancer for more information about this syndrome.)
After colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer is the second hallmark cancer of a family with Lynch syndrome. Even in the original Family G, described by Dr. Aldred Scott Warthin, numerous family members were noted to have extracolonic cancers including endometrial cancer. Although the first version of the Amsterdam criteria did not include endometrial cancer,[
11
] in 1999, the Amsterdam criteria were revised to include endometrial cancer as extracolonic tumors associated with Lynch syndrome to identify families at risk.[
12
] In addition, the Bethesda guidelines in 1997 (revised in 2004) did include endometrial and ovarian cancers as Lynch syndrome–related cancers to prompt tumor testing for Lynch syndrome.[
13
,
14
]
The lifetime risk of ovarian carcinoma in females with Lynch syndrome is estimated to be as high as 12%, and the reported relative risk (RR) of ovarian cancer has ranged from 3.6 to 13, based on families ascertained from high-risk clinics with known or suspected Lynch syndrome.[
15
-
20
] There may be differences in ovarian cancer risk depending on the Lynch syndrome–associated pathogenic variant. In
PMS2
-associated Lynch syndrome, one study of 284 families was unable to identify an increased risk of ovarian cancer.[
21
] Another prospective registry of 3,119 Lynch syndrome–pathogenic variant carriers described the cumulative risk of ovarian cancer to range from 10% to 17% in
MLH1
,
MSH2
, and
MSH6
carriers. In contrast, 0 of 67 women with a pathogenic variant in
PMS2
developed ovarian cancer in 303 follow-up years.[
22
] Overall, there are too few cases of
PMS2
pathogenic variant carriers to make definitive recommendations for ovarian cancer management. Characteristics of Lynch syndrome–associated ovarian cancers may include overrepresentation of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  stages I and II at diagnosis (reported as 81.5%), underrepresentation of serous subtypes (reported as 22.9%), and a better 10-year survival (reported as 80.6%) than reported both in population-based series and in carriers of
BRCA
pathogenic variants.[
23
,
24
]
The issue of breast cancer risk in Lynch syndrome has been controversial.
Retrospective studies have been inconsistent, but several have demonstrated microsatellite instability in a proportion of breast cancers from individuals with Lynch syndrome;[
25
-
28
] one of these studies evaluated breast cancer risk in individuals with Lynch syndrome and found that it is not elevated.[
28
] However, the largest prospective study to date of 446 unaffected carriers of pathogenic variants from the Colon Cancer Family Registry [
29
] who were followed for up to 10 years reported an elevated SIR of 3.95 for breast cancer (95% CI, 1.59–8.13;
P
= .001).[
29
] The same group subsequently analyzed data on 764 carriers of MMR gene pathogenic variants with a prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer.  Results showed that  the 10-year risk of breast cancer following colorectal cancer was 2% (95% CI, 1%–4%) and that the SIR was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.07–2.59).[
30
] A series from the United Kingdom composed of clinically referred Lynch syndrome kindreds, with efforts to correct for ascertainment, showed a twofold increased risk of breast cancer in 157
MLH1
carriers but not in carriers of  other MMR variants.[
31
] Results from a meta-analysis of breast cancer risk in Lynch syndrome among 15 studies with molecular tumor testing results revealed that 62 of 122 breast cancers (51%; 95% CI, 42%–60%) in MMR pathogenic variant carriers were MMR-deficient. In addition, breast cancer risk estimates among a total of 21 studies showed an increased risk of twofold to 18-fold in eight studies that compared MMR variant carriers with noncarriers, while 13 studies did not observe statistical evidence for an association of breast cancer risk with Lynch syndrome.[
32
]
A number of subsequent studies have suggested the presence of higher breast cancer risks than previously published,[
33
-
36
] although this has not been consistently observed.[
37
] Through a study of 325 Canadian families with Lynch syndrome, primarily encompassing
MLH1
and
MSH2
carriers, the lifetime cumulative risk for breast cancer among
MSH2
carriers was reported to be 22%.[
33
]  Similarly, breast cancer risks were elevated in a study of 423 women with Lynch syndrome, with substantially higher risks among those with
MSH6
and
PMS2
pathogenic variants, compared with
MLH1
and
MSH2
pathogenic variants.[
34
] In fact, breast cancer risk to age 60 years was 37.7% for
PMS2
, 31.1% for
MSH6
, 16.1% for
MSH2
, and 15.5% for
MLH1
.  These findings are consistent with another study of 528 patients with Lynch syndrome–associated pathogenic variants (including
MLH1
,
MSH2
,
MSH6
,
PMS2
, and
EPCAM
) in which
PMS2
and
MSH6
variants were much more frequent among patients with only breast cancer, compared with those with only colorectal cancer (
P
= 2.3 x 10
-5
).[
35
]
Additional data to support an association of
MSH6
with breast cancer were provided through a study of over 10,000 cancer patients across the United States who had genetic testing.[
36
]  Findings indicated that
MSH6
was associated with breast cancer with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.59 (95% CI, 1.35–5.44). Taken together, these studies highlight how the risk profile among patients with Lynch syndrome is continuing to evolve as more individuals are tested through multigene panel testing, with representation of larger numbers of individuals with
PMS2
and
MSH6
pathogenic variants compared with prior studies.
In the absence of definitive risk estimates, individuals with Lynch syndrome are screened for breast cancer on the basis of family history.[
38
]
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS)
Breast cancer is also a component of the rare LFS, in
which germline variants of the
TP53
gene on chromosome 17p have been
documented.  Located on chromosome 17p,
TP53
encodes a 53kd nuclear phosphoprotein that binds
DNA sequences and functions as a negative regulator of cell growth and
proliferation in the setting of DNA damage.  It  is also an
active component of programmed cell death.[
39
]  Inactivation of the
TP53
gene
or disruption of the protein product is thought to allow the persistence of
damaged DNA and the possible development of malignant cells.[
40
,
41
] Widely used clinical diagnostic criteria for LFS were originally developed by Chompret et al. in 2001 (called the
Chompret Criteria
) [
42
] and revised in 2009 based on additional emerging data.[
43
]
LFS  is characterized by premenopausal breast cancer
in combination with childhood sarcoma, brain tumors, leukemia, and
adrenocortical carcinoma.[
40
,
44
,
45
]
Germline variants in
TP53
are thought to account for fewer than 1% of breast cancer cases.[
46
]
TP53
-associated breast cancer is often human epidermal growth factor receptor two (HER2/neu)–positive, in addition to being estrogen receptor (ER)–positive,  progesterone receptor (PR)–positive, or both.[
47
-
49
] Evidence
also exists that patients treated for a
TP53
-related tumor with chemotherapy or
radiation therapy may be at risk of a treatment-related second malignancy.
Historical criteria for defining LFS
The term LFS was used for the first time in 1982,[
50
] and the following criteria, which subsequently  became the classical definition of the syndrome, were proposed by Li and Fraumeni in 1988 [
51
]:
Sarcoma before age 45 years;
A first-degree relative (FDR) with cancer before age 45 years; AND
Another close relative (FDR or second-degree relative [SDR]) with either cancer before age 45 years or a sarcoma at any age.
Subsequently in 2001, Chompret et al. [
42
] systematically developed clinical criteria for recommending
TP53
genetic testing, with the narrow LFS tumor spectrum defined as sarcoma, brain tumors, breast cancer, and adrenocortical carcinoma.  The criteria were as follows:
A proband affected by a narrow-spectrum tumor before age 36 years AND at least one FDR or SDR affected by a narrow-spectrum tumor (other than breast cancer if the proband is affected by breast cancer) before age 46 years or multiple primary tumors; OR
A proband with multiple primary tumors, two of which belong to the narrow spectrum and the first of which occurred before age 36 years, irrespective of family history; OR
A proband with adrenocortical carcinoma irrespective of the age at onset and family history.
These criteria were revised in 2009 [
43
] based on additional emerging data [
41
,
52
] as follows:
A proband with a tumor belonging to the LFS tumor spectrum* before age 46 years AND at least one FDR or SDR with an LFS tumor (except breast cancer if proband has breast cancer) before age 56 years or with multiple tumors; OR
A proband with multiple tumors (except multiple breast tumors), two of which belong to the LFS tumor spectrum and the first of which occurred before age 46 years; OR
A patient with adrenocortical carcinoma or choroid plexus, irrespective of family history.
*The 2009 Chompret criteria defined the LFS tumor spectrum as including the following cancers: soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, brain tumor, premenopausal breast cancer, adrenocortical carcinoma, leukemia, and lung bronchoalveolar cancer.
In 2015, Bougeard et al. [
45
] revised the criteria based on data from 415 carriers of pathogenic variants, to include the presence of childhood anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer before age 31 years  as an indication for testing, similar to what is recommended for choroid plexus carcinoma and adrenocortical carcinoma.  The criteria were revised as follows:
A proband with a tumor belonging to the LFS tumor spectrum** before age 46 years AND at least one FDR or SDR with LFS tumor (except breast cancer if proband has breast cancer) before age 56 years or with multiple tumors; OR
A proband with multiple tumors (except multiple breast tumors), two of which belong to the LFS tumor spectrum and the first of which occurred before age 46 years; OR
A patient with adrenocortical carcinoma, choroid plexus tumor, or rhabdomyosarcoma of embryonal anaplastic subtype, irrespective of family history; OR
Breast cancer before age 31 years.
**The 2015 Chompret criteria defined the LFS tumor spectrum as including the following cancers:  premenopausal breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumor, and adrenocortical carcinoma.
Clinical characteristics of LFS
Germline
TP53
pathogenic variants were identified in 17% (n = 91) of 525 samples submitted to City of Hope laboratories for clinical
TP53
testing.[
41
] All families with a
TP53
pathogenic variant had at least one family member with a sarcoma, breast cancer, brain cancer, or adrenocortical cancer (core cancers). In addition, all eight individuals with a choroid plexus tumor had a
TP53
pathogenic variant, as did 14 of the 21 individuals with childhood adrenocortical cancer. In women aged 30 to 49 years who had breast cancer but no family history of other core cancers, no
TP53
variants were found.
Subsequently, a large clinical series of patients from France who were tested primarily based on the 2009 version of the Chompret criteria [
43
]

 included 415 carriers of pathogenic variants from 214 families.[
45
]  In this study, 43% of carriers had multiple malignancies, and the mean age at first tumor onset was 24.9 years.  The childhood tumor spectrum was characterized by osteosarcomas,  adrenocortical carcinomas, CNS tumors, and soft tissue sarcomas (present in 23%–30% collectively), whereas the adult tumor spectrum primarily encompassed breast cancer (79% of females) and soft tissue sarcomas (27% of carriers).  The
TP53
pathogenic variant detection rate was 6% among females younger than 31 years with breast cancer  and no additional features suggestive of LFS.  Evaluation of genotype-phenotype correlations indicated a gradient of clinical severity, with a significantly lower mean age at onset among those with dominant-negative missense variants (21.3 years), compared with those with all types of loss-of-function variants (28.5 years) or genomic rearrangements (35.8 years).  With the exception of adrenocortical carcinoma, affected children mostly harbored dominant-negative missense pathogenic variants.   Among 127 female carriers of pathogenic variants with breast cancer, 31% developed contralateral breast cancer (CBC).  Receptor status information was available for 40 tumors, which indicated 55% were HER2-positive, and 37% were triple-positive (i.e., ER-positive, PR-positive, and HER2-positive).   There was an exceptionally high rate of multiple malignancies (43%) among carriers of pathogenic variants, of which 83% were metachronous.  Treatment records were available for 64 carriers who received radiation therapy for treatment of their first tumor; of these, 19 (30%) developed 26 secondary tumors within a radiation field, with a latency of 2 to 26 years (mean, 10.7 y).
Similarly, results of 286
TP53
pathogenic variant–positive individuals in the National Cancer Institute’s LFS Study indicated a cumulative cancer incidence of almost 100% by age 70 years for both males and females.[
53
] They reported substantial variations by sex, age, and cancer type.  Specifically, cumulative cancer incidence reached 50% by age 31 years in females and age 46 years in males, although male risks were higher in childhood and late adulthood.  Cumulative cancer incidence by sex for the top four cancers is included in
Table 4
.  Of those with one cancer, 49% developed at least one additional cancer after a median of 10 years.  Age-specific risks for developing first and second cancers were comparable.

are unexpectedly being identified in individuals without a family history characteristic of LFS.[

pathogenic variant in an individual or family who does not meet the Chompret criteria is uncertain. Consequently, it remains important to interpret cancer risks and determine optimal management strategies for individuals who are unexpectedly found to have a germline
TP53
pathogenic variant, while considering their personal and family histories.
One cohort study evaluated 116 individuals with a germline
TP53
pathogenic variant yearly at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center using multimodality screening with and without gadolinium. Baseline screening identified a cancer in eight patients (6.9%) with a false-positive rate of 34.5% for MRI (n = 40).[
55
] Breast cancer screening  with annual breast MRI with and without contrast is recommended.[
56
] Additional screening for other cancers has been studied and is evolving.[

PTEN
Hamartoma Tumor Syndromes (Including Cowden Syndrome)
Cowden syndrome and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS) are part of a spectrum of conditions known collectively as
PTEN
hamartoma tumor syndromes (PHTS). Approximately 85% of patients diagnosed with Cowden syndrome, and  approximately 60% of patients with BRRS have an identifiable
PTEN
pathogenic variant.[
59
] In addition,
PTEN
pathogenic variants have been identified in patients with very diverse clinical phenotypes.[
60
] The term PHTS refers to any patient with a
PTEN
pathogenic variant, irrespective of clinical presentation.
PTEN
functions as a dual-specificity phosphatase that removes phosphate groups from tyrosine, serine, and threonine.
PTEN
pathogenic variants are diverse and can present as
nonsense
, missense,
frameshift
, or
splice-site variants
. Approximately 40% of variants are found in exon 5, which encodes the phosphatase core motif; several recurrent pathogenic variants have been observed at this location.[
61
] Pathogenic variants in the 5’ end of
PTEN
or within the phosphatase core of
PTEN
tend to affect more organ systems.[
62
]
Operational criteria for the diagnosis of Cowden syndrome have been published and subsequently updated.[
63
,
64
] These include major,  minor, and
pathognomonic
criteria that consist of certain mucocutaneous manifestations and adult-onset dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum (Lhermitte-Duclos disease).   An updated set of criteria based on a systematic literature review has been suggested  [
65
]   and is currently utilized in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.[
66
] Contrary to previous criteria, the authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any features to be classified as pathognomonic. Increased genetic testing (especially
multigene panels
) has identified individuals with germline
PTEN
pathogenic variants who do not meet  diagnostic criteria for PHTS. Diagnostic criteria will need to be reconciled with these recently discovered phenotypes. Hence, it is unclear whether PHTS diagnoses should be based on clinical features or a positive
PTEN
genetic test result. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) suggests that referral for genetics consultation be considered for individuals with a personal history of or a first-degree relative with the following: 1) adult-onset Lhermitte-Duclos disease or 2) any three of the major or minor criteria that have been established for the diagnosis of Cowden syndrome.[
67
] Detailed recommendations, including
diagnostic criteria
for Cowden syndrome, can be found in the NCCN and ACMG guidelines.[
66
,
67
] Additionally, a predictive
model
that uses clinical criteria to estimate the probability of a
PTEN
pathogenic variant is available; a cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that germline
PTEN
testing is cost effective if the probability of a variant is greater than 10%.[
68
]
Over a 10-year period, the International Cowden Consortium (ICC)  prospectively recruited a consecutive series of adult and pediatric patients meeting relaxed ICC criteria for
PTEN
testing in  the United States, Europe, and Asia.[
69
] Most individuals did not meet the clinical criteria for a diagnosis of Cowden syndrome or BRRS. Of the 3,399 individuals recruited and tested, 295 probands (8.8%) and an additional 73 family members carried a germline
PTEN
pathogenic variant.  The authors concluded that melanoma, kidney cancer, and colorectal cancer should be added to the spectrum of cancers associated with
PTEN
germline pathogenic variants (in addition to breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and endometrial cancer). This conclusion was based on the high melanoma, kidney, and colorectal cancer lifetime risk estimates found in individuals with
PTEN
pathogenic variants. A second study of approximately 100 patients with a germline
PTEN
pathogenic variant confirmed these findings and suggested a cumulative cancer risk of 85% by age 70 years.[
70
]
Although
PTEN
pathogenic variants, which are estimated to occur in 1 in 200,000 individuals,[
63
] account for a small fraction of hereditary
breast cancer, the characterization of PTEN function will provide valuable
insights into the signal pathway and the maintenance of normal cell
physiology.[
63
,
71
]  Lifetime breast cancer risk is estimated to be between 25% and 50% among women with Cowden syndrome.[
72
] Other studies have reported risks as high as 85%;[
69
,
70
,
73
,
74
] however, there are concerns regarding selection bias in these studies. As in
other forms of hereditary breast cancer, onset is often at a young age and may
be bilateral.[
75
]  Lifetime risk of endometrial cancer is estimated to be between 19% and 28%, depending on the cohort studied, with an increased risk of premenopausal onset.[
69
,
70
,
76
] Because of the low prevalence of
PTEN
pathogenic variants in the population, the proportion of endometrial cancer attributable to Cowden syndrome is small. There are no data that link
PTEN
pathogenic variants to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Skin manifestations include multiple trichilemmomas, oral
fibromas and papillomas, and acral, palmar, and plantar keratoses.  History or
observation of the characteristic skin features raises a suspicion of Cowden
syndrome.  CNS manifestations include macrocephaly, developmental delay, and dysplastic gangliocytomas of the cerebellum.[

Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS)
PJS is an early-onset autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by melanocytic macules on the lips, the perioral region, and buccal region;
and multiple GI polyps, both hamartomatous and
adenomatous.[
79
-
81
]  Germline pathogenic variants in the
STK11
gene at chromosome 19p13.3 have been identified in the vast majority of PJS families.[
82
-
86
]  GI cancers (including colorectal adenocarcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, small intestinal adenocarcinoma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma) are  some of the most common malignancies seen in individuals with PJS. PJS also increases the risk of developing cancers in other organs.  For example, the cumulative risks have been estimated to be 32% to 54% for breast cancer [
87
-
89
] and 21% for ovarian cancer (mainly ovarian sex-cord tumors).[
87
] The risk of developing pancreatic cancer in individuals with PJS is estimated to be more than 100-fold higher than that of the general population (although these statistics are  based on calculations from a small number of individuals with PJS).[
87
] A systematic review found a lifetime cumulative cancer risk, all sites combined, of up to 93% in patients with PJS.[
87
,
90
]
Table 5
shows the cumulative risk of these tumors.
Females with PJS are also predisposed to the development of cervical adenoma malignum, a rare and very aggressive adenocarcinoma of the cervix.[
91
] In addition, females with PJS commonly develop benign ovarian sex-cord tumors with annular tubules, whereas males with PJS are predisposed to development of Sertoli-cell testicular tumors;[
92
] although neither of these two tumor types is malignant, they can cause symptoms related to increased estrogen production.
Although the risk of malignancy appears to be exceedingly high in individuals with PJS based on the published literature, the possibility that selection and referral biases have resulted in overestimates of these risks should be considered.

PJS is caused by pathogenic variants in the
STK11
(also called
LKB1
) tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 19p13.[
83
,
84
]  Unlike the adenomas seen in familial adenomatous polyposis, the polyps arising in PJS are hamartomas. Studies of the hamartomatous polyps and cancers of PJS show allelic imbalance (LOH) consistent with the two-hit hypothesis, demonstrating that
STK11
is a tumor suppressor gene.[
95
,
96
] However, heterozygous
STK11
knockout mice develop hamartomas without inactivation of the remaining wild-type allele, suggesting that
haploinsufficiency
may be sufficient for initial tumor development in PJS.[
97
] Subsequently, the cancers that develop in
STK11
+/- mice do show LOH;[
98
] indeed, compound mutant mice heterozygous for pathogenic variants in
STK11
+/- and homozygous for pathogenic variants in
TP53
-/- have accelerated development of both hamartomas and cancers.[
99
]
Germline variants of the
STK11
gene represent a spectrum of nonsense, frameshift, and missense variants, and splice-site variants and large deletions.[
82
,
88
]
Approximately 85% of variants are localized to regions of the kinase domain of the expressed protein. No strong genotype-phenotype correlations have been identified.[
88
] Up to 30% of variants are large deletions involving one or more exons of
STK11
, underscoring the importance of deletion analysis in suspected cases of PJS.[
82
]
STK11
has been unequivocally demonstrated to cause PJS. Although earlier estimates using direct DNA sequencing showed a 50% pathogenic variant detection rate in
STK11
, studies adding techniques to detect large deletions have found pathogenic variants in up to 94% of individuals meeting clinical criteria for PJS.[
82
,
90
,
100
] Given the results of these studies, it is unlikely that other major genes cause PJS.
Clinical management
NCCN and the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) on Colorectal Cancer recommend upper endoscopy and high-quality colonoscopy with polypectomy beginning between the ages of 8 to 10 years.[
101
,
102
]
Management of small bowel hamartomas  is important because patients with PJS have risks of bleeding, intussusception, and malignancy. In PJS, cumulative lifetime risk of small bowel cancer is approximately 13%.  NCCN guidelines recommend computed tomography enterography (CTE), magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), or video capsule endoscopy (VCE) beginning between the ages of  8 to 10 years for small bowel surveillance in PJS.[
101
] These studies are repeated at intervals that are based on study findings up to age 18 years. Afterwards, screening is repeated every 2 to 3 years.  Few studies have directly compared yields of these different small bowel cancer surveillance tools.  One Australian study of 20 patients with PJS undergoing paired VCE and MRE  found that more small bowel polyps (>1 cm) were detected by VCE than MRE.[
103
] However,  balloon enteroscopy detected more small bowel polyps (>1 cm) than both VCE and MRE. NCCN guidelines also include recommendations for other PJS manifestations.
PALB2
Pathogenic variants in the
PALB2
gene are associated with increased risks of breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. For more information about
PALB2
cancer risks and management options, see
PALB2: Cancer Risks and Management
.
De Novo Pathogenic Variant Rate
Until the 1990s, the diagnosis of genetically inherited breast and ovarian cancer syndromes was based on clinical manifestations and family history. Now that some of the genes involved in these syndromes have been identified, a few studies have attempted to estimate the spontaneous pathogenic variant rate (
de novo pathogenic variant
rate) in these populations. Interestingly, PJS,
PTEN
hamartoma syndromes, and LFS are all thought to have high rates of spontaneous pathogenic variants, in the 10% to 30% range,[
104
-
107
] while estimates of de novo pathogenic variants in the
BRCA
genes are thought to be low, primarily on the basis of the few case reports published.[
108
-
116
] Additionally, there has been only one case series of breast cancer patients who were tested for
BRCA
pathogenic variants in which a de novo variant was identified.  Specifically, in this study of 193 patients with sporadic breast cancer, 17 pathogenic variants were detected, one of which was confirmed to be a de novo pathogenic variant.[
108
]  As such, the de novo pathogenic variant rate appears to be low and fall into the 5% or less range, based on  the limited studies performed.[
108
-
116
] Similarly, estimates of de novo pathogenic variants in the MMR genes associated with Lynch syndrome are thought to be low, in the 0.9% to 5% range.[
117
-
119
] However, these estimates of spontaneous pathogenic variant rates in the
BRCA
genes and Lynch syndrome genes seem to overlap with the estimates of nonpaternity rates in various populations (0.6%–3.3%),[
120
-
122
] making the de novo pathogenic variant rate for these genes relatively low.

Moderate-Penetrance Genes Associated With Breast and/or Gynecologic Cancers

Background
Pathogenic variants
in
BRCA1
,
BRCA2
,
PALB2
, and the
genes
involved in other rare syndromes discussed in the
High-Penetrance Breast and/or Gynecologic Cancer Susceptibility Genes
section of this summary account for less than 25% of the
familial
risk of breast cancer.[
1
] Despite intensive genetic
linkage studies
, there do not appear to be other high-
penetrance
genes that account for a significant fraction of the remaining multiple-case familial clusters.[
2
]  However, several moderate-penetrance genes associated with breast and/or gynecologic cancers have been identified. Genes such as
CHEK2
and
ATM
are associated with a 20% or higher lifetime risk of breast cancer;[
3
,
4
] similarly, genes such as
RAD51C
,
RAD51D
, and
BRIP1
are associated with a 5% to 10% risk of ovarian cancer.[
5
,
6
] Many of these genes are now included on
multigene panels
, although the clinical actionability of these findings remains uncertain and under  investigation.
Breast and Gynecologic Cancer Susceptibility Genes Identified Through Candidate Gene Approaches
There is a very large literature of genetic epidemiology studies describing associations between various
loci
and breast cancer risk. Many of these studies suffer from significant design limitations. Perhaps as a consequence, most reported associations do not replicate in follow-up studies. This section is not a comprehensive review of all reported associations. This section describes associations that are believed by the editors to be clinically valid, in that they have been described in several studies or are supported by robust meta-analyses. The clinical utility of these observations remains unclear, however, as the risks associated with these variations usually fall below a threshold that would justify a clinical response.
Fanconi anemia genes
Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare, inherited condition characterized by bone marrow failure, increased risk of malignancy, and physical abnormalities. To date, 16 FA-related genes, including
BRCA1 and BRCA2
, have been identified (as outlined in
Table 6
). FA  is mainly an
autosomal recessive
condition, except when caused by pathogenic variants in
FANCB
, which is
X-linked recessive
.
FANCA
accounts for 60% to 70% of pathogenic variants,
FANCC
accounts for approximately 14%, and the remaining genes each account for 3% or fewer.[

Progressive bone marrow failure typically occurs in the first decade, with patients often presenting with thrombocytopenia or leucopenia.  The incidence of bone marrow failure is 90% by age 40 to 50 years.  The incidence is 10% to 30% for hematologic malignancies (primarily acute myeloid leukemia) and 25% to 30% for nonhematologic malignancies (solid tumors, particularly of the head and neck, skin, gastrointestinal [GI] tract, and genital tract).  Physical abnormalities,  including short stature, abnormal skin pigmentation, radial ray defects (including malformation of the thumbs), abnormalities of the urinary tract, eyes, ears, heart, GI system, and central nervous system, hypogonadism, and developmental delay are present in 60% to 75% of affected individuals.[
7
]
Variants in some of the FA genes, most notably
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
, but also
PALB2
,
RAD51C
, and
BRIP1
, among others, may predispose to breast cancer in heterozygotes.  Given the widespread availability of
multigene (panel) tests
, genetic testing of many of the FA genes is frequently performed despite uncertain cancer risks and the lack of available evidence-based medical management recommendations for many of these genes.
FA gene pathogenic variant carrier status can have implications for reproductive decision making because pathogenic variants in these genes can lead to serious childhood onset of disease if both parents are carriers of pathogenic variants in the same gene. Partner testing may be considered.
BRIP1
BRIP1
(also known as
BACH1
) encodes a helicase that interacts with the
BRCA1
C-terminal  domain. This gene also has a role in BRCA1-dependent DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint function.
Biallelic
pathogenic variants in
BRIP1
are a cause of FA,[
8
-
10
] much like such pathogenic variants in
BRCA2
.
Monoallelic pathogenic variants in
BRIP1
have emerged as having a significant association with increased ovarian cancer risk. Nine-tenths to two and half percent of women with ovarian cancer carry a pathogenic variant in
BRIP1
.[
11
] Odds ratios (ORs) for ovarian cancer in individuals with a
BRIP1
pathogenic variant range from 2.2 to 5.0.[
12
] The median age of ovarian cancer diagnosis in individuals with
BRIP1
pathogenic variants ranges from the mid-50s to 70 years.
BRIP1
pathogenic variants have been seen in high-grade serous, borderline, and endometrioid ovarian cancers, but not in clear-cell or mucinous types.[
13
] Per current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended for women who carry a
BRIP1
pathogenic variant.[
14
]
With respect to breast cancer risk, several studies consistently report ORs less than 2.0. A meta-analysis of 148 studies found an OR for breast cancer of 1.62 in individuals with
BRIP1
pathogenic variants (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20–2.20).[
15
] ORs for breast cancer in
BRIP1
carriers  ranged from 0.60 to 1.81 in other studies. There is a growing consensus that
BRIP1
is not a moderate- to high-risk breast cancer susceptibility gene.  However, studies are looking at the possible associations between
BRIP1
pathogenic variants  and certain subtypes of breast cancer, such as triple-negative breast cancer. Limitations of these
BRIP1
association studies  include the following: rarity of
BRIP1
pathogenic variants, heterogeneity of study methodologies, and inconsistent reporting of family histories in many of the published studies.
CHEK2
CHEK2
is a gene involved in the
DNA
damage repair response pathway. Based on numerous studies, a
polymorphism
, 1100delC, appears to be a rare, moderate-penetrance cancer susceptibility allele.[
16
-
21
]  One study identified the pathogenic variant in 1.2% of the European controls, 4.2% of the European
BRCA1/BRCA2
-negative familial breast cancer cases, and 1.4% of unselected female breast cancer cases.[
16
] In a group of 1,479 Dutch women younger than 50 years with invasive breast cancer,  3.7% were found to have the
CHEK2
1100delC pathogenic variant.[
22
] In additional European and U.S.  (where the pathogenic variant appears to be slightly less common) studies, including a large prospective study,[
23
]  the frequency of
CHEK2
pathogenic variants detected in familial breast or ovarian cancer cases has ranged from 0% [
24
] to 11%;  overall, these studies have found an approximately 1.5-fold to 3-fold increased risk of female breast cancer.[
23
,
25
-
28
]  A multicenter combined analysis and reanalysis of nearly 20,000 subjects from ten case-control studies, however, has verified a significant 2.3-fold excess of breast cancer among carriers of pathogenic variants.[
29
]    A subsequent meta-analysis based on 29,154 cases and 37,064 controls from 25 case-control studies found a significant association between
CHEK2
1100delC heterozygotes and breast cancer risk (OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 2.25–3.36).  The ORs and CIs in unselected, familial, and early-onset breast cancer subgroups were 2.33 (1.79–3.05), 3.72 (2.61–5.31), and 2.78 (2.28–3.39), respectively. However, study limitations included pooling of populations without subgroup analysis, using  a mix of population-based and hospital-based controls, and basing results on unadjusted estimates (as cases and controls were matched on only a few common factors); therefore, results should be interpreted in the context of these limitations.[
30
] In a series of male breast cancer patients, the
CHEK2
1100delC variant was significantly more frequently identified than in controls, suggesting that this variant is also associated with an increased risk of male breast cancer.[
31
]
Two studies have suggested that the risk associated with a
CHEK2
1100delC pathogenic variant was stronger in the families of
probands
ascertained because of bilateral breast cancer.[
32
,
33
] Furthermore, a meta-analysis of carriers of 1100delC pathogenic variants estimated the risk of breast cancer to be 42% by age 70 years in women with a family history of breast cancer.[
34
]  Similarly, a Polish study reported that
CHEK2
truncating pathogenic variants confer breast cancer risks based on a family history of breast cancer as follows: no family history, 20%; one
second-degree relative
(SDR), 28%; one
first-degree relative
(FDR), 34%; and both FDRs and SDRs, 44%.[
3
]  Moreover, a Dutch study suggested that female homozygotes for the
CHEK2
1100delC variant have a greater-than-twofold increased breast cancer risk compared with heterozygotes.[
35
] Although there have been conflicting reports regarding cancers other than breast cancer associated with
CHEK2
pathogenic variants, this may be dependent on variant type (i.e.,
missense
vs. truncating) or population studied and is not currently of clinical utility.[
21
,
26
,
36
-
41
] The contribution of
CHEK2
variants to breast cancer may depend on the population studied, with a potentially higher variant prevalence in Poland.[
42
] Carriers of
CHEK2
variants in Poland may be more susceptible to estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer.[
43
]
A large Dutch study of 86,975 individuals reported an increased risk of cancers other than breast and colon for carriers of the
CHEK2
1100delC pathogenic variant,[
44
] although additional studies are needed to further refine these risks.
(Refer to the
CHEK2
section in Genetics of Colorectal Cancer   for more information.)
ATM
Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by
neurologic deterioration, telangiectasias, immunodeficiency states, and
hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation.  It is estimated that 1%
of the general population may be heterozygote carriers of
ATM
variants.[
45
]  More than 300 variants in the gene have been
identified, most of which are truncating
variants.[
46
] ATM proteins have been shown to play a role in cell cycle
control.[
47
-
49
]
In vitro
, AT-deficient cells are sensitive to ionizing radiation and
radiomimetic drugs, and lack cell cycle regulatory properties after exposure to
radiation.[
50
] There is insufficient evidence to recommend against radiation therapy in carriers of a single
ATM
pathogenic variant (heterozygotes).
Initial, large epidemiological studies demonstrated a statistically increased relative risk (RR) of approximately 2.0 for breast cancer among female
ATM
heterozygotes.[
4
,
51
] 
 Subsequent, large international consortium-based studies have refined risk estimates.[
52
,
53
] An international study based on 113,000 females from 25 countries reported an OR  of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.71–2.57) for breast cancer in
ATM
heterozygotes.
ATM
pathogenic variants were also associated  with ER-positive tumors.[
52
] Domains specifically associated with higher breast cancer risks included the FRAP–ATM–TRRAP (FAT) domain (
P
= .00019 in all studies) and protein kinase domains (
P
= .00092 in all studies). Similarly, a United States–based study of 63,000 women reported an OR of 1.82 for breast cancer in
ATM
heterozygotes (95% CI, 1.46–2.27) and also reported an association between
ATM
pathogenic variants and ER-positive breast cancers.[
53
] A similar OR of 2.03 (95% CI, 1.89–2.19) was estimated for invasive ductal breast cancer through a commercial, lab-based study of 4,607 individuals with
ATM
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants.[
54
]
Age-specific cumulative breast cancer risks modeled through a meta-analysis were reported to be 6.02% by age 50 years and 32.83% by age 80 years.[
55
] Another meta-analysis reported the RR for female breast cancer as 3.0 in
ATM
carriers (95% CI, 2.1–4.5).[
56
] A subsequent systematic review and meta-analysis  estimated an adjusted OR of 1.67 for breast cancer risk in individuals with
ATM
pathogenic variants (95% CI, 0.73–3.82) based on seven adjusted case-control studies.[
57
] The crude OR was 2.27 (95% CI, 1.17–4.40) based on nine unadjusted case-control studies. The RR was estimated as 1.68 (95% CI, 1.17–2.40) based on two cohort studies. Overall, the findings suggested genotype-phenotype correlations, with the
ATM
c.7271T>G variant (also known as the
ATM
Val2424Gly variant) as the most predisposing factor and with limited predictive ability for Asp1853Val, Leu546Val, and Ser707Pro
ATM
variants. Per NCCN guidelines, it is recommended that women who carry an
ATM
pathogenic variant have annual mammograms starting at age 40 years with consideration of breast magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast beginning at age 30 to 35 years.[
14
]
While multiple studies have reported that  most
ATM
pathogenic variants impart moderate risks for breast cancer, the c.7271T>G missense variant has been shown to predispose individuals to higher breast cancer risks.[
58
,
59
] Specifically, in a commercial laboratory, data-based study of patients referred for hereditary cancer testing with a multi-gene panel (N = 627,742) including 4,607
ATM
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant carriers, risk of invasive ductal breast cancer was higher for the c.7271T>G  missense variant (OR, 3.76; 95% CI, 2.76–5.12) than for other missense and truncating
ATM
variants.[
54
]
Some studies reported an association between
ATM
and ovarian cancer, with ovarian cancer lifetime risk approaching  ~3%.[
60
,
61
]  A commercial laboratory, data-based study reported an OR of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.35–1.83) for ovarian cancer in
ATM
pathogenic variant carriers.[
54
]
Pancreatic cancer has also been associated with
ATM
pathogenic variants, with an OR of 4.21 (95% CI, 3.24–5.47) reported through a commercial lab–based study.[
54
] Among 130 pancreatic cancer kindreds with a germline
ATM
pathogenic variant, the cumulative risk of pancreatic cancer was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.8%–1.3%) by age 50 years, 6.3% (95% CI, 3.9%–8.7%) by age 70 years, and 9.5% (95% CI, 5.0%–14.0%) by age 80 years.[
62
] Overall, the RR of pancreatic cancer was 6.5 (95% CI, 4.5–9.5) in
ATM
pathogenic variant carriers when compared with noncarriers. The average  age at diagnosis was 64 years (range, 31–98 y).
The association between
ATM
pathogenic variants  and prostate cancer risk have been inconclusive, with a commercial lab–based study reporting an OR of 2.58 (95% CI, 1.93–3.44).[

RAD51
RAD51
and the family of
RAD51
-related genes, also known as
RAD51
paralogs, are thought to encode proteins that are involved in DNA damage repair through homologous recombination and interaction with numerous other DNA repair proteins, including BRCA1 and BRCA2.  The RAD51 protein plays a central role in single-strand annealing in the DNA damage response. RAD51 recruitment to break sites and recombinational DNA repair depend on the
RAD51
paralogs, although their precise cellular functions are poorly characterized.[
63
]   Variants in these genes are thought to result in loss of RAD51 focus formation in response to DNA damage.[
64
]
One of five
RAD51
-related genes,
RAD51C
has been reported to be linked to both FA-like disorders and familial breast and ovarian cancers. The literature, however, has produced contradictory findings. In a study of 480 German families characterized by breast and ovarian cancers who were negative for
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants, six monoallelic variants in
RAD51C
were found (frequency of 1.3%).[
65
] Another study screened 286
BRCA1/BRCA2
-negative patients with breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer and found one likely pathogenic variant in
RAD51C
-G153D.[
66
]
RAD51C
pathogenic variants have also been reported in Australian, British, Finnish, and Spanish non-
BRCA1/BRCA2
ovarian cancer–only and breast/ovarian cancer families, and in unselected ovarian cancer cases, with frequencies ranging from 0% to 3% in these populations.[
5
,
67
-
73
] In a sample of 206 high-risk Jewish women (including 79 of
Ashkenazi
origin) previously tested for the common Jewish pathogenic variants, two previously described and possibly pathogenic missense variants were detected.[
74
]    Four additional studies were unable to confirm an association between the
RAD51C
gene and hereditary breast cancer or ovarian cancer.[
75
-
78
]
In addition to carriers of
RAD51C
pathogenic variants, there are  other
RAD51
paralogs, including
RAD51B
,
RAD51D
,
RAD51L1
,
XRCC2
, and
XRCC3
, that may be associated with breast and/or ovarian cancer risk,[
6
,
71
,
79
-
83
] although the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. In a case-control study of 3,429 ovarian cancer patients,
RAD51C
and
RAD51D
pathogenic variants were more commonly found in ovarian cancer cases (0.82%) than in controls (0.11%,
P
< .001).[
84
]
In addition to
germline variants
, different polymorphisms of
RAD51
have been hypothesized to have reduced capacity to repair DNA defects, resulting in increased susceptibility to familial breast cancer.  The Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of
BRCA1/BRCA2
(CIMBA) pooled data from 8,512 carriers of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants and found evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer among  women who were
BRCA2
carriers and who were homozygous for CC at the
RAD51
135G→C SNV (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.91–1.51).[
85
]
Several meta-analyses have investigated the association between the
RAD51
135G→C polymorphism and breast cancer risk. There is significant overlap in the studies reported in these meta-analyses,  significant variability in the characteristics of the populations included, and significant methodologic limitations to their findings.[
86
-
89
] A meta-analysis of nine epidemiologic studies involving 13,241 cases and 13,203 controls of unknown
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
status found that women carrying the CC
genotype
had an increased risk of breast cancer compared with women with the GG or GC genotype (OR,  1.35; 95% CI, 1.04–1.74).  A meta-analysis of 14 case-control studies involving 12,183 cases and 10,183 controls confirmed an increased risk only for women who were known
BRCA2
carriers (OR,  4.92; 95% CI, 1.10–21.83).[
90
]   Another meta-analysis of 12 studies included only studies of known
BRCA
-negative cases and found no association between
RAD51
135G→C and breast cancer.[
91
]
In summary, among this conflicting data is substantial evidence for a modest association between germline variants in
RAD51C
and breast cancer and ovarian cancer.  There is also evidence of an association between polymorphisms in
RAD51
135G→C among women with homozygous CC genotypes and breast cancer, particularly among
BRCA2
carriers.  These associations are plausible given the known role of
RAD51
in the maintenance of genomic stability.

Single Nucleotide Variant–Associated Cancer Risks
In This Section
Genome-Wide Searches
Polygenic risk scores for breast and ovarian cancer
Whole-Genome and Whole-Exome Sequencing
Polymorphisms
underlying polygenic susceptibility to breast and gynecologic cancers are considered low
penetrance
, a term often applied to sequence
variants
associated with a minimal to moderate risk. This is in contrast to
high-penetrance
variants or
alleles
that are typically associated with more severe
phenotypes
, for example
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants leading to an
autosomal dominant inheritance
pattern in a family, and
moderate-penetrance
variants such as
BRIP1
,
CHEK2
, and
RAD51C
. (Refer to the
High-Penetrance Breast and/or Gynecologic Cancer Susceptibility Genes
and the
Moderate-Penetrance Genes Associated With Breast and/or Gynecologic Cancer
sections of this summary for more information.) Because these types of sequence variants (also called low-penetrance
genes
, alleles, variants, and polymorphisms) are relatively common in the general population, their overall contribution to cancer risk is estimated to be much greater than the
attributable risk
in the population from pathogenic variants in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
. For example, it is estimated by
segregation analysis
that half of all breast cancer occurs in 12% of the population that is deemed most susceptible.[
1
] There are no known low-penetrance variants in
BRCA1/BRCA2
. The N372H variation in
BRCA2
, initially thought to be a low-penetrance allele, was not verified in a large combined analysis.[
2
]
Two strategies have attempted to identify low-penetrance polymorphisms leading to breast cancer susceptibility: candidate gene and
genome-wide searches
. Both involve the epidemiologic case-control study design. The candidate gene approach involves selecting genes based on their known or presumed biological function, relevance to carcinogenesis or organ physiology, and then searching for or testing known genetic variants for an association with cancer risk. This strategy relies on imperfect and incomplete biological knowledge, and, despite some confirmed associations (described below), has been relatively disappointing.[
2
,
3
] The candidate gene approach has largely been replaced by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in which a very large number of
single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) (approximately 1 million to 5 million) are chosen within the genome and tested, mostly without regard to their possible biological function, but instead to more uniformly capture all genetic variation throughout the genome.
Genome-Wide Searches
In contrast to assessing candidate genes and/or alleles, GWAS involve comparing a very large set of genetic variants spread throughout the genome.  The current paradigm uses sets of as many as 5 million SNVs that are chosen to capture a large portion of common variation within the genome based on the HapMap and the 1000 Genomes Project.[
4
,
5
]  By comparing allele frequencies between a large number of cases and controls, typically 1,000 or more of each, and validating promising signals in replication sets of subjects, very robust statistical signals of association have been obtained.[
6
-
8
] The strong correlation between many SNVs that are physically close to each other on the
chromosome
(
linkage disequilibrium
) allows one to “scan” the genome for susceptibility alleles even if the biologically relevant variant is not within the tested set of SNVs.  Although this between-SNV correlation allows one to interrogate the majority of the genome without having to assay every SNV, when a validated association is obtained, it is not usually obvious which of the many correlated variants is causal.
Genome-wide searches are showing great promise in identifying common, low-penetrance susceptibility alleles for many complex diseases,[
9
]  including breast cancer.[
10
-
13
] The first study involved an initial scan in
familial
breast cancer cases followed by replication in two large sample sets of
sporadic breast cancer
, the final being a  collection of over 20,000 cases and 20,000 controls from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC).[
10
] Five distinct genomic regions were identified that were within or near the
FGFR2
,
TNRC9
,
MAP3K1
, and
LSP1
genes or at the chromosome 8q region.  The 8q region and others may harbor multiple independent
loci
associated with risk.   Subsequent genome-wide studies have replicated these loci and identified additional ones.[
11
,
12
,
14
-
19
] Numerous SNVs identified through large studies of sporadic breast cancer appear to be associated more strongly with estrogen receptor (ER)–positive disease;[
20
] however, some are associated primarily or exclusively with other subtypes, including
triple-negative disease
.[
21
,
22
] An
online catalog
is available of SNV-trait associations
from published GWAS for use in investigating
genomic characteristics of trait/disease-associated SNVs.
Although the statistical evidence for an association between genetic variation at these loci and breast and ovarian cancer risk is overwhelming, the biologically relevant variants and 
the mechanism by which they lead to increased risk are unknown and will require further genetic and functional characterization.  Additionally, these loci are associated with very modest risk (typically, an odds  ratio [OR] <1.5), with more risk variants likely to be identified.  No interaction between the SNVs and epidemiologic risk factors for breast cancer have been identified.[
23
,
24
] Furthermore, theoretical models have suggested that common moderate-risk SNVs have limited potential to improve models for individualized
risk assessment
.[
25
-
27
]  These models used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) as a measure of discriminatory accuracy. A subsequent study used ROC curve analysis to examine the utility of SNVs in a clinical dataset of more than 5,500 breast cancer cases and nearly 6,000 controls, using a model with traditional risk factors compared with a model using both standard risk factors and ten previously identified SNVs. The addition of genetic information modestly changed the AUC from 58% to 61.8%, a result that was not felt to be clinically significant. Despite this, 32.5% of patients were in a higher quintile of breast cancer risk when genetic information was included, and 20.4% were in a lower quintile of risk. Whether such information has clinical utility is unclear.[
25
,
28
]
More limited data are available regarding ovarian cancer risk. Three GWAS involving staged analysis of more than 10,000 cases and 13,000 controls have been carried out for ovarian cancer.[
29
-
31
]    As in other GWAS, the ORs are modest, generally about 1.2 or weaker but implicate a number of genes with plausible biological ties to ovarian cancer, such as
BABAM1
, whose protein complexes with and may regulate BRCA1, and
TIRAPR
, which codes for a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, molecules that may be important in
BRCA1/BRCA2
-deficient cells.
Polygenic risk scores for breast and ovarian cancer
The collective influence of many genetic variants has more recently been evaluated using an aggregate score.  In 2015, a
polygenic risk score
(PRS) comprising all of the known breast cancer risk genetic variants or SNVs was estimated in women of European ancestry using 41 studies in the BCAC, including more than 33,000 breast cancer cases and 33,000 controls.[
32
]  This early attempt at estimating a PRS for breast cancer included 77 SNVs, which collectively conferred lifetime risks of developing breast cancer by age 80 years of 3.5% and 29% for women in the lowest and highest 1% of the PRS, respectively.[
32
] Since then, PRSs incorporating additional genetic variants and examining other breast cancer–related outcomes including tumor and pathological characteristics, mode of detection, and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) have been estimated.[
33
-
40
] In 2019, the PRS with the highest discriminatory ability to date was developed and prospectively validated in the largest GWAS datasets available (79 studies in BCAC and more than 190,000 women in the U.K. Biobank), which incorporates information on 313 genetic variants and is optimized for ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer.[
39
] Compared with women in the middle quintile, those in the highest 1% of PRS
313
had 4.04-, 4.37-, and 2.78-fold risks of developing breast cancer overall, ER-positive disease, and ER-negative disease, respectively.[
39
] Lifetime absolute risk (AR) of breast cancer by age 80 years for women in the lowest and highest 1% of PRS
313
ranged from 2% to 31% for ER-positive breast cancer, while for ER-negative disease, the ARs ranged from 0.55% to 4%.[
39
]
Common genomic variants associated with the development of a first primary breast cancer are also associated with the development of CBC.[
40
] Women in the highest quartile of the PRS had a 1.6-fold increased risk of developing CBC compared with the lowest quartile.[
40
] Moreover, PRSs of breast and ovarian cancers have been assessed in women who are carriers of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants, and have been found to be predictive of cancer risk in these women, supporting the hypothesis of a shared polygenic component of cancer risk between the general population and variant carriers.[
36
] The PRS for ER-negative disease had the strongest association with breast cancer risk in
BRCA1
variant carriers, while the strongest association in
BRCA2
variant carriers was seen for the overall breast cancer PRS.
BRCA1
variant carriers had cumulative lifetime risks of 56% and 75% of developing breast cancer at the 10
th
and 90
th
percentile of the PRS, respectively. The ovarian cancer PRS was strongly associated with risk for both
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
variant carriers. For
BRCA2
variant carriers, the ovarian cancer risk was 6% and 19% by age 80 years for those at the 10
th
and 90
th
percentile of PRS, respectively. The authors noted that the incorporation of the PRS into risk prediction models may better inform decisions on cancer risk management for this population.[
36
]
Two large studies have supported that PRSs can improve breast cancer risk stratification.[
41
,
42
] PRSs were most important in the breast cancer risk stratification of individuals with
CHEK2
and
ATM
pathogenic variants. After PRSs were incorporated, 30% of individuals with a
CHEK2
pathogenic variant and nearly half of the individuals with an
ATM
pathogenic variant dipped below a 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer. This is significant, since lifetime risk values greater than 20%  can prompt more frequent breast cancer screening and other types of clinical management.[
41
] PRSs were also effective when stratifying breast cancer risk in noncarriers. Gallagher et al. analyzed case-control data from 150,962 women who had multigene hereditary cancer genetic testing. This study examined the impact of a PRS with 86 SNVs on individuals with pathogenic variants in
BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM
, and
PALB2
. The PRS was predictive of breast cancer in  individuals with pathogenic variants. However, breast cancer risk stratification was more pronounced in noncarriers (OR, 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45–1.49) and
CHEK2
pathogenic variant carriers (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.36–1.64) than in carriers of
BRCA1
(OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10–1.32) or
BRCA2
(OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12–1.34) pathogenic variants. The ORs for
ATM
(OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.21–1.55) and
PALB2
(OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16–1.55) pathogenic variant carriers  were intermediate when compared with those of
BRCA1/2
pathogenic variant carriers,
CHEK2
pathogenic variant carriers, and noncarriers. Even though the PRS improved breast cancer risk stratification across all groups,  the PRS was most important for individuals with
CHEK2
pathogenic variants and for noncarriers.[
42
] Similarly, Gao et al. analyzed case-control data from 26,798 non-Hispanic White individuals with breast cancer and 26,127 controls using a PRS based on 105 SNVs. More than 95% of
BRCA1
,
BRCA2
, and
PALB2
pathogenic variant carriers had a 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer. In contrast, 52.5% of
ATM
pathogenic variant carriers and 69.7% of
CHEK2
pathogenic variant carriers without
first-degree relatives
(FDRs)  with breast cancer had a 20% lifetime risk of breast cancer. This was also true in  78.8% of
ATM
carriers and 89.9% of
CHEK2
carriers  with an FDR with breast cancer.[
41
]
Several studies have also examined the extent to which clinical breast cancer risk prediction models can be improved by including information on known susceptibility SNVs, and reporting improved discriminatory accuracy after inclusion of the PRS.[
43
-
48
] For example, in a study combining PRS
77
with clinical models, the AUC for predicting breast cancer before age 50 years improved by more than 20%.[
44
] Clinical trials, including
WISDOM
and
MyPeBs
, are in progress to study the potential clinical utility of the PRS for making screening decisions and understanding outcomes.[
49
] Because PRSs have been largely developed and validated in populations of European ancestry, the utility and prediction accuracy of these PRSs in non-European populations is unknown.
A large study examined whether known reproductive and lifestyle risk factors interact with PRSs to increase breast cancer risk and did not find a multiplicative interaction with established risk factors.[

Whole-Genome and Whole-Exome Sequencing
In addition to GWAS interrogating common genetic variants, sequencing-based studies involving
whole-genome
or
whole-exome sequencing
[
51
] are also identifying genes associated with breast cancer, such as
XRCC2
, a rare, moderate-penetrance breast cancer
susceptibility gene
.[

Clinical Sequencing
section in Cancer Genetics Overview for more information about whole-exome sequencing.)

Introduction
Psychosocial research in the context of cancer genetic testing helps to define
psychological outcomes, interpersonal and
familial
effects, and cultural and
community responses.  This type of research also identifies behavioral factors that encourage or
impede
screening
and other health behaviors.  It can enhance decision making
about risk-reduction interventions, evaluate psychosocial interventions to
reduce distress and/or other negative sequelae related to risk notification and
genetic testing, provide data to help resolve ethical concerns, and predict the
interest in testing of various groups.

Uptake of Genetic Counseling and Genetic Testing
Degree of uptake of genetic counseling and genetic testing
Comparison of uptake rates among studies in which counseling and testing were offered is challenging because of differences in methodologies, including the sampling strategy used, the recruitment setting, and testing through a research protocol with high-risk cohorts or
kindreds
. In a systematic review of 40 studies conducted before 2002 that had assessed genetic testing utilization, uptake rates varied widely and ranged from 25% to 96%, with an average uptake rate of 59%.[
1
] Results of multivariate analysis found that
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic testing uptake was associated with having a personal or family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and with methodological features of the studies, including sampling strategies, recruitment settings, and how studies defined actual uptake versus the intention to have testing.
Other factors have been positively correlated with uptake of
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic testing, although these findings are not consistent across all studies.  Psychological factors that have been positively correlated with testing uptake include greater cancer-specific distress and greater perceived risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer.  Having more cancer-affected relatives also has been correlated with greater testing uptake.

Several studies conducted in non-U.S. settings have examined the uptake of genetic testing.[
7
-
11
] In studies examining the uptake of testing among at-risk relatives of carriers of
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
pathogenic variants, uptake rates have averaged below 50% (range, 36%–48%), with higher uptake reported among female relatives than in male relatives.  Other factors associated with higher uptake of testing were not consistently reported among studies but have most commonly included being a parent and wanting to learn information about a child’s risk.
Factors influencing uptake of genetic counseling and genetic testing
In reviews that have examined the cumulative evidence concerning the predictors of uptake of
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
genetic testing, important predictors of testing uptake include older age,
Ashkenazi Jewish
(AJ) heritage, unmarried status, a personal history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer.  Studies recruiting participants in hospital settings had significantly higher recruitment rates than did studies recruiting participants in community settings.  Studies that required an immediate decision to test, rather than allowing delayed decision making, tended to report higher uptake rates.[
1
]  However, there is evidence that women diagnosed with breast cancer are equally satisfied with genetic counseling (including information received and strength and timing of physician recommendations for counseling), whether they received genetic counseling before or after their definitive surgery for breast cancer.[
12
]   Another review [
13
] found that uptake of genetic testing for
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants was related to psychological factors (e.g., anxiety about breast cancer  and perceived risk of breast cancer) and demographic and medical factors (e.g., history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer, presence of children, and higher number of
affected
first-degree relatives
[FDRs]).  Family members with a known
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant were more likely to pursue testing; those with more extensive knowledge of
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing, heightened risk perceptions, beliefs that mammography would promote health benefit, and high intentions to undergo testing were more likely to follow through with testing.[
14
]
In a review of racial and ethnic differences that affect the uptake of
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing, intention to undergo genetic testing in African American women was related to having at least one FDR with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, higher perceived risk of being a carrier, and less anticipatory guilt about the possibility of being a
gene
carrier.[
15
] A systematic review found that certain racial and ethnic minority groups, including African American and Hispanic individuals, had more negative views and greater concerns about genetic counseling and testing when compared with White individuals. African American and Hispanic individuals were more likely to believe genetic testing could be used to show their ethnic group was inferior to other groups.  Additionally, African American and Hispanic individuals were found to have low awareness and knowledge about the importance of genetics in cancer,
BRCA
status, and genetic testing.[
16
]
Reasons cited for following through with testing included a desire  to learn about a child's risk, to feel relief from uncertainty, to inform screening or risk-reducing surgery decisions, and to inform important life decisions such as marriage and childbearing.[
14
,
17
] Among African American women, the most important reason for testing included motivation to help other relatives decide on genetic testing.[
15
]
Physician recommendation may be another motivator for testing.  In a retrospective study of 335 women considering genetic testing, 77% reported that they wanted the opinion of a genetics physician about whether they should be tested, and 49% wanted the opinion of their primary care provider.[
18
]  However, there is some evidence of referral bias favoring those with a maternal family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer. In a Canadian retrospective review of 315 patients, those with a maternal family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer were 4.9 times (95% confidence interval, 3.6–6.7) more likely to be referred for a cancer genetics consultation by their physician than were those with a paternal family history (
P
< .001).[
19
] Studies have found that physicians may not adequately assess paternal family history [
20
] or may underestimate the significance of a paternal family history for genetic risk.[
20
-
22
] Other studies have shown that physician referral of patients who meet U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines for
BRCA
genetic counseling has been suboptimal.[
23
]
The uptake of
BRCA
testing to inform surgical treatment decisions when offered appears to be high in research cohorts;[
2
,
24
] however, findings from other studies suggest that testing is underutilized in clinical practice to inform breast cancer treatment decisions.[
6
,
25
,
26
] Barriers to the use of
BRCA
testing to inform surgical treatment decisions, including lack of physician referral of newly diagnosed patients for genetic counseling, type of insurance coverage (such as Medicare or Medicaid), and challenges in the timing and coordination of testing, have been reported.[
6
,
27
-
30
] In a randomized trial that provided proactive rapid genetic counseling (delivery of genetic counseling prior to surgery) compared with usual care for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, results suggested that although genetic counseling uptake was higher in the intervention arm, this did not translate into higher rates of genetic testing, receipt of results before surgery, or bilateral mastectomy decisions.[
31
]
Insurance coverage
Insurance coverage is an important consideration for individuals deciding whether to undergo genetic testing. (Refer to the
Insurance coverage
section in the PDQ summary on
Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling
for more information.)
Uptake of genetic counseling and genetic testing in diverse populations
Degree of uptake of genetic counseling and genetic testing in diverse populations
There are limited data on uptake of genetic counseling and testing among non-White populations, and further research will be needed to define factors influencing uptake in these populations.[
32
]   The uptake of
BRCA
testing appears to vary across some racial and ethnic groups. A few studies have compared uptake rates between African American and White women.[
4
,
33
] In a case-control study of women who had been seen in a university-based primary care system, African American women with family histories of breast cancer or ovarian cancer were less likely to undergo
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing than were White women who had similar histories.[
33
] In another study among breast cancer patients who were counseled about
BRCA1/BRCA2
risk in a clinical setting, lower uptake was reported among African American women than among White women.[
4
]
Notably, the racial differences observed in these studies do not appear to be explained by factors related to cost, access to care, risk factors for carrying a
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variant, or differences in psychosocial factors, including risk perceptions, worry, or attitudes toward testing.
Factors influencing uptake of genetic counseling and genetic testing in diverse populations
Several studies have examined uptake or “acceptance” of
BRCA
testing among African American individuals enrolled in genetic research programs. Among study enrollees from an African American kindred in Utah, 83% underwent
BRCA1
testing.[
34
] Age, perceived risk of being a carrier, and more extensive cancer knowledge predicted testing acceptance. Another study that recruited African American women  through physician and community referrals reported a
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing acceptance rate of 22%.[
35
] Predictors of test acceptance included having a higher probability of having a pathogenic variant, being married, and being less certain about one’s cancer risk. Finally, a third study that recruited at-risk African American women from an urban cancer screening clinic found that acceptors of
BRCA
testing were more knowledgeable about breast cancer genetics and perceived fewer barriers to testing, including negative emotional reactions, stigmatization concerns, and family-related guilt.[
36
] While these are independent predictors of genetic testing uptake, they do not explain the disparities in testing uptake across different ethnic groups. What may explain these differences are several attitudes and beliefs held about testing by individuals from diverse populations.
Work examining attitudes toward breast cancer genetic testing in Latino and African American populations indicates limited knowledge and awareness about testing but a generally receptive view once they are informed; in comparison with White populations, Latino and African American populations have relatively more concerns about testing.
For example, in a qualitative study with 51 Latino individuals unselected for risk status, important findings included the fact that participants were highly interested in genetic testing for inherited cancer susceptibility, despite very limited knowledge about genetics.  One important barrier involved secrecy or embarrassment about family discussions of cancer and genetics, which could be addressed in intervention strategies.[
37
]   Another qualitative study with 54 Latina women at risk of hereditary breast cancer showed that knowledge about
BRCA1/BRCA2
counseling was low, although the women were interested in learning more about counseling to gain risk information for family members.  Barriers to counseling included life demands, cost, and language issues.[
38
]
A telephone survey of 314 patients from an inner-city network of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, health centers, 50% of whom were African American, found that most participants (57%)  (both African American and  White participants) felt that genetic testing to evaluate disease risk was a good idea; however, more African American participants than White participants thought that genetic testing would lead to racial discrimination (37% vs. 22%, respectively) and that genetics research was unethical  and tampered with nature (20% vs. 11%, respectively).[
39
] Finally, in a study of 222 women in Savannah, Georgia, where most had neither a personal history (70%) nor a family history (60%)  of breast cancer, African American women (who comprised 26% of the sample) were less likely to be aware of breast cancer genes and genetic testing.  Awareness was also related to higher income, higher education level, and having a family breast cancer history.  However, 74% of the entire sample expressed willingness to be tested for breast cancer susceptibility.[
40
]
In a sample of 146 African American women meeting criteria for
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant testing, women born outside the United States reported higher levels of anticipated negative emotional reactions (e.g., fear, hopelessness, and lack of confidence that they could emotionally handle testing).  Higher levels of breast cancer–specific distress were associated with anticipated negative emotional reactions, confidentiality concerns, and anticipated guilt regarding the family impact of breast cancer genetic testing.[
41
] A future orientation (e.g., "I often think about how my actions today will affect my health when I am older") was associated with overall perceived benefits of breast cancer genetic testing in this population (n = 140); however, future orientation was also found to be positively associated with family-related cons of testing, including family guilt and worry regarding the impact of testing on the family.[
42
]
There are racial differences in provider discussion and patient uptake of genetic testing for variants in
BRCA1/BRCA2
. A study of women aged 18 to 64 years and diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2007 and 2009 found that, even after adjusting for pathogenic variant risk, African American women were less likely to report having received a physician recommendation for genetic testing. There was no difference across all races in concerns that
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing was too expensive and only minimal differences in testing attitudes or insurance concerns were found, none of which influenced testing uptake.[
43
] A study of breast or ovarian cancer survivors (N = 50) eligible for
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
genetic testing found that 48% were referred for genetic counseling and testing and/or had undergone genetic testing. Individuals with higher breast cancer genetics knowledge and higher self-efficacy were more likely to have engaged in genetic counseling and testing.[
44
]  In a study of women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 years between 2009 and 2012 who were identified through the Florida Cancer Data System state registry and eligible for
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic testing on the basis of existing guidelines, African American individuals were less likely to report a discussion with their health care provider and undergo genetic testing.[
45
] The same study found similar overall testing rates in Hispanic (61%) and non-Hispanic (65%) White individuals. However, testing rates were lower among Hispanic individuals who spoke primarily Spanish at home (50% Spanish speaking vs. 69% English speaking;
P
= .0009), and in general, Hispanic individuals were less likely to have been referred for genetic testing.[
46
] However, this finding is not consistent across all studies.  In a study of women aged 20 to 79 years with ductal carcinoma
in situ
or invasive breast cancer identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry in Georgia and Los Angeles County, all eligible for
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
genetic testing on the basis of existing guidelines, no ethnic differences were detected in receipt of genetic counseling or physician-directed discussion about genetic testing.[
30
]
Factors associated with declining genetic counseling and testing
There is evidence that primary reasons for declining testing involves being childless, which reduces any family motivations for testing; and concerns about the negative ramifications of testing, including difficulty retaining insurance or concerns about personal health.
Limited data are available about the characteristics of at-risk individuals who decline to be tested or have never been tested.  It is difficult to access samples of test decliners because they may be reluctant to participate in research studies. Studies of genetic testing uptake are difficult to compare because people may decline at different points and with different amounts of pretest education and counseling. One study found that 43% of affected and
unaffected
individuals from hereditary breast/ovarian cancer families who completed a baseline interview regarding testing declined to be tested. Most individuals who declined testing chose not to participate in educational sessions. Decliners were more likely to be male and be unmarried and have fewer relatives with breast cancer. Decliners who had high levels of cancer-related stress had higher levels of depression. Decliners lost to follow-up were significantly more likely to be affected with cancer.[
47
]
Another study looked at a small number (n = 13) of women decliners who carried a 25% to 50% probability of harboring a
BRCA
pathogenic variant; these nontested women were more likely to be childless and to have higher levels of education. This study showed that most women decided not to undergo the test after serious deliberation about the risks and benefits. Satisfaction with frequent
surveillance
was given as one reason for nontesting by most of these women.[
48
] Other reasons for declining included having no children and becoming acquainted with breast/ovarian cancer in the family relatively early in their lives.[
47
,
48
]
A third study evaluated characteristics of 34 individuals who declined
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing in a large multicenter study in the United Kingdom. Decliners were younger than a national sample of test acceptors, and female decliners had lower mean scores on a measure of cancer worry. Although 78% of test decliners/deferrers felt that their health was at risk, they reported that learning about their
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant status would cause them to worry about the following:
Their children's health (76%).
Their life insurance (60%).
Their own health (56%).
Loss of their job (5%).
Receiving less screening if they did not carry a
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant (62%).
Apprehension about the impact of the test result was a more important factor in the decision to decline testing than were concrete burdens such as time required to travel to a genetics clinic and time spent away from work, family, and social obligations.[
49
] In 15% (n = 31) of individuals from 13 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) families who underwent genetic education and counseling and declined testing for a documented pathogenic variant in the family, positive changes in family relationships were reported—specifically, greater expressiveness and cohesion—compared with those who pursued testing.[
50
]
Genetic counseling and testing in children
Testing for
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants has been almost universally limited to adults older than 18
years.  The risks of testing children for adult-onset disorders, such as breast
and ovarian cancers, as inferred from developmental data on children’s medical 
understanding and ability to provide informed consent, have been outlined in
several reports.[
51
-
54
]
Studies suggest that individuals who have undergone
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic testing or who are adult offspring of individuals who have had testing are generally not in favor of testing minors.[
55
,
56
] Although the data are limited, research suggests that males, pathogenic variant
noncarriers
, and those whose mothers did not have personal histories of breast cancer may be more likely to favor genetic testing in minors in general.[
55
]  Of those who had minor children at the time the study was conducted, only 17% stated a preference for having their own children tested.  Concerns regarding testing of minors included psychological risks and insufficient maturity. Potential benefits included the ability to influence health behaviors.[
56
]
No data exist on the testing of children for
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants, although some researchers believe it is necessary to test the validity
of assumptions underlying the general prohibition of testing children for
genetic variants associated with breast and ovarian cancers and other adult-onset diseases.[
57
-
59
] In one study,  20 children (aged  11–17 y)  of a selected group of mothers undergoing genetic testing (80% of whom previously had breast cancer and all of whom had discussed
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing with their children) completed self-report questionnaires on their health beliefs and attitudes toward cancer, feelings related to cancer, and behavioral problems.[
60
] Ninety percent of children thought they would want cancer risk information as adults; half worried about themselves or a family  member developing cancer. There was no evidence of emotional distress or behavioral problems.
What People Bring to Genetic Testing: Impact of Risk Perception, Health Beliefs, and Personality Characteristics
The emerging literature in this area suggests that risk perceptions,
health beliefs, psychological status, and personality characteristics are important factors in
decision making about breast/ovarian cancer genetic testing.  Many women
presenting at academic centers for
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing arrive with a strong belief
that they have a pathogenic variant, having decided they want genetic testing, but
possessing little information about the risks or limitations of testing.[
61
] Most mean scores of psychological functioning at baseline for subjects in genetic counseling studies were within normal limits.[
62
]  Nonetheless, a subset of subjects in many genetic counseling studies present with elevated anxiety, depression, or cancer worry.[
63
,
64
]  Identification of these individuals is essential to prevent adverse outcomes. In a study of 205 women pursuing genetic counseling, interactions among cancer worry, breast cancer risk perception, and perceived severity of having a breast cancer
genetic variant
were found such that those with high worry, high breast cancer risk perception, and low perceived severity were twice as likely to follow through with
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing than others.[
65
]
A general tendency to overestimate inherited risk of breast and ovarian cancer
has been noted in at-risk populations,[
66
-
69
] in cancer patients,[
67
,
70
,
71
] in spouses of breast and ovarian cancer patients,[
72
] and among
women in the general population.[
73
-
75
] but underestimation of breast cancer risk in higher-risk and average-risk women also has been reported.[
76
]  This overestimation may encourage a belief that
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic testing will be more
informative
than it is currently thought
to be.  Some evidence exists that even counseling does not dissuade women at
low to moderate risk from the belief that
BRCA1
testing could be valuable.[
32
] 
 Overestimation of both breast and ovarian cancer risk has been associated with nonadherence to physician-recommended screening practices.[
77
,
78
] A meta-analysis of 12 studies of outcomes of genetic counseling for breast/ovarian cancer showed that counseling improved the accuracy of risk perception.[
79
]
Women appear to be the prime communicators within families about the family 
history of breast cancer.[
80
]  Higher numbers of maternal versus paternal
transmission cases are reported,[
81
] likely due to family communication
patterns, to the misconception that breast cancer risk can only be transmitted
through the mother, and to the greater difficulty in recognizing paternal
family histories because of the need to identify more distant relatives with
cancer.  In an analysis of 2,505 women participating in the Family Healthware Impact Trial,[
82
] not only was evidence of underreporting of paternal family history identified, but also women reported a lower level of perceived breast cancer risk with a paternal versus maternal breast cancer family history.[
83
] Physicians and counselors taking a family history are encouraged to
elicit paternal and maternal family histories of breast, ovarian, or
other associated cancers.[
80
]
The accuracy of reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer varies;
some studies found levels of accuracy above 90%,[
84
,
85
] with others finding
more errors in the reporting of cancer in second-degree relatives (SDRs) or more distant
relatives [
86
] or in age of onset of cancer.[
87
]  Less accuracy has been found in the reporting of cancers other
than breast cancer.  Ovarian cancer history was reported with 60% accuracy in
one study compared with 83% accuracy in breast cancer history.[
88
]  Providers
should be aware that there are a few published cases of Munchausen syndrome in
reporting of false family breast cancer history.[
89
]  Much more common is
erroneous reporting of family cancer history due to unintentional errors or
gaps in knowledge, related in some cases to the early death of potential
maternal informants about cancer family history.[
80
]
(Refer to the
Documenting the Family History
section in Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling for more information.)
Targeted written,[
90
,
91
] video, CD-ROM, interactive computer programs and websites,[
92
-
99
] and culturally targeted educational materials [
100
-
102
] may be effective and efficient methods of increasing knowledge about the pros and cons of genetic testing.  Such supplemental materials may allow more efficient use of the time allotted for pretest education and counseling by genetics and primary care providers and may discourage individuals without appropriate indication of risk from seeking genetic testing.[
90
]
Genetic Counseling for Hereditary Predisposition to Breast Cancer
Counseling for breast cancer risk typically involves individuals with family
histories that are potentially attributable to
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
.  It also, however,
may include individuals with family histories of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, Cowden syndrome, or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.[
103
]  (Refer to the
High-Penetrance Breast and/or Gynecologic Cancer Susceptibility Genes
section of this summary for more information.)
Management strategies for carriers may involve decisions about the nature, frequency, and
timing of screening and surveillance procedures, chemoprevention, risk-reducing surgery, and use of
hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The utilization of breast conservation and
radiation as cancer therapy for women who are carriers may be influenced by knowledge of pathogenic variant status.  (Refer to the
Management of Cancer Risks in
BRCA1/2
Carriers
section in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management for more information.)
Counseling also includes consideration of related psychosocial concerns and
discussion of planned family communication and the responsibility to warn other
family members about the possibility of having an increased risk of breast,
ovarian, and other cancers.  Data suggest that individual responses to being tested as adults are influenced by the results status of other family members.[
104
,
105
] Management of anxiety and distress are important
not only as quality-of-life factors, but also because high anxiety may
interfere with the understanding and integration of complex genetic and medical
information and adherence to screening.[
106
-
108
]    Formal, objective evaluation of these outcomes are well documented.  (Refer to the
Emotional Outcomes
and
Behavioral Outcomes
sections of this summary for more information.)
Published descriptions of counseling programs for
BRCA1
(and subsequently for
BRCA2
) testing include strategies for gathering a family history, assessing
eligibility for testing, communicating the considerable volume of relevant
information about breast/ovarian cancer genetics and associated medical and
psychosocial risks and benefits, and discussion of specialized ethical
considerations about confidentiality and family communication.[
109
-
116
] 
Participant distress, intrusive thoughts about cancer, coping style, and social
support were assessed in many prospective testing candidates.  The psychosocial
outcomes evaluated in these programs have included changes in knowledge about
the genetics of breast/ovarian cancer after counseling, risk comprehension,
psychological adjustment, family and social functioning, and reproductive and
health behaviors.[
117
] A Dutch study of communication processes and satisfaction levels of
consultands
going through cancer genetic counseling for inherited cancer syndromes indicated that asking more medical questions (by the counselor), providing more psychosocial information, and longer eye contact by the counselor were associated with lower satisfaction levels. The provision of medical information by the counselor was most highly related to satisfaction and perception that needs have been fulfilled.[
118
]
Many of the psychosocial outcome studies involve specialized, highly selected
research populations, some of which were utilized to map and clone
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
.  One such example is K2082, an extensively studied kindred of more than 800
members of a Utah Mormon family in which a
BRCA1
pathogenic variant accounts for the
observed increased rates of breast and ovarian cancer.  A study of the
understanding that members of this kindred have about breast/ovarian cancer
genetics found that, even in breast cancer research populations, there was
incomplete knowledge about associated risks of colon and prostate cancer, the
existence of options for risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO),
and the complexity of existing psychosocial risks.[
109
]  
A meta-analysis of 21 studies found that genetic counseling was effective in increasing knowledge and improved the accuracy of perceived risk. Genetic counseling did not have a statistically significant long-term impact on affective outcomes including anxiety, distress, or cancer-specific worry and the behavioral outcome of cancer surveillance activities.[
62
] These prospective studies, however, were characterized by a heterogeneity of measures of cancer-specific worry and inconsistent findings in effects of change from baseline.[
62
]
Emotional Outcomes
Although there were initial concerns about the possibility of adverse emotional consequences from
BRCA
testing, most studies conducted over the years have shown low levels of psychological distress among both carriers and noncarriers, particularly over the longer term.[
119
-
121
] In a meta-analysis examining cancer-specific distress over short (0–4 weeks), moderate (5–24 weeks), and long (25–52 weeks) periods of time since the receipt of testing results, carriers were found to demonstrate increased levels of  distress shortly after receiving results, with levels returning to baseline within moderate and long periods of time.[
119
] In contrast, noncarriers and those with inconclusive results showed reduced levels of distress over time.[
119
,
122
] Psychological distress patterns were found to vary as a function of several factors, including the cancer history of the individual and the country within which the study was conducted. Carriers with a personal history of cancer experienced small decreases in distress over time, whereas no changes were observed among carriers without a personal history of cancer. Among individuals with inconclusive results, greater decreases in distress were observed among those without a cancer history than among those with a cancer history.  Among noncarriers, those in the United States experienced significantly greater decreases in psychological distress than  noncarriers from Europe and Australia.  A study conducted in Austria noted that certain subgroups of consultands experienced greater distress, including those who were older, had a more recent cancer diagnosis, or those who had received counseling but declined
BRCA
testing.[
123
]
Several studies have reported on emotional outcomes over longer follow-up periods (i.e., greater than 12 months after disclosure) than those reported in the meta-analysis described above.[
119
] In a U.K. study, cancer-related worry did not differ between carriers and noncarriers at 3 years of follow-up.[
124
] Two U.S.-based studies published since the meta-analytic review [
119
] have reported similar findings among women who were surveyed more than 3 years after receipt of
BRCA
test results.[
125
,
126
]  In a cross-sectional study,[
125
] 167 women who were surveyed more than 4 years after receiving
BRCA
test results reported low levels of genetic testing–specific concerns, as measured using the Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment Scale.[
127
]  In multivariate regression models, carriers of pathogenic variants were significantly more likely to experience distress than were noncarriers. In a second study,[
126
] 464 women were followed prospectively for a median of 5 years (range, 3.4–9.1 y) after testing. Among both affected and unaffected participants,
BRCA
carriers reported significantly higher levels of distress, uncertainty (affected only), perceived stress (affected only), and lower positive testing experiences (unaffected only) than women who received negative results for a known pathogenic variant in the family.[
126
] Although both studies [
125
,
126
] reported greater distress among
BRCA
carriers than among noncarriers, the level of distress was not reflective of clinically significant dysfunction.
Although most studies have reported that a positive
BRCA
test result has a relatively minimal impact on psychological distress, many of these studies were conducted among families with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer who underwent extensive pretest genetic counseling. Therefore, emotional responses may not generalize to individuals who test under different contexts. For example, individuals who are tested with population
BRCA
screening may not have a family history of cancer.[
128
-
130
]  Although pretest genetic counseling is recommended, this is not always done when genetic testing is ordered by nongenetic providers [
131
] or directly through commercial companies.[
132
,
133
]
For example, in a Canadian study of 2,080 Jewish women who participated in a population-based genetic screening study to test for three
BRCA
pathogenic variants common in families of Jewish heritage, women were not offered in-person genetic counseling but were given a pamphlet on genetic testing for
BRCA1/BRCA2
before they provided a DNA sample. One year after genetic testing, women who were positive for a pathogenic variant (n = 18) showed significant increases in cancer-specific distress, whereas no changes in distress were observed among women who were negative for a pathogenic variant.[
129
]  The mean distress score on the Impact of Event Scale for the 18 women with a known pathogenic variant was 25.3 (range, 2–51);  10 of 18 women (56%) scored within moderate (26–43) (n = 7) or severe (44+) (n = 3) ranges. It is unclear from this study whether the increase in distress observed at 1 year of follow-up was due to the lack of in-person genetic counseling, or whether the lower levels of distress at baseline observed were because the women in the study were low risk but eligible for testing because of their ancestry. A follow-up study with this cohort found that distress decreased between 1 to 2 years after testing and that changes in distress varied by risk-reduction options undertaken by carriers. Specifically, those who had undergone RRM or risk-reducing oophorectomy experienced significant decreases in distress compared with those who did not have either surgery.[
130
] Another smaller qualitative study also supports these findings.[
134
]
Similarly, the impact of direct-to-consumer (DTC)
BRCA
testing through commercial companies requires further evaluation. Case studies have reported adverse emotional responses after receipt of a positive
BRCA
result from DTC genetic testing, suggesting the need for further evaluation of the emotional outcomes of women undergoing genetic testing through commercial companies.[
132
,
133
] Only one study, conducted by a commercial company, has attempted to evaluate the impact of
BRCA
testing in this context.[
135
] A total of 32 individuals (16 women and 16 men) who tested positive for one of three
BRCA
founder pathogenic variants
common in AJs completed semi-structured interviews. None of the carriers reported extreme anxiety, although some experienced moderate anxiety (13%) or initial disappointment and anxiety that dissipated over time (28%). These findings should be interpreted with caution given that only 24% (32 of 136) of invited carriers of
BRCA
pathogenic variants participated in the study, raising concerns about selection bias.
Despite evidence of a short-term increase in distress after the receipt of genetic testing results, any adverse responses to a positive carrier status dissipate within 12 months.[
119
] Additional research is needed to examine emotional outcomes for those who are not provided genetic counseling before testing.[
131
]
Emotional outcomes in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients
It is increasingly common for women with breast cancer to pursue genetic counseling and testing at the time of diagnosis to assist with treatment decision making. (Refer to the
Benefits of offering genetic testing at the time of cancer diagnosis
section for more information.)  Given that women with new breast cancer diagnoses are likely to experience some distress, concerns have been raised about the potential for additional adverse psychological implications of rapid genetic counseling and testing (RGT) between diagnosis and surgery.[
136
,
137
] However, data from several studies,[
138
-
140
] including a large observational study [
141
] and a randomized trial,[
142
]    provided evidence indicating that there were no adverse psychological effects associated with RGT. For example, an observational study analyzed 1,007 with newly diagnosed breast cancers from four Canadian academic centers. These patients underwent RGT and  adverse psychological effects were not noted at one week or one year posttesting.[
141
] There were no differences in anxiety, distress, or depression between
BRCA
carriers (6% of the study population) and those with uninformative results in the short-term. However, after one year,
BRCA
carriers had significantly lower depression scores when compared with patients who had uninformative, negative results.  Depression scores  were within the normal range for both groups, and these scores did not reach  depression levels that were clinically significant. Factors associated with lower levels of psychological functioning included lower educational levels, not having family histories of cancer, and undergoing bilateral mastectomies.  Of note, women who had a variant of uncertain significance in the
BRCA1/2
genes and a bilateral mastectomy had higher depression scores than
BRCA
carriers. One randomized controlled trial found that patients undergoing rapid genetic counseling and testing felt more actively involved in treatment decision making than those receiving standard care.[
143
]
Family Effects
Family communication about genetic testing and hereditary risk
Family communication about genetic testing for cancer susceptibility, and 
specifically about the results of
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic testing, is complex.  Age and gender appear to be important variables in the disclosure of genetic test results.  Studies have documented that older women were more likely to disclose genetic test results (especially to their daughters) than  younger women.[
144
,
145
] Female carriers are more likely to disclose their genetic test results
to other family members [
146
] than
are male carriers.[
146
,
147
]  Among males, noncarriers were more likely than carriers
to tell their sisters and children the results of their tests.
BRCA1/BRCA2
carriers who disclosed their results to sisters had a slight decrease in
psychological distress, compared with a slight increase in distress for carriers
who chose not to tell their sisters.  One study found that men reported greater difficulty disclosing a known pathogenic variant to family members than  women (90% vs. 70%).[
148
]
Family communication of
BRCA1/BRCA2
test results to relatives is another factor affecting participation in testing. There have been more studies of communication with FDRs and SDRs than with more distant family members. Studies have investigated the process and content of communication among sisters about
BRCA1/BRCA2
test results.[
149
,
150
] Study results suggest that both carriers of pathogenic variants [
149
] and women with uninformative results [
149
,
150
] communicate with sisters to provide them with genetic risk information. Similar findings were reported in women with uninformative results disclosing test results to their daughters.[
150
]
Among relatives with whom genetic test results were not discussed, the most important reason given was that the affected women were not close to their relatives [
149
] or had a poor relationship with them.[
150
] Studies found that women with a
BRCA
pathogenic variant more often shared their results with their mother and adult sisters and daughters than with their father and adult brothers and sons.[
80
,
144
,
145
,
151
-
153
]
A study that evaluated communication of test results to FDRs at 4 months postdisclosure found that participants were more likely to inform brothers of their results if the
BRCA
pathogenic variant was inherited through the paternal line.[
145
] Another study found that disclosure was limited mainly to FDRs, and dissemination of information to distant relatives was problematic.[
154
] Age was a significant factor in informing distant relatives with younger patients being more willing to communicate their genetic test result.[
149
,
151
,
154
] Additionally, one study found that lower genetic worry, higher interest in genomic information, carrying a
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variant, or having never been married was associated with communication to more family members.[
147
] In contrast, a longer time interval since diagnosis was associated with communication to fewer family members.[
147
]
A few in-depth qualitative studies have looked at issues associated with family communication about genetic testing. Although the findings from these studies may not be generalizable to the larger population of at-risk individuals, they illustrate the complexity of issues involved in conveying hereditary cancer risk information in families.[
155
]  On the basis of 15 interviews conducted with women attending a familial cancer genetics clinic, the authors concluded that while women felt a sense of duty to discuss genetic testing with their relatives, they also experienced conflicting feelings of uncertainty, respect, and isolation.  Decisions about whom in the family to inform and how to inform them about hereditary cancer and genetic testing may be influenced by tensions between women's need to fulfill social roles and their responsibilities toward themselves and others.[
155
] Another qualitative study of 21 women who attended a familial breast and ovarian cancer genetics clinic suggested that some women may find it difficult to communicate about inherited cancer risk with their partners and with certain relatives, especially brothers, because of their own fears and worries about cancer.[
153
]  This study also suggested that how genetic risk information is shared within families may depend on the existing norms for communicating about cancer in general.  For example, family members may be generally open to sharing information about cancer with each other, may selectively avoid discussing cancer information with certain family members to protect themselves or other relatives from negative emotional reactions, or may ask a specific relative to act as an intermediary to  disclosure of information to other family members.[
156
]  The potential importance of individuals outside the family, such as friends, as both confidantes about inherited cancer risk information and as sources of support for coping with this information was also noted in the study.[
153
]
A study of 31 mothers with a documented
BRCA
pathogenic variant explored patterns of dissemination to children.[
157
] Of those who chose to disclose test results to their children, age of offspring was the most important factor. Fifty percent of the children who were told were  aged 20  to 29 years and slightly more than 25% of the children were aged 19 years or younger. Sons and daughters were notified in equal numbers. More than 70% of mothers informed their children within a week of learning their test result. Ninety-three percent of mothers who chose not to share their results with their children indicated that it was because their children were too young. These findings were consistent with three other studies showing that children younger than 13 years were less likely to be informed about test 
results compared with older children.[
145
,
158
,
159
] Another study of 187 mothers undergoing
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing evaluated their need for resources to prepare for a facilitated conversation about sharing their
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing results with their children. Seventy-eight percent of mothers were interested in three or more resources, including literature (93%), family counseling (86%), talk to prior participants (79%), and support groups (54%).[
158
]
A longitudinal study of 153 women self-referred for genetic testing for
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants and 118 of their partners evaluated communication about genetic testing and distress before testing and at 6 months 
posttesting.[
160
] The study found that most couples discussed the decision to undergo testing (98%), most test participants felt their partners were supportive, and most women disclosed test results to their partners (97%, n = 148). Test participants who felt their partners were supportive during pretest discussions experienced less distress after disclosure, and 
partners who felt more comfortable sharing concerns with test participants pretest experienced less distress after disclosure. Six-month follow-up revealed that 22% of participants felt the need to talk about the testing experience with their partners in the week before the interview. Most participants (72%, n = 107) reported comfort in sharing concerns with their partners, and 5% (n = 7) reported relationship strain as a result of genetic testing. In couples in which the woman had a positive genetic test result, more relationship strain, more protective buffering of their partners, and more discussion of related concerns were reported than in couples in which the woman had a true-negative or uninformative result.[
160
]
A study of 561 FDRs of women who had undergone
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
genetic testing found that 22% of FDRs did not recall being informed of the genetic test results despite the women reporting that the results had been shared.[
161
] Men were less likely to recall receiving the results (
P
> .001). Of those with recall about receiving the test results, 10.5% of FDRs did not recall the findings. For those with recall of the results, 17.9% of FDRs had an interpretation that was discordant with the correct results. Accuracy of test results recall was greater for informative test results (those that were either true positive or true negative) (
P
= .029). However, regardless of the test results, FDRs perceived the cancer risk to be higher before they learned of the findings than after (74%  and 53% of FDRs reported that they believed their risk for cancer was greater than average before and after hearing test results, respectively).
There is a small but growing body of literature regarding psychological effects in men who have a family history of breast cancer and who are considering or have had
BRCA
testing. A qualitative study of 22 men from 16 high-risk families in Ireland revealed that more men in the study with daughters were tested than men without daughters.  These men reported little communication with relatives about the illness, with some men reporting being excluded from discussion about cancer 
among female family members.  Some men in the study also reported actively avoiding open discussion with daughters and other relatives.[
162
] In contrast, a study of 59 men testing positive for a
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant found that most men participated in family discussions about breast and/or ovarian cancer. However, fewer than half of the men participated in family discussions about risk-reducing surgery. The main reason given for having
BRCA
testing was concern for their children and a need for certainty about whether they could have transmitted the pathogenic variant to their children. In this study, 79% of participating men had at least one daughter. Most of these men described how their relationships had been strengthened after receipt of
BRCA
results, helping communication in the family and greater understanding.[
163
] Men in both studies expressed fears of developing cancer themselves.  Irish men especially reported 
fear of cancer in sexual organs.
Family functioning
One study assessed 212 individuals from 13   families with HBOC who received genetic counseling and were offered
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing for documented pathogenic variants in the family. Individuals who were not tested were found 6 to 9 months later to have significantly greater increases in family expressiveness and cohesiveness compared with those who were tested. Individuals who were randomly assigned to a client-centered versus problem-solving genetic counseling intervention had a significantly greater reduction in conflict, regardless of the test decision.[
50
]
Partners of high-risk women
Many studies have looked at the psychological effects in women of having a high risk of developing cancer, either on the basis of carrying a
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant or having a strong family history of cancer.  Some studies have also examined the effects on the partners of such women.
A Canadian study assessed 59 spouses of women found to have a
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant.  All were supportive of their spouses’ decision to undergo genetic testing and 17% wished they had been more involved in the genetic testing process.  Spouses who reported that genetic testing had no impact on their relationship had long-term relationships (mean duration 27 years).  Forty-six  percent of spouses reported that their major concern was of their partner dying of cancer.  Nineteen percent were concerned their spouse would develop cancer and 14% were concerned their children would also be carriers of
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants.[
164
]
In a U.S. study, 118 partners of women who underwent genetic testing for pathogenic variants in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
completed a survey before testing and then again 6 months after result disclosure.  At 6 months, only 10 partners reported that they had not been told of the test result.  Ninety-one percent reported that the testing had not caused strain on their relationship.  Partners who were comfortable sharing concerns before testing experienced less distress after testing.  Protective buffering was not found to impact distress levels of partners.[
160
]
An Australian study of 95 unaffected women at high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer (13 carriers of pathogenic variants and 82 with unknown variant status) and their partners showed that although the majority of male partners had distress levels comparable to a normative population sample, 10% had significant levels of distress that indicated the need for further clinical intervention. Men with a high monitoring coping style and greater perceived breast cancer risk for their wives reported higher levels of distress. Open communication between the men and their partners and the occurrence of a cancer-related event in the wife’s family in the last year were associated with lower distress levels. When men were asked what kind of information and support they would like for themselves and their partners, 57.9% reported that they would like more information about breast and ovarian cancer, and 32.6% said they would like more support in dealing with their partner's risk. Twenty-five percent of men had suggestions on how to improve services for partners of high-risk women, including strategies on how to best support their partner, greater encouragement from  health care professionals to attend appointments, and meeting with other partners.[
165
]
A review of this literature reported that the
BRCA
testing process may be distressing for male partners, particularly for those with spouses identified as carriers. Male partner distress appears to be associated with their beliefs about the woman’s breast cancer risk, lack of couple communication, and feelings of alienation from the testing process.[
166
]
At-risk males
A review of the literature on the experiences of males in families with a known
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variant reported that while the data are limited, men from variant-positive families are less likely than females to participate in communication regarding genetics at every level, including the counseling and testing process. Men are less likely to be informed of genetic test results received by female relatives, and most men from these families do not pursue their own genetic testing.[
167
]
A study of Dutch men at increased risk of having inherited a
BRCA1
pathogenic variant reported a tendency for the men to deny or minimize the emotional effects of their risk status, and to focus on medical implications for their female relatives. Men in these families, however, also reported considerable distress in relation to their female relatives.[
168
]  In another study of male psychological functioning during breast cancer testing, 28 men belonging to 18 different high-risk families (with a 25% or 50% risk of having inherited a
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant) participated.  The study purpose was to analyze distress in males at risk of carrying a
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant who 
applied for genetic testing.  Of the men studied, most had low 
pretest distress; scores were lowest for men who were optimistic or who did not have daughters. Most carriers of pathogenic variants had normal levels of anxiety and depression and reported no guilt, though some anticipated increased distress and feelings of responsibility if their daughters developed breast or ovarian cancer. None of the noncarriers reported feeling guilty.[
169
] In one study,[
163
]  adherence to recommended screening guidelines after testing was analyzed.  In this study, more than half of male carriers of pathogenic variants did not adhere to the screening guidelines recommended after disclosure of genetic test results. These findings are consistent with those for female carriers of
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants.[
163
,
170
]
A multicenter U.K. cohort study examined prospective outcomes of
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing in 193 individuals, of which 20% were men aged 28 to 86 years. Men’s distress levels were low, did not differ among carriers and noncarriers, and did not change from baseline (before genetic testing) to the 3-year follow-up. Twenty-two percent of male carriers of pathogenic variants received colorectal cancer screening and 44% received prostate cancer screening;[
124
] however, it is unclear whether men in this study were following age-appropriate screening guidelines.
Children
Several studies have explored communication of
BRCA
test results to at-risk children. Across all studies, the rate of disclosure to children ranging in age from 4 to 25 years is approximately 50%.[
145
,
151
,
154
,
158
,
171
-
174
]   In general, age of offspring was the most important factor in deciding whether to disclose test results.  In one study of 31 mothers disclosing their
BRCA
test results, 50% of the children who were informed of the results were aged 20 to 29 years and slightly more than 25% of the children were aged 19 years or younger. Sons and daughters were notified in equal numbers.[
157
] Similarly, in another study of 42 female carriers of
BRCA
pathogenic variants, 83% of offspring older than age 18 years were told of the results, while only 21% of offspring aged 13 years or younger were told.[
158
]
Several studies have also looked at the timing of disclosure to children after parents receive their test results. Although the majority of children were told within a week to several months after results disclosure,[
145
,
157
,
158
] some parents chose to delay disclosure.[
158
] Reasons for delaying disclosure included waiting for the child to get older, allowing time for the parent to adjust to the information, and waiting until results could be shared in person (in the case of adult children living away from home).[
158
]
In one study, participants
who told children younger than 13 years about their carrier status had
increased distress, and those who did not tell their young children experienced
a slight decrease in distress. Communication with young children was found to be influenced by developmental variables such as age and style of parent/child communication.[
173
]
One study looked at the reaction of children to results disclosure or the effect on the parent-child relationship of communicating the results.[
158
] With regard to offspring’s understanding of the information, almost half of parents from one study reported that their child did not appear to understand the significance of a positive test result, although older children were reported to have a better understanding. This same study also showed that 48% of parents reported at least one negative reaction in their child, ranging from anxiety or concern (22%) to crying and fear (26%). It should be noted, however, that in this study children's level of understanding and reactions to the test result were measured qualitatively and based only on the parents' perception. Also, given the retrospective design of the study, there was a potential for recall bias. There were no significant differences in emotional reaction depending on age or gender of the child. Lastly, 65% of parents reported no change in their relationship with their child, while 5 parents (22%) reported a strengthening of their relationship.
Interestingly, a large multicenter study of 869 mother-daughter pairs (the daughters were aged 6 to 13 y) found that girls with a family history of breast cancer or a familial
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant   compared with those without such family histories had better psychosocial adjustment by maternal report.[
175
]  However, based on a combination of maternal report and direct assessment of girls aged 10 to 13 years,  girls with family histories of breast cancer or familial
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants experienced greater breast cancer–specific distress and a higher perceived risk of breast cancer  than their peers without such family histories.  Moreover, higher daughter distress was associated with higher maternal distress. A similarly designed study in older girls, aged 11 to 19 years, found that higher breast cancer–specific distress in daughters was associated with perceived risk and maternal distress. This older age group had higher self-esteem than did their peers without a family history of breast cancer.[
176
]
Another study of 187 mothers undergoing
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing evaluated their need for resources to prepare for a facilitated conversation about sharing their
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing results with their children. Seventy-eight percent of mothers were interested in three or more resources, including literature (93%), family counseling (86%), talking to prior participants (79%), and support groups (54%).[
177
]
Testing for
BRCA1/BRCA2
has been almost universally limited to adults older than 18
years.  The risks of testing children for adult-onset disorders (such as breast
and ovarian cancer), as inferred from developmental data on children’s medical 
understanding and ability to provide informed consent, have been outlined in
several reports.[
51
-
54
]  Surveys of parental interest in testing children
for adult-onset hereditary cancers suggest that parents are more eager to
test their children than to be tested themselves for a breast cancer gene,
suggesting potential conflicts for providers.[
178
,
179
]  In a general population
survey in the United States, 71% of parents said that it was moderately, very,
or extremely likely that if they carried a breast-cancer predisposing pathogenic variant,
they would test a 13-year-old daughter now to determine her breast cancer
gene status.[
178
]  To date, no data exist on the testing of children for
BRCA1/BRCA2
, though some researchers believe it is necessary to test the validity
of assumptions underlying the general prohibition of testing of children for
breast/ovarian cancer and other adult-onset disease genes.[
57
-
59
] In one study,  20 children (aged  11–17 y)  of a selected group of mothers undergoing genetic testing (80% of whom previously had breast cancer and all of whom had discussed
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing with their children) completed self-report questionnaires on their health beliefs and attitudes toward cancer, feelings related to cancer, and behavioral problems.[
60
] Ninety percent of children thought they would want cancer risk information as adults; half worried about themselves or a family  member developing cancer. There was no evidence of emotional distress or behavioral problems. Another study by this group [
173
] found that 1 month after disclosure of
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic test results, 53% of 42 enrolled mothers of children aged 8 to 17 years had discussed their result with one or more of their children. Age of the child rather than pathogenic variant status of the mother influenced whether they were told, as did family health communication style.
Prenatal diagnosis and preimplantation genetic testing
The possibility of transmitting a pathogenic variant to a child may pose a concern to families affected by HBOC,[
180
] perhaps to the extent that some carriers may avoid childbearing.[
181
,
182
] These concerns also may prompt women to consider using prenatal testing methods to help reduce the risk of transmission.[
180
,
183
] Prenatal diagnosis is an encompassing term used to refer to any medical procedure conducted to assess the presence of a genetic disorder in a fetus. Methods include amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling (CVS).[
184
,
185
] Both procedures carry some risk of miscarriage and some evidence suggests fetal defects may result from using these tests.[
184
,
185
] Moreover, discovering the fetus is a carrier for a genetic defect may impose a difficult decision for couples regarding pregnancy continuation or termination. An alternative to these tests is preimplantation genetic testing (PGT), a procedure used to test fertilized embryos for genetic disorders before uterine implantation,[
180
,
186
,
187
] thereby avoiding the potential dangers associated with amniocentesis and CVS and the decision to terminate a pregnancy. Using the information obtained from the genetic testing, potential parents can decide whether or not to implant. PGT can be used to detect pathogenic variants in hereditary cancer predisposing genes, including
BRCA
.[
180
,
183
]
In the United States, a series of studies has evaluated awareness, interest (e.g., would consider using PGT), and attitudes related to PGT among members of Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered (FORCE), an advocacy organization focused on individuals at increased risk of HBOC.[
180
,
183
,
188
] The first study was a web-based survey of 283 members,[
180
] the second included 205 attendees of the 2007 annual FORCE conference,[
183
] and the third was a web-based survey of 962 members.[
188
,
189
] These studies have documented low levels of awareness, with 20% to 32% of study respondents reporting having heard of PGT before study participation.[
183
,
188
] With respect to interest in PGT, the first study [
180
] found only 13% of women would be likely to use PGT, whereas, 33% of respondents in the subsequent FORCE studies reported that they would consider using PGT.[
183
,
188
] In the third FORCE-based study (n = 962),[
188
] multivariable analysis revealed PGT interest was associated with the desire to have more children, having previously had any prenatal genetic test, and previous awareness of PGT. Attitudinal predictors of interest in PGT included agreement that others at risk of HBOC should be offered PGT; the belief that PGT is acceptable for individuals at risk of HBOC; the belief that PGT information should be given to individuals at risk of HBOC; and endorsement of PGT benefits of having children without genetic variants and eliminating genetic diseases. Conversely, those who indicated that PGT was “too much like playing God” and reported that they considered PGT in the context of religion, had less interest in PGT.
It is unknown whether the attitudes of FORCE members toward PGT are representative of the majority of
BRCA
carriers. A cross-sectional study of 1,081
BRCA
carriers, 65% of whom were recruited through FORCE and the remainder by the University of Pennsylvania, revealed that a majority of carriers were in favor of offering PGT and prenatal diagnosis to carriers (59% for PGT and 55.5% for prenatal diagnosis).[
190
] Of those who indicated that their families were not complete, 41% of
BRCA
carriers reported that their carrier status impacted their decision about future biological children. This study also revealed that 21.5% of unpartnered
BRCA
carriers felt more pressure to get married.
The U.K. Human Fertilization and Embryology authority has approved the use of PGT for HBOC. In a sample of 102 women with a
BRCA
pathogenic variant, most were supportive of PGT but only 38% of the women who had completed  their families would consider it for themselves had PGT been available, and only 14% of women who were contemplating a future pregnancy would consider PGT.[
191
] In a study of 77 individuals undergoing
BRCA
testing as part of a multicenter cohort study in Spain, 61% of respondents reported they would consider PGT. Factors associated with PGT interest were age 40 years and older  and had a prior cancer diagnosis.[
192
]
In France, couples who obtain authorization from a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis team may access PGT free of charge as a benefit of their national 
health care system. However, no
BRCA
carriers have been authorized to use PGT. In a national study of 490 unaffected carriers of
BRCA
pathogenic variants of childbearing age (women aged 18–49 y; men aged 18–69 y), 16% stated that
BRCA
test results had altered their ongoing plans for childbearing.[
193
] Upon qualitative analysis of written comments provided by some respondents, 
the primary impact was related to accelerating the timing of pregnancy, feelings of guilt about possibly passing on the pathogenic variant to offspring, and having future children. In response to a 
hypothetical scenario in which PGT was readily available, 33% of participants reported that they would undergo PGT. Factors associated with this intention were having no future reproductive plans at the time of the survey, feeling pregnancy termination was an acceptable option in the context of identifying a
BRCA
pathogenic variant, and having fewer cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer in the family. When presented with questions about expectations about delivery of PGT or prenatal diagnosis  information, 85% of respondents felt it should be provided along with
BRCA
test results; 45% felt that it should be provided when carriers decide to have children. Respondents stated 
that they would expect this information to be delivered by cancer geneticists (92%), obstetrician/gynecologists (76%), and general practitioners (48%).
A small (N = 25) qualitative study of women of reproductive age positive for a
BRCA
pathogenic variant who underwent genetic testing before having children evaluated how their
BRCA
status influenced their attitudes about reproductive genetic testing (both PGT and prenatal diagnosis) and decisions about having children.[
194
] In this study, the decision to undergo
BRCA
testing was primarily motivated by the desire to manage one’s personal cancer risk, rather than a desire to inform future reproductive decisions. The perceived severity of HBOC influenced concerns about passing on a
BRCA
pathogenic variant to children and also influenced willingness to consider PGT or prenatal diagnosis. Decisions about PGT and prenatal diagnosis also varied based on the participant's  personal experiences. Most did not believe that a known
BRCA
pathogenic variant was a reason to terminate a pregnancy. As observed in prior studies, knowledge of reproductive options varied; however, there was a tendency among participants to view PGT as more acceptable than prenatal diagnosis with regard to termination of 
pregnancy. Decisions regarding the pros and cons of PGT versus prenatal diagnosis with termination of pregnancy were driven primarily by personal preferences and experiences, rather than by morality judgments. For example, women were deterred from PGT based on the need to undergo
in vitro
fertilization and to take hormones that might increase cancer risk and based on the observed 
experiences of others who underwent this procedure.
One study has examined these issues among high-risk men recruited from FORCE and Craigslist (a bulletin board website) (N = 228).[
195
] Similar to the previous studies of women, only 20% of men were aware of PGT before survey participation. In a multivariate analysis, those who selected the “other” option for possible benefits of PGT compared with those who selected from several predetermined options (e.g., having children without genetic variants) and those who considered PGT in the context of 
religion (as opposed to health and safety) were less likely to report that they would ever consider using PGT.
Cultural/Community Effects
The recognition that
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants are prevalent, not only in
breast/ovarian cancer families but also in some ethnic groups,[
196
] has led to
considerable discussion of the ethical, psychological, and other implications of
having one’s ethnicity be a factor in determination of disease predisposition. 
Concerns that people will think everything is solely determined by genetic factors and the creation of a genetic underclass [
197
]
have been voiced.  Questions about the impact on the group of being singled out
as having genetic vulnerability to breast cancer have been raised.  There is
also confusion about who gives or withholds permission for the group to be
involved in studies of their genetic identity.  These issues challenge
traditional views on informed consent as a function of individual autonomy.[
198
]
A growing literature on the unique factors influencing a variety of cultural subgroups suggests the importance of developing culturally specific genetic counseling and educational approaches.[
100
,
199
-
203
] The inclusion of members within the community of interest (e.g., breast cancer survivors, advocates, and community leaders) may enhance the development of culturally tailored genetic counseling materials.[
101
] One study showed that participation in any genetic counseling (culturally mediated or standard approaches) reduced perceived risk of developing breast cancer.[
204
]
Ethical Concerns
The human implications of the ethical issues raised by the advent of genetic
testing for breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility are described in case studies,[
205
] essays,[
206
,
207
] and research reports.  Issues about rights and
responsibilities in families concerning the spread of information about genetic
risk promise to be major ethical and legal dilemmas in the coming decades.
Studies have shown that 62% of studied family members were aware of the family
history and that 88% of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer family members
surveyed have significant concerns about privacy and confidentiality. 
Concern about cancer in third-degree relatives, or relatives further
removed, did not differ from  concern about cancer in the
proband's
FDRs or SDRs.[
208
]  Only half of surveyed FDRs of women with
breast or ovarian cancer felt that written permission should be required to
disclose
BRCA1/BRCA2
test results to a spouse or immediate family member. 
Attitudes toward testing varied by ethnicity, previous exposure to genetic
information, age, optimism, and information style.  Altruism is a factor
motivating genetic testing in some people.[
209
]  Many
professional groups have made recommendations regarding informed
consent.[
113
,
209
-
212
]  There is some evidence that not all practitioners are
aware of or follow these guidelines.[
213
]  Research shows that many
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic testing consent forms do not fulfill recommendations by professional
groups about the 11 areas that should be addressed,[
214
] and they omit highly
relevant points of information.[
213
]  In a study of women with a history of breast or ovarian cancer, the interviews yielded that the women reported feeling  inadequately prepared for the ethical dilemmas they encountered when imparting genetic information to family members.[
215
] These data suggest that more preparation about disclosure to family members before testing reduces the emotional burden of disseminating genetic information to family members.  Patients and health care providers would benefit from enhanced consideration of the ethical issues of warning family members about hereditary cancer risk. (Refer to the PDQ summaries
Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling
and
Cancer Genetics Overview
for more information about the ethics of cancer genetics and genetic testing.)
Psychosocial Aspects of Cancer Risk Management for Hereditary Breast and Gynecologic Cancers
Decision aids for individuals considering risk management options for hereditary breast and gynecologic cancers
A systematic review of decision aids for
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
carriers suggested that these tools are beneficial during the decision-making process.[
216
]
BRCA1/BRCA2
carriers who used decision aids had lower decisional conflict (regarding treatment decisions), were more likely to reach risk-management decisions, and were more satisfied with their decisions than those who did not use decision aids. There were mixed or null findings regarding information-related outcomes like participant knowledge and whether there were consistent differences in actual risk-management choices.
A telephone-based intervention study used integrated motivational interviewing techniques and was led by genetic counselors.[
217
] This study found no differences in rates of RRSO among
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
carriers in the intervention arm and the control arm after 1 year. However, women in the intervention arm had significantly lower decisional conflict and higher knowledge scores after 1 year. Two years after the intervention, 53.9% of women in the intervention arm had undergone RRSO, while 32.6% of women in the control arm had undergone RRSO.
Uptake of cancer risk management options
Several studies have examined uptake and adherence to cancer risk management options in individuals who have had genetic counseling and testing for
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants. Outcomes vary across studies and include the following: 1) uptake/adherence to screening options (mammography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and 2) selection of risk-reducing options (i.e., risk-reducing mastectomy [RRM] and/or RRSO).
Most studies reported outcomes by pathogenic variant carrier status. Follow-up time after  participants received their genetic test results also varied across studies, ranging from 12 months to several years. The Hereditary Breast Cancer Clinical Study Group assessed uptake of cancer risk management options in 6,223 women with a
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant.[
218
] These women were  25 to 80 years old and lived in  10 different countries (including the United States). Data from this study  revealed the following:
Mammography
In a personal communication, the first author shared that mammography uptake was defined as participants' self-reporting of mammography screenings after they received their genetic test results (K. Metcalfe, PhD, email, May 30, 2023).[
218
] Mammography  uptake  was 82%, but this value diminished over time. The authors suggested that this decrease in mammography uptake may have been due to an increase in breast MRI uptake in participating countries, like  Poland, where use of MRI exceeds the use of mammography.
MRI
In a personal communication, the first author shared that MRI uptake was defined as participants' self-reporting of screening MRIs after they received their genetic test results (K. Metcalfe, PhD, email, May 30, 2023).[
218
] The rate of screening MRI increased in women tested from  Canada, Poland, and the United States from  2009 and onward (81.3%) when compared with women who tested prior to 2009 (69.5%). Overall, 72.8% of women in this study reported receiving a breast MRI in the past year.
Risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM)
Uptake of RRM in women without a history of breast cancer was 27.8%, with RRM occurring at a mean age of 41.8 years (range, 19–78 y).
The rate of RRM uptake was the highest in the United States (49.9%).
Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO)
Uptake of RRSO varied slightly by gene, with 62.8% of
BRCA1
carriers   and 69.7% of
BRCA2
carriers receiving RRSO.
Uptake of RRSO was 70.7% in women with personal histories of breast cancer.
For women who chose RRSO, the age of surgery also varied by gene. In
BRCA1
carriers, 7.2% had RRSO performed before age 35 years, whereas in
BRCA2
carriers, 37.8% had RRSO performed before age 45 years.
Chemoprevention
Use of tamoxifen or raloxifene for risk reduction in women without histories of breast cancer was 6.3% (n = 155/2463).
Chemoprevention use was highest in the United States (15%), with use occurring in 12.7% of
BRCA1
carriers and in 17.4% of
BRCA2
carriers.
In summary, breast cancer screening with mammogram in
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
carriers may be suboptimal and can diminish over time.[
218
] A portion of this decline is associated with an increase in breast MRI use, and a corresponding decrease in mammography  screening, in certain countries. However, the uptake of breast MRI in
BRCA1/BRCA2
carriers was also suboptimal.
Women were more likely to undergo RRM when testing from 2009 and onward (30.3%) when compared with those who tested prior to 2009 (26.9%;
P
= .04).[
218
] Decisions about RRM may be influenced by personal factors, such as young patient age. When compared with women aged 30 to 39 years, women aged 50 to 59 years had lower rates of RRM (statistically significant) at 2, 5, and 10 years post–genetic testing.[
219
] Other factors that may influence decisions about RRM include the following:  a family history of breast cancer, psychosocial factors (such as a desire to reduce cancer-related distress), recommendation from a health care provider, cultural/health care system–related factors, intact ovaries, and a recent diagnosis of breast/ovarian cancer.[
220
,
221
] An individual’s choice to have RRM also appears to be influenced by pretreatment genetic education and counseling, regardless of the patient's genetic test results.[
222
] Additionally, when those diagnosed with breast cancer had
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic test results at the time of surgical decision-making, this resulted  in increased uptake of bilateral mastectomy (OR, 8.23; 95% CI, 2.55–26.59;
P
< .001).[
223
]
Uptake of RRSO was associated with increasing age, White race, having children, a family history of ovarian cancer, a personal history of mastectomy, higher perceived risk of ovarian cancer, and higher perceived benefit of RRSO.[
224
,
225
] The decision to have RRSO  also varied based on pathogenic variant carrier status, with carriers of
BRCA1
pathogenic variants (N = 226) undergoing RRSO more frequently than those with
BRCA2
pathogenic variants (N = 188;
P
= .01).[
219
] In this study, a small proportion of women who were previously healthy developed breast cancer  and chose to have RRSO after their cancer diagnoses (N = 14/60; 23.3%).
BRCA
testing, when offered to women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, has been shown to influence surgical decision making in that carriers are more likely to opt for bilateral mastectomy compared with noncarriers.[
222
,
226
,
227
] Predictors of contralateral  RRM before genetic counseling and testing included younger age at breast cancer diagnosis, more time since diagnosis, having at least one affected FDR, and not being employed full-time.  In the year after disclosure of test results, 18% of women who tested positive for a
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant and 2% of those whose test results were uninformative underwent contralateral  RRM.  Predictors of contralateral  RRM after genetic testing included younger age at breast cancer diagnosis, higher cancer-specific distress before genetic counseling, and having a positive
BRCA1/BRCA2
test result.  In this study, contralateral  RRM was not associated with distress at 1 year after disclosure of genetic test results.  A retrospective chart review evaluated uptake of bilateral mastectomies in 110 women who underwent
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic testing before making surgical decisions about the treatment of newly diagnosed breast cancer.  Carriers of
BRCA
pathogenic variants were more likely to undergo bilateral mastectomies than were women in whom no variant was detected (83% vs. 37%;
P
= .046).[
228
]  The only predictor of contralateral RRM in women without a pathogenic variant was being married (
P
= .03).  Age, race, parity, disease stage and biomarkers, increased mammographic breast density, and breast MRI did not influence contralateral RRM decisions at the time of primary surgical treatment.
A study conducted from 2006 to 2014 in 11 U.S. academic and community centers of 897 women, aged 40 years and younger at breast cancer diagnosis, found that rates of
BRCA
genetic testing have increased over time.[
227
]  Within 1  year after diagnosis,  87% of the sample underwent
BRCA
testing.  The rate increased from 77% of newly diagnosed women tested in 2006 to 95% of women tested in 2013.  Among women who tested positive for a pathogenic
BRCA
variant and stated that testing affected their surgery decisions (n = 88), 86% underwent bilateral mastectomy compared with 51% of noncarriers (
P
< .001).  Among untested women, about one-third reported that they were not told by a health care provider that they were candidates for
BRCA
testing; yet, according to national guidelines, all were eligible for testing solely on the basis of their age at diagnosis.
A systematic review of risk-reducing salpingectomy  with delayed oophorectomy (RRDSO) found that the avoidance of surgical menopause, preservation of fertility, concerns about sexual functioning, a family history of breast cancer, and an interest to avoid HRT were all related to being more likely to accept this option.[
229
] Those concerned with surgical timing, complications, and  ongoing cancer risk were less likely to opt for RRDSO. In a small cohort of premenopausal
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
carriers (n = 43), 44% chose to pursue RRDSO, 28% chose to pursue RRSO, and 28% chose to pursue only screening.[
230
] One year after surgery, cancer worry had decreased among all of those who elected to have surgery. Surgical complications were not reported.
Cancer screening and risk-reducing behaviors
Data are now emerging regarding uptake and adherence to cancer risk management recommendations such as screening and risk-reducing interventions.  Cancer screening adherence and risk-reduction behaviors as defined by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines were assessed in a cross-sectional study of 214 women with a personal history (n = 134) or family history (n = 80) of breast or ovarian cancer.  Among unaffected women older than  40 years, 10% had not had a mammogram or clinical breast examination (CBE) in the previous year and 46% did not practice breast self-examination (BSE).  Among  women previously affected with breast or ovarian cancer, 21% had not had a mammogram, 32% had not had a CBE, and 39% did not practice BSE.[
231
]
Three hundred and twelve women who were counseled and tested for
BRCA
pathogenic variants between 1997 and 2005 responded to a survey regarding their perception of genetic testing for HBOC. The survey included questions on risk reduction options, including screening and risk-reducing surgeries. Two hundred and seventeen (70%) of the women had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and 86 (28%) tested positive for a pathogenic variant in either the
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
gene. None of the
BRCA
-positive women agreed that mammograms are difficult procedures because of the discomfort, while 11 (5.4%) of the
BRCA
-negative women did agree with this statement. Both groups (
BRCA
-positive and
BRCA
-negative) agreed that risk-reducing surgeries provide the best means for lowering cancer risk and worry, and most patients in both groups expressed the belief that RRM is not too drastic, too scary, or too disfiguring.[
232
]
A prospective study from the United Kingdom examined the psychological impact of mammographic screening in 1,286 women aged 35 to 49 years who have a family history of breast cancer and were participants in a multicenter screening program.  Mammographic abnormalities that required additional evaluation were detected in 112 women. These women, however, did not show a statistically significant increase in cancer worry or negative psychological consequences as a result of these findings.  The 1,174 women who had no mammographic abnormality detected experienced a decrease in cancer worry and a decrease in negative psychological consequences compared with baseline after receipt of their results.  At 6 months, the entire cohort had experienced a decrease in measures of cancer worry and psychological consequences of breast screening.[
233
]
A qualitative study explored health care professionals’ views regarding the provision of information about health protective behaviors (e.g., exercise and diet).  Seven medical specialists and ten genetic counselors were interviewed during a focus group or individually. The study reported wide variation in the content and extent of information provided about health-protective behaviors and in general, participants did not consider it their role to promote such behaviors in the context of a genetic counseling session.  There was agreement, however, about the need to form consensus about provision of such information both within and across risk assessment clinics.[
234
]
Not all studies specify whether screening uptake rates fall within recommended guidelines for the targeted population or the specific clinical scenario, nor do they report on other variables that may influence cancer screening recommendations. For example, women who have a history of atypical ductal hyperplasia would be advised to follow screening recommendations that may differ from those of the general population.
Psychosocial Outcome Studies
Psychosocial outcomes associated with risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM)
A prospective study conducted in the Netherlands found that among 26 carriers of
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants, the 14 women who chose mastectomy had higher distress both before test result disclosure and 6 and 12 months later, compared with the 12 carriers who chose surveillance and compared with 53 women negative for a pathogenic variant. Overall, however, anxiety declined in women undergoing RRM; at 1 year, their anxiety scores were closer to those of women choosing surveillance and to the scores of women negative for a pathogenic variant.[
235
] Interestingly, women opting for RRM had lower pretest satisfaction with their breasts and general body image than carriers who opted for surveillance or noncarriers of
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variants. Of the women who had an RRM, all but one did not regret the decision at 1 year posttest disclosure, but many had difficulties with body image, sexual interest and functioning, and self-esteem. The perception that doctors had inadequately informed them about the consequences of RRM was associated with regret.[
235
] At the 5-year follow-up, women who had undergone RRM had less favorable body image and changes in sexual relationships, but also had a significant reduction in the fear of developing cancer.[
236
] In a study of 78 women who underwent risk-reducing surgery (including
BRCA1/BRCA2
carriers and women who were from high-risk families with no detectable
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant), cancer-specific and general distress were assessed 2 weeks before surgery and at 6 and 12 months postsurgery.[
237
]  The sample included women who had RRM and RRSO alone and women who had both surgeries.  There was no observable increase in distress over the 1-year period.
Mixed psychosocial outcomes were reported in a follow-up study (mean, 14 y) of 609 women who received RRM at the Mayo Clinic.  Seventy percent were satisfied with RRM, 11% were neutral, and 19% were dissatisfied.  Eighteen percent believed that if they had the choice to make again, they probably or definitely would not have an RRM.  About three-quarters said their worry about cancer was diminished by surgery.  One-half reported no change in their satisfaction with body image; 16% reported improved body image after surgery.  Thirty-six percent said they were dissatisfied with their body image after RRM.  About one-quarter of the women reported adverse impact of RRM on their sexual relationships and sense of femininity, and 18% had diminished self-esteem.  Factors most strongly associated with satisfaction with RRM were postsurgical satisfaction with appearance, reduced stress, no reconstruction or lack of problems with implants, and no change or improvement in sexual relationships.  Women who cited physician advice as the primary reason for choosing RRM tended to be dissatisfied after RRM.[
238
]
A study of 60 healthy women who underwent RRM measured levels of satisfaction, body image, sexual functioning, intrusion and avoidance, and current psychological status at a mean of 4 years and 4 months postsurgery. Of this group, 76.7% had either a strong family history (21.7%) or carried a
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
pathogenic variant (55%). Overall, 97% of the women surveyed were either satisfied (17%) or extremely satisfied (80%) with their decision to have RRM, and all but one participant would recommend this procedure to other women. Most women (66.7%) reported that surgery had no impact on their sexual life, although 31.7% reported a worsening sexual life, and 76.6% reported either no change in body image or an improvement in body image, regardless of whether reconstruction was performed. Worsening self-image was reported by 23.3% of women after surgery. Women’s mean distress levels after surgery were only slightly above normal levels, although those women who continued to perceive their postsurgery breast cancer risk as high had higher mean levels of global and cancer-related distress than those who perceived their risk as low. Additionally, carriers of
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
pathogenic variants and women with a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer had higher mean levels of cancer-related distress than women with a limited family history.[
239
]
Very little is known about how the results of genetic testing affect treatment decisions at the time of cancer diagnosis.  Two studies explored genetic counseling and
BRCA1/BRCA2
genetic testing at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.[
24
,
222
]  One of these studies found that genetic testing at the time of diagnosis significantly altered surgical decision making, with more pathogenic variant carriers than noncarriers opting for bilateral mastectomy.  Bilateral RRM was chosen by 48% of women with a known pathogenic variant [
222
] and by 100% of women with a known pathogenic variant in a smaller series [
24
] of women undergoing testing at the time of diagnosis.  Of women in whom no pathogenic variant was found, 24% also opted for bilateral RRM. Four percent of the test decliners also underwent bilateral RRM. Among carriers of pathogenic variants, predictors of bilateral RRM included whether patients reported that their physicians had recommended
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing and bilateral RRM before testing, and whether they received a positive test result.[
222
] Data are lacking on quality-of-life outcomes for women who undergo RRM after genetic testing that is performed at the time of diagnosis.
A prospective study from the Netherlands evaluated long-term psychological outcomes of offering women with breast cancer genetic counseling and, if indicated, genetic testing at the onset of breast radiation for treatment of their primary breast cancer. Of those who were approached for counseling, some underwent genetic testing and chose to receive their result (n = 58), some were approached but did not fulfill referral criteria (n = 118), and some declined the option of counseling/testing (n = 44). Another subset of women undergoing radiation therapy was not approached for counseling (n = 182) but  was followed using the same measures. Psychological distress was measured at baseline and at 4, 11, 27, and 43 weeks after initial consultation for radiation therapy. No differences were detected in general anxiety, depression or breast cancer–specific distress across all four groups.[
240
]
A retrospective questionnaire study of 583 women with a personal and family history of breast cancer and who underwent contralateral RRM between 1960 and 1993 measured overall satisfaction after mastectomy and factors influencing satisfaction and dissatisfaction with this procedure.[
241
] The mean time of follow-up was 10.3 years after risk-reducing surgery. Overall, 83% of all participants stated they were satisfied or very satisfied, 8% were neutral, and 9% were dissatisfied with contralateral RRM. Most women also reported favorable effects or no change in their self-esteem, level of stress, and emotional stability after surgery (88%, 83%, and 88%, respectively). Despite the high levels of overall satisfaction, 33% reported negative body image, 26% reported a reduced sense of femininity, and 23% reported a negative effect on sexual relationships. The type of surgical procedure also affected levels of satisfaction. The authors attributed this difference to the high rate of unanticipated reoperations in the group of women having subcutaneous mastectomy (43%) versus the group having simple mastectomy (15%) (
P
< .0001). Limitations to this study are mostly related to the time period during which participants had their surgery (i.e., availability of surgical reconstructive option).[
241
,
242
] None of these women had genetic testing for pathogenic variants in the
BRCA1/BRCA2
genes. Nevertheless, this study shows that while most women in this group were satisfied with contralateral RRM, all women reported at least one adverse outcome.
A retrospective survey of 137
BRCA
carriers examined the psychosocial impact of preserving the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) in women with bilateral RRM.[
243
] The study found that body image and sexual well-being differed significantly based on the type of RRM the women underwent. Women with NAC preservation were more satisfied with their breasts (72% vs. 61%), were more satisfied with the surgical outcome (85% vs. 74%) and had greater sexual well-being (68% vs. 52%) than women without NAC preservation. No differences in cancer-related distress, anxiety, depression, or risk perceptions were observed between the two groups. Oncological outcomes of nipple-sparing mastectomy in
BRCA
carriers have not been inferior to RRM without NAC preservation.[
244
] (Refer to the
Risk-reducing strategies for breast cancer
section in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management for more information.)
Another study compared long-term quality-of-life outcomes in 195 women after bilateral RRM performed between 1979 and 1999 versus 117 women at high risk of breast cancer opting for screening.  No statistically significant differences were detected between the groups for psychosocial outcomes. Eighty-four percent of those opting for surgery reported satisfaction with their decision.  Sixty-one percent of women from both the surgery and screening groups reported being very much or quite a bit contented with their quality of life.[
245
]
In a study of psychosocial outcomes associated with RRM and immediate reconstruction,  61 high-risk women (27 carriers of pathogenic variants, others with high-risk family history), 31 of whom had a prior history of breast cancer, were evaluated on average 3 to 4 years after surgery.[

] The study utilized questions designed to elicit yes versus no responses and found that the surgery was well-tolerated with 83% of 
participants reporting that the results of their reconstructive surgery were as they expected, 90% reporting that they had received adequate preoperative information, none reporting that they regretted the surgery, and all reporting that 
they would choose the same 
route if they had to do it again. Satisfaction with the results ranged from 74% satisfied with the shape of their breasts to 89% satisfied with the appearance of the scarring. Comparison of this group to normative samples on quality-of-life indicators (Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire scores) indicated no reductions in quality of life in these women.
A qualitative study examining material on the
FORCE
website posted by 21 high-risk women (
BRCA1/BRCA2
-positive) undergoing RRM showed that these women anticipated and received negative reactions from friends and family regarding the surgery, and that they managed disclosure in ways to maintain emotional support and self-protection for their decision. Many of the women expressed a relief from intrusive breast cancer thoughts and worry, and were satisfied with the cosmetic result of their surgery.[
247
]
In contrast, another study examined long-term psychosocial outcomes in 684 women who had had bilateral or contralateral RRM on average 9 years before assessment.[
248
] A majority of women (59%) also had reconstructive surgery.  Interestingly, based on a Likert scale, 85% of women reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with their decision to have an RRM. However, in qualitative interviews, many women went on to describe dissatisfaction or negative psychosocial outcomes associated with surgery. The authors coded the responses as negative when women reported still being anxious about their breast cancer risk and/or reported negative feelings about their body image, pain, and sexuality. Seventy-nine percent of the women providing negative comments and 84% of those making mixed comments (mixture of satisfaction and dissatisfaction) responded that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with their decision. Twice as many women with bilateral mastectomy made negative and mixed comments than did women with contralateral mastectomy. The areas of most concern were body image, problems with breast implants, pain after surgery, and sexuality. The authors proposed that those who had undergone contralateral procedures had already been treated for cancer, while those who had undergone bilateral procedures had not been treated previously, and this may partially account for the differences in satisfaction between the two groups. These findings suggest that women's satisfaction with RRM may be tempered by their complex reactions over time.
In a qualitative study of 108 women who underwent or were considering RRM, more than half of those
who had RRM
felt that presurgical consultation with a psychologist was advisable; nearly two-thirds thought that postsurgical consultation was also appropriate. All of the women
who were considering RRM
believed that psychological consultation before surgery would facilitate decision-making.[

Psychosocial outcomes associated with risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO)
Prior studies on the impact of RRSO suggest some variability in outcomes based on menopausal status:
A Canadian prospective study examined the impact of RRSO on menopausal symptoms and sexual functioning  in a sample of 140 women with known
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
pathogenic variants.[
250
] This study compared  outcomes before surgery and after surgery (an average of 3.5 y later). RRSO was associated with an increase in menopausal symptoms and a decrease in reported sexual functioning in premenopausal women (n = 93). However, differences in overall quality of life  (QOL) were not reported in this group. HRT reduced the adverse effects associated with RRSO but did not fully eliminate them. In postmenopausal women (n = 47), RRSO resulted in an increase in physical symptoms (i.e., insomnia and fatigue) and decreases in both sexual functioning and overall QOL.
A cross-sectional study analyzed  244 women with
BRCA1
/
BRCA2
pathogenic variants who were aged 40 years or older.[
251
]
BRCA1/BRCA2
carriers who did not undergo RRSO had more cancer worry than women who had undergone RRSO, but fewer menopausal symptoms. Those who underwent RRSO and those who did not had similar levels of  sexual activity and functioning. Comparing women with pre- vs. postmenopausal RRSO, premenopausal women were more likely to be sexually active, to report menopausal symptoms, and to have depression than postmenopausal women. However, premenopausal and postmenopausal women  had similar levels of sexual functioning. For more information, see the
Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy for ovarian cancer risk reduction
section in
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
: Cancer Risks and Management.
A cross-sectional study of 641 women (66% of whom were
BRCA1/BRCA2
carriers)  who underwent RRSO before or after menopause  found no long-term association between premenopausal RRSO and measures of  cognitive function.[
252
]
Behavioral Outcomes
A study [
253
] of screening behaviors of 216 self-referred, high-risk (>10% risk of carrying a
BRCA1/BRCA2
pathogenic variant) women who are members of hereditary breast cancer families found a range of screening practices.  Even the  presence of known pathogenic variants in their families was not associated with good adherence to recommended screening practices.  Sixty-nine percent of women aged 50 to 64 years and 83% of women aged 40 to 49 years had had a screening mammogram in the previous year.  Twenty percent of participants had ever had a CA-125 test and 31% had ever had a pelvic ultrasound or TVUS. Further analysis of this study population [
253
] looking specifically at 107 women with informative
BRCA
test results found good use of breast cancer screening, though the uptake rate in younger carriers is lower. The reason for the lower uptake rate was not explored in this study.[
254
] One survey of screening behaviors among women at increased risk of breast/ovarian cancer identified physician recommendations as a significant factor in adherence to screening.[
255
]
While motivations cited for pursuing genetic testing often include the expectation that carriers of pathogenic variants will be more compliant with breast and/or ovarian screening recommendations,[
253
,
256
-
258
] limited data exist about whether participants in genetic testing alter their screening behaviors over time and about other variables that may influence those behaviors, such as insurance coverage and physician recommendations or attitudes.
The impact of cancer genetic counseling on screening behaviors was assessed in a U.K. study of 293 women followed for 12 months postcounseling at  four cancer genetics clinics.[
259
] BSE, CBE, and mammography were significantly increased after counseling; however, gaps in adherence to recommendations were noted: 38% of women aged 35 to 49 years had not had a mammogram by 12 months postcounseling. BSE was not done by most women at the recommended time and frequency.
This is a critical issue not only for women testing positive, but also for
adherence to screening for those testing negative and those who have
received
indeterminate results
or choose not to receive their results.  It is
possible that adherence actually diminishes with a decrease in the perceived
risk that may result from a negative genetic test result.
In addition, while there is still some question regarding the link between
cancer-related worry and breast cancer screening behavior, accumulating
evidence appears to support a linear rather than a curvilinear relationship. 
That is, for some time, the data were not consistent; some data supported the
hypothesis that mild-to-moderate worry may increase adherence, while excessive
worry may actually decrease the utilization of recommended screening practices. 
Other reports support the notion that a linear relationship is more likely;
that is, more worry increases adherence to screening recommendations.  Few
studies, however,  have followed women to assess their health behaviors
after genetic testing.  Thus, a negative test result leading to decreased
worry could theoretically result in decreased screening adherence.  A large study found that patient compliance with screening practices was not related to general or screening-specific anxiety—with the exception of BSE, for which compliance is negatively associated with procedure-specific anxiety.[
77
] Further
research designed to clarify this potential concern would highlight the need
for comprehensive genetic counseling to discuss the need for follow-up
screening.
Further complicating this area of research are issues such as the baseline rate
of mammography adherence among women older than 40 or 50 years before genetic
testing.  More specifically, the ability to note a significant difference in
adherence on this measure may be affected by the high adherence rate to this
screening behavior before genetic testing by women undergoing such testing.   It
may be easier to find significant changes in mammography use among women with a
family history of breast cancer who test positive.  Finally, adherence over
time will likely be affected by how women undergoing genetic
testing and their caregivers perceive the efficacy of many of the screening options
in question, such as mammography for younger women, BSE,
and ovarian cancer screening (periodic vaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125
measurements), along with the value of preventive interventions.
The issue of screening decision-making and adherence among women undergoing
genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer is the subject of several ongoing
trials, and an area of much needed ongoing study.
