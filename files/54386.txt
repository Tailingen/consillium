Chemoradiotherapy for Advanced Esophageal Cancer
This study aims to show that the addition of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy to a palliative course of external beam radiation treatment improves both dysphagia relief and patient quality of life in patients with unresectable esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin and Taxol (paclitaxel)|RADIATION: External Beam Radiation
Proportion of patients who achieve relief of dysphagia, Will be measured as the proportion of patients who achieve relief of dysphagia, defined as improvement of at least one point on the Mellow Dysphagia Score, measured at Day 57 after the start of radiotherapy, and maintained for at least 28 calendar days (until the Day 85 visit)., up to day 85
Dysphagia progression free survival, Will be measured from screening to the time of first progression of dysphagia. Progression of dysphagia will be defined as follows:

* A drop of at least 1 point on the 5 point Mellow Dysphagia Score,
* Stricture requiring intervention, or
* Death,

Other secondary objectives as follows:

Time to achieving any response in dysphagia after treatment as measured by an improvement of at least 1 point on the 5 point Mellow Dysphagia Score. Number of patients receiving secondary treatment (radiation, chemotherapy or stenting), Utility assessments pre to post treatment and at 3 and 6 months, Quality of life differences post treatment and at 3 and 6 months. Measures of biological/serological correlates of response, Acute and late toxicity., 6 Months
Patients with carcinoma of the esophagus not suitable for definitive radical treatment who have symptomatic dysphagia requiring locoregional palliation, and who have no contra-indications to chemo-radiotherapy will be offered Carboplatin (AUC 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 concurrent with external beam radiation therapy of 30Gy/10 fractions over two weeks where the primary goal is relief of dysphagia and other outcomes include toxicity, quality of life and metabolomics.
