Tobacco Treatment in the Context of Lung Cancer Screening
The proposed study will test a medication plus text messaging intervention specifically designed for lung cancer screening patients. Half of the patients will receive standard of care, and half will receive the treatment intervention.
Smoking Cessation
BEHAVIORAL: Text messaging plus nicotine replacement therapy|OTHER: Standard Care at Lung Cancer Screening
End of Treatment Abstinence Rates, 7-day point prevalence abstinence, Week 8 (end of treatment)
End of Study Abstinence Rates, Effect size estimates at End of Study, 3-month follow-up
Screening for lung cancer at earlier, more treatable stages has the potential to reduce mortality from the U.S.'s most deadly cancer. Annual lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography is now recommended for high risk individuals based on age and smoking history. This study will evaluate a smoking cessation intervention for lung cancer screening patients. We will evaluate quit rates after a standard intervention (brief counseling session at time of lung cancer screening) versus a dual nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and gain-framed text messaging intervention.
