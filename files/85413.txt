Preliminary Investigation of β-hydroxybutyrate Supplementation in Colorectal Cancer Prevention
The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplementation in individuals who are undergoing a standard-of-care colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy.
Colorectal Cancer
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: R-1,3-Butanediol
Determine whether oral BHB supplementation is safe and tolerable, Assessment of patient tolerance of BHB supplements through weekly monitoring of side effects and/or intolerances and patient compliance. We will monitor the percentage of individuals who continue through Visit 2, and the percentage continuing through Visit 3, as well as the compliance with taking the BHB supplement., Through study completion, which will be approximately 2 years
Determine whether oral BHB supplementations increases serum BHB levels, Assessment of fasting serum BHB levels before, during, and after BHB supplementation to determine if BHB supplementation appreciably increases serum BHB levels., Through study completion, which will be approximately 2 years|Investigate whether oral BHB supplementation leads to transcription and protein expression changes in the colonic mucosa, Comparison of both transcription and protein changes in the colonic mucosa from mucosal biopsies before and after BHB supplementation to determine if BHB supplementation is having measurable effects on the colonic mucosa., Through study completion, which will be approximately 2 years
The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplementation in individuals who are undergoing a standard-of-care colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy in order to determine whether BHB supplementation is safe and tolerable. Additionally, this study will determine whether BHB supplementations increases serum BHB levels, and leads to transcription and protein expression changes in the colonic mucosa. BHB supplementation will be performed through oral administration of HVMN Ketone-IQ, a commercially available BHB supplement, with an active ingredient of R-1,3-Butanediol, which gets converted to BHB.
