Hepatocellular Carcinoma Study Comparing Vaccinia Virus Based Immunotherapy Plus Sorafenib vs Sorafenib Alone
This is a randomized Phase 3 study to determine whether treatment with vaccinia virus based immunotherapy (Pexa-Vec) followed by sorafenib increases survival compared to treatment with sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received prior systemic therapy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
BIOLOGICAL: Pexastimogene Devacirepvec (Pexa Vec)|DRUG: Sorafenib
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of participants who showed overall response during their participation in the study. Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (mRECIST) and assessed by tri-phasic contrast enhanced CT: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of intratumoral enhancing area; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of enhancing area; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., From date of randomization to the date of first documented radiographic tumor progression up to 53 months
This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing Pexa Vec followed by sorafenib versus sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC without prior systemic therapy.

A total of 459 patients were randomly assigned to 2 treatment arms- 234 patients in the Pexa-Vec followed by sorafenib treatment group and 225 patients in the sorafenib only treatment group.
