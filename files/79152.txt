Development and Initial Application of a Combined Exercise and Psychological Intervention Program for Patients After Esophagectomy
Esophageal cancer imposes a significant burden in China, accounting for over 60% of the global disease burden. While surgery remains a common and highly effective treatment for esophageal cancer, patients often experience multiple physical and psychological symptoms postoperatively, severely affecting their recovery outcomes and quality of life. Although existing exercise or psychological intervention programs have shown some effectiveness, issues such as relatively singular intervention content, imprecise intervention timing, and vague intervention details persist.

This project, based on previous research foundations (including the development of symptom measurement tools and the identification of key recovery periods), is guided by symptom management theory and knowledge translation models. Taking a perspective of the synergistic impact of physical and psychological symptoms, the study focuses on patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery. Initially, evidence-based literature review, focus group interviews, and expert consultations were conducted to develop a combined exercise and psychological intervention program, integrating subjective (CSCA_EC) and objective (6MWT) measurement indicators, named "Recovery For EC." Subsequently, the program was preliminarily applied in clinical settings using a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative quasi-experimental design (108 cases) and qualitative interviews to assess its acceptability. The final clinical trial version of the Recovery For EC program was developed to provide patients with a tool for self-monitoring recovery outcomes and offer clinical healthcare professionals guidance for implementing precise and personalized rehabilitation management.

the Convalescence Symptom Assessment Scale for EsophageCtomy patients (CSAS_EC), The Convalescence Symptom Assessment Scale for EsophageCtomy patients (CSAS_EC) is an instrument developed by our research team based on patient self-reported outcomes, designed to assess the symptomatology and functional level during the recovery period of esophagectomy patients. This CSAS_EC has been developed and refined into an 11-point scale with 28 items, encompassing four dimensions (early recovery symptoms, late recovery symptoms, persistent symptoms, and psychosocial symptoms). The CSAS_EC scores range from 0 to 280, with higher scores indicating more severe postoperative symptoms in esophageal cancer patients., Preoperative and Postoperative day 7 and through study completion, on average, 40 days post-surgery.
6-Minute Walk Test, Participants are instructed to walk as fast as possible in a sparsely crowded, straight corridor to determine their six-minute walking distance. The cardiorespiratory functional assessment criteria are as follows: walking distance \<150 meters is considered severely abnormal, 150-300 meters is moderately abnormal, 301-450 meters is mildly abnormal, and \>450 meters is considered normal., Preoperative and Postoperative day 7 and through study completion, on average, 40 days post-surgery.|Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a widely used self-assessment questionnaire for evaluating anxiety and depression symptoms in hospital patients. HADS consists of 14 items, divided into two dimensions: Anxiety and Depression. It uses a Likert 4-point scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 21. Higher scores indicate more severe anxiety and depression symptoms., Preoperative and Postoperative day 7 and through study completion, on average, 40 days post-surgery.|Postoperative Complications, According to the Clavien-Dindo classification system, Grade I refers to complications that do not require any treatment such as medication or surgery, Grade II involves the need for medication, blood transfusion, or nutritional support, Grade III necessitates surgical or interventional treatment, Grade IV poses a potential threat to the patient's life requiring intensive care, and Grade V results in patient death. The number and severity of postoperative complications are assessed and documented accordingly. Data on complications can be obtained from participants' electronic medical records., Postoperative day 7
