HAIC Combined With Donafenib Tosilate and Toripalimab for Unresectable HCC
This is a prospective, single-armed, multicentric, explorative phase II clinical research of conversional therapy with combination of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy(HAIC), Donafenib Tosilate and Toripalimab for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

Compared with systemic intravenous chemotherapy, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy(HAIC) has the advantages of increasing local drug concentration and reducing systemic toxic and side effects. Currently, it is gradually used in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with good safety and high objective response rate. Immunotherapy combined with targeted and chemotherapy was well tolerated. At present, anti-programmed cell death protein-1(PD-1) antibody combined with chemotherapy and targeted therapy for advanced biliary tract tumors has initially shown good safety and encouraging efficacy, which is worthy of further exploration. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HAIC (FOLFOX) combined with Toripalimab and Donafenib Tosilate in unresectable HCC.
