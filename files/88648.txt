Phase I/Ib Study of NK Expressing an Affinity-enhanced T-cell Receptor (TCR) Against the NY-ESO-1
The goal of this clinical research study is to find a recommended dose of donated NK cells that can be given along with chemotherapy to patients with advanced cancers. The safety and effects of this therapy will also be studied.
Synovial Sarcoma|Myxoid/Round Cell Liposarcoma
DRUG: Fludarabine phosphate|DRUG: NY-ESO-1 TCR/IL-15 NK|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives

1. To determine the safety and optimal cell dose of adoptive NK expressing an affinity-enhanced Tcell receptor (TCR) reactive against the NY-ESO-1- r (NY-ESO-1 TCR/IL-15 NK) in patients with advanced synovial sarcoma and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma
2. To determine the antitumor activity of adoptive CB-specific NK cells expressing an affinityenhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) reactive against the NY-ESO-1- (NY-ESO-1 TCR/IL-15 NK).

Secondary Objectives

1. To investigate the correlation between the percentage of NY-ESO-1 in the pre-treatment sample of the tumor, and the tumor response to the treatment.

Exploratory Objectives

1. To quantify the persistence of infused allogeneic adoptive NK expressing an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) reactive against the NY-ESO-1-specific CB-derived NK cells (NY-ESO-1 TCR/IL15 NK) in the recipient.
2. To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies.
3. To obtain preliminary data on quality of life and patient experience.
