MRI (Including Spectroscopy and Fat-Saturations and Diffusion-Weighted Imaging) in Cervical Cancer
To detect differences in MR spectroscopy, diffusion weighted MR, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) MR imaging between primary cervical tumors and normal cervical tissue.
Uterine Cervical Neoplasms
DEVICE: MR Spectroscopy|DEVICE: Fat-Saturation and Diffusion-Weighted Imaging|DEVICE: Dynamic Contrast Enhancement MRI (MR-DCE)|DEVICE: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
Differences in MR spectroscopy, diffusion weighted MR, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) MR imaging between primary cervical tumors and normal cervical tissue., 3 months
Determine whether MR-DCE or MR-FS or DTI can improve target delineation in primary cervical tumors., 3 months
At our institution, all patients receiving external beam and/or brachytherapy as part of the treatment of primary cervical cancer receive CT, PET, and MRI simulation scans as standard of care. Brachytherapy patients also receive weekly T1/T2 weighted MR simulation scans as part of their treatment planning.

We propose the use of additional MR sequences to the standard T1/T2 weighted MR simulation scans. The data obtained from these additional sequences will be used for improving tumor delineation and obtaining prognostic information.
