Endoscopic Ultrasound Radiofrequency Ablation and Immunotherapy Pembrolizumab for Locally Advanced Unresectable and Metastatic Pancreatic Duct Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to perform a pilot phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combined EUS-RFA, chemotherapy, and systemic immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable and metastatic Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC).
