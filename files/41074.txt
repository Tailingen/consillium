Study of the Safety and Tolerability of IV Infused PG545 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This Phase Ia study aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose of once-weekly IV infused PG545 and to evaluate its safety in subjects with advanced solid tumours. In addition, the study will explore whether PG545 exposure results in changes to chemicals produced by the body that are associated with cancer growth and spread.
Advanced Solid Tumours
DRUG: PG545
Determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of PG545, The MTD will be determined by assessing dose limiting toxicities at the end of the first month's treatment. Dose escalation and de-escalation will continue until an MTD is identified. Each cohort of patients will receive weekly doses at a single dose level for the duration of the study., Evaluated at the end of initial 28-day cycle
Number of adverse events by cohort, Subjects will be followed for the duration of their treatment (an expected average of 12 weeks), and for four weeks post-treatment|Severity of adverse events by cohort, Subjects will be followed for the duration of their treatment (an expected average of 12 weeks), and for four weeks post-treatment|Assessment of the anti-tumour activity of PG545 using RECIST criteria, Subjects will be followed for the duration of their treatment (an expected average of 12 weeks), and then up to four weeks post-treatment
