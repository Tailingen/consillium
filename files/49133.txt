To Evaluate an MRI-based Optimized Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Pathway Powered by Artificial Intelligence
It is a prospective paired-cohort study for diagnostic test evaluation. The study aim to determine the accuracy of AI review and investigate whether AI review could detect MRI visible significant cancer as effective as radiologist review. MRI image of about 368 men recommended for biopsy will be reviewed by an AI model and an experienced radiologist, respectively. AI review (index) and radiologist review (standard) will be blinded to each other, while biopsy urologists will be well-informed of the findings of both AI review and radiologist review and make personalized biopsy plan by combining both findings. The pathological results of MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy (reference) will serve as the gold standard to assess the diagnostic accuracy.
