Non-Invasive Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging of Lymphoma, Leukemia and Metastatic Lymph Nodes
The purpose of this study is to see if a new way of imaging called the Cerenkov luminescence or effect that is used with a standard clinical PET/CT and/or investigation scans can be done in order to capture tumor sizes. The investigators believe endoscopies and surgical procedures could benefit from this type of imaging in the future. The Cerenkov imaging could be used as a guide for surgical resections.

The purpose of this study is to use the Cerenkov light from FDG, Iodine-131 tracer sand/or other investigational tracers to image tumors and its sizes in the head, neck, breast, axillary and pelvic regions with a highly sensitive camera. The investigators will be trying to see if we can get another picture of the tumor using the Cerenkov light as part of the standard clinical scan or therapy.
Head and Neck Cancers
RADIATION: Cerenkov emissions from the PET tracer 18F-FDG and the radiotherapeutic 131I
feasibility of clinical Cerenkov imaging, is to assess the feasibility of clinical Cerenkov luminescence imaging using current clinical radiotracers (18F-FDG and 131I) and a highly sensitive camera., 2 years
Correlate Cerenkov imaging, signal with uptake of the radiotracer. Cerenkov images will be correlated with images obtained from standard clinical PET/CT and scintigraphy., 2 years
