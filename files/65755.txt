The Influences of Long Periods of Pneumoperitoneum and Head up Position on the Variation of Heart-rate Corrected QT Interval During Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Gastrectomy - Observational Study
Sympathetic activity could be increased during robot-assisted laparoscopic gastrectomy, which is performed in a head up position under CO2 pneumoperitoneum.

Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system prolongs the QT interval and can increases the susceptibility to life threatening cardiac arrhythmias.

Thus the investigators decided to evaluate the heart-rate corrected QT interval (QTc interval) during robotic-assisted laparoscopic gastrectomy.

Evaluate the heart-rate corrected QT (QTc) interval (msec) during robotic-assisted laparoscopic gastrectomy, (T0: Pre-induction T1: 10min after anesthetic induction T2: 1min after CO2 pneumoperitoneum T3: 5min after CO2 pneumoperitoneum T4: 30min after steep trendelenburg position T5:60min after steep trendelenburg T6: 90min after steep trendelenburg T7: Supine positon following end of pneumoperitoneum T8: 5 min after end of pneumoperitoneum T9: End of surgery T10: 10min after extubation), through study completion, an average of 5 hours
