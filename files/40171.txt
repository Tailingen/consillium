Impact of Cultural and Linguistic Backgrounds on Patient Care and Experience of Women With Gynecologic Malignancies
Purpose of this study to delineate the attitudes and experiences of patients, interpreters and cancer care professionals involved in the care of oncology patients with gynecologic malignancies with cultural and linguistic diversity backgrounds, in addition to highlighting any barriers to optimal patient care through questionnaires.
Gynecologic Cancer
OTHER: Questionnaire
To describe culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patient experiences and attitudes in the clinic setting concerning interpretation services, in addition to barriers to providing care and self-management supports., â€¢Eligible patients will be matched to complete questionnaires in their specified preferred language. Question domains will encompass patient demographics, comprehension of diagnosis and treatment, clinical trials, palliative care and overall experiences in the clinic from the perspective of a CALD oncology patient, including identification of any barriers to optimal care., 4 to 6 weeks|To describe training processes and challenges faced by interpreters when providing services to oncology and palliative care CALD patients., Questionnaires will be anonymous and delivered in English only. Question domains will encompass demographics, professional background, and overall experiences in the clinic setting from the perspective of a professional team member caring for the oncology patient with CALD background, including identification of any barriers to optimal care., 4 to 6 weeks|To describe challenges faced by treating physicians and allied health professionals when providing care to CALD patients in oncology or palliative care clinic settings., Questionnaires will be anonymous and delivered in English only. Question domains will encompass demographics, professional background, and overall experiences in the clinic setting from the perspective of a professional team member caring for the oncology patient with CALD background, including identification of any barriers to optimal care., 4 to 6 weeks
To characterize the demographics of the CALD population in the gynecology clinic with regards to visible minority populations and self-reported preferred first languages., Frequencies and proportions for the answers of multiple-choice questions in Oncology clinic experiences, Clinical trials and Palliative care clinic sections of Patient Questionnaire will be calculated and reported., 4 to 6 weeks|To compare patient distress levels between different ethnic minorities using Distress Assessment and Response Tool (DART) data from iCALD (UHN Research Ethics Board #20-5032), Patients answer specific questions about physical, emotional and practical challenges that impact with their ability to engage in their cancer care., 4 to 6 weeks
Approximately 45% of Toronto residents have a mother tongue other than English, and over a quarter of people speak a language other than English most often at home, with over 180 different languages and dialects spoken throughout the Greater Toronto Area. Additionally, based on the census data from 2016 there also appears to be an unbalanced distribution between minority background and socioeconomic status, with lower income neighborhoods being primarily occupied by visible minority populations, which has been associated with lower socioeconomic status and poorer health literacy, and potentially correlates with healthcare service utilization overall and worse clinical outcomes.

Although linguistically diverse patients in predominantly Caucasian societies is a common phenomenon, it is relatively poorly studied across the globe, although some reports have demonstrated a tendency towards longer inpatient lengths of stay and higher readmission rates. In particular, one retrospective cohort study at two hospital affiliated with the University of Toronto, Canada, found that in over 9000 patients who presented to the emergency room or were admitted, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) patients had higher rates of re-presentations and readmissions if their underlying pathology was a chronic condition (chronic airways disease or cardiac failure) due to the complex care pathways involved upon discharge. This is highly relevant to the oncology patient, as consultations are time-restricted and management algorithms are highly complex and involve multiple parallel communication pathways, which carries a higher risk of misinterpretation when coupled with a background where English is not the patient's primary spoken language.

The use of a professional interpreter in medical consultations, defined by the Ontario Council on Community Interpreting (OCCI) as a "fluently bilingual individual with appropriate training and experience who is able to interpret with consistency and accuracy and who adheres to the Standards of Practice and Ethical Principles," has been shown to reduce significantly medical communication errors as compared with ad-hoc family members, improve duration of hospitalization, reduce readmission rates and improve patient satisfaction.

Caring for patients who come from CALD backgrounds poses a unique set of challenges not only from the perspective of the patient, but also for the treating physicians and team of health professionals, including those employed by interpretation services.

The iCALD-2 protocol aims to investigate barriers affecting CALD patient care using a questionnaire approach. Collectively with the iCALD retrospective study, this protocol looks to establish a baseline from which interventional studies surrounding CALD patients and interpretive services can be launched in the future, with a view to potential expansion across other tumour site clinics .
