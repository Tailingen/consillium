PET Imaging of Cancer Patients Using 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9
This is a scientific study to determine expression of vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1) in cancer patients by 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) before and after cancer treatment.

68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 uptake in bone marrow and cancerous lesions, Standardized uptake value of PET tracer 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 in the bone marrow and cancerous lesions, within a 1 day
The purpose of this study is to evaluate expression of vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1) in bone marrow and cancerous lesions before and after therapy using 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that undergo bone marrow transplantation and patients with melanoma and lung cancer that undergo chemotherapy will be studied. In addition, imaging results will be compared with clinical data and research data from blood samples. The study is of great clinical importance as other methods do not provide such comprehensive information on the presence of the VAP-1 molecule in the body, especially in the bone marrow and cancer tissue before and after cancer treatment. Research is also important for drug development targeting VAP-1.
