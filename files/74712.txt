Percentage of ctDNA positivity in treatment cohort after 6 cycles or at least 3 months of adjuvant treatment, Percent of patients positive for ctDNA after 6 cycles or at least 3 months months after starting adjuvant treatment will be used to estimate the efficacy of adjuvant trifluridine and tipiracil (TAS102) in combination with irinotecan in patients with ctDNA positive colon adenocarcinoma. The Signatera MRD ctDNA Assay will be used to measure ctDNA positivity., 6 months
