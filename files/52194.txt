Personalized Functional Profiling in Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer or Recurrent Glioblastoma Patients in Luxembourg.
The investigators are developing a novel standardized and centralized approach named Integrated Personalized Functional Profiling (PFP) in Luxembourg. Based on recent improvements in cancer biopsy-derived 3D-culture technologies the PFP process will screen patient derived cells (PDCs) with FDA/EMA-approved drugs to generate personalized functional response profiles. The selected drug through PFP technology will provide personalized treatment recommendation for the patient.

This pilot study will evaluate the clinical feasibility of setting-up an effective workflow as a first step. Outcomes from this study will be used subsequently to help plan the clinical validation of the implementation of PFP.
