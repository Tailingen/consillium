Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients with stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion
Study the effectiveness of aminocamptothecin in treating patients with stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer., 120 hour continuous infusion once a week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest. Patients are assessed after every 2 courses of therapy.
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion (AC/CD) administered as a 120 hour weekly infusion is an effective treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. II. Observe any toxicities associated with this treatment in this patient population.

OUTLINE: Patients receive a 120 hour continuous infusion of aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion (AC/CD) once a week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest. Patients are assessed after every 2 courses of therapy. Treatment with aminocamptothecin continues indefinitely if there is tumor shrinkage or stable disease and no significant toxicity is experienced. Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
