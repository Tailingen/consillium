A Phase 2 Study of CPI-0610 With and Without Ruxolitinib in Patients With Myelofibrosis
Phase 1 Part (Complete): Open-label, sequential dose escalation study of pelabresib in patients with previously treated Acute Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, and Myelofibrosis.

Phase 2 Part: Open-label study of CPI-0610 with and without Ruxolitinib in patients with Myelofibrosis.

CPI-0610 is a small molecule inhibitor of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins.

DRUG: Pelabresib (CPI-0610)|DRUG: Ruxolitinib
Phase 2 (Cohorts 1B and 2B and Arm 3): Evaluate the spleenic response, By imaging after 24 weeks|Phase 2 (Cohorts 1A and 2A): Evaluate the RBC (Red Blood Cell) transfusion independence rate, Absence of RBC transfusion and no hemoglobin level below 8 g/dL in the prior 12 weeks|Phase 2 (Arm 4): Evaluate the complete hematological response rate, 1 cycle (21 days)
Phase 2 (Arms 1, 2, and 3): Evaluate the duration of the spleenic response by imaging, Through study completion or end of treatment, up to 24 weeks and beyond|Phase 2 (all arms): Evaluate the change in patient reported outcomes, Changes from baseline in the total symptom score (MFSAF v4.0) and PGIC after 24 weeks|Phase 2 (all arms): area under the curve (AUC), Assessed during Cycle 1 (first 21 days on study)|Phase 2 (all arms): maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), Assessed during Cycle 1 (first 21 days on study)
Phase 2 (Arms 1, 2, and 3): Evaluate response category rate, Rate of response by the International Working Group - Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) criteria after 24 weeks|Phase 2 (Arms 1, 2, and 3): Evaluate the rate of RBC transfusion and the RBC transfusion dependence rate, Average number of RBC units per subject-month, up to 24 weeks and beyond
