Genetic Susceptibility to Kidney Cancer
This study will further the understanding of the genetic events leading to the development of RCC.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
To identify interindividual differences in inherited genetic instability, 12 months
This study will further the understanding of the genetic events leading to the development of RCC; explore the genetic basis for genetic instability and how it affects cancer risk; and eventually provide a means of identifying a subgroup of individuals who are most likely to develop RCC. Such individuals may then be targeted for intervention programs such as chemoprevention or dietary modification.
