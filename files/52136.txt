Neoadjuvant Bintrafusp Alfa in Patients With Resectable Biliary Tract Cancer
The NEOBIL study aims to investigate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant Bintrafusp alfa in patients with resectable biliary tract cancer.
Biliary Tract Cancer|Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Bintrafusp alfa
Major Pathologic Response (MPR) measured in the surgically resected tumor, Response to neoadjuvant treatment will be determined according to the Becker score. MPR is defined by a Becker grade of 1 (1a or 1b), namely at least \< 10% of viable tumor., 24 months
Tumor Response, Tumor Response according to RECIST1.1, 24 months|Rate of Resectability, Rate of Resectability in biliary tract cancer patients, 24 months|Adverse events according to CTCAE V5, 24 months|Adverse Events of Special Interest, Postoperative wound infections, impaired wound healing, wound dehiscence, prolongation of post-op hospitalization beyond 14 days., 24 months
The only curative therapy for biliary tract cancer (BTC) is resection. However, recurrence rates are very high with a median recurrence-free survival (RFS) time of 18 months with adjuvant chemotherapy. Bintrafusp alfa is a bifunctional fusion protein targeting TGF-Î² and PD-L1 that has shown promising activity in a second-line phase I BTC study. The neoadjuvant treatment approach is not a current standard in biliary tract cancer, but it is an accepted and frequently applied treatment strategy in other resectable and borderline-resectable cancers such as lung, gastric and rectal cancer. The hypothesis is that Bintrafusp alfa leads to a major pathological response in 30% of resectable BTC patients.
