A Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Study of RO5185426 in Previously Treated Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
This open-label study will assess the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of RO5185426 administered as 240mg tablets in previously treated patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients will be randomized to receive one of four dose-levels of RO5185426 \[RG7204; PLEXXIKON; PLX4032\] orally twice daily on days 1 to 15 (morning dose). Starting on day 22, treatment with RO5185426 may be resumed at a dose of 960 mg twice daily and continued until disease progression. Target sample size is \<100 patients.

Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed., Pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 24, 28, 72, 76, 168 hours post-dose on Day 15|Terminal Elimination Half-Life (t1/2) of Vemurafenib on Day 15, Time measured for vemurafenib plasma concentrations to decrease by one-half (t1/2) was calculated as 0.693 divided by apparent first-order terminal elimination rate constant (0.693/kel)., Pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 24, 28, 72, 76, 168 hours post-dose on Day 15|Accumulation Ratio of Vemurafenib on Day 15, Accumulation ratio was calculated as, AUC(0-8) on Day 15 divided by AUC(0-8) on Day 1., Pre-dose, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 hours post-dose on Day 1 and 15
Percentage of Participants With a Confirmed Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), Confirmed best overall response was defined as having best objective response as CR or PR, as assessed by investigator and confirmed at least 28 days after initial response. Tumor response was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) were required to demonstrate a reduction to normal (short axis less than \[\<\] 10 millimeters \[mm\]). PR was defined as a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum diameter. Percentage of participants with best overall response of confirmed CR or PR are reported., Up to approximately 3 years (assessed at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, thereafter every 2 cycles and then every 4 cycles after Cycle 13)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time, in months, from the date of the first study drug administration to the date of death, regardless of the cause of death., Up to approximately 3 years (assessed at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, thereafter every 2 cycles and then every 4 cycles after Cycle 13)
