Application of Intra-operative Prophylactic Antibiotics/Antiseptics in Chinese Breast Reconstruction Patients
The study aims to investigate different approaches of local application of antibiotics/antiseptics intraoperatively in Chinese patients undergoing post-mastectomy implant based breast reconstruction, and aims to single out an intervention method that limits the use of antibiotics and maintains low rates of surgical site infection and capsular contracture. Patients who undergo post mastectomy breast reconstruction in the breast reconstruction department in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital are eligible to enter the study.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Cefazolin/clindamycin
Occurrence of minor surgical site infection, the reconstructed breasts present with redness, edema, pain and rise in skin temperature by observation, drainage or wound secretion microbiology culture are positive, the symptoms are relieved by oral antibiotics., assessed up to 3 months post-op|Occurrence of major surgical site infection, the reconstructed breasts present with redness, edema, pain and rise in skin temperature by observation, drainage or wound secretion microbiology culture are positive, the symptoms are relieved by intravenous antibiotics or demand surgical interventions such as explantation or change of implant., assessed up to 3 months post-op|Occurrence of capsular contracture, Hardness, pain, and or changes of shape/volume of the reconstructed breasts both by observation or inspected by breast imaging .The grade of capsular contracture is recorded in baker's grading(I-IV)., assessed from 3 months post-op up to 2 years post-op or until the trial ends, whichever comes first
Occurrence of flap necrosis, Complete or partial flap necrosis at the surgical site by surgeon's observation;, assessed up to 1 months post-op|Occurrence of hematoma, Peri-prosthetic hematoma observed by hematic drainage and reduced Hematocrit count comparing to normal range;, assessed up to 72 hours post-op|Occurrence of peri-prosthetic seroma, Peri-prosthetic seroma observed by clinical inspection and/or breast imaging;, from 3 months post-op up to 2 years post-op or until the trial ends|Baseline and changes of patient's evaluation, Patient oriented aesthetic and overall satisfaction evaluation using Breast-Q questionnaires (implant reconstructive module), evaluate at 6 months as baseline, repeated evaluation at 12 months and 24 months post-op or until the trial ends, whichever comes first, to record changes
There is an ongoing trend towards implant based breast reconstruction in post-mastectomy patients in China. In 2015, more than 60% of patients undergoing breast reconstruction in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital opted for implant based breast reconstruction. One of the major complications in implant based breast reconstruction is infection, which could cause implant explantation, delay the time to adjuvant therapies in breast cancer patients, and inflict adverse psychological effects. Although empirical intravenous and/or oral antibiotics are suggested peri-operatively, local applications of antibiotics/antiseptics and their combinations are applied differently in many medical centers worldwide, and some even suggest against the use of intraoperative local antibiotics. Furthermore, there is no consensus as to the local application of antibiotics intraoperatively for breast reconstruction patients in Chinese population. We therefore designed an open-label prospective randomized control trial in our Chinese patient population to investigate the effects of three different approaches of intraoperative surgical site intervention with antibiotics and or antiseptics. In each groups, all peri-operative interventions are standardized to best reduce bias. Short-term infection rate and long-term capsular contracture rate will be observed in the hope of singling out the best modality in our medical center to integrate into the overall comprehensive treatment for female breast cancer patients.
