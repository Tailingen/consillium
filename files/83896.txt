The management of nonfunctional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-pNETs) remains controversial. In general, surgical resection is the standard treatment for NF-pNETs. However, the incidence of postoperative adverse events of surgical resection is relatively high. Recently, several studies have revealed that endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)-guided fine-needle injection (EUS-FNI) with ethanol or lauromacrogol may offer an effective treatment for pNETs. Therefore, a multicenter prospective study is being conducted to further identify the efficacy and safety of EUS-FNI for NF-pNETs.
