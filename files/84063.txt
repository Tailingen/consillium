Acceptability and Feasibility of Combination Treatment for Cervical Precancer Among South African Women Living With HIV
The purpose of this study is to explore whether an anti-cancer medication (5-fluorouracil cream) placed in the vagina after a surgical excision procedure is an acceptable and useful form of treatment for cervical precancer among the woman with HIV infection.

The number of subjects adhered to and retained in the study, The feasibility of the combination of surgical excision followed by adjuvant 5FU for the treatment of CIN2/3 among HIV-infected women will be evaluated using the number of subjects adhered to and retained in the study., Up to 24 weeks|The number of participants who found the intervention acceptable, The acceptability of the combination of surgical excision followed by adjuvant 5FU for the treatment of CIN2/3 among HIV-infected women will be assessed through a participant questionnaire administered at midline and end of the study., week 10 to week 24
The proportion of participants with CIN2 or CIN 3 that regressed to CIN1, Efficacy of combination treatment for CIN2/3 will be assessed as the number of subjects with CIN2 or CIN3 regressed to CIN1 or normal histology., 24 weeks|The percentage of participants who demonstrate clearance of high-risk HPV, Efficacy of combination treatment for HPV will be assessed as the percentage of women in each study arm who demonstrate clearance of high-risk HPV between baseline and 24 weeks., 24 weeks
There are currently no medical therapies recommended to promote the clearance of humanpapilloma virus (HPV) infection, regression of cervical dysplasia, or treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected women are at higher risk of HPV infection, with rates as high as 45% - 90%. Despite being preventable, cytologic abnormalities, cervical precancer (high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia \[CIN2/3\]), and invasive cervical cancer also occur more frequently in HIV infected women.

This study is testing whether topical 5-fluorouracil (5FU) can be used as a patient-controlled adjuvant treatment for cervical precancer (CIN2/3) to be self-administered after surgical excision to reduce the risk of persistent/recurrent CIN2/3 and progression to cervical cancer among HIV-infected women.
