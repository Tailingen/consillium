Feasibility Study of a Neuromuscular Fatigue Test and Associated Hemodynamic Responses: Application in Healthy Volunteers for Use in Patients with Chemotherapy-treated Breast Cancer
This cross-sectional and single-center study aims to progressively induce an increase in peripheral fatigue during successive efforts in healthy subjects. Participants will undergo three evaluations, each lasting one and half hours, to validate the test and assess its reproducibility. These three visits will be conducted at a minimum interval of 48 hours.

OTHER: Test of neuromuscular fatigue and associated hemodynamic responses
Evaluation of the progressive changes in the level of peripheral fatigue through the consecutive blocks., Significant changes in the level of peripheral fatigue during successive efforts as measured by the non invasive technique of nervous stimulation of the motor nerve., All measurements will be taken at the end of each of the four exercise bouts, during the same visit.
Correlation between peripheral fatigue and haemodynamic responses, Correlation between the level of change in the amplitude of the potentiated quadriceps twitch and the level of change in haemodynamic parameters., Correlation between variables measured at the end of each of the four exercise bouts, during the same visit|Validate the feasibility of the test on the following secondary parameter: reproducibility of the test, Reproducibility of the test due to the absence of significant difference in the exercise-induced peripheral fatigue levels (percentage change from baseline) and mean arterial pressure (mmHg) between sessions 2 and 3., 2 to 7 days between sessions 2 and 3.|Validate the feasibility of the test on the following secondary parameter: absence of transient discomfort, Low rating of the level of discomfort assessed by a 10 cm visual analog scale after each effort. The participant will be asked to grade between 0 and 10 the level of discomfort felt in the thighs., All measurements will be taken at the end of each of the four exercise bouts, during the same visit|Validate the feasibility of the test on the following secondary parameter: Tolerance to peripheral nerve stimulation using the self-reports of pain intensity scales., Evaluation of the subject's response to various levels of peripheral nerve stimulation intensity, starting with very low intensities, while recording any sensations of discomfort reported by the subject using the self-reports of pain intensity scales (10 cm visual analog scale)., All measurements will be taken during the same visit, at the end of each of the four exercise bouts
