Dose Escalation Trial to Evaluate Dose Limiting Toxicity/Maximum Tolerated Dose of Microneedle Arrays Containing Doxorubicin (D-MNA) in Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
This is a Phase I study in participants with superficial or nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), designed to assess dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dissolvable, tip-loaded, microneedle arrays containing doxorubicin (D-MNA).
Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Placebo-containing MNA|DRUG: 25 µg doxorubicin-containing MNA|DRUG: 50 µg doxorubicin-containing MNA|DRUG: 100 µg doxorubicin-containing MNA|DRUG: 200 µg doxorubicin-containing MNA
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities as Assessed by Local Skin Response (LSR) Grading Scale, Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in Trial Subjects Assessed by Local Skin Response Grading Scale, 0-4, 4 being the worst dermal response, 4 weeks
Number of Participants With Complete Response (CR) of Eradicated Basal Cell Carcinoma as Measured by Histological Analysis, Complete Response (CR), defined as histological confirmation by central reading of basal cell carcinoma excision in all study participants, 4 weeks
This is a Phase I study in participants with superficial or nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), designed to assess dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dissolvable, tip-loaded, microneedle arrays containing doxorubicin (D-MNA). Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic and is currently approved for the treatment of a broad range of cancers, including but not limited to: breast, bladder, gastric, and ovarian cancers; small cell lung cancer; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; and acute myelo blastic leukemia. SkinJect, Inc. has developed a novel delivery system in the form of a tip-loaded dissolvable microneedle array (MNA) which will allow for topical delivery of doxorubicin directly to the lesion at concentrations that are far below standard systemic dosing, thereby reducing the adverse events associated with systemic delivery. The primary objective of this investigation is to establish the highest safe and tolerable dose of single applications of D-MNA, one application per week for three weeks in placebo, 25 µg, 50 µg, 100 µg, and 200 µg dose groups in participants with BCC.
