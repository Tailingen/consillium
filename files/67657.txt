ALK Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in ALK-rearranged Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study was to explore the efficacy of ALK-TKI in lung squamous cell carcinoma. Approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas have oncogenic fusions of EML-4 and ALK a mutation associated with tumorigenesis and migration.

Progression-free survival (PFS), To assess progression-free survival of patients treated by different treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, define as first dose to first documented disease progression assessed by investigator or death due to any cause, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month
Overall survival (OS), To assess overall survival, define as first dose to the death of the subject due to any cause, Time from first subject dose to study completion, or up to 36 month.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), To assess ICI and TKIs overall response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by investigator, define as the proportion of subjects who have a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR), Time from first dose to last dose, or up to 24 month.
This research focuses on exploring epidemiology, distributions and the efficacy and prognosis of ALK-TKI in lung squamous cell carcinoma.Approximately 5% of lung adenocarcinomas have oncogenic fusions of EML-4 and ALK a mutation associated with tumorigenesis and migration. Several studies have shown that in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cells, the use of ALK inhibitors can achieve better efficacy and significantly prolong overall survival. However few of them performed Fish or NGS tests. Our data demonstrates that lung squamous cell carcinoma with ALK rearrangement responds well to ALK-TKI, and correspondingly has a significant improvement in survival time and prognosis, providing a basis for the treatment of ALK-positive patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma. At the same time, we believe that genetic testing is also required for lung squamous cell carcinoma to achieve more accurate medication.
