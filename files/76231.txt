A Longitudinal Study of Plasma EBV DNA in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma From Both Endemic and Non-Endemic Patient Populations
1. To determine the prognostic implication of plasma Epstein-Bar Virus (EBV) DNA concentrations, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
2. To relate pretreatment plasma EBV DNA concentration to WHO classification of these tumors both in endemic and non-endemic areas.
3. To determine whether pretreatment plasma EBV DNA can serve as a prognostic factor for both endemic and non-endemic patient populations.

Plasma Epstein-Bar Virus (EBV) DNA concentrations, measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), every 6 months until end of study
