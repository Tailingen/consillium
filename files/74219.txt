HDM201 in Combination With MBG453 or Venetoclax in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
This was a phase 1b, multi-arm, open-label study of HDM201 in combination with MBG453 or venetoclax in subjects with AML or high-risk MDS.

For all subjects, TP53wt status had to be characterized by, at a minimum, no mutations noted in exons 5, 6, 7 and 8.

Two treatment arms enrolled subjects in parallel to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary antitumor activity of HDM201+MBG453 (treatment arm 1) and HDM201+venetoclax (treatment arm 2).

* In the treatment arm 1, subjects received HDM201 in combination with MBG453.
* In the treatment arm 2, subjects received HDM201 in combination with venetoclax. Venetoclax dose was gradually increased (ramp-up) over a period of 4 to 5 days to achieve the daily target dose tested that was subsequently continued.

Upon the completion of the escalation part, MTD(s) and/or RD(s) of HDM201 in combination with MBG453 or venetoclax in AML and high-risk MDS subjects was planned to be determined for each treatment arm.
