A Clinical Trial of Oral Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid (SAHA) in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Breast, Colorectal and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (0683-011)(TERMINATED)
This is an investigational study to determine the response rate of relapsed/refractory breast, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer to oral suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), to evaluate PET as an earlier indicator of response to SAHA as assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST) criteria and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid.

Response rate of relapsed/refractory breast, colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer to SAHA using RECIST criteria.
Positron emission tomography (PET) as an earlier indicator of the response to SAHA as assessed by RECIST criteria. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAHA for 14 days every 21 days.
