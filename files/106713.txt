Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy With Famitinib for Patients With Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
RATIONALE: Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3, Flt1 and Flt3. Phase I study of mono famitinib has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the safety and tolerance of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with famitinib for patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
