Application of the Stem Cell Therapy in the End Stage Liver Disease and Assessment Its Consequences in the Quality of Live Style as Well as Development of HCC.
Prospective study to calculated the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis C virus infected patients after stem cell therapy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C Virus Infected Patients
Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma post stem cell therapy in hepatitis C virus infected patients, within the first year after stem cell therapy
Compare the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients who had received stem cell therapy to those who had received the standared line of care, within one year of follow up of hepatitis C virus infected patients
Compare liver function in both groups, after one year of follow up|asses liver functions in both groups, after one year of follow up
Our prospective research is carried out in one of the stem cell therapy centers in Egypt where 140 hepatitis C virus infected patients attending for stem cell therapy are enrolled in our study and the patients will be followed up after stem cell therapy where the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma after stem cell therapy will be calculated , another group of hepatitis C virus infected patients attending to Kasr El Aini university hospital to receive the standered line of care as indicated will be enrolled in our study and will be followed up , where the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma will be calculated and compared to the previous group , to determine if there is a significant difference between both groups regarding the incidence of hepatocellular and determine whether stem cell therapy affecets the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis C virus infected patients.
