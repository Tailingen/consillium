Comparative Study of Photodynamic Therapy vs. CO2 Laser Therapy in Treatment of Actinic Keratoses
The purpose of this study is to determine whether photodynamic therapy or CO2 laser therapy is superior in the treatment of actinic keratoses with respect to efficacy and side effects.
Actinic Keratosis
PROCEDURE: ablative CO2 laser therapy|PROCEDURE: photodynamic therapy
Number of actinic keratoses 3 months after treatment, 3 months
Histologic features, 1 month after therapy|Epidermal thickness in optical coherence tomography, 1 month after therapy
Ablative laser therapy and photodynamic therapy are widely used and accepted therapeutic methods to treat multiple actinic keratoses, yet comparative studies are rare. The purpose of this study is to compare both treatments intraindividually with respect to treatment efficacy and side effects.
