Gefitinib and Berberine in the First-line Treatment of Lung Adenocarcinoma With EGFR Mutation
Rationale:

Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations (del19 or L858R) show an impressive progression-free survival between 9 and 11 months when treated with gefitinib. Combination of gefitinib and berberine could improve efficacy in lung cancer with EGFR mutation in vivo and vitro. The investigators hypothesize that progression-free survival could be improved by combination of gefitinib and berberine.
Lung Adenocarcinoma|EGFR Mutation
DRUG: gefitinib|DRUG: Berberine
Progression free survival, Time from the date of enrolment to discontinuation of treatment for any reason (including progression of disease, treatment toxicity, refusal and death), Within 6 months of the last visit of last patient, approximately 30 months after inclusion of first patient
Objective response, Best overall response (complete remission or partial remission) across all assessment time-points according to RECIST Criteria 1.1, during the period from enrolment to termination of trial treatment., through study completion,an average of three years|safety, Adverse events graded according to NCI CTCAE V4., Within 6 months of the last visit of last patient, approximately 30 months after inclusion of first patient
Strong lipogenic activity and high expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) were found in gefitinib-resistance NSCLC cells. Berberine, an effective suppressor of SREBP1 and lipogenesis regulated through ROS/AMPK pathway, selectively inhibited the growth of gefitinib-resistance NSCLC cells but not that of normal cells. It effectively caused mitochondrial dysfunction, activated reactive oxygen species (ROS)/AMPK pathway and finally suppressed cellular lipogenesis and cell proliferation. Addition of ROS blocker, AMPK inhibitor and palmitic acid significantly reduced the effect of Berberine. In in vivo study, treatment of Berberine led to significant inhibition of mouse tumor xenograft growth.
