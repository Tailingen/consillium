Combined Intrathecal Morphine and Dexmedetomidine Analgesia
The current study investigated the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia in cancer patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.

Opioids, administered intrathecal or epidural, are widely used for postoperative, and chronic nociceptive pain secondary to cancers. Intrathecal injection of morphine to provide postoperative analgesia during the initial 24 h after operation is a widely used technique.The Human studies on the antinociceptive effects of co-administrated intrathecal morphine and dexmedetomidine in postoperative pain are still lacking. In this study, the investigators aimed to compare the synergistic interaction and side-effects of combined intrathecal morphine and dexmedetomidine with either drug alone for postoperative analgesia in cancer patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups of 30 patients each to receive either; hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% (Group I/Bupivacaine Group), bupivacaine and 0.5 mg morphine (Group II/Morphine Group), bupivacaine and 0.5 mg morphine plus 5 Âµg of dexmedetomidine (Group III/Morphine-DEX Group). The assigned drugs were dissolved in 1ml physiological saline and administered intrathecal with bupivacaine before induction of general anesthesia.
