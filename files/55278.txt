A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Cobimetinib Plus Atezolizumab in BRAFV600 Wild-type Melanoma With Central Nervous System Metastases and Cobimetinib Plus Atezolizumab and Vemurafenib in BRAFV600 Mutation-positive Melanoma With Central Nervous System Metastases
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab in participants with BRAFV600 wild-type melanoma with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab and vemurafenib in BRAFV600 mutation-positive melanoma patients with CNS metastases.
Metastatic Melanoma
DRUG: Cobimetinib|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Vemurafenib
Intracranial Objective Response Rate (ORR), Intracranial ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) in their intracranial disease based on two consecutive assessments \>= 4 weeks apart. Disease status for this endpoint will be determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) with modified measurability definition for intracranial lesions (\>= 0.5 cm by MRI) and allowing up to five intracranial target lesions. CR is defined as disappearance of all lesions. PR is defined as \>=30% decrease in tumor burden, in the absence of CR. The primary endpoint is analyzed on the BRAFV600 mutation positive (Cohort 2) only as the Sponsor had discontinued enrolment into Cohort 1. Data for Cohort 1 was not collected nor analyzed for this outcome measure., Baseline up to cut of date (approximately 2.5 years)
Extracranial ORR, Extracranial ORR, defined as the percentage of participants with either a CR or PR in their extracranial disease based on two consecutive assessments \>=4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline up to cut of date (approximately 2.5 years)|Overall ORR, Overall ORR, defined as the percentage of participants with either a CR or PR in their overall disease (i.e. including intracranial and extracranial disease) based on two consecutive assessments \>= 4 weeks apart, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR., Baseline up to cut of date (approximately 2.5 years)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Intracranial, extracranial and overall PFS defined as the time from study treatment initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Baseline up to cut of date (approximately 2.5 years)|Duration of Response (DOR), Intracranial, extracranial and overall DOR, defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response based on two consecutive assessments â‰¥ 4 weeks apart to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. This endpoint is analyzed on the BRAFV600 mutation positive (Cohort 2) only as the Sponsor had discontinued enrolment into Cohort 1. Data for Cohort 1 was not collected nor analyzed for this outcome measure., Baseline up to cut of date (approximately 2.5 years)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Intracranial, extracranial and overall DCR, defined as the percentage of participants with a CR or PR or stable disease (SD) at 16 weeks from study treatment initiation, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and (if applicable) normalization of tumor marker levels. PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR or PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression. Disease progression is defined as \>=20% increase in tumor burden. This endpoint is analyzed on the BRAFV600 mutation positive (Cohort 2) only as the Sponsor had discontinued enrolment into Cohort 1. Data for Cohort 1 was not collected nor analyzed for this outcome measure., At 16 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from study treatment initiation to death from any cause., Baseline up to 4 years, 4 months|Time to Cognitive Symptom Deterioration, Time from study treatment initiation to cognitive symptom deterioration, defined as a change (\>= 10 points on a 0-100 scale) on selected scales of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BN20) (visual disorder, motor dysfunction, communication deficit, headaches, seizures and drowsiness)., Up to 48 months|Time to Symptom and Function Deterioration, Time from study treatment initiation to symptom and function deterioration defined as a change (\>= 10 points on a 0-100 scale) in fatigue, physical functioning, cognitive functioning, or role functioning as measured by the Fatigue, Physical, Cognitive, Role Functioning scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30., Up to 48 months|Duration of Stable/Improved Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Scores, Duration of Stable/Improved HRQoL scores as assessed through use of the two-item Global Health Status (GHS)/HRQoL subscale (Questions 29 and 30) of the EORTC QLQ-C30., Baseline up to cut of date (approximately 2.5 years)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, The safety profile of Cobimetinib plus Atezolizumab and Cobimetinib plus Atezolizumab plus Vemurafenib is evaluated in terms of occurrence and severity of AEs. Severity will be determined according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0), Baseline up to 4 years, 4 months
