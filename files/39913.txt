A Study to Assess the Feasibility of an E-Health System (ZEMY) Designed to Manage Symptoms in Participants With Breast Cancer Under Anti-Cancer Treatment
This is a three-month open-label, multicenter, interventional, single arm study located in France, designed to assess feasibility and reliability of the e-Health ZEMY software medical device under investigation for use by participants with breast cancer, who are starting an anti-cancer treatment at any stage of the disease, to manage disease symptoms and anti-cancer treatment-related toxicities while at home.
