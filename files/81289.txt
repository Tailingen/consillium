INCB106385 Alone or in Combination With Immunotherapy in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation/dose-expansion Phase 1 clinical study to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK profile, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical efficacy of INCB106385 when given as monotherapy or in combination with INCMGA00012 in participants with selected CD8 T-cell-positive advanced solid tumors including SCCHN, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, CRPC, TNBC, bladder cancer, and specified GI malignancies (defined as CRC, gastric/GEJ cancer, HCC, PDAC, or SCAC)
