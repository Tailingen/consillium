1st Line Treatment of Bevacizumab-Taxane vs Bevacizumab-Exemestane in Metastatic Breast Cancer
In first-line metastatic breast cancer, the bevacizumab-taxane to progression or toxicity, is currently the standard treatment. In patients expressing hormone receptors, it was shown that hormone therapy administered in maintenance after induction chemotherapy, could have a benefit regarding the progression-free survival. The investigators make the hypothesis that there would be interest to discontinue treatment with taxane after 4 months, and to begin hormone therapy while continuing maintenance bevacizumab.

Exemestane was chosen because it has been shown potentially active in patients who progressed after letrozole, anastrozole or tamoxifen.
