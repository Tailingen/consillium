Total-Body FDG PET for Radiotherapy Response Assessment in Head and Neck Cancer
The overall goal of this research study is to understand how 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a radioactive sugar behaves in head and neck cancer (HNC) and inflammation immediately following injection and at many hours post-injection, with the world's first total-body positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scanner (EXPLORER).
