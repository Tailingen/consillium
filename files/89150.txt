Study of XL092 in Combination With Immuno-Oncology Agents in Subjects With Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter Phase 1b, open label, dose-escalation and cohort-expansion study, evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, preliminary antitumor activity, and effect of biomarkers of XL092 administered alone, and in combination with nivolumab (doublet), nivolumab + ipilimumab (triplet) and nivolumab + relatlimab (triplet) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

In the Expansion Stage, the safety and efficacy of XL092 as monotherapy and in combination therapy will be further evaluated in tumor-specific Expansion Cohorts.
