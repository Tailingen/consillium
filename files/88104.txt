Radiotherapy & Olaparib in COmbination for Carcinoma of the Oesophagus
The purpose of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of olaparib in combination with radical radiotherapy in patients with oesophageal cancer who are unsuitable for platinum containing chemotherapy.
Carcinoma of the Oesophagus
DRUG: Olaparib|RADIATION: Radical external beam radiotherapy, 50Gy in 25 fractions
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of olaparib in combination with radical radiotherapy in patients with oesophageal cancer, MTD will be determined by the number of patients experiencing dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in each treatment cohort, using a 3+3 dose escalation schedule. A DLT is determined as grade 4 oesophagitis or dysphagia, or any other grade 3 toxicity. DLTs will be assessed weekly during treatment (day -3 to week 5), 10-14 days after completing treatment, weekly for a further 3 weeks and 3 months after completing treatment., 3 months post treatment
Overall toxicity profile of treatment (NCRI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects V3), Toxicity of treatment will be assessed via collection of adverse events, categorised by the NCRI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) V3. Adverse event data will be collected continuously from screening, with patients seen weekly during their treatment, 10-14 days after treatment completion, weekly for 3 further weeks, 3 monthly until 1 year then 6 monthly until 3 years., Assessed at all study visits, up to 3 years post treatment.|Olaparib compliance, At completion of olaparib treatment (end of week 5)|Radiotherapy (RT) compliance, At completion of RT treatment (end of week 5)|Local and overall treatment failure rate, This is defined as residual disease pathologically on endoscopic assessment \& biopsy or progressive disease on CT scan of thorax and abdomen., 3 months|Exploration of blood and tissue borne pharmacodynamic markers to establish the biological efficacy of the addition of Olaparib to radiotherapy., * Endoscopic biopsy sample taken for analysis at screening \& 3 months post treatment
* Translational research blood samples taken at screening, weekly during treatment, at end of treatment visit \& 3 months after treatment
* Skin biopsy samples taken from within \& outside irradiated field at week 4, Up to 3 months post treatment
The purpose of this study is to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of olaparib in combination with radical radiotherapy in patients with oesophageal cancer who are unsuitable for platinum containing chemotherapy.
