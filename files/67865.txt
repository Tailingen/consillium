QL1706 Plus Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy in Early High-Risk TNBC Breast Cancer
This study will look at the efficacy and safety of QL1706 plus albumin-bound paclitaxel and carboplatin in a neoadjuvant setting, in high-risk, TNBC early breast cancer.

pCR rate using an alternative definition, ypT0/Tis, PCR rate (ypT0/Tis) is defined as the percentage of participants without invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 36 weeks after study start|pCR rate in PD-L1+ population, pCR rate (ypT0/is ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in participants with tumors expressing Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)., Up to approximately 36 weeks after study start|rate of RCB scored 0-1, Residual cancer burden scored at 0-1 on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to approximately 36 weeks after study start|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on BICR and investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 36 weeks after study start
This study is a single-arm, single-center, phase II clinical study designed to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of QL1706 combined with Pcb regimen in the neoadjuvant treatment of early-stage high-risk TNBC breast cancer.

It is planned to enroll 73 subjects. After the subjects are enrolled in the study, they will receive 6 cycles of QL1706 combined with PCb regimen. A 3-week treatment cycle is used until the treatment termination event specified in the protocol occurs. The subjects will continue to undergo postoperative efficacy and safety visits after ending of the treatment.
