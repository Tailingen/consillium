Multiple clinical trials about chemotherapy plus venetoclax in primary diagnosed AML or relapsed/refractly AML were ongoing to attempt the facility of the combination. Zu et al demostrated that full dose of 3 + 7 daunorubicin and cytarabine chemotherapy plus 8 days escalated venetoclax acheived 91% of CR/CRi with 97% 1-year overall survival and 72% 1-year event-free survival. In this trial , we try to reduced the intensive of 3 + 5 idarubicin and cytarabine chemotherapy, but prolong venetoclax to two weeks in the induction therapy in adults AML/MDS. We expect to increase the induced remission rate by extending the dosage of targeted drug venetoclax, and minimize the side effects by reducing the dose of 3 + 7 induction chemotherapy, so as to achieve the goal of high efficiency and low toxicity.
