Clinical Implementation of TNM-immunoscore in Resected Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to validate TNM-Immunoscore in resected non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: Will look for immune infiltration
Overall survival, Overall survival in the 1) overall population and in the 2) squamous cell carcinoma and 3) adenocarcinoma subgroups., 5 year follow-up
TTR, Time to recurrence in the 1) overall population and in the 2) squamous cell carcinoma and 3) adenocarcinoma subgroups., 5 year follow-up|Disease-specific survival, Disease specific survival in the 1) overall population and in the 2) squamous cell carcinoma and 3) adenocarcinoma subgroups., 5 year follow-up
The main aim is to validate the most promising T-cell marker candidates from earlier studies in a prospective multicenter study to establish a prognostic TNM-Immunoscore.

The investigators will include around 1000 stage I-IIIA patients from various centers in Scandinavia. The investigators will also collect demographic and clinicopathological data, blood and tissues in a database and biobank. Candidate T-cell markers will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry for validation and by other methods for exploration of their impact on prognosis
