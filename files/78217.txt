Colorectal Polyp Resection Adequacy
The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to ensure that polyps are completely removed by evaluating the borders of the removed polyp. If a polyp is found that meets the size requirements for the study, the investigators will take extra biopsies of the margin to determine if there is any abnormal tissue or cancer at these borders.
Polyp Resection Adequacy
The incomplete resection rates in polyps from Group 1 (clear margins) versus Group 2 (positive margins)., Define the frequency of free margins versus margins that have dysplasia to the cautery site in snare polypectomy. A free margin is defined as uninvolved or normal mucosa extending to the cautery margin at the polypectomy stalk., Between 3-6 months
