Evaluation of Pemetrexed Combined With Cisplatin and Radiotherapy for Unresectable Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The aim of this study is to evaluate if the multi modality treatment pemetrexed combined with cisplatin and radiotherapy can lead to a better tumor control and/or a better side-effect profile in patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Patients will be randomized between 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by 3 cycles of adjuvant combination chemotherapy.
