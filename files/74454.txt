Pilot Study of Cabazitaxel and Paclitaxel in HER2 Negative Breast Cancer
90 patients with HER2 negative breast cancer will be randomised to receive 18 weeks of chemotherapy treatment, either 6 cycles of 3 weekly Cabazitaxel or 6 cycles of weekly Paclitaxel to determine the difference in progression free survival between the 2 groups. If results at that stage suggest a potential benefit then the trial will be developed further to accrue 70 more patients.
HER2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cabazitaxel|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Progression free survival, Duration of progression free survival, Defined as the time from randomisation to either disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years.
Clinical benefit rate, Defined as stable disease rate + partial response rate+complete response rate according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, At the completion of 6 cycles of chemotherapy, which is after 18 weeks|Objective response rate, Defined as complete and partial response recorded from the start of treatment to completion of 6 cycles of treatment., At completion of 6 cycles of chemotherapy, which is after 18 weeks.|Overall survival, Survival duration from randomisation to date of death., Determined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. Average survival rates for this population may be approximately 18 months.|Time to next chemotherapy treatment, time from randomisation to another chemotherapy treatment after confirmed progression., Measured from from the date of the last day of trial treatment. approximately after progression which on average would be after 12 months.|Time to response, Time taken for tumour burden to respond to treatment, Determined by time from randomisation to radiological partial response, usually within the 6 cycles of treatment, therefore wihtin 18 weeks.|Quality of life as measured by patients themselves, 2 Quality of life questionnaires, EQ5D-5L and FACT B will be completed at baseline, prior to cycles 3 and 5 and at the end of treatment visit, therefore within approximately 21 weeks from randomisation|Number of adverse events and Number of participants with adverse events per arm and the grade of AEs, CTCAE Version 4.0 graded AEs, Form the date of consent to 30 days after trial treatment has stopped.
This is a prospective multicentre, randomised, open label, study comparing the efficacy and the safety of six 3-weekly cycles cabazitaxel versus 18 x weekly paclitaxel given as first line chemotherapy treatment in patients with HER2-normal metastatic breast cancer. Randomisation will be conducted by a 1:1 ratio.
