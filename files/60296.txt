A Study of Dasatinib as First-line Treatment for Newly Diagnosed Chronic-Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML-CP)
The purpose of this multicenter,open, prospective and single arm study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of domestic dasatinib in the first-line treatment of newly diagnosed CML-CP.
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia - Chronic Phase
DRUG: Dasatinib Tablets
Proportion of subjects who achieve and maintain major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months, MMR is defined as BCR-ABL1IS ≤ 0.1%, up to 12 months
Proportion of subjects who achieve and maintain MMR at 3，6 and 18 months, MMR is defined as BCR-ABL1IS ≤ 0.1%, up to 18 months|Time to MMR Overall, The time to MMR for all participants is defined as the time from first use of the study drug until measurement criteria are first met for MMR., up to 24 months|Cumulative MMR rates at 6, 12 and 24 months, MMR is defined as BCR-ABL1IS ≤ 0.1%, up to 24 months|Proportion of subjects who achieve and maintain MR4.0 and MR4.5 at 6, 12 and 24 months, MR4.0 is defined as BCR-ABL1IS ≤ 0.01%, MR4.5 is defined as BCR-ABL1IS ≤ 0.0032%, up to 24 months|Cumulative complete cytogenic response (CCyR) rates at 12 and 24 months, CCyR is defined as 0% Ph+ metaphases, up to 24 months|Proportion of subjects who achieve and maintain complete hematological response (CHR) at 3 months, CHR was defined as peripheral blood WBC \< 10x109 / L, PLT \< 450x109 / L, no immature granulocytes, basophils \< 0.05, no symptoms and signs of CML, spleen untouchable, up to 3 months|Time to accelerated phase (AP ) / blast crisis (BC), Time to AP / BC is defined as the time from the first use of the study drug to the date of CML related death or progression to AP or BC, whichever occurs first. For subjects without these events, the event was truncated at the date of the last evaluation (Hematology, extramedullary disease, or cytogenetic evaluation), up to 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first use of the study drug to the earliest occurrence of the following events: death from any cause (if death was the main cause of discontinuation) or progression to AP or BC., up to 24 months|Event free survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from the first use of the study drug to the earliest occurrence of the following events during the study treatment: loss of CHR, loss of PCyCR, loss of CCyR, death from any cause during the treatment, and progression to AP or BC, up to 24 months|ABL mutation rate after 6 months of treatment, The proportion of ABL mutations in subjects with BCR-ABL1IS \> 1% or disease progression after 6 months of treatment, up to 6 months|Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) to dasatinib, Evaluation of AEs, SAEs, and clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests according to laboratory reference ranges, up to 24 months
