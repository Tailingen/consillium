Convection-Enhanced Delivery of 124I-Omburtamab for Patients With Non-Progressive Diffuse Pontine Gliomas Previously Treated With External Beam Radiation Therapy
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new method to treat Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). The researchers will use "convection-enhanced delivery" (CED) to deliver an agent called 124I-omburtamab. CED is performed during surgery. The study agent is infused through a small tube placed into the tumor in the brain. Many studies have shown this can safely be done in animals but this study is the first time 124I-omburtamab will be given by CED in humans. This will be one of the first times that CED has been performed in the brain stem.

Omburtamab is something called an antibody. Antibodies are made by the body to fight infections and sometimes cancer. The antibody omburtamab is produced by mice and can attack many kinds of tumors. A radioactive substance, 124I-omburtamab, is attached to omburtamab. 124I-omburtamab sticks to parts of tumor cells and can cause the tumor cells to die from radiation. Studies have also been done on humans using 124I-omburtamab to treat other kinds of cancer. Our studies of some DPG and related tumors suggest that omburtamab will bind to the tumor, but the investigators don't know that for sure.

In this study, the researchers want to find out how safe 124I-omburtamab given by CED is at different dose levels. They will look to see what effects (both good and bad) it has on the patient. The dose of 124I-omburtamab will increase for each new group of patients. The procedure has already been safely performed with lower doses and infusion volumes in a number of patients here at MSKCC. The amount they get will depend on when they enter the study. If too many serious side effects are seen with a certain dose, no one will be treated with a higher dose, and some more patients may be treated with a lower dose to make sure that dose is safe.

maximum tolerated dose, Determination that a dose is safe will be made following the treatment of at least 3 but no more than 6 patients at a particular dose level. The dose levels are DL1 (0.25 mCi), DL2 (0.5 mCi), DL3 (0.75 mCi), DL4 (1.0 mCi) DL5 (2.5mCi), DL6 (3.25mCi), DL7 (4.0mCi), DL 7.1(4.0mCi), DL 7.2 (4.0mCi), DL 8 (6.0mCi), DL 9 (8.0mCi), DL 10 (10.0mCi), DL 11 (12.0mCi) ,fallback DL0 (0.125 mCi) FB1 (1.50mCi) and FB2 (2.0mCi). An incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the range of 25% is considered acceptable in this population. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined as the dose level below that at which 2 DLTs have occurred., 2 years|assess the toxicity profile, Adverse events (toxicity) will be assessed and classified according to the Clinical Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE). Generally, grade 3 toxicities interfere with activities of daily living (ADLs) and grade 4 toxicities are life-threatening. Grade 5 toxicities cause death., 2 years
overall survival, Overall survival from the time of diagnosis will be recorded for every patient in this study. Overall survival will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier methodology., 2 years
