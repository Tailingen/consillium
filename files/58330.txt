PRaG Therapy in Combination With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (NeoPRAG Study)
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about Phase I+Phase II Clinical Study of PRaG Therapy in Combination With Chemotherapy (AG Regimen) for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (NeoPRAG Study).The main question it aims to answer is to investigate the safety and efficacy of the PRaG treatment modality combined with chemotherapy neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: Immunotherapy:Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor(GM-CSF)、Cadumilimab|DRUG: Chemotherapy:Albumin-bound paclitaxel、Gemcitabine
Adverse events, From the beginning of treatment, record the treatment-related toxic reactions that occur in patients., 36 months|Serious adverse events, From the start of treatment, record any severe adverse reactions that occur in the patient., 36 months|1-year overall survival, Record the 1-year overall survival rate of patients after receiving treatment, The 1-year overall survival rate of patients after receiving treatment
Objective response rate, The lesions were evaluated according to the RECIST1.1 standard, and the proportion of patients with the best treatment response of CR and PR after treatment to the total number of evaluable cases was calculated., 36 months|Disease control rate, The lesions were evaluated according to the RECIST1.1 standard, and the proportion of patients with optimal treatment response of CR, PR, and SD after treatment was calculated based on the total number of evaluable cases., 36 months|Overall survival, The time from the first day of enrollment to the occurrence of death due to any reason. Patients who are still alive at the time of analysis will use the date of their last contact as the deadline., 36 months|R0 resection rate, The tumor was completely removed during surgery, and the resection margin was negative under microscopic observation., 36 months|Progression free survival, The time between the start of treatment and the observation of disease progression or death for any reason. Patients who are still alive at the time of analysis will use the date of their last contact as the cutoff date., 36 months
