Real-life Pan-HER-blockade With Neratinib
So far, there is no data available on treatment of patients with early-stage hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressed/amplified breast cancer, who completed adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy less than one year ago, in the clinical routine setting.

ELEANOR - designed as a prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional study (NIS) - will investigate real-world use of neratinib and its treatment management in patients with HR-positive, HER2-overexpressing/amplified breast cancer stage I-III having completed adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy less than one year ago. Data from this study will contribute to a deeper understanding and characterization of the everyday use of neratinib in a broader patient population in the German and Austrian routine setting.
