Low-dose Gemcitabine and Cisplatin and PD-1/PD-L1 Antibody Therapy in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
In this phase 2 study, researchers aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy and the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1/PD-L1 antibody in patients with advanced and unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

More and more studies suggest that low-dose chemotherapy has the ability to reshape the tumor microenvironment and promote tumor immunotherapy in a variety of tumors, supporting the rationality of combining low-dose chemotherapy with immunotherapy to effectively treat tumors with low T cell infiltration. More than half of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas are non-inflammatory \&quot;cold tumors\&quot;, and their unique immunosuppressive microenvironment is one of the reasons for the poor response rate to immunotherapy. Low-dose chemotherapy can transform \&quot;cold\&quot; tumors with low immunogenicity and poor immune cell infiltration into \&quot;hot\&quot; tumors with immune responsiveness and sufficient immune cell infiltration, enhance the effect of ICIs on tumor cells, and minimize systemic toxicity, thus preserving a \&quot;therapeutic window\&quot; for combined immunotherapy/targeted therapy. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that it is necessary to study the optimal dose of chemotherapeutic drugs in combination therapy. In combination therapy, long-term, adequate doses of chemotherapeutic drugs may be unnecessary because this will not only lead to more severe toxicity, but also damage rather than enhance anti-tumor immunity.

To determine the efficacy and safety of low-dose chemotherapy combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, we designed an open-label, prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical study of low-dose gemcitabine + cisplatin combined with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in the treatment of patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
