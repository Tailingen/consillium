Bortezomib and Cisplatin as First-Line Therapy in Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma
RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving bortezomib together with cisplatin works as first-line therapy in treating patients with malignant mesothelioma.
Malignant Mesothelioma
DRUG: bortezomib|DRUG: cisplatin
Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 18 weeks
Overall objective response rate|Symptomatic response rate|Safety as measured by NCI CTCAE v3.0 and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity questionnaire|Duration of PFS|Overall survival
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the activity and safety of bortezomib and cisplatin as first-line treatment in patients with malignant mesothelioma.
* Validate the use of progression-free survival rate as a primary endpoint for the design of phase II mesothelioma trials.

OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study.
