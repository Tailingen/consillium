Conversion Therapy of Disitamab Vedotin Combined With Sintilimab and S-1 in HER2 Overexpression Gastric Cancer
This is a phase II, one-arm study, which is aiming to evaluate the feasibility of combination of Disitamab Vedotin, Sintilimab and S-1 as conversion therapy in patients with HER2 overexpression unresectable gastric cancer .
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Disitamab Vedotin|DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: S-1|PROCEDURE: Intraperitoneal chemotherapy with paclitaxel
R0 resection rate, The proportion of patients who underwent R0 surgery among all patients., 1 year
objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients who achieved patial response and complete reponse per RECIST version 1.1., up to one year|overall survival (OS), median OS or OS rate, From the first dose to death from any cause, up to two years.|Recurrence free survival（RFS）, median RFS or RFS rate, From the first dose to recurrence or death from any cause, up to two years.|safety profile, The grade and proportion of adverse events, treatment related adverse events, immune-related adverse events (irAEs), serious adverse events, and perioperative complications, etc., up to 30 days after last treatment administration
In this study, 30 HER2 overexpression unresectable gastric cancer patients will enrolle and treate with Disitamab Vedotin, Sintilimab and S-1. During the study period, imaging examinations were conducted every 6-12 weeks to evaluate the tumor and whether it reached the operable standard. The scheme and duration of postoperative adjuvant treatment were determined by the investigator according to the patient's conditions (Sintilimab was recommended to be maintained for 1 year, and other drugs were increased or decreased according to the patient's conditions). During the study, safety evaluation and effectiveness evaluation will be conducted.
