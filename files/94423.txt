A Phase 2 Study of Isatuximab in Combination With Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone Followed by Isatuximab and Lenalidomide Maintenance in Newly Diagnosed Patients With Multiple Myeloma and Severe Renal Impairment
This is an Investigator-Initiated, phase 2, prospective, open-label study designed to be conducted in six hospitals in Greece.

Eligible patients will initially receive an induction phase of six 28-day cycles of isatuximab in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCd), followed by a maintenance phase with isatuximab and lenalidomide until disease progression, death, unacceptable adverse events, lost to follow up, or consent withdrawal, whichever occurs first. The study will last for approximately 36 months (follow-up period), starting from the date of the first patient in, to the date of the last patient last visit.

The primary objective is to assess the effect of induction treatment with isatuximab in combination with VCd on the renal function of newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma and severe renal impairment (RI).

The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of isatuximab in combination with VCd, followed by lenalidomide maintenance on: Overall response rate, Progression-Free Survival, Time to Response, Duration of Response, Overall Survival, Minimal Residual Disease negativity rate, Safety

Renal Response Rate (RRR), The primary endpoint is the renal response rate (RRR) after six months of treatment with isatuximab plus VCd. RRR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a partial renal (PRrenal) or better response after six months of treatment with isatuximab plus VCd, using the eGFR cut-off values of the IMWG response criteria, After six months of treatment with isatuximab plus VCd
Overall response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients who achieve a partial response (PR) or better, assessed by the Investigator using the IMWG criteria, from study treatment initiation to progressive disease (PD), or initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment, or death, whichever comes first., From study treatment initiation to progressive disease (PD), or initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment, or death, whichever comes first. Maximum time period 36 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from study treatment initiation to the date of first documentation of PD, assessed by the Investigator using the IMWG response criteria, or initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment, or death from any cause, whichever comes first., From study treatment initiation to progressive disease (PD), or initiation of further anti-myeloma treatment, or death, whichever comes first. Maximum time period 36 months|Time to Response (TTR), The time from study treatment initiation to the date of the first objective response of partial response (PR) or better, assessed with the IMWG response criteria., From study treatment initiation to partial response (PR), or better. Maximum time period 36 months|Duration of Response (DoR), The time from the date of the first objective response to the date of the first documented PD, assessed by the Investigator using the IMWG response criteria, or death, whichever occurs first. DoR will be assessed only for patients who have achieved â‰¥ partial response (PR), From time response is achieved to progressive disease (PD), or death, whichever comes first. Maximum time period 36 months|Overall Survival (OS), The time from study treatment initiation to the date of death from any cause. OS will be assessed during the response follow-up visits until the end of the study., From study treatment initiation to death. Maximum time period 36 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity, The proportion of patients achieving MRD-negative status, assessed by the Investigator at suspected complete response as per IMWG criteria., Through study completion. Maximum time period 36 months|Safety Events i.e. Adverse Events (AEs), Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), The incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)., Study treatment initiation until 30 days after last study treatment. Maximum time period 36 months
