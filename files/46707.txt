HX044,FIH Study in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies
The study will consist of a dose-escalation and dose-expansion component to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of HX044.

HX044 is an investigational drug that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory authorities for commercial purposes. This is the first study in which HX044 will be given to humans. The study drug has been tested in animals and was found to be well-tolerated with minimal side effects.
Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies
DRUG: HX044
Number of participants experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurence in a patient or subject, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., All AEs up to 90(±7）days after the last dose of study treatment|Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities(DLT) of HX044, All AEs/toxicities will be graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,Vesion5.0(NCI CTCAE v5.0);For the purpose of dose escalation, any of the following AEs occurring during the DLT observation period that were attributable to one or both study drugs were classified as DLTs., At the end of Cycle 2(each cycle is 21±3 days)
Objective response rate (ORR) per Investigator Assessment Using RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, Objective response rate (ORR) ,using RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria, is defined as the proportion of subjects with best overall response of complete response(CR)/iCR or partial response(PR)/iPR after treatment., Approximately 2 years|Disease control rate(DCR) per Investigator Assessment Using RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, Disease control rate(DCR) ,using RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST criteria, is defined as the proportion of subjects with best overall response of complete response(CR)/iCR or partial response(PR)/iPR or disease stabilization(SD)/iSD after treatment., Approximately 2 years|Number of participants with positive Anti-Drug Antibody(ADA) of HX044, ADA blood samples are assayed for anti-HX044 antibodies., Cycle 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,14,18 and then every 8 cycles,Day 1: with 60 minutes before the start of the infusion.|Time of Cmax(Tamx) of HX044, Time to reach HX044 maximum observed serum concentration, Approximately 2 years|Terminal Half life( t½) of HX044, HX044 terminal half-life., Approximately 2 years|Area Under the serum concentration-time curve(AUC), HX044 area under the serum concentration-time curve, Approximately 2 years
