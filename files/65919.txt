A Phase III Randomised Trial of Peri-Operative Chemotherapy Versus sUrveillance in Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer (POUT)
POUT is a multi-centred randomised controlled phase III trial. 345 patients who have undergone nephro-ureterectomy, are surgically staged pT2-pT4, N0-3 or are pT1 and node positive, and who are fit for adjuvant chemotherapy, will be randomised to four cycles of adjuvant platinum based chemotherapy (experimental group) or surveillance (control group). Participants will be followed up according to routine practice.

Primary endpoint: Disease-free survival (DFS)

Secondary endpoints:

* Overall Survival
* Metastasis free survival
* Incidence of bladder second primary tumours
* Incidence of contralateral primary tumours
* Acute and late toxicity
* Treatment compliance
* Quality of life
Transitional Cell Carcinoma of Ureter
DRUG: Chemotherapy|OTHER: Surveillance
Disease-free survival (DFS), To determine whether adjuvant combination chemotherapy improves the disease-free survival for patients with resected histologically confirmed muscle invasive (pT2-T4, N0-3) or node positive upper tract TCC., 3 years
Overall survival, Whether adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy improves overall survival in this patient group, Patients followed-up for 5 years|Metastasis free survival, To determine whether adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy improves metastasis free survival in this patient group., Patients are followed up for 5 years|Incidence of bladder second primary tumours, Whether adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy reduces incidence of second primary urothelial cancers, Patients are followed up for 5 years|Incidence of contralateral primary tumours, To determine whether adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy reduces incidence of contralateral primary urothelial cancers., Patients are followed up for 5 years|Acute and late toxicity, To assess the toxicity of chemotherapy in this patient group., Patients are followed up for 5 years|Quality of life (QoL), To assess the relative quality of life in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy or surveillance in this patient group., Patients' QoL will be assessed over 2 years
