Radiation Therapy in Combination With Brachytherapy for Clinically Localized, Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and side effects "of "ultra-hypofractionated" radiation therapy when used after brachytherapy (radiation implants). This treatment delivers a higher radiation dose with each treatment over a shorter period of time.

Number of Participants With Urinary Toxicity Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Participants with Urinary Toxicity Assessed by CTCAE v4.0 at approximately 12 months of hypofractionated radiation therapy in combination with brachytherapy for the treatment of intermediate risk prostate cancer., 12 months
Mean Change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) to Assess Urinary Functioning From Baseline at 12 Months, The International Prostate Symptom Score/IPSS index is a seven item questionnaire that assesses urinary functioning, including urinary frequency, nocturia, weak urinary stream, hesitancy, intermittence, incomplete emptying, and urgency. Questions are rated on a six point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate more difficulty in urinary functioning. A score of 7 or less is mildly symptomatic, 8 to 19 is moderately symptomatic, and 20 to 35 is severely symptomatic. Scale range is 0-35. Total score is reported., 12 months
