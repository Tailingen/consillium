The Value of Monitoring Circulating Cell DNA (ctDNA) in Pediatric Mature B Cell Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (NHL): A Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study
The next-generation sequencing (NGS) based on liquid biopsy has been an emerging technology to identify tumor-specific genetic aberrations in malignant tumors. The tumor tissue (FFPE) and plasma samples from the newly diagnosed pediatric mature B-NHL patients were collected and sequenced by 475 genes panel before, during and post treatment, to evaluate the significance of the ctDNA in efficacy prediction, predicting recurrence or mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy for pediatric mature B-NHL.
Non-hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: modified BFM-95 protocol
The mutation rate of the ctDNA of pediatric mature B-NHL, From the beginning of observation to the end of observationï¼ˆ6 weeks) of the last enrolled patient
This is a prospective, multi-center, observational cohort study. The tumor tissue (FFPE) and plasma samples (bone marrow or cerebrospinal fluid samples if necessary) from the newly diagnosed patients were collected and sequenced by 475 genes panel before, during and post treatment. Collection and analysis the results of ctDNA and chemotherapy response, to explore the mutation map of pediatric lymphoma and to evaluate the significance of liquid biopsy for efficacy prediction, predicting recurrence, mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy.
