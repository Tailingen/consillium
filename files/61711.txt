Safety Study of Pharmacokinetics of XL888 in Adults With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL888 in subjects with solid tumors. XL888 is a potent and selective inhibitor of HSP90, a key component of a molecular chaperone complex that promotes the conformational maturation and stabilization of diverse client proteins. Many HSP90 client proteins play critical roles in signaling pathways implicated in tumor cell growth, proliferation, and survival.
