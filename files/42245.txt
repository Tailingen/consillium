Effect of Ultrasound Guided Laser Ablation Therapy on Symptomatic Benign Thyroid Nodules
This is a prospective trial to evaluate the effects of laser ablation on symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. The study is designed to assess the clinical efficacy, safety, tolerability and impact on symptoms of single ultrasound guided laser ablation treatment of symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. Approximately 20 subjects will undergo laser ablation of symptomatic benign nodules.
Thyroid Nodule

On a scale from 0 to 10, how much does your thyroid nodule affect your appearance? 0 being the best outcome and 10 being the worst outcome., 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after procedure
Reported Pain Score on the Numerical Scale Immediately Post Procedure., Change in pain will be measured using a numerical scale at baseline, immediately post procedure and 3 months after procedure using the following question. Rate your pain on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain possible., Immediately post-procedure|Tolerability of Ultrasound Guided Percutaneous Laser Ablation for Treatment of Symptomatic Benign Thyroid Nodules as Reported Through a Questionnaire After the Procedure., Participants will be asked to answer the following questionnaire after the procedure.

How likely is it that you would have the laser ablation procedure again? 1 = Very Likely 2 = Somewhat Likely 3 = Not Likely, Post-procedure on the day of procedure|Number of Participants With Treatment Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Treatment related adverse events will be captured using CTCAE v4,0 format, 1 year|Reported Pain Score on the Numerical Scale 3 Months Post Procedure., Change in pain will be measured using a numerical scale at baseline, immediately post procedure and 3 months after procedure using the following question. Rate your pain on a scale from 0 to 10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain possible., 3 months|Tolerability of Ultrasound Guided Percutaneous Laser Ablation for Treatment of Symptomatic Benign Thyroid Nodules as Reported Through a Questionnaire After the Procedure., Participants will be asked to answer the following questionnaire after the procedure.

How satisfied were you with the length of the laser ablation procedure? 1= Satisfied 2 = Neither 3 = Dissatisfied, Post-procedure on day of procedure|Tolerability of Ultrasound Guided Percutaneous Laser Ablation for Treatment of Symptomatic Benign Thyroid Nodules as Reported Through a Questionnaire After the Procedure., Participants will be asked to answer the following questionnaire after the procedure.

How much discomfort did you have with the laser ablation procedure? 1= Less than I thought 2 = About what I thought 3 = More than I thought, Post-procedure on day of procedure
* Laser ablation will be carried out in a single session under sterile conditions and ultrasound guidance with the support of Echolaser Smart Interface.
* Local anesthesia will be offered.
* The treatment plan will be assisted using the Echolaser Smart Interface.
* Depending on the shape and volume of the nodule to be treated, the investigator will determine whether one or two needles positioned parallel to each other along the longitudinal axis of the nodule will need to be used for treatment.
* Under ultrasound guidance, the investigator will introduce up to two 21-gauge introducer needles through the Guide kit into the target thyroid lesion percutaneously.
* Once the correct positioning of the needles has been verified under ultrasound imaging, an optical fiber is introduced into each needle with its tip protruding 5 mm out of the needle and in direct contact with the tissue to be ablated.
* Laser beam emission through the flat-tipped optical fiber produces a lesion (coagulation volume) within the nodule of an ellipsoidal shape, one third of which is positioned behind the tip of the fiber, and two-thirds in front.
* Each application session will last between 400 and 600 seconds under a laser source power output of 3W. An application is defined as the time between turning on and turning off the laser source.
* Up to 3 applications may be carried out during the same treatment session by pulling back along the needle and fiber axis by 0.5-1.0-1.5 cm to allow for treatment of tissue area not treated with previous application.
* Following completion of the laser ablation, the fibers will be removed followed by extraction of the needle(s). Hemostasis will be achieved at the site of needle insertion by applying pressure to the site.
* External bleeding will be assessed by visual inspection following extraction of the needle.
* Internal bleeding and potential nodule rupture will be assessed by ultrasound of the thyroid/neck with doppler flow assessment by the investigator following needle extraction using GE Logiq P6 ultrasound.The site will be covered with a sterile dressing/bandage.
