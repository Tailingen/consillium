Retrospective Study on the Evolution of CIN 1 to 3 in Per and Postpartum in Nancy From 2014 to 2022
In France, the screening rate for cervical cancer remains too low. Screening is simple and non-invasive.

Pregnant patients are most of the time young and are part of the target population for screening, and for many women, it is the first encounter with a gynecologist.

The cervical smear is therefore an important step of the first consultation during pregnancy In the case of pathological results, colposcopies with biopsies are performed, frequently finding CIN 1 to 3. (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) These CIN lesions evolve slowly and most of the time, treatment can be withheld until the end of the pregnancy.

Several studies suggest a higher regression rate in pregnant patients. Our study will evaluate the rate of regression, progression or persistence of these lesions in per and post partum patients in Nancy, between 2014 and 2022.

To obtain our results, we will compare the results of per and post partum biopsies in each patient.

In a second step, we will study the risk factors of aggravation or on the contrary the protective factors, allowing a faster regression of the lesions
