Mind-body Online Therapy in Gynecological Oncology
In this randomized-controlled two-arm monocentric study with three measurement time points, the effectiveness and feasibility of an internet-based, therapist-guided mind-body self-help intervention for gynecological cancer patients with primary diagnoses is examined. Different modules (e.g., relaxation, mindfulness, stress management, disease management, nutrition and exercise behaviors) with a mind-body focus are available for the patients. The goal of the intervention is to improve or maintain the quality of life.
