(Peak) A Phase 3 Randomized Trial of CGT9486+Sunitinib vs. Sunitinib in Subjects With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
This is a Phase 3, open-label, international, multicenter study of CGT9486 in combination with sunitinib. This is a multi-part study that will enroll approximately 442 patients. Part 1 consists of two evaluations: 1) confirming the dose of an updated formulation of CGT9486 to be used in subsequent parts in approximately 20 patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy for GIST and 2) evaluating the potential for drug-drug interactions between CGT9486 and sunitinib in approximately 18 patients who have received at least two prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for GISTs. The second part of the study will enroll approximately 388 patients who are intolerant to, or who failed prior treatment with imatinib only and will compare the efficacy of CGT9486 plus sunitinib to sunitinib alone with patients being randomized in a 1:1 manner. Additionally, a drug-drug interactions substudy will investigate the potential for CGT9486 to be a CYP3A4 inducer in approximately 16 patients who have received at least one prior line of therapy for GIST.

The scale comprises 30 questions, 24 of which are aggregated into 9 multi-item scales, to include 5 functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting) and 1 global health status scale. The remaining 6 single-item scales assess symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, diarrhea and the financial impact). All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher score for the functioning scales and global health status denote a better level of functioning, while higher scores on the symptom and single-item scales indicate a higher level of symptoms., Approximately 48 months
