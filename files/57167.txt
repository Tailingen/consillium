External Validation of Uromonitor as a Biomarker for Optimization of NMIBC Management by the CUETO Group
Independent validation of Uromonitor as a non-invasive biomarker of recurrence of Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer
Sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of Uromonitor, To evaluate the clinical sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of Uromonitor in the detection of bladder cancer recurrence in patients previously diagnosed (over the last 3 months to 2 years) of NMIBC, treated or not, 2 years after diagnosis
Statistics in CIS, treated or not, To evaluate the clinical sensitivity and specificity of Uromonitor in the detection of bladder cancer recurrence in patients previously diagnosed (over the last 3 months to 3 years) of NMIBC with carcinoma in situ (CIS) associated and treated with BCG, 2 years after diagnosis|Early diagnostics, To check if Uromonitor can provide some early diagnostics of NIMBC by following for two years a group of false positive patients of both previous groups (Uromonitor Positive / Cystoscopy Negative), 4 years after diagnosis
This study is intended as an independent validation series for previous studies performed in several European centers with less statistical power. We expect to validate the results from a previous study, reaching the sensitivity and specificity data obtained at generation and first external validation papers. The overall goal of this study is to perform a bigger external multicenter validation study to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of Uromonitor for the detection of bladder cancer recurrence in an independent series of patients.

The specific objectives of this study protocol are the following:

Main endpoint:

â€¢ To evaluate the clinical sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of Uromonitor in the detection of bladder cancer recurrence in patients previously diagnosed (over the last 3 months to 2 years) of NMIBC, treated or not, by testing a total of 600 patients (EVALUATION-CUETO Study)
