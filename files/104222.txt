A Study of Patupilone in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Varying Degrees of Hepatic Function
This phase I study will determine the pharmacokinetic profile of patupilone in patients with mild or moderately impaired hepatic function within 2 cycles of treatment. The study population for this trial consists of patients with a documented advanced solid tumor. Patients will be stratified into 3 groups: those with normal liver function, and those with mild or moderate liver dysfunction.

DRUG: Patupilone/EPO906
To assess the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of patupilone and its metabolite, After completion of the study (approximately 6 weeks from treatment)|To determine the maximum tolerated dose of patupilone in patients with hepatic impairment, After completion of the study (approximately 6 weeks from treatment)
To correlate the level of hepatic dysfunction to observed toxicity and pharmacokinetics, After completion of the study (approximately 6 weeks from treatment)|Safety and tolerability in patients with hepatic impairment will be assessed by adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and out of range lab values, After completion of the study (approximately 6 weeks from treatment)|To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity which will be assessed by radiological scans every 6 weeks, After completion of the study (approximately 6 weeks from treatment)
