A Study of Camizestrant in ER+/HER2- Early Breast Cancer After at Least 2 Years of Standard Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy
This is a Phase III open-label study to assess if camizestrant improves outcomes compared to standard endocrine therapy in patients with ER+/HER2 - early breast cancer with intermediate or high risk for disease recurrence who completed definitive locoregional therapy (with or without chemotherapy) and standard adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) for at least 2 years and up to 5 years. The planned duration of treatment in either arm of the study is 60 months.
Breast Cancer, Early Breast Cancer
DRUG: Camizestrant|DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Anastrozole|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Exemestane
Invasive breast cancer-free survival (IBCFS), IBCFS is defined as time from randomisation until date of first occurrence of:

* Invasive ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (invasive IBTR)
* Locoregional invasive breast cancer recurrence
* Distant recurrence
* Invasive contralateral breast cancer
* Death attributable to any cause., Up to 10 years
Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), IDFS is defined as time from randomisation until date of first occurrence of one of the following events:

* Invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (invasive IBTR)
* Locoregional invasive breast cancer recurrence
* Distant recurrence
* Invasive contralateral breast cancer
* Second primary non-breast invasive cancer
* Death attributable to any cause., Up to 10 years|Distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), DRFS is defined as time from randomisation until date of first distant recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 10 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from randomisation until death from any cause., Up to 10 years|Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events, with Severity Determined According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0), Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Absolute and percent change from baseline in Clinical Laboratory Parameters, Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Absolute and percent change from baseline in Vital Sign Parameters, Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Number of participants with abnormal physical examinations, Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Change from baseline of arthralgia as measured by the EORTC-IL-194 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) item 10. EORTC-IL-194 uses 0 - 4 scale (higher score is worse), Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Change from baseline of hot flush as measured by the EORTC-IL-194 item 4. EORTC-IL-194 uses 0 - 4 scale (higher score is worse), Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Change from baseline of vaginal dryness as measured by the EORTC-IL-194 item 15. EORTC-IL-194 uses 0 - 4 scale (higher score is worse), Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Proportion of patients experiencing each level of symptomatic AEs of arthralgia as measured by the EORTC-IL-194 item 10. EORTC-IL-194 uses 0 - 4 scale (higher score is worse), Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Proportion of patients experiencing each level of symptomatic AEs of hot flush as measured by the EORTC-IL-194 item 4. EORTC-IL-194 uses 0 - 4 scale (higher score is worse), Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Proportion of patients experiencing each level of symptomatic AEs of vaginal dryness as measured by the EORTC-IL-194 item 15. EORTC-IL-194 uses 0 - 4 scale (higher score is worse), Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Change from baseline and TTD (time to deterioration ) of health-related QoL (quality of life) as measured by the 2 global QoL items from the EORTC-QLQ-C30 items 11 and 12. EORTC-QLQ-C30 uses 0 - 4 scale (higher score is worse), Until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)|Pharmacokinetics (PK), â€¢ Plasma concentrations of camizestrant pre-dose (Ctrough)( trough concentration), Until 6 months from treatment start
This is a Phase III open-label study to assess if camizestrant improves outcomes compared to standard endocrine therapy in patients with ER+/HER2 - early breast cancer who completed definitive locoregional therapy (with or without chemotherapy) and standard adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) for at least 2 years and up to 5 years. The planned duration of treatment in either arm of the study is 60 months. The eligible patients must have intermediate or high risk of recurrence, as defined by specified clinical and biologic criteria. Prior use of CDK4/6 inhibitors is permitted. The primary endpoint of the study is Invasive breast cancer-free survival (IBCFS) and main secondary endpoints include Invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), Distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), Overall survival (OS), Safety and Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs).

Patients will be followed for 10 years from randomization of the last patient.
