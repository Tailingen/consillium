Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is a group of malignant tumors derived from placental trophoblastic cells, most of which are secondary to hydatidiform mole, and 95% of GTN patients present low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia(LR-GTN).In the 1960s and 1970s, with the in-depth study of the disease, it was found that the malignant tumor was highly sensitive to chemotherapy and had ideal tumor marker HCG to guide the treatment and follow-up. Therefore, GTN was the best malignant tumor with the overall cure rate of LR-GTN nearly 100%.MTX single-drug multi-course chemotherapy is the classic treatment of LR-GTN recommended by FIGO, but most patients can develop gastrointestinal, blood and liver toxicity during chemotherapy. In addition, the longer treatment cycle also brings a lot of discomfort to patients.

In recent years, some scholars proposed that the selection of treatment regimen of LR-GTN secondary to hydatidiform pregnancy should consider the toxic and side effects of chemotherapy, the maintenance of patients' physiological functions and quality of life.Retrospective studies abroad have shown that LR-GTN delayed chemotherapy for hydatidiform mole pregnancy only started chemotherapy for LR-GTN at a certain stage of progression, and the results did not change the prognosis of LR-GTN but reduced the rate of chemotherapy.In addition, for some patients with ultra-low risk of LR-GTN in hydatidiform pregnancy undergoing hysteroscopic repeat curettage , the rate of chemotherapy can be reduced, the related costs can be reduced and the quality of life of patients can be improved.

In this prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study, with the routine use of a gleam of MTX single drug treatment scheme for comparison, comparing uterine cavity again emptying delay chemotherapy guided by parallel hysteroscopy surgery clinical curative effect and adverse reaction, which discuss after hydatidiform mole ultra-low dangerous GTN patients with uterine cavity emptying again guided by hysteroscopy surgery as a line of ultra low dangerous GTN patients after hydatidiform mole security and feasibility of the treatmen
