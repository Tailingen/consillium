A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Entrectinib and Crizotinib in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic ROS1 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) With and Without Central Nervous System (CNS) Metastases
The study will compare the efficacy and safety of entrectinib with crizotinib in participants with advanced or metastatic ROS1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The participants will self-administer oral entrectinib or crizotinib as described in the protocol and local prescribing information. Treatments will continue until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal from the study, whichever occurs first.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Entrectinib|DRUG: Crizotinib
Progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with central nervous system (CNS) metastases at baseline, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression (extracranial or intracranial) or death from any cause whichever occurs first determined by a blinded independent review committee (BIRC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., Up to 7 years
Progression-free survival in the Central Nervous System (CNS-PFS), CNS-PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression in the CNS or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined by the BIRC using RECIST v1.1, Up to 7 Years|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who attain Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by the BIRC and the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Up to 7 Years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from when response (CR or PR) is first documented to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, as assessed by the BIRC and the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Up to 7 Years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression (extracranial or intracranial) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, as determined by the BICR and investigator using RECIST v1.1, Up to 7 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, Up to 7 Years|Percentage of participants with confirmed deterioration as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30), Up to 7 Years|Percentage of participants with impact on lung cancer-specific symptoms assessed by the EORTC QLQ-LC13, Up to 7 Years|Objective response rate in the CNS-ORR in participants with CNS metastases at baseline, CNS-ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who attain CR or PR for lesions in the CNS, as determined by the BIRC per RECIST v1.1, Up to 7 Years|Duration of response in the CNS (CNS-DOR) in participants with CNS metastases at baseline, CNS-DOR is defined as the time from when a CNS response (CR or PR) is first documented to disease progression in the CNS, as determined by the BIRC per RECIST v1.1, Up to 7 Years|Percentage of participants with Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events and Adverse Events leading to dose modifications/interruptions, study drug withdrawal or death, Assessed by the investigator according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0, Up to 7 Years
