Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This clinical trial studies the side effects of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and how well it works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To study safety and efficacy single agent Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (MylotargÂ®) as induction therapy for patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who have relapsed after standard treatments or who are not candidates for standard consolidation treatment after Daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To correlate morbidity and mortality with the use of gemtuzumab (gemtuzumab ozogamicin) to specific subtypes of leukemia.

II. To correlate gemtuzumab response to degree of cluster of differentiation (CD) 33 positivity.

III. To correlate FMS-Related Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT 3)/nucleophosmin (NPM) status and CD 33 positivity to gemtuzumab response.

IV. To document incidence of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome with the use of gemtuzumab.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Treatment continues for 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year.
