The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of implementing acupuncture intervention in federally qualified health centers oncology clinics for breast cancer survivors.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Acupuncture
Acceptability for Treating Multiple Symptoms with Acupuncture, Protocol Acceptability Scale is a 9-item instrument with scores ranging from 0 to 18 used to measure acceptability of the study processes and protocols. Items are measured on a 0 to 2 scale, where 0 means "did not like the study/did not like acupuncture/did not enjoy participating", and 2 means "liked the study/liked acupuncture/enjoyed participating". The protocol was deemed to have high acceptability if 80% of participants scored â‰¥ 80% of possible points on the acceptability scale. The investigators calculated the mean score for each of the 9 questions, divided the total score for the 9 questions by the maximum possible points for the measure, and converted the total mean scores to percentage of participants who liked the study/liked acupuncture/enjoyed participating., At week 6 after finishing the 10th acupuncture treatment|The numbers of study participants being recruited and retained (Feasibility), The numbers of study participants being recruited and retained during the study period will be documented as planned, : from the activation of the study to the completion of the recruitment, week 12|Identify barriers and facilitators associated with implementing acupuncture in federally qualified health center oncology clinics., Specific questions will be asked during a face-to-face interview to identify factors favoring or barriers to implementing acupuncture into federally qualified health center oncology clinics among breast cancer survivors and providers., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
