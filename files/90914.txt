Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome Combined With Capecitabine in Patients With HER-2 Negative Advanced Breast Cancer
To evaluate the dose-limiting toxicity of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome combined with capecitabine in patients with HER-2 negative advanced breast cancer who have received at least first-line treatment, explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome, and determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome|DRUG: Capecitabine
MTD of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome, To evaluate the tolerability of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome combination regime, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days or 28 days)
Safety: Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities (NCI CTCAE v5.0), To identify the incidence of AE and SAE in clinical trial, From the initiation of the first dose to 21 or 28 days after the last dose|Objective response rate (ORR), To evaluate the efficacy of anti-tumor, 21 or 28 days after the last dose|Disease control rate (DCR), To evaluate the efficacy of anti-tumor, 21 or 28 days after the last dose|Progression-free survival (PFS), To evaluate the efficacy of anti-tumor, one year after the last dose
This is a single-center, open-label, phase I dose-increasing study following the "3+3" principle, which planned to enroll a maximum of 48 clinically confirmed patients with advanced HER-2 negative breast cancer who have received at least first-line treatment, to explore the MTD of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome.
