Dose-escalation, Dose-expansion Study of Safety of Azer-cel (PBCAR0191) in Patients With r/r NHL and r/r B-cell ALL
This is a Phase 1/1b, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of azer-cel, an allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR T, in adults with r/r B ALL and r/r B-cell NHL.

This is a multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, parallel assignment, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, find an appropriate dose to optimize safety and efficacy, and evaluate clinical activity of azer-cel in participants with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Before initiating azer-cel, participants will be administered lymphodepletion (LD). At Day 0 of the Treatment Period, participants will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of azer-cel. All participants will be monitored through D720 or progression. All participants who receive a dose of azer-cel will be followed in a separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) study for up to 15 years after exiting this study.
