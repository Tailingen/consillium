FACBC PET and PEM as a Staging Tool and Indicator of Therapeutic Response in Breast Cancer Patients
This study has been designed to help us determine if FACBC PET or PEM can accurately evaluate how far the breast cancer has spread in the breast. Also, to help determine if FACBC PET or PEM can accurately measure your response to chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography (PET)|DRUG: Fluorine-18 labeled 1-amino-3-fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (FACBC)|PROCEDURE: Positron emission mammography (PEM) When available|PROCEDURE: MR
assess the diagnostic accuracy, Accuracy of standardized uptake values will be analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC curves will be constructed separately for FACBC PET, FACBC PEM and MR. The area under the curve will be used as a summary measure and compared using the standard nonparametric test \[20\]. We will also consider dichotomizing the uptake and present accuracy using sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Dichotomized values will be compared using the McNemar test., 2 years|ability of FACBC PET and PEM to determine therapeutic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Patients with locally advanced IDC or ILC, requiring neoadjuvant therapy prior to definitive surgery, will undergo FACBC PET and PEM both before chemotherapy and after. Following definitive breast surgery, pathologic specimens will be analyzed to determine if FACBC imaging can predict pathologic treatment response., 2 years
