The Efficacy and Safety of HAIC With FOLFOX vs Sorafenib for Patients Who Showed TACE-resistant: a Retrospective Study
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered the gold standard for treating intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, any treatment guidelines do not specify the criteria for repeating TACE. This study was to compare HAIC with FOLFOX with sorafenib who showed TACE-resistant.
