Evaluation of a New EUS Guided Biopsy Needle (SharkCore) Comparing to Standard EUS Needle (ProCore)
Diagnosis of lesions of pancreas, the upper gastrointestinal tract, as well as adjacent structures, such as lymph nodes, is still showing advancements especially with the increased use of endoscopic ultrasound. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNA/FNB) have become mainstay diagnostic techniques for these lesions. The purpose of the study is to compare between the currently used, ProCore needles and the new biopsy needle, SharkCore, for the histological diagnosis and evaluation of lesions.

Diagnostic accuracy of needle as assessed by diagnostic yield of needle and final diagnosis method, The final diagnosis of tissue from needle will be compared to the final diagnosis reached either by surgical removal of mass or other method of biopsy, Up to 1 month
Number of passes to procure core tissue from needle, The number of passes needed to acquire core tissue as assessed by the pathologist in the room., During procedure|Safety of tissue procurement by needle, All complications related to needle used will be recorded with a preset questionnaire to measure the frequency of complications related to needle used., Up to 1 year|Procedure time, Time required to acquire tissue using each needle will be recorded from time of needle insertion to time of core tissue procurement as per pathologist., During procedure
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNA/FNB) have become mainstay diagnostic techniques for the diagnosis and evaluation of lesions of the pancreas, the upper gastrointestinal tract, as well as adjacent structures, including lymph nodes. Cytology specimens provided from FNA cannot fully characterize certain neoplasms such as lymphomas or mesenchymal tumors. Core biopsy specimens for histological examinations are needed to provide accurate diagnoses.

ProCore needles (ProCore, Wilson-Cook Medical Inc. Winston-Salem, NC) were designed to obtain histological and cytological samples. Studies comparing ProCore needles with standard FNA needles showed no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy, histological core tissue procurement or mean number of passes.

To overcome the above mentioned limitations (mainly suboptimal core tissue procurement rates), a new novel SharkCore needle (Beacon Endoscopic, Newton, MA, USA) has been designed and approved for clinical human use by the FDA.

The objective of the study is to compare the new EUS guided histology biopsy needle SharkCore to the currently used EUS histology needle, ProCore, for the histological diagnosis and evaluation of lesions.
