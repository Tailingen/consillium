Befotertinib and Icotinib in Treatment-naive Patients With Advanced EGFR-Mutant Lung Cancer
This research study is studying a combination of two drugs as a possible treatment for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with an EGFR mutation.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Icotinib|DRUG: Befotertinib
Objective Response Rate （ORR）, ORR, per RECIST 1.1 calculated as the proportion of patients with a best overall response defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 24 months
Duration of response（DOR）, DOR, defined as the time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) until the date of documented progression or death in the absence of disease progression., 24 months|Disease control rate（DCR）, DCR, defined as proportion of complete response, partial response, and disease stabilization to the proportion of patients with evalueable tumors., 24 months|Progression-free survival（PFS）, PFS, defined as time from study drug administration to progression or death due to any cause., 36 months|Intracranial objective response rate（iORR）, iORR, defined as the proportion of subjects with complete intracranial response, partial intracranial response to subjects with brain metastasis target lesions at baseline., 24 months|Overall survival （OS）, OS, defined as the time from study drug administration until the date of death due to any cause., 36 months|Adverse event（AE）, AE,defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study medication, whether or not considered related to the study drugs. AEs are summarized by type, incidence, severity and relationship to study drugs., 36 months
AUC, AUC, defined as area under the plasma concentration-time curve., 4 months|Tmax, Tmax, defined as time of maximum concentration., 4 months|Cmax, Cmax,defined as maximum concentration., 4 months|Health Relevent Quality of Life（HRQoL）, Change from baseline scores on the functional assessment of cancer therapy- Lung (FACT-L) quality of life questionnaire., 36 months
This is a phase II, single-arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of befotertinib (25mg three times daily, orally）combining with icotinib (125mg three times daily, orally) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC that is known to be EGFR sensitising mutation (EGFRm) positive, treatment-naive and eligible for first-line treatment with an EGFR-TKI.
