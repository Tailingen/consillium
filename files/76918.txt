This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with four sites that assesses the efficacy of a decisional intervention \[University of Rochester-Geriatric Oncology assessment for Acute myeloid Leukemia (UR-GOAL)\] compared to an attention control. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either the intervention arm or the attention control arm. Compared to an attention control, UR-GOAL will improve patient distress, observed and patient-perceived shared decision making (SDM), and patient decisional conflict.
