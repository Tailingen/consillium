⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C PET/CT in Patients With Selected Solid Malignancies or Hodgkin's Lymphoma
To determine the safety and feasibility of 89Zr-Df-IAB22M2C as an immunoPET tracer; determine the best time window and protein dose for imaging; determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) and biodistribution of the probe; and to determine imaging parameters for optimal lymphoid and tumor visualization.

DRUG: ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C Infusion
Safety and tolerability of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C assessed by local and systemic signs and symptoms of infusion reactions,incidence of adverse events,changes in laboratory test results,dose limiting toxicities,vital signs and 12-lead electrocardiogram findings, From infusion of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C up to 12 weeks
Evaluate imaging time window with ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, From infusion of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C through up to Day 6|Evaluate protein dose for imaging with ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, From infusion of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C through up to Day 6|Evaluate the radioactive pharmacokinetics of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C by determining the time-activity curves for serum (% injected dose/liter), AUC, clearance, volume of distribution, Tmax and Cmax., The data from the actual concentration and the parameters will be summarized descriptively and also presented as subject specific listings., From infusion of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C through up to Day 6|Evaluate the dosimetry of a single dose of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C, Dosimetry will be determined from the ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C PET/CT scans obtained during the course of this study at 1-2 hours, 6-8 hours (optional), 24 (± 4 hours), 48 (± 4 hours) hours and 92-144 hours post infusion in patients at the optimal dosing cohort. Regions of interest will be drawn at each PET/CT time point to capture target and major organ uptakes. Once all five PET/CT scans are analyzed, the biologic clearance will be evaluated from the "dynamic" sequence of the scans and the final estimated radiation dose calculated using the clearance seen in the images. The data for dosimetry also comes from Imaging Endpoints. Patterns of radiotracer uptake and estimates of semi-quantitative measurements, using typical SUV (Standardized uptake value) estimates (SUV max; SUV peak; SUV mean) will be presented. The data will be summarized descriptively and will also be presented as subject specific listings., From infusion of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C through up to Day 6
This is a phase I study of positron emission tomography (PET/CT) with ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C in patients with selected solid malignancies (NSCLC, SCLC, SqCCHN, melanoma, merkel cell tumor, renal, bladder, hepatocellular, triple negative breast, or gastroesophageal cancer) or Hodgkin's lymphoma. Up to 24 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this clinical study.

This phase 1 study is a dose escalation study of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C to evaluate safety, tolerability, optimal time window and protein dose for imaging, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, as well as the ability of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C to detect CD8+ expressing T cells. The investigational imaging agent to be administered in this study will be 3.0 (±20%) mCi dose of ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C injected intravenously. Up to six cohorts of up to 6 patients each will be studied sequentially with dose escalation at 0.2 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 5.0 mg, and 10.0 mg total protein doses followed by an optimal dose expansion cohort. Safety as well as lymphoid visualization (LV) on imaging (i.e. signal in tumor and lymphoid organs including spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow) will be evaluated to drive dose escalation/de-escalation.

At least 2 weeks will separate the ⁸⁹Zr-Df-IAB22M2C administration in the first patient and subsequent patients of each dose cohort to provide an opportunity to detect any acute reaction to the study drug and any adverse events. Tracer administration for subsequent patients in each cohort will be separated by a minimum of 24 hours

Each patient will undergo five (5) post infusion PET/CT scans ( 1 - 2 hours, 6-8 hrs (optional), 24 ± 4 hours, 48 ± 4 hours and 92 - 144 hours).

Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be drawn at the following timepoints: pre-infusion; then post-infusion at 5-10 min, 30 (+/-10) min, 60 (+/- 10) min, 120 (+/- 10) min, 240 (+/- 10) min, 350-490 (+/- 10) min (optional), 24 hrs (visit 3), 48 hrs (visit 4), 92-144 hrs (visit 5). The imaging data collected across the dosing cohort and time series of PET/CT scans will assess biodistribution, dosimetry, and be used to recommend a protein dose and an optimal time window for imaging in future studies
