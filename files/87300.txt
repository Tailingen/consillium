Three Schedules of CUE-101 Administered Before Surgery or Definitive Chemoradiation Therapy in HLA-A*0201 Positive Patients With Locally Advanced, HPV16-Positive Oropharyngeal Squamous-Cell Carcinoma
This is a phase 2 trial to assess the safety and tolerability of three schedules of CUE-101 administered in the neoadjuvant phase before standard of care (SOC) therapy to treatment naïve, HLA-A\*0201 positive patients with newly diagnosed, locally advanced HPV16+ oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma (OPSCC). This is an exploratory trial of a limited sample size to confirm safety and to assess for pharmacodynamic signals of efficacy in each of three schedules of CUE-101. Safety assessments will be performed at baseline and after CUE-101 administration. To assess for efficacy, peripheral blood and tumor samples will be collected at baseline and after CUE-101 administration. Following CUE-101, patients will proceed with SOC therapy, as prescribed by the treating physician.

Pathological tumor response, * Defined as rates of major and complete pathological response
* A major pathologic response (mPR) will be defined as ≤ 10% residual viable tumor within the tumor sample collected after administration of CUE-101. A complete pathologic response (cPR) will be defined as no invasive cancer in the tumor sample collected. For surgical patients, the tumor sample will include the primary tumor specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes at the time of resection. For def-chemoradiation therapy patients, the tumor sample will comprise the biopsy(s) submitted. Pathologic tumor response will be stratified based on if the patients underwent surgery or post-CUE-101 biopsy only., At the time of surgery or biopsy (Day 1 - approximately 7-14 days after start of CUE-101 treatment)|Objective response rate (ORR), * Proportion of patients with a complete response + partial response
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Prior to surgery/definitive chemoradiation treatment (Day 1 - approximately 7-14 after start of CUE-101 treatment)|Change in area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of serum PK parameters, -Prior to each CUE-101 infusion, end of each CUE-101 infusion, 1 hour post-end of each CUE-101 infusion, 5 hours post-end of each CUE-101 infusion, 24 hours post-end of each CUE-101 infusion, surgery day 1 or definitive chemoradiation day -2 or -1, 2 month follow-up, 4 month follow-up, 8 month follow-up and 12 month follow-up., Through 12 month follow-up|Change in Cmax of serum PK parameters, -Prior to each CUE-101 infusion, end of each CUE-101 infusion, 1 hour post-end of each CUE-101 infusion, 5 hours post-end of each CUE-101 infusion, 24 hours post-end of each CUE-101 infusion, surgery day 1 or definitive chemoradiation day -2 or -1, 2 month follow-up, 4 month follow-up, 8 month follow-up and 12 month follow-up., Through 12 month follow-up|Change in Terminal elimination half-life(t1/2) of serum PK parameters, -Prior to each CUE-101 infusion, end of each CUE-101 infusion, 1 hour post-end of each CUE-101 infusion, 5 hours post-end of each CUE-101 infusion, 24 hours post-end of each CUE-101 infusion, surgery day 1 or definitive chemoradiation day -2 or -1, 2 month follow-up, 4 month follow-up, 8 month follow-up and 12 month follow-up., Through 12 month follow-up|Number of participants who relapse, Through 12 month follow-up|Number of participants who die summarized by cause of death, Through 12 month follow-up|Progression-free survival (PFS), Through 12 month follow-up|Overall survival (OS), Through 12 month follow-up
