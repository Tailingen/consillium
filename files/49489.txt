Evaluation of Home Program and Telerehabilitation for the Treatment Process in Patients With Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema
During the Covid-19 pandemic, rehabilitation services for all patients were affected, and a term that was previously in use but gained popularity during the pandemic entered our vocabulary: 'Telerehabilitation'. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the treatment process and adherence of patients undergoing telerehabilitation.

Our study is a randomized single-blind prospective study. Patients aged 18 to 75 years with stage 1-2 lymphedema associated with breast cancer and upper extremity lymphedema, who had undergone breast surgery at least 3 months prior, were included in the study. Group 1: Patients were given a brochure explaining the massage and exercises they should perform. They were periodically contacted by a physiotherapist and clinician to remind them of their tasks. Group 2: Patients underwent telerehabilitation exercises and massages three times a week guided by a physiotherapist and clinician, and on the remaining days, they continued their self-administered tasks. Patients were evaluated three times: before treatment, at weeks 5 and 8 after treatment. During each visit, patients' inter-limb volume difference, Quick DASH and Life Impact Scale scores, pain, tension, stiffness, and heaviness sensations were assessed.
