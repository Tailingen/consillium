X-396 Capsule in Patients With ALK-positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Previously Treated With Crizotinib
The main purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of X-396(Ensartinib) capsule in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with crizotinib.While exploring the relationship between biomarkers and drug efficacy and safety.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: X-396 capsule
Objective response rate (ORR) based on independent radiology review, ORR per RECIST 1.1 calculated as the proportion of patients with a best overall response defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 24 months
ORR based on investigator assessment, ORR per RECIST 1.1 calculated as the proportion of patients with a best overall response defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by independent radiology review and investigator, PFS, defined as time from first dose of X-396 to progression or death due to any cause., 36 months|Overall survival (OS), OS, defined as time from first dose of X-396 to death due to any cause., 36 months
Overall intracranial response rate (OIRR) by independent radiology review and investigator assessment, OIRR calculated as the ORR (CR+PR) of lesions in the brain for patients who have measureable disease in the brain at baseline., 24 months|Patient reported time to deterioration (TTD) as measured by EORTC C30/LC13 QoL questionnaire, Time to deterioration (TTD) is defined at the time from date of randomization to a worsening of at least 10 points (on a 100 point scale) in each item score of the EORTC C30/LC13, 24 months
This is a phase II, multicenter, single-arm study in which the safety and efficacy of X-396(Ensartinib) will be assessed in adult Chinese patients with ALK-positive(rearrangement) non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with crizotinib. Approximately 144 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC which carry ALK -rearrangement will be enrolled in the study.
