BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN as Pre-ASCT Induction Therapy in R/R HL Patients Non Responding to IGEV
A pilot phase II study with brentuximab vedotin as pre-ASCT induction therapy in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma patients non-responding to IGEV salvage treatment.
Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN
Complete response (CR rate), Complete response will be defined according to recently updated international criteria (Cheson 2007), assuming that a negative PET is defined by DEAUVILLE scores 1 and 2., 1 year and half from the beginning of the study
PFS, Additional study endpoint is final response to Brentuximab vedotin followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), in terms of progression free survival (PFS)., 2 years and half from the beginning of the study|Neurotoxicity rate, Neurotoxicity of any grade defined as National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , version 4.03 (NCI CTCEA, 2010), 1 year half from the beginning of the study|Duration of remission (DR), Additional study endpoint is final response to Brentuximab vedotin followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), in terms of duration of remission (DR)., 2 years and half from the beginning of the study
Brentuximab vedotin emerged as active single-agent in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL.

Some patients don't reach a complete response after salvage treatment with IGEV (ifosfamide, gemcitabine, vinorelbine) and remain PET positive so the idea is to treat this subset of patients with brentuximab vedotin with the aim of achieving a complete remission before transplant.
