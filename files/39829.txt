FLT-PET/DW-MRI for Detection of Brain Metastases and Early Therapy Evaluation in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of the study is to determine the value of FLT-PET early after initiated chemotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer, and to determine whether MRI of the brain should be performed routinely in these patients.
