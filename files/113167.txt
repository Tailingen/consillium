Study to objectify the level of physical activity of patients by a tool, often used in the global population: the pedometer. Several measurements per questionnaire also will be carried out repeatedly (weekly) in order to correlate this level of objective physical activity with the levels of fatigue and quality of life. The hypothesis we formulate is as follows: the number of weekly steps is negatively correlated with the level of fatigue, positively with the quality of life and well-being.
