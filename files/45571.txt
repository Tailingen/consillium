A Study to Investigate the Antitumor Activity, Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of BGB-A445 in Combination With Tislelizumab in Participants With Select Advanced Solid Tumors.
The objective of this study is to assess the overall response rate, evaluate the antitumor activity, and characterize the safety and tolerability of BGB-A445 alone or in combination with tislelizumab in participants With Advanced or Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma (UC), Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC), or Melanoma
Urothelial Carcinoma|Renal Cell Carcinoma|Melanoma|Non-mucosal Melanoma
DRUG: BGB-A445|DRUG: Tislelizumab
Overall Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by the Investigator, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed complete response Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), Up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug(s) or before the initiation of a new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first
Disease-Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease as determined from tumor assessments by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug(s) or before the initiation of a new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease lasting for at least 24 weeks as determined from tumor assessments by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug(s) or before the initiation of a new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first|Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with AEs characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by the National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 \[NCI-CTCAE v 5.0\]), timing, seriousness, and relationship to study drug(s); physical examinations; electrocardiograms (ECGs); and laboratory assessments as needed, Up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug(s) regardless of whether the participant starts a subsequent anticancer therapy|Number of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with SAEs characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by the National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 \[NCI-CTCAE v 5.0\]), timing, seriousness, and relationship to study drug(s); physical examinations; electrocardiograms (ECGs); and laboratory assessments as needed, Up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug(s) regardless of whether the participant starts a subsequent anticancer therapy
