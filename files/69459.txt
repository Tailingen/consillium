Study of ADI-PEG 20 Versus Placebo in Subjects with High Arginine Level and Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Evaluate efficacy and safety of ADI-PEG 20 in patients with high-argininephenotypic and HCC
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: ADI-PEG20|OTHER: Placebo
Overall Survival (OS), Time from study enrollment to death, Approximately 18 months
Progression free survival, Time from study enrollment to progressive disease or death, Approximately 18 months
Safety will be evaluated by laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, physical examinations and subject medical history which will be performed to detect new abnormalities and any deterioration in pre-existing conditions.

Efficacy will be determined by overall survival, progression free survival, pharmacodynamics (peripheral blood arginine and citrulline levels) and immunogenicity (antibodies to ADI-PEG 20).
