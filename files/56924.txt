A Study of AL2846 on Tolerance and Pharmacokinetics
A study of AL2846,a C-met/Hepatocyte growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor,in patients with advanced cancer.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: AL2846
The type of dose-limiting toxicity(ies) (DLT[s]) of AL2846, Subjects within 28 days after treatment appear the following toxicity reaction relate to the drug ：II °or above of kidney damage，III °or above of non-hematological toxicity,IV°hematological toxicity ,Neutropenia associated with fever., For 4 weeks for DLTs|Pharmacokinetics of AL2846 (in plasma), In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at H0/H0.5/H1/H2/H4/H8/H11/H24/H34/H48/H58/H72/H96/H120/H168 (H means Hour). In the study of multiple-dose, full PK profiles will be obtained at D0/D1/D4/D7/D10/D13/D15/D18/D21/D24/D28 (D means Day)., up to 28 Days (endpoint when the two consecutive time points of blood drug concentration <150 DPM/mL)|The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AL2846, The highest dose at which no more than 33% of the subjects experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during treatment, 48 weeks
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of participants with OR based assessment of confirmed complete remission (CR) or confirmed partial remission (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)., each 56 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)
To study the pharmacokinetic characteristics of AL2846 in the human body; To recommend a reasonable dose and indication for subsequent research.
