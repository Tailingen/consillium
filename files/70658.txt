Pilot Study to Assess Telemonitoring of Gleevec (Imatinib Mesylate) or Tasigna (Niltinib) Therapy
This study is being conducted in a population of patients with chronic phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) to learn more about how patients follow prescribed regimens for taking oral cancer drugs.
Chronic Phase CML
BEHAVIORAL: no access to eMedonline|BEHAVIORAL: eMedonline access
eMedonline will be used to measure non-compliance in taking oral drug regimens., Patients are stratified to one of two groups: Group 1 is pateints on Gleevec or Tasigna who have been on drug less than 6 months; Group 2 is patients on Gleevec or Tasigna who have been on drug for equal to or more than 6 months.

Group 1 is then divided into 2 groups: one using eMedonline for 3 months and the other not using eMedonline for 3 months. A crossover survey and pill counts will be done at the 3 month timepoint and then the groups will switch their access status to eMedonline., at 6 months, non-compliance will be measured in each arm of study
This is a randomized, controlled pilot study to introduce eMedonline telemonitoring technology to CML patients taking Gleevec or Tasigna. eMedonline will be used to automatically collect time-dose specific medication data for individual patients, including dosing times, missed doses, adverse events and e-diary data. All data will be available to research staff for remote review via Web interface. Adverse events and non-adherence will prompt interventions including supportive care counseling.
