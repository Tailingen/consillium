Biomarker-based Algorithm for Diagnosis of Glioma
ATRX (X-linked mental retardation and alpha-thalassaemia syndrome protein) loss and pTERT (Telomerase reverse transcriptase) mutation are diagnostic markers of gliomas. However, 4 to 28% of gliomas shows none of these alterations. The aim of this project is to propose a new test able to detect the telomeric status for every glioma. Based on this test and other markers (such as mutation of IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) and IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2)), investigators propose an algorithm, able to classify the main subtypes of gliomas (astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma).
Glioma
OTHER: PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
Determination of the prognosis and diagnosis values of a new qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) -based biological testing in glioma, An algorithm will be built, based on the result of this specific biological testing combined with other markers (determined in routine clinical testing). The algorithm parameters will be set using samples with a clear diagnosis (concordant molecular and immuno-histological markers). Then gliomas with uncertain diagnosis will be classified and the global overall survival will be predicted.

Biological testing will be performed during one year and the analyses in terms of disease outcome will be refreshed every year., 1 year
