Patient-Reported Outcomes in PHiladelphia-nEgative Cytogenetic mYeloproliferative Neoplasms (PROPHECY).
This study will ultimately aim at developing a GIMEMA platform for collecting HRQoL and symptom burden information on Italian patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative MPN. The main objective of the protocol is to improve our understanding of the impact of the disease and various treatments on patients-wellbeing, symptom burden and daily functioning.

OTHER: Questionnaire
Compare HRQoL profiles of Philadelphia chromosome negative MPN patients with those of their peers in the general population, To detect a baseline difference of at least 4 points between MPN patients and their peers in the general population in any of the following primary scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire: fatigue, global QoL/health status, physical, emotional and role functioning (all ranging from 0 to 100 points)., After 5 years from study entry
