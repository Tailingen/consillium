Phase 2a Study to Evaluate Suppression of Radiotherapy-induced Mucositis by TK112690
Patients expected to receive a continuous course of radiation as single daily fractions of 2.0 Gy treatment with a cumulative radiation dose of 70 Gy. The radiation can be 2DRT, 3DRT,IMRT etc. Prior to each radiation treatment the patients will receive a one-hour infusion of TK-90 or equivalent TK-90 placebo depending on randomization. 6 Hours after the completion of TK-90 infusion or TK-90 placebo dose, the patients will receive another identical TK-90 or TK-90 placebo treatment depending on randomization. This treatment cycle will continue for 7 weeks. The TK112690 dose will be 45 mg/kg.
Mucositis
DRUG: TK-112690|DRUG: Placebo
Mucositis, * SOM (Severe Oral Mucositis) - Comparison of incidences of Grade 3 or 4 mucositis (WHO scale) in the treatment and placebo groups.
* Duration of SOM (Severe Oral Mucositis). Days patients suffer Grades 3 and 4 oral mucositis measured by WHO scale from the start of treatment.
* Calculate Number of days from the first occurrence of WHO Grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis through the first occurrence of non-severe (≤ Grade 2) without a subsequent instance of ≥ Grade 3 oral mucositis.
* Subjects with complete study follow-up for SOM who do not develop severe oral mucositis (grade 0-2) will be considered to have duration of 0 days., 7 weeks
Secondary efficacy/outcome mucositis, * Mucositis status in the patients will also be evaluated using two different published and validated mucositis scales: NCI/CTCAE/mucositis, and PROMS.
* Comparison of WHO scale values of treated patients at each point of evaluation.

NCI/CTCAE=National Cancer Institute/Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and WHO=World Health Organization PROMS=Patient Reported oral Mucositis Symptom Scale

As per WHO:Grade 0 to Grade 5 \& NCI CTCAE: Grade 1 to Grade 5, 7 weeks|Incidence Adverse Events That Are Related to Treatment, Tolerance, 7 Weeks
Patients expected to receive a continuous course of radiation as single daily fractions of 2.0 Gy treatment with a cumulative radiation dose of 70 Gy. The radiation can be 2DRT, 3DRT,IMRT etc. Prior to each radiation treatment the patients will receive a one-hour infusion of TK-90 or equivalent TK-90 placebo depending on randomization. 6 Hours after the completion of TK-90 infusion or TK-90 placebo dose, the patients will receive another identical TK-90 or TK-90 placebo treatment depending on randomization. This treatment cycle will continue for 7 weeks. The TK112690 dose will be 45 mg/kg.

* 24 patients will be randomized equally into 2 different groups: TK-90 treated or TK-90 placebo treated.
* Screening must be completed within 2 weeks.
* The treatment period for the study is 7 weeks.
* Study follow-up will be scheduled post two weeks of completion of last dose of radiation or early termination through up to 4 weeks.
* Blinding: The study will be partially blinded. The patient and investigator as well as site personnel will be blinded as to whether TK-90 or TK-90 placebo is administered. The CRO, sponsor, and site pharmacist will know whether the patient was administered active drug or TK-90 placebo.
