Elastofibroma Dorsi: Analysis of Risk Factors and Surgical Outcomes in a Single-Center Retrospective Study
This study aims to retrospectively evaluate patients who underwent surgical treatment for elastofibroma dorsi, a rare benign tumor typically located in the subscapular region of the chest wall. The study will analyze demographic and clinical features, risk factors, diagnostic imaging methods, postoperative complications, and recurrence rates. By identifying potential predictors of complications and recurrence, the study hopes to contribute to the understanding and management of this silent and often incidental lesion.
