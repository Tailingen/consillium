Transverse Coloplasty vs. Side-to-end Anastomosis Following Low Anterior Resection (LAR): CSAR Trial
CSAR Trial's aim is to determine whether the transverse coloplasty pouch or the side-to-end anastomosis as rectal reservoir reconstruction offers the best functional results.

Stool frequency, Between group differences in stool frequency at t = 6 months postoperative, time = 6 months postoperative
Postoperative complications, * Septic intraabdominal complications related to anastomosis (anastomotic insufficiencies, suture insufficiencies, abscesses);
* Wound infection, through study completion (an average of 12 months postoperative)|Quality of Life, Quality of Life with focus on colorectally specialized questionnaires, baseline, postoperative (2-3 months, 6 months, 12 months)|Antimotility drug usage, Usage of antimotility drugs (e.g. loperamide) evaluated by standardized questionnaires, baseline, postoperative (2-3 months, 6 months, 12 months)
This study directly compares two neorectal reservoir-techniques, the transverse coloplasty and the side-to-end anastomosis, in low anterior resection in distal rectal cancer for the first time. Its focus is on the functional results. Besides stool frequency, the quality of life, safety of the procedures and the usage of stool modulating drugs is monitored in an 12 months-follow up regime.
