First Line Study of Irinotecan, Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in Metastatic Gastric or Gastroesophageal Cancer.
The investigators hypothesize IXO chemotherapy will have an improvement in response rate and acceptable toxicity for uncurable metastatic gastric cancer compared to historical controls.
Gastrointestinal Neoplasm|Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Irinotecan-Capecitabine-Oxaliplatin
Overall Response Rate and dose limiting toxicity, 2 years
Progression Free Survival, overall survival, death, alterations in quality of life outcomes, 2 years
This is a single arm, open-label, multicentre, phase II trial in which patients with metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma will be treated with the combination of irinotecan, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin (IXO).Patients will receive the combination of irinotecan, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin at the recommended phase II dose and sequence determined by the completed phase I trial. Patients will be treated on study until disease progression, overwhelming toxicity, or consent withdrawal.
