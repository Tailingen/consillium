A Study to Find the Best Dose of BI 836880 Alone and in Combination With BI 754091 in Japanese Patients With Different Types of Advanced Cancer
The primary objective of this trial is:

Part I

* To determine Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BI 836880 monotherapy Part II
* To determine MTD and/or RP2D of the combination therapy of BI 836880 and BI 754091

The secondary objectives are:

Part I

* To document the safety and tolerability, and characterise pharmacokinetics (PK) of BI 836880 as monotherapy Part II
* To document the safety and tolerability, and characterise PK of the combination therapy of BI 836880 and BI 754091
