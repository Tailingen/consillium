Effects of a Strength Physical Exercise Program in Colorectal Cancer Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy Treatment
Chemotherapy is a crucial treatment in the fight against colon cancer, but unfortunately, its impact is not limited to cancer cells alone. Chemotherapy drugs, designed to attack fast-growing cells, also affect healthy tissues, leading to various side effects. One of the most common adverse effects is peripheral neuropathy, a condition that affects the peripheral nerves and can manifest as tingling sensations, numbness, pain or weakness in the extremities.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can be especially challenging for colon cancer patients, as it further aggravates quality of life during an already difficult period. Nerves responsible for motor and sensory function are compromised, affecting the patient's ability to perform daily activities and weakening their physical endurance. This phenomenon adds to the emotional and physical burden of fighting cancer.

However, there are tools that can positively influence these adverse effects, such as physical exercise. Although it may seem contradictory, regular physical exercise has been shown to have beneficial effects on peripheral neuropathy. Physical exercise can improve blood circulation and promote regeneration of damaged peripheral nerves. In addition, exercise helps to alleviate the pain and discomfort associated with neuropathy, thereby strengthening patients' functional capacity.

It is essential to emphasize that any exercise plan must be tailored to the individual capabilities of each patient, and medical supervision is essential. Therefore, the combination of chemotherapy and carefully planned physical exercise offers a comprehensive strategy to address both the disease and its side effects, providing colon cancer patients with a better quality of life during their journey to recovery.

Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, The EORTC CIPN20 questionnaire will be used.This questionnaire contains 20 items on which patients rate their experience for each symptom during the previous week using scores from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The sum score was obtained by adding the scores of items 1 to 19 resulting in a sum score range of 19 to 76, which was termed CIPN20 sum1-19. Item 20 rates male impotence, Baseline and immediately after the intervention
Wellbeing, It will be evaluated through the the EORTC QLG Core Questionnaire (EORTC QOL-30) quality of life questionnaire in its specific version for colorectal cancer EORT QLQ-CR30. Scores can range from 0 (worst quality of life) to 100 (best quality of life), with higher values indicating better quality of life in the areas evaluated., Baseline and immediately after the intervention|Body Mass Index, Obtained from the participant's weight and height., Baseline and immediately after the intervention|Oxygen consumption, It will be evaluated through the 6-minute walk test., Before and after the intervention|Anxiety and depression, They will be evaluated through the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Scores on the HADS can be interpreted as follows:

Anxiety:

0-7: Absence of clinically significant anxiety. 8-10: Possible presence of clinically significant anxiety. 11 or more: Clinically significant anxiety.

Depression:

0-7: Absence of clinically significant depression. 8-10: Possible presence of clinically significant depression. 11 or more: Clinically significant depression., Baseline and immediately after the intervention|Fatigue, The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-F) Questionnaire will be used. FACT-F scores are calculated by summing the scores of the different domains, where higher scores indicate better quality of life. The total score may vary depending on the scale used in the specific questionnaire, but generally ranges from 0 to 176 points., Baseline and immediately after the intervention|Sleep quality, Will be evaluated through the Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale (MISS). Each question is scored on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 indicates that the symptom is not present and 4 indicates a very severe presence of the symptom. Therefore, the total score on the MISS can range from 0 to 12 points.

Interpretations of the MISS scores may be as follows:

0-3 points: Absence or minimal presence of insomnia symptoms. 4-6 points: Mild insomnia symptoms. 7-9 points: Moderate insomnia symptoms. 10-12 points: Severe insomnia symptoms., Baseline and immediately after the intervention|Sex, It will be registered at the beginning of the study., Baseline|Heighth, It will be registered at the beginning of the study in centimeters., Baseline
