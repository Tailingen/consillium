Preoperative Radiotherapy And ASTX660 in Rectum Cancer
Compare two arms:

* Chemotherapy followed by tolinapant (ASTX660) in combination with Long-Course Radio Chemotherapy (LCRT), and
* Tolinapant (ASTX660) in combination with Short-Course Radiotherapy (SCRT) followed by chemotherapy For each patient, the treatment arm will be allocated on the following basis: patients will be allocated to the chemotherapy followed by LCRT arm unless they present at least one of the following criteria: contraindication to receive mFOLFIRINOX (including intolerance to irinotecan and UGT1A1\*28 polymorphism), age \> 75, general condition incompatible with the radiotherapy schedule of LCRT. In such case, patients will be allocated to the SCRT arm.

Tolinapant (ASTX660) will be administered orally once a day for 7 consecutive days every other week during 10 weeks (One week On / One week Off during 10 weeks).

Both treatment arms will have a dose escalation part to determine the MTD and/or RP2D, followed by an expansion part where up to 21 subjects will be dosed at the RP2D. Both arms will enroll simultaneously.
