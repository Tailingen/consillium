PROMISE Registry: A Prostate Cancer Registry of Outcomes and Germline Mutations for Improved Survival and Treatment Effectiveness
PROMISE aims to create a comprehensive nationwide registry of prostate cancer patients with germline pathogenic variants by prospectively screening approximately 5,000 subjects with a confirmed prostate cancer diagnosis, either through tissue biopsy, PSA greater than 100 ng/dL and/or radiographic evidence of disease and receiving systemic therapy for prostate cancer. Patients at all stages of disease will be welcome to participate in the PROMISE Registry.

Participants will be recruited \& screened over a five-year period. Study participants will be asked to provide a saliva sample to be tested for germline cancer risk variants through Color Health. If the results identify a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, an appointment with a genetic counselor from Color Health will be scheduled to discuss the results.

Participants will complete a baseline demographic survey that includes self-reported health history, family history of cancer and standardized patient reported outcome (PRO) measures.

PROMISE Registry staff will request medical records from the participant's cancer care provider(s) for the purpose of obtaining clinical data.

Participants will receive bi-annual newsletters offering information on new developments in treatment and research opportunities, including clinical trials, associated with genetic variants.

Eligible participants (those with target germline mutations) will be followed every 6 months to obtain updated health records data and patient-reported outcomes data. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 15 years.

The PROMISE registry will help identify prostate cancer patients with pathogenic variants to learn more about how these variants affect patient outcomes. Ultimately, we hope to help patients learn more about their disease and the treatments that they may derive the most benefit from, including the germline genetic biomarker-based clinical trials they may be eligible for.
