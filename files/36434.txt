The Clinical Study of SHR-9839 for Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is an open-label, phase I clinical trial of SHR-9839 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The whole study is divided into three stages: dose escalation, dose expansion and efficacy expansion.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: SHR-9839
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD), Incidence and category of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 4 week cycle of SHR-9839 treatment, On the first day of each week,4 weeks is a treatment cycle|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), RP2D will be determined on the basis of evaluation on MTD/MAD, PK, PD, efficacy data in dose escalation and dose expansion stages., From Day 1 to 90 days after last dose|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) ([CTCAE] v5.0), Assess safety and tolerability of SHR-9839 by way of adverse events (CTCAE v5.0)., From Day 1 to 90 days after last dose
PK parameter: Tmax of SHR-9839, Time to maximum concentration of SHR-9839, approximately 10 months|PK parameter: Cmax of SHR-9839, Maximum concentration of SHR-9839, approximately 10 months|PK parameter: AUC0-t of SHR-9839, Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration time point of SHR-9839, Approximately 10 months|PK parameter: AUC0-âˆž of SHR-9839, Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity of SHR-9839, Approximately 10 months|Immunogenicity of SHR-9839, Anti-SHR-9839 antibody (ADA), Approximately 12 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Evaluated using RECIST 1.1, Approximately within 36 months|Duration of response (DoR), Evaluated using RECIST 1.1, Approximately within 36 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Evaluated using RECIST 1.1, Approximately within 36 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Evaluated using RECIST 1.1, Approximately within 36 months
