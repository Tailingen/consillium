Enrichment & Purging of Stem Cells in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
To evaluate the role of purging the hematopoietic cell graft on outcomes for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
PROCEDURE: high dose chemo then auto hematopoietic cell transplant
PCR positivity in peripheral blood cell collections after cyclophosphamide
Enrichment of hematopoietic stem cells
To study the use of peripheral blood stem cells which have been treated in an effort to remove tumor cells. The researchers hope to learn whether or not this will be more effective in removing the tumor cells as compared to other methods of purging (the removal of cancer cells).
