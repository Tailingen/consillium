Patient Preferences for Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Cancer Screening Tests
This study plans to learn more about what patients think about screening for esophageal cancer (EAC) and Barrett's esophagus (BE); a pre-cancerous condition associated with esophageal cancer. The plan is to use this information to modify screening practices in the United States with the goal to decrease the number of people who die from esophageal cancer.

BEHAVIORAL: Patient survey
Define patient preferred BE/EAC screening test and barriers for attributes of BE/EAC screening tests, A discrete choice-based conjoint analysis survey evaluating 5 domains: benefit of detection (sensitivity), convenience (time, setting), screening related physical harms (procedural discomfort), and financial harms will be used to determine the relative importance of BE/EAC screening test characteristics and patient priorities. Survey data will be reported in aggregate and factors and choices will be analyzed using the Fisher Exact and Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests. This approach will elicit the overall preferred test and differences in each test attribute that informed the patients choice., Baseline
Characterization of differences in BE/EAC test preferences by patient sociodemographic characteristics and by patient presence or absence of GERD, Using the discrete choice-based conjoint analysis survey analysis, a logistic regression model of patient-specific attributes (age, sex, race, ethnicity) and by presence or absence of GERD will be used to evaluate if disparities in patient demographics or heath history impact complex decision making., Baseline
To achieve this goal, patient preferences for BE/EAC screening tests will be evaluated through a prospective multicenter discrete choice-based conjoint survey. Patients will choose between a series of hypothetical options and rank their priorities and what they value according to differences in benefit of detection (sensitivity), convenience (time, setting), screening related physical harms (procedural discomfort), and financial harms. By evaluating relative importance of test characteristics and patient prioritization the study will (1) define patient preferences and barriers for attributes of BE/EAC screening modalities to elicit the overall preferred test as well as differences in each attribute that informed that choice and (2) characterize differences in BE/EAC test preferences by patient sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity) and by the presence or absence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
