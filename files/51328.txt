Study of Efficacy and Safety of CTL019 in Pediatric ALL Patients
This was a single arm, open-label, multi-center, phase II study to determine the efficacy and safety of an experimental therapy called CTL019 T-cells in pediatric patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who were refractory to standard chemotherapy regimen or relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplant.
