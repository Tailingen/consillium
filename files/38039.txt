Tislelizumab in Combination With Sitravatinib in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with sitravatinib compared with docetaxel in participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy and anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody, with the anti-PD-(L)1 antibody administered in combination with or sequentially before or after the platinum-based chemotherapy.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Sitravatinib
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any reason., From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately|Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC), defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the IRC based on RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately
Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator based on RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately|Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of participants with partial response or complete response as determined by the IRC based on RECIST v1.1, From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately|Duration of Response (DOR), defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by the IRC based on RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately|Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response (BOR) is complete response, partial response or stable disease as determined by the IRC based on RECIST v1.1, From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately|Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed according to the European Organization and Treatment of Cancer lung cancer module, QLQ-LC13, A score of 1-4 will be administrated for each item in QLQ-LC13. The higher scores will indicate the worse outcomes., From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately|Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core cancer (QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 is completed by the participant. The EORTC QLQ-30 contains 30 questions that incorporate 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global health status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The participant answers questions about their health during the past week. There are 28 questions answered on a 4-point scale where 1 =Not at all (best) to 4 =Very Much (worst) and 2 questions answered on a 7-point scale where 1 =Very poor (worst) to 7 =Excellent (best)., From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately|Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed according to the European Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), Participant-reported outcomes based on EuroQoL-Five Dimensions, Five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) for all cohorts The EQ-5D- is a generic, self-reported measure of utility that consists of a five-item descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system has two versions, namely the 3L and 5L, both involving five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). In the EQ-5D-5L that will be used, participants may choose from the following five response levels: no problems=1; slight problems=2; moderate problems=3; severe problems=4; and unable to/extreme problems=5. Higher values indicate worst health., From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately|Number of participants experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0, From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately|Plasma concentration of sitravatinib, From first randomization up to 35 months, approximately
