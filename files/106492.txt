PROSPR/PCIPS Project 3: Communication of Personalized Breast Cancer Risk
In order to better communicate personal risk of breast cancer to women who have not yet initiated breast cancer screening (mammography), The Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania has created a personal breast cancer screening decision aid tool. This tool will be pilot tested, and then implemented and tested in nine primary care and OB/GYN practices within the University of Pennsylvania Health System.

BEHAVIORAL: Breast Cancer Screening Decision Aid
Mammography Use Correlated to Personal Risk of Breast Cancer, Medical charts of women in both the intervention and control groups of the study will be analyzed to determine if these women initiated breast cancer screening (mammography) correlated to their personal risk of breast cancer as displayed by the decision aid., One year post-intervention
Knowledge, Worry, Regret, Decisional Conflict, Accuracy of Risk Perception, Six weeks after a women's appointment with their primary care or OB/GYN provider, they will receive a post-intervention survey which will assess knowledge, worry, satisfaction, numeracy, behavior, etc., 6 weeks post-intervention
In order to better communicate personal risk of breast cancer to women who have not yet initiated breast cancer screening (mammography), The Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania has created a personal breast cancer screening decision aid tool. This tool incorporates questions about a women's personal history of breast cancer and compares her to the average women her age in terms of breast cancer risk. The tool helps the women to understand the benefits and risks of breast cancer screening. This tool will be pilot tested using SSI to help develop the final version of the decision aid tool. The decision aid tool will then be implemented and tested in nine general internal medicine, family medicine, and OB/GYN practices within the University of Pennsylvania Health System.
