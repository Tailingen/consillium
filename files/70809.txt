Metformin in Stage IV Lung Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether metformin is effective in lowering plasma IL-6 level and improving the treatment response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: METFORMIN
The change of plasma IL-6 level after the treatment with metformin, 12 weeks
The objective response rate (RR), 2 YEARS|The progression free survival, 2 years|The overall survival, 2-years|Number of participants with adverse events, All adverse events (AEs) occurring after the patient receiving the first dose of study drug will be monitored and recorded. Periodic measurement of vital signs, regular laboratory evaluation for hematology and blood chemistry will be arranged and these will be graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 grades., 2-years|Changes of quality of life, The quality of life will be evaluated by the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire which will be completed at baseline, during the therapy, and post-therapy period, 2-years
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Several clinical studies show metformin could decrease IL-6 level in addition to the glucose-lowering effect. Preclinical data also reveal metformin could decrease the IL-6 production in lung cancer cells and enhance cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in animal model. Based on these findings, the purpose of this study is to determine whether metformin is effective in lowering plasma IL-6 level and improving the treatment response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer clinically. Patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in this study and receive standard treatments for lung cancer, either chemotherapy combining cisplatin and pemetrexed or targeted therapy (Gefitinib). For patients with plasma IL-6 more than 2.0 pg/ml after 2 cycles of standard treatment, metformin will be given and titrated to 1500mg/day gradually. Plasma IL-6 level will be checked after use of metformin for 12 weeks. Tumor response to the standard treatment plus metformin will be evaluated and side effects of metformin will also be monitored.
