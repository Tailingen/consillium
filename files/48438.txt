Clinical Study of Sintilimab Combined With Chemotherapy in Neoadjuvant Treatment of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
By exploring the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant therapy with Sintilimab combined with platinum-containing chemotherapy in patients with resectable Stage ⅡB-ⅢA NSCLC, we will provide new treatment options and strategies for stage ⅡB-ⅢA NSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Sintilimab Combined with Platinum-containing Chemotherapy
Major pathological remission, Residual tumor cells were less than 10% in postoperative specimen pathology, 3 years|Event-free survival, The time from enrollment to occurrence of any event, including death, disease progression, change of chemotherapy regimen, change to chemotherapy, addition of other treatments, occurrence of fatal or intolerable side effects., 3 years
Pathological complete remission, No tumor cells were found in postoperative specimen pathology, 3 years|Overall Survival, Time from randomization to death (from any cause), 3 years|Disease-free survival, The time between randomization and relapse of disease or death (from any cause), 3 years|Objective remission rate, The proportion of patients whose tumor volume shrinks to a predetermined value and maintains the minimum time limit is the sum of complete and partial responses., 3 years
The distant recurrence rate after radical surgery for early and partial locally advanced NSCLC is high, while the benefit degree of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not satisfactory. The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant therapy with Sintilimab combined with platinum-containing chemotherapy in patients with resectable Stage ⅡB-ⅢA NSCLC.

In addition to exploring the advantages of clinical efficacy of combination therapy, the analysis of biomolecular markers will be used to further understand the effects of combination therapy mode on immune activation and tumor immune microenvironment, and to explore potential biomarkers for predicting treatment response.
