Patient Recall of Cancer Screening and Diagnosis
The purpose of this research is to try to better understand how much information relating to cancer screening and diagnoses that people can recall on their own and to better understand how to help people get better information. In this study, investigators will see if giving time or other resources help individuals remember more and more accurate details about their cancer screening and care.

Completeness of survey, Completeness: For each survey, for each participant, investigators will count the number of "don't know" response rates. From this, investigators will calculate the percent completeness of the survey., at 1 week (after second survey completed)|Accuracy of survey, Investigators will assess the inter-rater reliability between the first and second survey by calculating a Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Although not a perfect assumption, investigators will use the second survey as the reference. Number of changed answers on an individual level will be calculated, representing improved accuracy. Investigators do not anticipate many changes, and, again, this will not be normally distributed., at 1 week (after second survey completed)
This is a randomized controlled trial of an intervention to encourage use of online medical records for filling out a cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment questionnaire. Participants will be asked to self-report on cancer screening and treatment. They will then be asked the same questions again a week later.

The control group will have had one week to reflect on the questions, and investigators anticipate some influence of this on responses. The intervention group will be prompted about accessing their medical records from the major local health systems online, with links to directions provided by each hospital system. They will then be asked to fill out the same questionnaire.
