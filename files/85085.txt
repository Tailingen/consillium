A Phase I Feasibility And Safety Study of Fluorescein-Specific (FITC-E2) CAR T Cells In Combination With Parenterally Administered Folate-Fluorescein (UB-TT170) For Osteogenic Sarcoma
The purpose of this study is to see if a new treatment could help patients who have osteosarcoma that does not go away with treatment (is refractory) or comes back after treatment (is recurrent).This study is testing a combination of study therapies, UB-TT170 and genetically modified chimeric antigen receptor T lymphocyte (CAR T) cells, which work together in a way that is different from chemotherapy.

In this study, researchers will take some of your blood and remove the T cells in a process called "apheresis". Then the T cells are taken to a lab and changed to CAR T cells that recognize the flags from UB-TT170. Once researchers think they have grown enough CAR T cells, called antiFL(FITC-E2) CAR T cells, to fight your cancer, you may get some chemotherapy to make room in your body for the new cells and then have those cells put back in your body.

A few days after the you get your CAR T cell infusion you will start to get infusions of UB-TT170, with the dose slowly increasing for the first few infusions until you have reached a maximum dose that you will get on a regular schedule. The UB-TT170 will attach to your tumor cells and flag them so that they attract the CAR T cells. When the CAR T cells see the labeled tumor cells they can kill the tumor cells.

The active part of the study lasts about 8 months, and if you get the CAR T cell infusion you will be in long-term follow-up for 15 years.
Osteosarcoma
BIOLOGICAL: SCRI-E2CAR_EGFRtv1|DRUG: UB_TT170
Adverse events associated with ex-vivo expanded autologous T cells genetically modified to express an antiFL(FITC-E2) CAR administered with UB-TT170 will be assessed, The type, frequency, severity, and duration of adverse events will be summarized, 30 days
Ability to manufacture antiFL(FITC-E2) CAR cells, The number of successfully manufactured antiFL(FITC-E2) CAR products will be assessed, 28 Days|Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of UB-TT170 in combination with the anti-FL(FITC-E2) CAR T cells, Pharmacokinetics of UB-TT170 in combination with the anti-FL(FITC-E2) CAR T cells, 25 days
