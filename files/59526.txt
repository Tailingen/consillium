Docetaxel in Treating Children With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic or Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel in treating children who have relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia.
Leukemia
DRUG: docetaxel
Response to therapy, The levels of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins will be evaluated in specimens taken before and after administration of docetaxel, at the end of therapy and at the time of relapse. The average values and variance of these levels will be used to design further investigations. The pre- and post- docetaxel levels will be compared using the difference of these two values for each patient. The change in level will be assessed using a paired t-test with an appropriate transformation for normality., At any time during protocol therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic or acute myeloid leukemia treated with docetaxel.
* Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
