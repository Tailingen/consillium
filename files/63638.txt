An Extension (Rollover) Study of Vemurafenib in Participants With BRAF V600 Mutation-Positive Malignancies Previously Enrolled in an Antecedent Vemurafenib Protocol
This open-label, multicenter, non-randomized study provided continued access to vemurafenib for eligible participants with BRAF V600 mutation-positive malignancy, who were previously enrolled and treated in an antecedent vemurafenib protocol and did not meet the protocol's criteria for disease progression, or were treated beyond progression and were still deriving clinical benefit (as assessed by investigator), and may have therefore potentially benefited from continued treatment with vemurafenib. Participants received treatment with oral vemurafenib at 960 milligrams (mg) twice daily (BID), 720 mg BID, or 480 mg BID, depending on the last dose in the antecedent protocol. Treatment continued until progression of disease or as long as the participant was deriving clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator (case-by-case decision with approval of the Medical Monitor), death, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, loss to follow-up, or decision of the Sponsor to terminate the study, whichever occurred first.
Neoplasms
DRUG: Vemurafenib
Dose Intensity of Vemurafenib, Dose Intensity was defined as (total actual doses taken/total planned doses) \*100, where total planned doses = prescribed doses \* planned days on treatment, where planned days on treatment were defined as the interval between date of first dose and date of last dose., Baseline up to a maximum of 7 years.
Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An Adverse Event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory values or abnormal clinical test results), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as Adverse Events. Reported are the Percentage of Participants with AEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug (up to a maximum of 7 years).
