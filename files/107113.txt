Clinical Study of IM96 CAR-T Cell Therapy in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer
This study, a single-center, open, single-dose clinical study, was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IM96 CAR-T cells in treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer

This study is planned to enroll 6-12 patients with advanced colorectal cancer, using a modified "3+3" design for dose escalation, with two dose groups of 12×10\^8 CAR-T cells and 20×10\^8 CAR-T cells. 3-6 subjects are planned to be enrolled in each dose group to assess their safety, and if the incidence of horizontal dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is ≤1/6 within 28 days after transfusion in one dose group, the next dose group can be started. If the incidence of horizontal dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in a dose group is ≤1/6 within 28 days after transfusion, transfusion of cells from the next dose group can be initiated.

This study will be divided into a screening period, a cell collection period, a chemotherapy pretreatment period, a return infusion and a follow-up period, and within 28 days of return infusion the investigator will assess whether a DLT (Dose limited toxicity) event has occurred to confirm the safety of this dose group.
