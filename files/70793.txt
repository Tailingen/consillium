Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy VERification
The goal of this multi-center randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the added value of needle based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE)-imaging to regular diagnostic bronchoscopic peripheral lung lesion analysis on the diagnostic yield in patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules suspect for malignancy.

The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

To determine if the addition of nCLE-imaging to conventional diagnostic bronchoscopic peripheral lung lesion analysis results in an improved diagnostic yield (defined as the proportion of patients in whom the bronchoscopic procedure results in a definitive diagnosis out of the total number of patients that have received the diagnostic bronchoscopic procedure).

Participants will undergo diagnostic bronchoscopy either with or without the addition of nCLE imaging before each TBNA. Based on the feedback of the CLE images on (in)correct placement of the needle, the needle might be repositioned before sampling. Comparison between the diagnostic yield of these groups will be done including subgroup analysis.

Rationale: Lung cancer screening and the increasing use of chest-computed tomography (CT) has led to an increase in the number of (incidental) found suspected malignant lung lesions. Since tissue acquisition for pathological analysis is prerequisite for diagnosis and optimal treatment, a drastic increase in the number of patients that need to undergo bronchoscopy is expected.

Over 70% of the suspected lesions develop in the periphery of the lung and are therefore not visible during conventional bronchoscopy. Although several bronchoscopic navigational techniques demonstrated an improved navigation towards the target lesion, the diagnostic yield remains suboptimal due to a substantial near-miss rate. As a result, the need for complementary bronchoscopic guidance that provides real-time feedback on the correct positioning of the biopsy instruments is urgent.

Needle-based Confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) is a novel high-resolution imaging technique that uses an excitation laser light to create 'real-time' microscopic images of tissues. nCLE can be integrated into the biopsy needle, allowing real-time cancer detection at the tip of the biopsy needle during bronchoscopy. The confocal microscope captures autofluorescence of tissues or, combined with intravenously (IV) infused fluorophores (such as fluorescein) allows imaging of individual tumor cells. Recent studies on nCLE-imaging in lung tumors and metastatic lymph nodes have identified and validated nCLE criteria for malignancy (enlarged pleomorphic cells, dark clumps and directional streaming) and airway/lung parenchyma (alveoli, elastin fibres of the conducting airway, bronchial epithelium and still image) and granulomas. A recent study demonstrated that these nCLE-criteria can be used in real-time to fine-tune the needle positioning during ongoing bronchoscopy and thereby potentially improve the diagnostic yield.

This randomized controlled trials aims to evaluate the added value of nCLE-imaging (smart needle) to the conventional used bronchoscopic approach for peripheral lung lesion analysis.

Objective: This multicenter, randomized controlled trial, aims to investigate if nCLE-imaging integrated with conventional bronchoscopy results in a higher diagnostic yield compared to conventional bronchoscopy without nCLE in the diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules.

Study design: Investigator-initiated, international, multi-center randomized controlled trial including university and general hospitals.

Study population: Patients (\>18 years old) with suspected malignant peripheral lung lesions with an indication for bronchoscopic analysis.

Procedure: Bronchoscopy will be performed according to institutional practice, including radial endobronchial ultrasound (r-EBUS) and optionally fluoroscopy, electromagnetic navigation, virtual bronchoscopy and/or ultrathin bronchoscopy. This is followed by transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and (cryo-)biopsies (control arm). In the study arm, nCLE-imaging will be added prior to TBNA tissue acquisition to fine-tune the sampling area. Cytology staining for rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE) and cellblock will be performed according to local practice.

Primary objective:

To determine if the addition of nCLE-imaging to conventional bronchoscopic peripheral lung lesion analysis results in an improved diagnostic yield. (defined as the proportion of patients in whom the bronchoscopic procedure results in a definitive diagnosis out of the total number of patients that have received the diagnostic bronchoscopic procedure).
