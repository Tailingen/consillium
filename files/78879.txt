Radiation-induced Diarrhoea During Curative EBRT of Prostate and Rectal Cancer
Approx. 80% of patients with prostate and rectal cancer who receive radiation therapy (RT) experience acute radiation-induced diarrhea (RID). RID has major impact on patients' quality of life, can lead to pause or early termination of RT and chronic diarrhea. RID is poorly described with few details of type and severity of RID in clinical practice and in the literature. We are conducting an observational study in patients in patients who receive curative EBRT radiation for prostate and rectal cancer to uncover the frequency and classifications of RID.
Radiation-induced Diarrhoea in Prostate and Rectal Cancer
OTHER: No intervention
Frequency and classification of radiation-induced diarrhrea in patients with prostate and rectal cancer during curative external radiotherapy, Frequency of RID measured as mean number of stools per day/week, distribution daytime/night-time during EBRT.

RID measured as Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE)/Bristol Stool Scale (diarrhoea, rectal haemorrhage, bloating, abdominal pain, tenesmus, proctitis, rectal fissure, mucus, flatulence and faecal incontinence), score and use of antidiarrheal medication and laxatives (type, dose, start, stop).

QoL measured during and following EBRT. Patient's nutrition, physical activity, biochemical measures and faecal samples., 1 June 2022 - 31 December 2023
1. Background Prostate and rectal cancer are among the most common cancer types in Denmark and make up the majority of patients who receive curative radiation therapy of the small pelvis. A well-known side effect of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the pelvis is radiation-induced diarrhoea (RID). When ionising radiation is given to the patient, both tumour and the surrounding cells are damaged. Thus, irradiating prostate and rectal cancer will inevitably lead to the damage of the nearby gut mucosa cellular components. This cellular damage is causing the RID. RID is reported as the problem with the greatest impact on health-related quality of life (QoL) and social behaviour.

   Up to approx. 70% of patients who receive pelvic radiation experience acute RID. It usually occurs two weeks after start of EBRT and peaks during 4-5 weeks. Acute RID may cease a few weeks after the end of EBRT but increases the risk of developing chronic RID.

   Recently, a systematic Cochrane review reveals low evidence for dietary interventions in RID due to few studies and low scientific quality. A serious drawback of the Cochrane review was that it included studies prior of 2005, with radiotherapy given both pre- and post-surgery, as well as with radiotherapy techniques resulting in higher doses to the normal tissue. It is well known that the volume of the radiation field greatly impacts the severity of RID and newer radiation techniques allow smaller volume fields.

   There is a lack of consensus about how acute RID is reported, such as definition of RID (frequency), classification and the changes during EBRT. There is also a lack of knowledge of changes in microbiomes which can contribute to RID. The role of dietary intervention during EBRT could also influence RID.
2. Aim The aim of this prospective observation study is to investigate the frequency, severity and changes of acute RID in patients with prostate and rectal cancer as well as the role of nutrition and changes in microbiome during curative EBRT.
3. Method This is an observational multicenter study of acute RID in patients with prostate and rectal cancer during curative EBRT. The study will take place in parallel with the patients' EBRT, which is ongoing on weekdays over 39 days for patients with prostate cancer and 28 days for patients with rectal cancer.

Study procedure Candidates will be identified according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients will be informed orally and in written form by a doctor or project nurse at the first oncology appointment.

The observations will start at baseline and concomitant with EBRT. All examinations and observations will be carried out in parallel with the patient's EBRT.

Data collection

1. Patient data: Civil status, age, sex, comorbidities, smoking, histopathology data: Primary diagnosis, date, stage, Electronic patient's record (EPR) 2. Treatment data: Treatment start and end date, fractionation and total dose (Gy), field size and anatomical location, EPR 3. Clinical examinations: ECOG performance status, body weight, height, rectal exploration, rectal haemorrhage or mucus, bloating, flatulence, obstipation, abdominal pain or tenesmus, faecal or urine incontinence, EPR, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4. Medication: Anti-diarrhoeal medication, laxatives, antibiotics, opioids, EPR 5. Frequency and classification of RID, body weight, Bristol Stool Scale and patient reported stool diary 6. Nutrition screening: Nutrition-related symptoms, dietary intake development, PG-SGA-short form 7. Dietary assessment: 3-day food records, online food database (Vitakost, 2006-2018, Denmark 8. Patient's physical activity, International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-short form) 9. Quality of life (QoL), EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-PRT20 questionnaires 10.

Faecel samples only for patients treated in Aalborg: F-calprotectin, short chain fatty acids. Samples will be frozen for subsequent microbial analysis, EPR (microbiological record)

4. Statistical considerations It is expected to include at least 100 patients during the inclusion period from 1 June 2022 to 31 December 2023. We expect to find above 30% of the patients with acute RID, why the required number of patients is estimated as above. The data are processed descriptive, as current numbers and percentages.

Uni- and multivariate analyses will be conducted using the Stata software, version 16 (StataCorp, LLC, TX, USA).

5. Subjects Patients with prostate and rectal cancer patients commenced to start curative EBRT, referred to the oncology department at Danish hospitals participating in the study will be consecutively screened for study eligibility according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
