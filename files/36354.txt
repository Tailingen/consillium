Verbal Synchrony, Satisfaction and Decision-making in Face-to-face Consultations
Eligible participants will be: benign thyroid nodules patients, to be involved in a consultation with their endocrinologist and/or surgeon and/or radiologist, in order to discuss treatment options related to benign thyroid nodules.
Thyroid Nodule
Evaluation of predictive power of verbal synchrony established between patient and physician during the consultation on patients' satisfaction, The primary endpoint of our research is to test the predictive power of verbal synchrony established between patient and physician during the consultation on patients' satisfaction with tha analysis of audio and video recording file.

Variables analyzed from audio recording will be use of words, verbal synchrony, empathic communication; variables analyzed from video recording will be facial emotion expression and facial emotion expression synchrony, 1 month
Eligible participants will be: benign thyroid nodules patients, to be involved in a consultation with their endocrinologist and/or surgeon and/or radiologist, in order to discuss treatment options related to benign thyroid nodules. Endocrinologist and/or surgeon and/or radiologist involved in the consultation will be recruited as well.

Before the scheduled consultation with endocrinologist, surgeon or radiologist, benign thyroid nodules patients will be screened for eligibility by a researcher and a physician from the Interventional Radiology Unit.

If patients meet all the inclusion criteria, they will be contacted by the researcher and proposed to participate. The day of the consultations, researcher will meet participants face to face, they will answer any questions should arise and will ask them to sign the informed consent form.

Benign thyroid nodules patients have a specific clinical pathway, in which they may have consultations with endocrinologists, and/or with surgeon, and/or with radiologists. Patients will be recruited before their first consultation and then, if they are scheduled to have other consultations with other professionals, will be recruited as well for the following consultations.
