Lenvatinib Plus DEB-TACE and HAIC vs. Lenvatinib Plus DEB-TACE for Large HCC With PVTT
This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib plus transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) with drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE) and hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) with FOLFOX regemen (Len+DEB-TACE+HAIC) versus lenvatinib plus DEB-TACE (Len+DEB-TACE) for large hepatocellular carcinoma (\> 7cm) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).

This is a multicenter, prospective and randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Len+DEB-TACE+HAIC compared with Len+DEB-TACE for unresectable large HCC (\>7cm) with PVTT.

178 patients with large HCC (\> 7cm) and PVTT will be enrolled in this study. The patients will receive either Len+DEB-TACE+HAIC or Len+DEB-TACE using an 1:1 randomization scheme. In the Len+DEB-TACE+HAIC arm, the microcatheter will be reserved at the main hepatic tumor-feeding artery after DEB-TACE and chemotherapy drugs (oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin; FOLFOX-based regimen) will be intra-arterially administered though the microcatheter. DEB-TACE+HAIC treatments can be repeated based on the evaluation of follow-up laboratory and imaging examination by the multidisciplinary team. In the Len+DEB-TACE arm, patients will be treated with DEB-TACE alone. TACE treatment can be repeated based on the evaluation of follow-up laboratory and imaging examination by the multidisciplinary team. In both arms, lenvatinib 12mg (body weight â‰¥60kg) or 8mg (body weight \<60kg) P.O. qd will be started within 7 days after the first DEB-TACE+HAIC/DEB-TACE.

The primary end point of this study is time to progression (TTP). The secondary endpoints are tumor response (objective response rate and disease control rate), overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs).
