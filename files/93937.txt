Biomarkers in Urine Samples From Patients With Wilms Tumor
RATIONALE: Studying samples of urine from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies biomarkers in urine from patients with Wilms tumor.

Wilms tumor biomarkers identified by ELISA
OBJECTIVES:

* To validate the prognostic performance of specific-candidate Wilms tumor markers by measuring their urinary concentration using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in urine specimens collected at diagnosis from 50 patients with favorable histology Wilms tumor who relapsed and 50 patients who did not relapse.

OUTLINE: Urine specimens are analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for biomarkers.
