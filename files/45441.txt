Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Investigational Agents in Resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (MK-3475-01E/KEYMAKER-U01)
The main goals are after treatment given before surgery, to measure the number of people who have no signs of cancer cells in tumors and lymph nodes removed during surgery; and to learn about whether the cancer gets smaller or goes away by measuring the number of people with a certain number of living cancer cells in the tumor removed during surgery.
Lung Neoplasm Malignant
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab (neoadjuvant)|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Sacituzumab tirumotecan|DRUG: Antihistamine|DRUG: H2 receptor antagonist|DRUG: Acetaminophen (or equivalent)|DRUG: Dexamethasone (or equivalent)|DRUG: Carboplatin|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab (adjuvant)|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Steroid mouthwash (dexamethasone or equivalent)
Pathological Complete Response (pCR), pCR is defined as absence of residual viable invasive cancer on hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides of the resected lung specimen and lymph nodes., Up to approximately 20 weeks|Percent Residual Viable Tumor (%RVT), %RVT is defined as the percentage of residual tumor estimated by comparing the estimated cross-sectional area of viable tumor with estimated cross-sectional areas of remainder of tumor bed. The tumor bed is defined as the area of tissue occupied by viable tumor or tumoral regression (includes areas of necrosis, foamy macrophages, giant cell reaction, cholesterol cleft granuloma, and inflammation.), Up to approximately 20 weeks
Percentage of Participants Who Report at Least 1 Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 5 years|Percentage of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 1 year|Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization to any of the following events: radiographic disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) (for participants who have not had or will not have surgery, or participants who have gross residual disease after an incomplete resection \[R2 resection\]); local progression (primary tumor or regional lymph nodes) or distant metastasis precluding planned surgery; tumor determined to be unresectable in the operating room; local or distant recurrence (for participants who are disease free after surgery or participants with microscopic positive margins \[R1 resection\]); occurrence of new primary NCSLC; death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS), DMFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of diagnosis of distant metastasis or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), OR is defined as a complete response or partial response with or without confirmation per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator during the Neoadjuvant Phase., Up to approximately 12 weeks|Percentage of Participants Who Experience a Perioperative Complication, Perioperative Complications include both intraoperative and postoperative complications., Up to approximately 20 weeks|Mean Length of Hospital Stay, Hospital Stay is the length of inpatient time spent in hospital., Up to approximately 20 weeks|Percentage of Participants Who Require Hospital Readmission after Discharge, In participants previously discharged from hospital, the percentage requiring readmission to hospital., Up to approximately 20 weeks|Mean Length of Surgery, Length of surgery is the time spent in surgery., Up to approximately 20 weeks|Percentage of Participants Who Require a Blood Transfusion, Blood transfusion is the transfer of donated blood into the vein of a recipient., Up to approximately 20 weeks
