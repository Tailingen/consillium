Study With SCB-313 (Recombinant Human TRAIL-Trimer Fusion Protein) for Treatment of Malignant Pleural Effusions
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and PK/PD of SCB-313 (recombinant human TRAIL-Trimer fusion protein) administered once via intrapleural injection (SAD) and once daily over 2 to 3 days (MAD)for the treatment of cancer patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusions requiring drainage.
