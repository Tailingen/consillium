Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Ublituximab and Umbralisib in Participants With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Currently Treated With Ibrutinib, Acalabrutinib or Venetoclax
Phase 2, two cohort trial evaluating the addition of ublituximab and umbralisib on the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in participants with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), who are currently on treatment with ibrutinib, alacabrutinib or venetoclax.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Ublituximab|DRUG: Umbralisib|DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Acalabrutinib Oral Capsule
Rate of Undetected Minimal Residual Disease (U-MRD), U-MRD rate was defined as the proportion of participants who have undetectable MRD in the peripheral blood as confirmed by central lab., Up to approximately 23 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as percent of participants who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR was defined as no evidence of new disease, regression of all target nodal masses to normal size \< or = 1.5 cm in the longest diameter (LD) and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in peripheral blood \< 4\*10\^9/L. PR was defined as no evidence of new disease, a decrease in peripheral blood ALC by ≥50% from baseline or a decrease to \<4 x 10\^9/L or a decrease by ≥50% from the baseline in the sum of the products (SPD) of the target nodal lesions or a decrease by ≥50% from baseline in the CLL marrow infiltrate or in B lymphoid, no target, splenic, liver, or non-target disease with worsening that meets the criteria for definitive nodules, peripheral blood counts with ANC \>1.5 x 10\^9/L or platelet count ≥100 x 10\^9/L or hemoglobin ≥110 g/L (11.0 g/dL) without red blood cell transfusions, all without need for exogenous growth factors., Up to approximately 34 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) as Assessed by National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events-Version (NCI-CTCAE-V5), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A TEAE is an AE that starts or worsens after receiving study drug., Up to approximately 34 months
This is a Phase 2 open label, two treatment cohort trial evaluating the addition of ublituximab and umbralisib on the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in participants with CLL, who fail to achieve MRD negativity, after a minimum 6-month treatment with ibrutinib, alacabrutinib or venetoclax.
