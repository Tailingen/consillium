Safety and Efficacy of Bevacizumab in Combination With NaviFUS System for the Treatment of Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (rGBM)
This will be a prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study to investigate the safety and efficacy of Bevacizumab (BEV) in combination with microbubble (MB)-mediated FUS in patients with recurrent GBM. BEV represents the physician's best choice for the standard of care (SoC) in rGBM after previous treatment with surgery (if appropriate), standard radiotherapy with temozolomide chemotherapy, and with adjuvant temozolomide.

DEVICE: NaviFUS System|DRUG: Lumason|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Adverse Events (AEs), The incidence and severity of AEs associated with FUS-MB+BEV treatment in patients with rGBM, up to 52 weeks
6-month Progression-Free Survival (PFS-6), PFS-6 is the proportion of patients who remain progression-free at the 6-month time point, as determined by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Criteria, from the time of their first treatment., up to 6 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the earliest date of the first objective documentation of radiographic progression disease based on RANO Criteria, death, or last known follow-up due to any cause whichever occurs first. PFS will be followed continuously till the End-of-Study., up to 52 weeks|One-year Survival Rate, One-year survival rate is the proportion of patients who remain alive at the one-year time point from the time of their first treatment., up to 12 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the earliest date of death or last known follow-up due to any cause whichever occurs first. OS will be followed continuously while subjects are on study and via phone interviews every 3 months during the survival follow-up phase of the study., up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on a combination of imaging and clinical features as assessed by the RANO Criteria., up to 52 weeks|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response of CR, PR, or SD based on a combination of imaging and clinical features as assessed by the RANO Criteria., up to 52 weeks|Local Disease Control on the MRI Images, Local disease control is defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a CR, PR, or SD within the planning target tumor lesion, as assessed by the RANO Criteria., up to 52 weeks|Corticosteroid Consumption, Changes in corticosteroid usage will be compared to baseline., up to 52 weeks|Quality of life (QoL) assessment, The standardized and validated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and brain cancer questionnaire (QLQ-BN20, assessment specific to brain neoplasm) will be assessed at baseline and throughout treatment period. The changes in QoL during treatment will be compared to baseline. QoL is assessed based on the cancer or brain tumor patient's subjective evaluation of their current status, the presence or absence of the specific symptoms, and their overall general health., up to 52 weeks
The study aims to demonstrate the high safety profile and effectiveness of BEV+FUS-MB targeted therapy for brain tumors.

Any patient with a histological diagnosis of GBM who meets all of the specific eligibility criteria may participate in this study by signing informed consent in person or through their legal representative. Eligible patients will undergo a 2-week baseline observation screening period.

Up to 10 eligible patients will be enrolled in this study. Eligible patients will follow the standard operating procedures of BEV (10 mg/kg intravenous (IV) infusion over 30-90 minutes). After at least 30 minutes, patients will be administered microbubbles (MB) (LumasonÂ®) at a dose of 0.1 mL/kg, along with optimal ultrasound exposure doses determined by the acoustic emission feedback FUS power control algorithm of the NaviFUS System. The treatment will be administered every 2 weeks up to 34 weeks or until evidence of progression disease (PD), intolerable toxicity precluding further treatment, non-compliance with study follow-up, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.
