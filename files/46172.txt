Trial of ZW25 (Zanidatamab) in Patients With Advanced HER2-expressing Cancers
This is a first-in-human, 3-part study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of ZW25 (zanidatamab) by itself and combined with selected chemotherapy agents in patients with locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing cancers. This study will also the evaluate the way the body absorbs, distributes, and eliminates ZW25 (pharmacokinetics or PK).

The proportion of patients who experience dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) (Part 1), Up to 8 months|The proportion patients who experience laboratory abnormalities and/or adverse events as defined by CTCAE v4.03 that are related to treatment (Parts 2 and 3), Throughout the duration of the study; up to 2 years
Serum concentrations of ZW25, Throughout the duration of the study; up to 2 years|The proportion of patients who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies, Throughout the duration of the study; up to 2 years|The proportion of patients with an objective response (partial response or complete response) as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, Throughout the duration of the study; up to 2 years|Progression free survival as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria, Throughout the duration of the study; up to 2 years|The proportion patients who experience laboratory abnormalities and/or adverse events as defined by CTCAE v4.03 that are related to treatment (Part 1), Throughout the duration of the study; up to 2 years
Part 1 of the study will evaluate increasing doses of ZW25 to find the highest dose of ZW25 that does not cause unacceptable side effects (maximum-tolerated dose or MTD), the lowest safe dose with the highest rate of effectiveness (optimal biological dose or OBD), and/or other recommended dosages (RDs) of ZW25 in up to 7 dose-specific cohorts. Eligible patients include those with selected HER2-expressing locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic cancers that have progressed after receipt of all therapies known to confer clinical benefit (or ineligible to receive therapy).

Part 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ZW25 in patients with selected HER2-expressing locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic cancers that have progressed after receipt of all therapies known to confer clinical benefit (or ineligible to receive therapy) in up to 5 separate disease-specific cohorts.

Part 3 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ZW25 combined with selected chemotherapy agents, including paclitaxel, capecitabine, vinorelbine, or capecitabine and tucatinib. Patients with selected HER2-expressing locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic cancers that have progressed after at least 1 and no more than 3 prior systemic chemotherapy regimens will be evaluated in this part of the study.
