Phase III Study of DCVAC/PCa Added to Standard Chemotherapy for Men With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
The VIABLE study sought to confirm the hypothesis that the combination of docetaxel with DCVAC/PCa followed by a maintenance therapy with DCVAC/PCa would improve overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, international, parallel-group phase III study. Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were candidates to receive standard of care first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel plus prednisone were randomized 2:1 into one of two arms: an investigational arm (DCVAC/PCa) and a control arm (placebo) in addition to chemotherapy (docetaxel plus prednisone).
