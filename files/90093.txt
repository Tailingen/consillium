NPC Study : TAX + CIS Neoadjuvant in Patients With Loco Regionally Advanced Undifferentiated Carcinoma of Nasopharyngeal Type (UCNT)
Primary Objective:

To estimate the overall response rate after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy of Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 in combination with Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 given for 3 cycles, and followed by conventional radiotherapy in UCNT.

Secondary Objectives:

To evaluate:

* The radiological response after chemotherapy and radiotherapy
* The pathological response after chemotherapy by cavum biopsy

To estimate:

* The duration of overall response
* The time to progression (T.T.P)

To analyze:

* The overall survival
* The safety profile

DRUG: DOCETAXEL(XRP6976)
Evaluation of tumor response in patients with measurable disease according to RECIST criteria, on day 21 of each treatment cycle for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, on day 64 and day 71 (3 to 4 weeks after the third chemotherapy)
