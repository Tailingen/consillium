Computer Aided Diagnosis of Colorectal Neoplasms During Colonoscopic Examination
An NBI-based diagnosis requires training and experience. We are developing a system of computerized image recognition, which can detect possible NBI features of polyps, and provide a more objective diagnosis, which allows nonexpert endoscopists to achieve a high diagnostic accuracy.
