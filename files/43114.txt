Human CD19 Targeted T Cells Injection(CD19 CAR-T) Therapy for Relapsed and Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
A Phase Ⅱ Clinical Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Human CD19 Targeted T Cells Injection (CD19 CAR-T) Therapy for R/R B-NHL.

Patients will be given a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by a single infusion of CD19 CAR+ T cells.
B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Human CD19Targeted T Cells Injection
Overall response rate (ORR) at 3 months post infusion, ORR is defined as proportion of subjects who achieved Partial remission(PR) or better at 3 months (D90±7) post infusion as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) based on Lugano 2014 criteria., 3 months post infusion
Duration of remission (DOR) after administration, DOR refers to the time from the first assessment of complete response or partial response to the first assessment of disease progression or death from any cause., 2 years post infusion|Progression-free Survival (PFS) after administration, PFS refers to the time from the start of cell infusion to the first assessment of tumor progression or death from any cause., 2 years post infusion|Overall Survival (OS) after administration, OS refers to the time from cell infusion to death due to any cause., 2 years post infusion|Disease control rate (DCR), The best overall response is the ratio of partial response(PR) or complete response(CR) or stable disease(SD) patients to the total number of cases., 2 years post infusion|Safety evaluation, The occurrence and outcome of adverse events evaluated by physical examination, laboratory examination, electrocardiogram, imaging scan, etc., 2 years post infusion|Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters: Maximum CAR level inperipheral blood, The highest concentration of Human CD19 Targeted T Cells Injection amplified in peripheral blood after infusion (Cmax) ., 2 years post infusion|Pharmacokinetics(PK) parameters: Time to peak CAR level in blood (Tmax), The time to reach the highest concentration of Human CD19 Targeted T Cells Injection in peripheral blood after infusion (Tmax) ., 2 years post infusion|Pharmacokinetics(PK) parameters: 28-day Area under the curve of the CAR level in blood(AUC0-28), The 28-day area under the curve of Human CD19 Targeted T Cells Injection in peripheral blood after infusion（AUC0-28d）., 2 years post infusion|Pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters, The clearance degree of CD19 positive B cells in peripheral blood at respective time point., 2 years post infusion
Subjects with relapsed and refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma would be selected if subjects meet all criteria evaluated by physical exams, blood tests, electrocardiograph, computedtomography （CT）/magnetic resonance Imaging(MRI)/positron emission tomography（PET）, tumor assessments, etc. Subjects would be hospitalized to receive the infusion of CD19 CAR+ T cells after lymphodepleting regimen, with the observation and evaluation of efficacy and safety.
