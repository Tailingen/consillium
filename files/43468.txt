Phase 1 Study of SON-1010 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label, adaptive-design outpatient study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK/PD of SON-1010 administered to patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: SON-1010
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SON-1010, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SON-1010, Highest safe dose achieved during dose escalation, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of SON-1010, Highest safe dose achieved during dose escalation, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Serum and urine concentrations of SON-1010 will be determined at various time points, Concentration vs time of SON-1010 will be measured using blood \& urine samples taken at various time points on study, Cycles 1 and 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Effect of SON-1010 on Serum cytokine levels, Concentration of serum level of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 will be measured using blood samples taken at various time points on study, Cycles 1 and 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Evaluation of SON-1010 immunogenicity, Evaluate the immunogenicity of SON-1010 by measuring the number of patients developing anti-SON-1010 antibodies, Cycles 1, 2 and 3 (each cycle is 28 days)|To assess the antitumor activity of SON-1010, Objective response rate per RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST or other appropriate disease-specific response criteria., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
This is a study of SON-1010, a single-chain human Interleukin-12 (IL12) cytokine linked to a single-chain variable region (scFv) antibody fragment, known as the fully human albumin binding domain (FHAB). The albumin binding domain moiety of SON-1010 attaches to albumin in the bloodstream, resulting in significantly enhanced drug PK properties, potentially lower risk than IL12 alone, and a broader therapeutic index. The study is designed to safely and rapidly establish the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with up to 5 dose-escalation groups and to expand the dataset at the recommended RP2D.
