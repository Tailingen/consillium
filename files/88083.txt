A Phase II Study of ABC294640 as Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a Phase II study of single agent ABC294640. Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have experienced tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity on single agent sorafenib will receive ABC294640 500 mg by mouth twice a day continuously. Patients will continue on study drug until the development of progressive disease per modified RECIST, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of patient consent or other event as outlined in patient discontinuation.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: ABC294640
To assess objective response rate (per modified RECIST) of single agent ABC294640 in treatment of HCC, Radiographic Assessment will be completed up to 28 days prior to registration and every 8 weeks (+/- 7 days) following registration until disease progression or other (e.g.toxicity, patient decision, etc). The baseline radiographic assessment will include CT or MRI of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Subsequent imaging will include only those body regions that include measureable index lesions per modified RECIST. Radiographic assessments will be completed every 8 weeks (+/- 7 days). In regards to the end of treatment visit, if the patient is taken off study and already has radiographic documentation of progressive disease, completing the radiographic assessment at the end of treatment visit is not required per study. If the patient is taken off study for other reasons such as toxicity or patient decision, it is strongly recommended that a radiographic assessment be obtained., The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) at 16 weeks defined according to modified RECIST criteria in second-line ABC294640 in patients with advanced HCC who have progressed on sorafenib.
To estimate the time to tumor progression (TTP) in HCC patients treated with ABC294640, Patients who have not progressed by the end of the follow-up will have their TTP values censored., While on study, radiographic response will be documented every 8 weeks; after discontinuation, every 3 months for a maximum of 24 months after the last patient registered|To estimate the overall survival (OS) in HCC patients treated with ABC294640, Survival times will be censored for patients lost to follow-up or still alive at the trial's termination., Time interval from initiation of study treatment to death due to any cause. All patients should be followed every 3 months for survival for a maximum of 24 months after the last patient has been registered to the trial.|To evaluate the pharmacokinetic behavior of ABC294640 in HCC patients [Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax)], Blood samples will be drawn.

Variable transformations will be considered as needed and Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients will be constructed as appropriate. The sample size of 39 provides a minimum of 80% power to detect a correlation of at least ± 0.44 versus a null correlation of 0., Plasma samples for sphingolipid profiling will be drawn at baseline, on Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to and 8 hours post ABC dosing, and prior to dosing on Cycle 1 Day 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1, and within 1 hour prior to the pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies.|To explore the relationship between changes in c-Myc marker levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in patients being given ABC294640, Scatterplots of percent change in target lesions versus change in marker levels will be constructed.
