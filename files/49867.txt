Efficacy of Cilostazol in Prevention of Peripheral Neuropathy
There are several mechanisms concerning pathophysiology of paclitaxel induced peripheral neuropathy. One of the main mechanisms is induction of Schwann cell dedifferentiation by paclitaxel. At the preclinical level, cilostazol potently inhibited paclitaxel-induced dedifferentiation of cultured Schwann cells, yet this positive effect have not been clinically investigated.
