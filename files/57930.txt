GEN1042 Safety Trial and Anti-tumor Activity in Participants With Malignant Solid Tumors
The goal of this trial is to learn about the antibody GEN1042 when it is used alone and when it is used together with another antibody cancer drug, pembrolizumab (with or without chemotherapy), for treatment of participants with certain types of cancer.

Dose Escalation and Safety Run-in Parts: Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Toxicities will be graded for severity according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) criteria version 5.0, First Cycle (21 days)|Dose Expansion: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) \[complete or partial response (PR or CR)\] based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 3 years
All Parts: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), From first dose until the end of the study (approximately 3 years)|Dose Escalation: ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR (PR or CR) based on RECIST version 1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 3 years|All Parts: Duration of Objective Response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the date of first progressive disease (PD) or death based on RECIST version 1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 3 years|All Parts: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST version 1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 3 years|All Parts: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from Day 1 in Cycle 1 to the first documented progression or death due to any cause based on RECIST version 1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 3 years|All Parts: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from Day 1 in Cycle 1 to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 3 years|All Parts: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of GEN1042, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 2 years)|All Parts: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of GEN1042, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 2 years)|All Parts: Half-life (tÂ½) of GEN1042, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 2 years)|All Parts: Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) Response to GEN1042, Serum samples will be screened for antibodies binding to GEN1042 and the titer of confirmed positive samples will be reported., Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to end of treatment (approximately 2 years)
This is an open-label, multicenter phase 1/2 study designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of GEN1042 administered as a monotherapy or in combination in participants with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors.

Participants will receive either GEN1042 alone, GEN1042 with pembrolizumab, or GEN1042 with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy. All participants will receive active drug; no one will receive placebo.

This trial has 2 parts. The purpose of the first part is to find out if GEN1042 is safe and to find out the best doses of GEN1042 to use. The purpose of the second part is to give GEN1042 to more participants to see how well the dose(s) of GEN1042 selected in the first part work against cancer with GEN1042 when given alone or in combination with pembrolizumab or in combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy.

Trial details include:

* The average trial duration will be about 3 years.
* The treatment duration will be up to 2 years (when GEN1042 is combined with pembrolizumab).
* The visit frequency will be weekly at first and lessening over time until visits are only once every 3 weeks.
