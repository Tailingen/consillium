Multicentric Randomised Trial for Resectable Gastric Cancer
The CRITICS-II trial aims to identify the optimal preoperative regimen in resectable gastric cancer by comparing three investigational treatment arms: chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy and subsequent chemoradiotherapy vs. chemoradiotherapy. The rationale behind this trial design is based on the following concepts:

* Preoperative treatment is associated with better patient compliance than postoperative regimens
* Preoperative treatment increases the likelihood of disease downsizing/downstaging and radical R0 resections
* Preoperative paclitaxel/carboplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy and DOC chemotherapy are effective, feasible and safe regimens
