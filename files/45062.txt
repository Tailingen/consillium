A Phase II Study of Zanubrutinib, Lenalidomide Plus R-CHOP as the First-line Treatment for Diffused Large B-cell Lymphoma
This study is a multi-center, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized phase II clinical study in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zanubrutinib, lenalidomide plus R-CHOP (ZR2-CHOP) as the first-line therapy for treatment-naive high-risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients.
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Zanubrutinib|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisone (or equivalent)
Complete response rate after six cycles of ZR2-CHOP, Complete response rate will be assessed by (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET/CT) according to 2014 Lugano Criteria., at the end of 6 cycles(each cycle is 21 days)
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) two years follow-up, PFS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of progression, relapse from CR, or death, whichever occurred first. Responses were based on 2014 Lugano Criteria., At 2 years|Overall survival (OS) two years follow-up, Overall survival was defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death. Median Overall Survival was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method., At 2 years|Circulating tumor Deoxyribonucleic Acid (ctDNA) clearance rate, ctDNA will be measured at baseline and after 2, 4, 6 cycles of ZR2-CHOP, Baseline (At initial start), at the end of 2,4 ,6 cycles(each cycle is 21 days)|Overall response rate after six cycles of ZR2-CHOP, Overall response rate will be assessed by FDG-PET/CT or CT scan according to 2014 Lugano Criteria., at the end of 6 cycles(each cycle is 21 days)|Overall response rate after two, four cycles of ZR2-CHOP, Overall response rate will be assessed by FDG-PET/CT according to 2014 Lugano Criteria., at the end of 2,4 cycles(each cycle is 21 days)|Complete response rate after two, four cycles of ZR2-CHOP, Overall response rate will be assessed by FDG-PET/CT according to 2014 Lugano Criteria., at the end of 2,4 cycles(each cycle is 21 days)|Incidence of adverse events, Toxicities will be summarized by grade and by their relationship to treatment according to CTCAE (version 5.0)., At 2 years
