Intervention Trial Evaluating Focal Therapy Using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer
The investigators aim to evaluate cancer control, genitourinary, rectal and overall health-related quality of life outcomes and effectiveness of focal therapy for localised prostate cancer using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU).
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Focal Therapy Using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound
Oncological safety, To determine the proportion of men who are free of clinically significant prostate cancer in the treated area AND are free of clinically significant prostate cancer in the untreated area 36 months after focal therapy using HIFU, 36 months|Oncological safety, To determine the proportion of men who are free of any prostate cancer in the treated area AND are free of clinically significant prostate cancer in the untreated area 36 months after focal therapy using HIFU, 36 months
Biochemical failure, To analyse the rate of biochemical recurrence by measuring PSA values following focal therapy using HIFU:

* biochemical recurrence defined according to the Phoenix Consensus OR
* by PSA velocity \>1 ng/ml/year OR PSA doubling time \</=3 years, 36 months|Sensitivity and specificity of MRI imaging, To determine the clinical validity (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, inter-observer variability) of

* multi-parametric MR-imaging to predict presence of clinically significant prostate cancer on transperineal template prostate mapping biopsies prior to focal therapy
* MR-imaging changes to predict presence of residual/recurrent clinically significant prostate cancer on biopsy, 36 months|Health care costs, To determine the costs of treatment and longitudinal morbidity associated with complications at 36 months compared to other treatments of localized prostate cancer., 36 months|Erectile function, Rate of erectile dysfunction and time to return of erectile function (measured by the IIEF-15), 36 months|Orgasmic function, Rate of loss of ejaculation and orgasm (measured by the IIEF-15), 36 months|Sexual function, Rate of pain during intercourse, 36 months|Erectile function, Number of men using phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors to maintain erectile function (measured by the IIEF-15), 36 months|Continence, Rate of urinary incontinence (pad free, leak free and padfree alone) (determined by the UCLA-EPIC urinary continence questionnaire), 36 months|Continence, Time to return of continence (pad free, leak free and padfree alone) (determined by the UCLA-EPIC urinary continence questionnaire), 36 months|Lower urinary tract symptoms, Rate of lower urinary tract symptoms (as determined by IPSS scores), 36 months|Bowel function, Rate of bowel toxicity (determined by the UCLA-EPIC Bowel questionnaire ), 36 months|Anxiety, Anxiety levels (measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer, 36 months|Quality of life, General health related quality of life (measured using FACT-P Version 4 ), 36 months|General histological outcome, To determine the histological outcomes at 6, 12 and 36 months, 36 months|Secondary intervention, Rate of secondary prostate cancer intervention (prostatectomy, radiotherapy, androgen ablation), 36 months
