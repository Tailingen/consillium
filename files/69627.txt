Study of PET Imaging With 18F-TFB in Patients With Thyroid Cancer
The goal of the study is to evaluate a new imaging test that may allows the investigators to predict the uptake of radioactive iodine by thyroid cancer faster than the current standard and that does not interfere with the uptake of radioactive iodine used for therapy.
