A Study to Compare Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab + Vinorelbine vs. Placebo + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel in Previously Untreated HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a randomized, open-label, two-arm, phase III trial in Germany to investigate whether vinorelbine-based triple combination presents a less toxic treatment option than docetaxel-based triple combination in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who have not previously received any systemic treatment in the metastatic setting.

The primary objective of the study is to compare patient-reported quality of life in the two treatment arms. Patients will be followed-up for survival until death or end of study after at least 79 deaths occured in each arm, whatever comes first.

DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Vinorelbine|DRUG: Docetaxel
Patient-reported health-related quality of life (QoL): FACT-B, Area under the curve (AUC) in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B) questionnaire subscale Trial Outcome Index-Physical/Functional/Breast (TOI-PFB) after 18 weeks (irrespective of disease or treatment situation at that time point).
