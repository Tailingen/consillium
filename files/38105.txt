Axillary Reverse Mapping for Breast Carcinomas
Distinct arm from breast axillary dissection (AD), or axillary reverse mapping (ARM), involves retrieving all breast related nodes while leaving intact the main lymphatic drainage chain of the upper limb. This represents a new surgical technique that is the focus of recent surgical interest.
Axillary Dissection
PROCEDURE: Axillary dissection for breast carcinomas
Success of the principal objectives is qualified as finding one or more radioactive node in zone D, Zone D is the area lateral to the lateral thoracic vein and extending from the second intercostobrachial nerve to the axillary vein.

If all radioactive nodes are found below the second intercostobrachial nerve (Zone C, A) or medial to the lateral thoracic vein (Zone A, B) this qualifies a failure of the main objective, 1 day
Evaluate the incidence of metastatic or micro-metastatic disease within the "SENTIBRAS " node, Evaluate the incidence of metastatic or micro-metastatic disease within, 15 days|Evaluate the correlation between clinical and histological results, Evaluate the correlation between clinical and histological results, 15 days|Evaluate the morbidity associated with Axillary Dissection., Evaluate the morbidity associated with Axillary Dissection., 1 year, 2 years and 5 years
Distinct arm from breast axillary dissection (AD), or axillary reverse mapping (ARM), involves retrieving all breast related nodes while leaving intact the main lymphatic drainage chain of the upper limb. This represents a new surgical technique that is the focus of recent surgical interest. The assumption is that the sentinel node (SN) of the upper limb is different from the SN of the breast and that it is uninvolved after metastatic involvement of the axillary nodes in relation to the breast. During the ARM procedure, it is necessary to use an injection of a lymphatic tracer into the upper limb in order to visualize the lymphatic arm drainage.The ultimate goal for ARM procedure is to reduce the rate of lymphedema in N+ patients requiring an AD.
