Dose Escalation of RMC-5552 Monotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of escalating doses of RMC-5552 monotherapy in adult participants with relapsed/refractory solid tumors and to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/1b study of RMC-5552 monotherapy in participants with advanced relapsed or refractory solid tumors. The study will include 2 components: 1) a Dose-Escalation Component for participants with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and 2) a Dose-Expansion Component for participants with relapsed or refractory solid tumors harboring certain specific mutations/rearrangements that result in hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway. Participants will be treated until disease progression per RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria for withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first.
