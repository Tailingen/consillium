Fractionated Busulfan Conditioning Regimen for Allo-HSCT in Non-remission Myeloid Malignancies
The goal of this single-arm phase II study is to test in patients with non-remission myeloid malignancies undergoing allogeneic hemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The main question it aims to answer are:

* The safety and efficacy of fractionated busulfan Combined With Chidamide/Fludarabine/Cytarabine(ChiFAB) conditioning regimen in increasing the overall survival rate in patients with non-remission myeloid malignancies after allo-HSCT.
* The efficacy of fractionated busulfan conditioning regimen in reducing the recurrence rate in patients with non-remission myeloid malignancies after allo-HSCT.

Participants will receive fractionated busulfan-based ChiFAB conditioning regimen (busulfan 3.2mg/kg d-13, -12, 1.6mg/kg d-6\~-3, fludarabine 35mg/m2 d-6\~-2, cytarabine 1g/m2,d-6\~-2, chidamide 30mg d-13,-10,-6,-3) before allo-HSCT.
