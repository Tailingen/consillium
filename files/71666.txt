Comparison of Secretin-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) to Endoscopic Pancreatic Function Test (ePFT) in Diagnosing Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency
The aim of our study is to evaluate S-MRCP, in comparison to direct pancreatic function, to measure pancreatic exocrine function in patients who have symptoms suspicious for insufficiency. We hypothesize that S-MRCP imaging parameters will correlate well with the direct pancreatic exocrine functioning.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Synthetic Human Secretin
Primary outcome: correlation between S-MRCP with ePFT, The primary outcome that we will be measuring will be correlation between duodenal filling on S-MRCP (expressed as percent of duct volume change from baseline and maximal values following secretin administration) with maximal bicarbonate concentration from ePFT., 30 days
Surgical resection offers the only hope of cure for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. While perioperative mortality rates have declined in recent years, pancreatic resection is still associated with significant postoperative malnutrition, maldigestion, and glucose intolerance, mostly as a result of pancreatic insufficiency. Quantifying individual pancreatic function remains a challenge, but is essential in improving the survival and quality of life of pancreatic cancer patients. Secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (S-MRCP) has recently emerged as a widely-accepted noninvasive technique to assess morphological changes in pancreatic ducts, as well as functional secretory capacity of the gland. The aim of our study is to evaluate S-MRCP as a means to evaluate for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. This will be a prospective study of twelve patients who have undergone pancreatic resection and who have symptoms of abdominal pain, steatorrhea or weight loss. We will be comparing quantitative parameters of S-MRCP (maximal change in pancreatic duct diameter and volume before and after secretin administration) with endoscopic pancreatic function testing (maximal bicarbonate concentration in duodenal aspirate after secretin administration).
