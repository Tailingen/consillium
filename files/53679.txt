HIPEC Combined With SOX and Sintilimab in the Treatment of Advanced Gastric Cancer With Peritoneal Metastasis
The prognosis of patients with peritoneal metastasis from gastric cancer is extremely poor. Although chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy has achieved promising efficacy in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer, patients with peritoneal metastasis benefit less from this regimen. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) represents a novel treatment option, which maintains the high concentration of drugs in the abdominal cavity, and improve the anti-tumor efficacy of chemotherapy drugs through the thermo-thermal effect. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of HIPEC and systemic chemotherapy combined with sintilimab in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with peritoneal metastasis.

DRUG: S-1, Oxaliplatin sintilimab HIPEC
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death, every 3 month postoperation up to 24 months
ORR, Objective Response Rate, every 3 month postoperation up to 24 months|DCR, disease control rate, every 3 month postoperation up to 24 months|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to diesea progression, every 3 month postoperation up to 24 months|Safety and Tolerability, Treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, every 3 month postoperation up to 24 months
To determine the efficacy and safety of HIPEC and systemic chemotherapy combined with sintilimab in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis, patients will receive SOX regimen chemotherapy combined with sintilimab, once every three weeks. In the first cycle, HIPEC will be administrated, and HIPEC or intraperitoneal chemotherapy will be administrated in the second to third cycles according to the patient's condition. Then, another 3-cycle SOX regimen of systemic chemotherapy will be administrated. After the end of 6 cycles, patients will receive maintain treatment with a combination of S-1 and sintilimab until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
