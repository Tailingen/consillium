Ripretinib in Chinese Patients With Advanced GIST: a Real World Study
to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety and predictive factors of ripetinib in Chinese patients with advanced GIST in the real world
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Ripretinib Oral Tablet
PFS, To assess the efficacy (progression-free survival \[PFS\], approximately 7 months
DCR, To assess disease control rate (DCR), approximately 6 months|OS, to assess median overall survival (mOS), approximately 12 months
Ripretinib has become the standard â‰¥ 4L treatment in advanced GIST. Given the small sample size of patients in the China bridging study of INVICTUS as well as the short marketing time of ripretinib, further exploration on the long-term efficacy and safety of ripretinib, as well as the dominant gene mutation type of ripretinib in Chinese GIST patients is required. Hence, we plan to further explore the efficacy of ripretinib, predictors of efficacy, etc. by collecting and analyzing real-world data from Chinese patients with advanced GIST recieving ripretinib.
