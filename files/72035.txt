The Value of VOCs Analysis in Exhaled Breath for Pulmonary Benign and Malignant Lesion Diagnosis
The purpose of this study is to analysis the volatile organic gases(VOCs) in exhaled breath of pulmonary lesion patients and healthy controls, in order to find the difference of composition and concentration among groups.
Lung Neoplasm|Lung Disease
Mass-to-charge Ratio, It is the measurement result of VOCs in exhaled breath using PTR-MS device., 6 months
Collect the exhaled gas in pulmonary lesion patients and healthy controls, using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry to analysis the different composition and concentration of VOCs, to find the biomarker gases of distinguishing benign and malignant lesion of lung among different groupsï¼Œ and try to build a diagnostic model for lung lesion.
