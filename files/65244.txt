FOLFOX Plus SIR-SPHERES MICROSPHERES Versus FOLFOX Alone in Patients With Liver Mets From Primary Colorectal Cancer
This study is a randomized multi-center trial that will assess the effect of adding Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT), using SIR-Spheres microspheres®, to a standard chemotherapy regimen of FOLFOX as first line therapy in patients with non-resectable liver metastases from primary colorectal adenocarcinoma.

Treatment with the biologic agent bevacizumab, if part of the standard of care at participating institutions, is allowed within this study at the discretion of the treating Investigator.

DEVICE: SIR-Spheres yttrium-90 microspheres|DRUG: Systemic chemotherapy (FOLFOX)
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at Any Site, PFS defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as an increase in the sum of the longest diameters of ≥ 20% and an absolute increase in the sum of the longest diameters of ≥ 5 mm, or the appearance of a new lesion., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Percentage of Participants With Overall Response, Tumour Response Rate per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT: Complete Response (CR) - Disappearance of all target lesions which is confirmed if determined by two observations not less than 4 weeks apart; Partial Response (PR) - \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Through study completion, up to 60 months
