Effect Of Whole Body Vibration Versus Weight Bearing Exercises On Osteoporosis In Breast Cancer Patients After Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy can damage bone marrow and therefore impair the production of white blood cells, platelets and red blood cells with the resulting anemia and osteoporosis.

Assessing the change in bone mineral density, By using DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry): Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is a clinically proven method of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) in the lumbar spine, proximal femur, forearm, and whole body. It is used primarily in the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis and other disease states characterized by abnormal BMD, as well as to monitor response to therapy for these conditions ., at baseline and after 2 months of intervention
Purposes of this study were:

1. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of the whole-body vibration (WBV) in improving osteoporosis in breast cancer patients after receiving chemotherapy within 3-6 months.
2. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of the weight bearing exercise in improving osteoporosis in breast cancer patients after receiving chemotherapy within 3-6 months.
3. To gain knowledge about the whole-body vibration (WBV) and the weight bearing exercise in improving osteoporosis in breast cancer patients after receiving chemotherapy within 3-6 months.
4. To share in designing an ideal protocol for the treatment of the osteoporosis in breast cancer patients after receiving chemotherapy within 3-6 months.
