Gut Microbiota and Metabonomics
To evaluate the correlation between gut microbiota and metabolites in Borrmann type IV gastric cancer; To find the effects of microflora and metabolites on target organs; To detect the mechanism of key flora and metabolite by in vitro and in vivo experiments; To construct models of gut microbiota and metabonomics by machine learning.
