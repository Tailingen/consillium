ABCB1/P-glycoprotein Expression as Biologic Stratification Factor for Patients With Non Metastatic Osteosarcoma
This is a phase II multicentre, uncontrolled trial including patients â‰¤ 40 years with non-metastatic extremity high-grade osteosarcoma stratified according to P-glicoprotein expression
Osteosarcoma
DRUG: Mifamurtide arm|OTHER: 3 drugs arm
Events free survival, Onset of any event. An event is the defined as disease recurrence (local or distant), death for disease or any other cause, onset of secondary tumors or the last follow-up examination, After 5 years from the time to first day of chemotherapy for all patients and from the date of surgery for the Pgp overexpression patients stratified according to tumor necrosis (Good Responders and Poor Responders).
Overall Survival, Time elapsed for the diagnosis to the death for any cause or to the last follow-up examination., After 5 years from the time to first day of chemotherapy for all patients and from the date of surgery for the Pgp overexpression patients stratified according to tumor necrosis (Good Responders and Poor Responders).
The main objective of the study is to evaluate the impact on event-free survival (EFS) of a multi-drug chemotherapy approach and mifamurtide treatment in patients with non-metastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities according to the expression of ABCB1/P-glycoprotein
