Predictive Value of Serum and Tissue Molecular Markers and Imaging Features in the Invasiveness and Prognosis of Pituitary Neuroendocrine Tumors
As the clinical manifestations of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors vary greatly, 2.7-15% of them are resistant to conventional treatments such as surgery, drug therapy and radiotherapy, and often relapse or regrow in the early postoperative period, which is invasive and has a poor prognosis. Therefore, it is important to find imaging, histological or serum molecular markers for early prediction of the invasiveness and clinical prognosis of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors. The aim of this study is to observe the changes of biomarkers and imaging features in serum or tissues of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors during the course of disease and treatment, and to explore the biomarkers and imaging features that can predict the proliferation, progression and recurrence risk of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors after medical or surgical treatment.
Pituitary Adenoma|Neuroendocrine Tumors
OTHER: diagnosed and treated reasonably according to the clinical guidelines and clinical pathways
Disease progression or recurrence after surgery, Disease'recurrence'corresponded to tumour detection at MRI and/or hormone hypersecretion in previously cured patients, while disease'progression'indicated the increase in size of post-operative tumour remnant in nonfunctioning tumours and/or relapse of hormone hypersecretion in functioning ones, up to 5 years
