If the participant is alive or the vital status is unknown, then the participant's data will be censored at the date the participant was last known to be alive., Up to 1 year and 5 months|Phase 2: Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)-negative Rate, MRD-negative rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved MRD-negative status to a threshold of 10\^-5 at any timepoint after initial dose of teclistamab and before disease progression or starting subsequent therapy., Up to 1 year and 5 months|Phase 2: Number of Participants with AEs, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product., Up to 1 year and 5 months|Phase 2: Number of Participants with AEs by Severity, Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0 with the exception of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), which will be graded according to the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) guidelines.

The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health status. EQ-5D-5L is a 5 item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating "health today" with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., Up to 1 year and 5 months|Phase 2: Change from Baseline in Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) Scale, Change from baseline in PGIS scale will be reported. The PGIS is a single item that assesses severity of the participant's health state, on a 5-point verbal rating scale (1: None, 2: Mild, 3: Moderate, 4: Severe, 5: Very Severe) at the time of completing the PRO measure.
