Comparison of The Effects of Sevoflurane, Desflurane and Total Intravenous Anaesthesia on Pulmonary Function Tests
This study will compare the effects of sevoflurane, desflurane and total intravenous anaesthesia on pulmonary function tests in patients undergoing endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery of pituitary gland. Participants will be divided into three equal groups. The first group will receive sevoflurane, second grup will receive desflurane and third grup will receive total intravenous anaesthesia. Investigators are also going to evaluate blood gas analysis.
Pituitary Adenoma
DRUG: Sevoflurane|DRUG: Desflurane|DRUG: Propofol
Change from baseline FEV1%predicted (no unit), FEV1 is measured with spirolab III colour liquid-crystal-display medical spirometer. FEV1%predicted is calculated with age, sex, height and weight input by the same equipment., Preoperative baseline, postoperative 1st hour and postoperative 24th hour
Change from baseline FVC%predicted (no unit), FVC is measured with spirolab III colour liquid-crystal-display medical spirometer. FVC%predicted is calculated with age, sex, height and weight input by the same equipment., Preoperative baseline, postoperative 1st hour and postoperative 24th hour|Change from baseline FEV1/FVC ratio (no units), FEV1/FVC ratio is calculated by spirolab III colour liquid-crystal-display medical spirometer based on age, sex, height and weight., Preoperative baseline, postoperative 1st hour and postoperative 24th hour|Change from baseline PaO2 (mmHg), PaO2 is a component of arterial blood gas analysis done with Cobas B221., Preoperative baseline, during the 1st hour of the operation, during the last hour of the operation, postoperative 1st hour and postoperative 24th hour|Change from baseline PaCO2 (mmHg), PaCO2 is a component of arterial blood gas analysis done with Cobas B221., Preoperative baseline, during the 1st hour of the operation, during the last hour of the operation, postoperative 1st hour and postoperative 24th hour|Change from baseline pH, pH is a component of arterial blood gas analysis done with Cobas B221, Preoperative baseline, during the 1st hour of the operation, during the last hour of the operation, postoperative 1st hour and postoperative 24th hour|Change from baseline SaO2 (%), SaO2 is a component of arterial blood gas analysis done with Cobas B221, Preoperative baseline, during the 1st hour of the operation, during the last hour of the operation, postoperative 1st hour and postoperative 24th hour|Change from baseline BE (mmol/L), BE is a component of arterial blood gas analysis done with Cobas B221, Preoperative baseline, during the 1st hour of the operation, during the last hour of the operation, postoperative 1st hour and postoperative 24th hour|Change from baseline HCO3 (mmol/L), HCO3 is a component of arterial blood gas analysis done with Cobas B221, Preoperative baseline, during the 1st hour of the operation, during the last hour of the operation, postoperative 1st hour and postoperative 24th hour|Change from baseline PaO2/FiO2 ratio (no units), PaO2/FiO2 ratio is calculated by investigators, Preoperative baseline, during the 1st hour of the operation, during the last hour of the operation, postoperative 1st hour and postoperative 24th hour
Investigators are going to evaluate forced expiratory volume in 1st Second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), potential of hydrogen (pH), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), base excess (BE), bicarbonate (HCO3) and partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio to compare the effects of drugs.
