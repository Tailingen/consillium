Exemestane in Treating Postmenopausal Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using exemestane may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well exemestane works in treating postmenopausal women with stage IV breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: exemestane|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method
Progression-free Survival, Estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Until disease progression of death from any cause, up to 3 years
Overall Response Rate, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Until disease progression or off treatment, assessed up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Progression-free survival at 4 months, as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Objective response rate (complete response \[CR\] and partial response \[PR\]).

II. Clinical benefit (CR, PR, and stable disease \>= 6 months).

III. Assessment of toxicity.

IV. Assessment of compliance with medication adherence.

V. Assessment of quality of life.

VI. Assessment of bone health.

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Serial measurements of serum estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate.

II. To investigate treatment resistance (e.g., expression of amphiregulin, epidermal growth factor receptor \[EGFR\]), using molecular and immunohistochemical analyses of blood and tumor samples of pre- and post- (when available) treatment tissues. Microarray analyses to quantitate the expression of specific estrogen-responsive genes (e.g. thyroid transcription factor 1 \[TTF1\] and PDZK1) will also be performed.

OUTLINE: Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.
