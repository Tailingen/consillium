Additional Mailed FIT Kits
This study aims to assess whether sending patients in a county health care system additional FIT Kits can increase the FIT Kit return rate enough to warrant the extra cost. To do this, the health system mailed a random subset of patients ages 60 to 75 a FIT Kit in November 2024 in addition to sending patients an annual FIT Kit mailing. This work analyzes the return rate of mailed FIT Kits within 60-days of the November mailing.

FIT Kit return rate, Indicator of whether a patient successfully returned a FIT Kit to the health system for processing, 60-Days
This study aims to assess whether sending patients in a county health care system additional FIT Kits can increase the FIT Kit return rate enough to warrant the extra cost. To do this, patients ages 60 to 75 due for colorectal cancer screening, who had not received a FIT Kit in the previous 3 months but had completed one sometime in the past and had an assigned primary care provider, were randomized to be sent a FIT Kit in November of 2024 or to usual care. Usual care includes an annual FIT Kit mailing. We will analyze the successful return rate of mailed FIT Kits within 60-days of the November mailing.
