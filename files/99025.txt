Study to Compare Neoadjuvant Combination of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab With Concurrent Taxane Chemotherapy or Endocrine Therapy and Quality of Life Assessment Under Adjuvant Therapy in Operable HER2+/HR+ Breast Cancer Patients
This is a prospective, phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, open-label study comparing a pre-surgical combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab with concurrent weekly paclitaxel chemotherapy or endocrine therapy given for 12 weeks with a quality of life assessment for 40 additional weeks in patients with operable HER2+/HR+ breast cancer.

Pathological complete response (pCR), 14 weeks after start of therapy treatment, tumor and lymph node biopsy is performed to reach the primary endpoint of pathological complete response (pCR) which is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (ypT0/is ypN0 in the current AJCC staging system). As secondary endpoint, also other response states will be taken into account: no invasive tumor in the complete resected breast specimen irrespective of the lymph node state following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (ypT0/is, any ypN)., 14 weeks after start of therapy treatment
Health-related quality of life using EORTC QBL-BR-23 scale, Assessment of quality of life questions during the past week or during the past 4 weeks (depending on the questions) are measured on a 4 level-scale: 1 (not at all); 2 (a little); 3 (quite a bit); 4 (very much), During the neoadjuvant treatment phase at baseline (week 1) and at week 13. In the adjuvant therapy phase, every 3 month, up to 12 months (from date of randomization) or date of drop out, whatever comes first|Health-related quality of life using EQ5D-5L scale, * questions about "self care", "usual activities", "pain /discomfort", anxiety/depression" are assessed on a 5 level-scale using tick boxes : "I have no problem"; "I have slight problems"; "I have moderate problems"; "I have severe problems" "I am unable"
* assessment of the patient health (good or bad) is measured on a scale numbered from 0 to 100 (100 means the best heath and 0 means the worst), During the neoadjuvant treatment phase at baseline (week 1) and at week 13. In the adjuvant therapy phase, every 3 month, up to 12 months (from date of randomization) or date of drop out, whatever comes first|Health-related quality of life using EORTC QLQ-C30 scale, * Assessment of quality of life questions (activities, breath, pain, sleep, appetite, vomiting, constipation, others..) are measured on a 4 level-scale: 1 (not at all); 2 (a little); 3 (quite a bit); 4 (very much)
* Assessment of Overall health and overall quality of life during the past week is measured on a 7 level-scale going from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent), During the neoadjuvant treatment phase at baseline (week 1) and at week 13. In the adjuvant therapy phase, every 3 month, up to 12 months (from date of randomization) or date of drop out, whatever comes first|Tumor size reduction by mammography, The diameters of the tumors in the breast will be measured in millimeter by mammography as part of clinical response measure. The tumor size measurement 13 weeks after start of therapy is also used to reach a secondary endpoint: near pCR, defined as tumor sized ypT1a/is, any ypN with tumor size., at screening visit and 12 weeks after start of therapy treatment|Tumor size reduction by palpation and ultrasound, The diameters of the tumors in the breast will be measured in millimeter by palpation and ultrasound as part of clinical response measure. The tumor size measurement 13 weeks after start of therapy is also used to reach a secondary endpoint: near pCR, defined as tumor sized ypT1a/is, any ypN with tumor size., at screening visit and 4, 7 and 13 weeks after start of therapy treatment|Overall survival, The overall survival is defined as time (days) between study treatment allocation and death of patient due to any cause., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Duration of invasive disease-free survival, Duration of invasive disease-free survival is defined as time (days) between study treatment allocation and relapse, secondary tumor event or death., From date of treatment allocation until the date of first documented progression or secondary tumor or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months (study duration including follow up)|Number of mastectomies, The number of mastectomies will be determined at time of surgery (week 14 and week 18), 14 weeks after start of therapy treatment|Ki67 level, The level of Ki67 in biopsie material will be measured at week 4 of neoadjuvant therapy, 4 weeks after start of therapy treatment|cDNA composition, The composition of cDNA in blood samples will be measured, at baseline, 3 weeks, 4 weeks and 6, 18, 24, 36 48 and 60 months after start of therapy treatment
