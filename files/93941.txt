Surgical Resection Combined With Intraperitoneal Hyperthermic Chemotherapy
Patients with ruptured liver cancer and bleeding after surgical resection were included according to the criteria of admission, and the patients were divided into experimental and control groups. the primary efficacy end point was RFS, and the secondary end point was the rate of abdominal implant metastases and OS.To analyze the efficacy of HIPEC.
Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy|Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Ruptured Liver
PROCEDURE: intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy
Intra-abdominal recurrence-free survival (RFS), Intra-abdominal recurrence-free survival (RFS):the time from surgical resection patients with HCC until the detection of intra-abdominal recurrence or metastasis or the end of the observation period, based on postoperative follow-up test criteria and imaging findings(2 years), the time from surgical resection in patients with HCC until the detection of intra-abdominal recurrence or metastasis or the end of the observation period(2 years)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS): time from partial hepatectomy for HCC until death from any cause or end of observation period(2 years), time from partial hepatectomy for HCC until death from any cause or end of observation period(2 years)|survival rate, defined as 1-month,3-month,6-month, 1-year,2-year survival rate, time from partial hepatectomy for HCC until death from any cause or end of observation period
Patients with ruptured liver cancer and bleeding after surgical resection were included according to the criteria of admission, and the patients were divided into groups: experimental group: surgical resection combined with intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion chemotherapy, and control group: simple surgical resection.

At further follow-up, the primary efficacy end point was time to Recurrence free survival (RFS) ,the time from the patient's treatment until the discovery of abdominal metastases or until the follow-up period, and the secondary end point was the rate of abdominal implant metastases, that is, according to the postoperative follow-up test and imaging findings, the incidence of abdominal implantation and metastasis, until the end of abdominal recurrence or metastasis or observation period. Overall Survival OS and survival rate: the time from the time the patient underwent partial hepatectomy until death from tumor causes or the end of the observation period. To analyze the efficacy of HIPEC.
