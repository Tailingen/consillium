Circulating Cancer Cells/Macrophage HYbrid Cells in Patients With Breast Cancer.
Pilot, prospective, monocentric study aimed at evaluating the rate of patients with circulating cancer cell/macrophage hybrid cells in the peripheral blood.

The study will be conducted on a population of patients with breast cancer (regardless of stage of the disease and the immunohistochemical subtype).

For each included patient, blood samples will be taken and tumor specimens will be collected for the study.

At the end of the blood collection, the patient will have completed his participation in the study.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Patients with breast cancer (stage I, II III or IV)
Rate of patients with cancer cell / macrophage hybrid cells in peripheral blood defined as the ratio of the number of patients with hybrid cells to the total number of patients., 20 months after the study start
Quantification of circulating hybrid cells in peripheral blood by automatic measurement (Cell Counter Corning) and expressed in number of cells / millilitre of blood., 20 months after the study start|Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from the date of inclusion to the date of progression or death from any cause., 20 months after the study start
