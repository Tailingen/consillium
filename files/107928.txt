Pembrolizumab And Stereotactic Radiosurgery (Srs) Of Selected Brain Metastases In Breast Cancer Patients
Patients with metastatic breast cancer with at least 2 brain metastases will receive pembrolizumab every 3 weeks. Patients will undergo stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to one of the brain lesions. Pembrolizumab infusion will be given on Day 4 (+/-1) after SRS treatment at the standard dose of 200mg IV over 30 minutes and repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Metastatic Breast Cancer|Brain Metastases
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Tumor response for non-irradiated brain lesions at 8 weeks according to RECIST1.1, detect abscopal responses in non-irradiated brain metastases, followed at routine post SRS brain MRI (evaluated at 8 weeks post-treatment, +/- one week) according to Response Evaluation criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1), 8 weeks|Correlation of abscopal responses with the radiation dose received, Correlate potential abscopal responses with their radiation dose exposure, 1 year|Overall survival - assessed from the start of study drug until death in non-irradiation metastases in the rest of the body by routine imaging., detect systemic objective responses in non-irradiated metastases in the rest of the body, by routine imaging, 3 years
Number of participants with abscopal response will be assessed., Evaluation of an abscopal effect elsewhere in the body. This will be assessed by serial CT based imaging performed every 3 months., up to 12 weeks
Patients with metastatic breast cancer with at least 2 brain metastases, eligible to receive SRS. Patients will complete radiation therapy within 1 week and Pembrolizumab may be continued every 3 weeks until evidence of brain progression or serious adverse toxicity. Patients will be followed until death.

Pembrolizumab infusion will be given on Day 4 (+/-1) after SRS treatment at the standard dose of 200mg IV over 30 minutes and repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
