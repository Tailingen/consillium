T1/2 determination helps in understanding the duration for which ANF-RHO or Neulasta would be active upon administration., ~ 128 ± 2 days|Pharmacokinetic profile of ANF-RHO and Neulasta - Area Under the Curve (AUC[0-t]), AUC\[0-t\] is an important parameter for determining as to how much of the drug is available in the body after administration of a drug formulation, in this case ANF-RHO vs Neulasta. Understanding the AUC for both these drug formulations will help us to determine the efficacy and safety profiles of these medicines., ~ 128 ± 2 days|Pharmacokinetic profile of ANF-RHO and Neulasta - Area Under the Curve (AUC[0-∞]), Similar to AUC\[0-t\] which is estimated till time 't', in AUC\[0-∞\], the estimation is done on the concentration of the drug to an infinite time. Calculation of the AUC\[0-∞\], helps understand how much of the drug is available in the body at extremely low concentrations, beyond the limits of measurable concentrations., ~ 128 ± 2 days|Pharmacokinetic profile of ANF-RHO and Neulasta - Area Under the Curve (AUC[0-t]/AUC[0-∞]), The parameter AUC\[0-t\]/AUC\[0-∞\] is useful to calculate the fraction of the Total AUC that was added due to the extrapolated AUC (AUC\[0-∞\]). It helps understand if the methods employed for determining the total AUC and drug's availability in the body are correct., ~ 128 ± 2 days|Incidence of anti-drug antibodies to ANF-RHO and Neulasta, ~ 128 ± 2 days
Forty Eight (48) adult female, chemotherapy treatment-naïve, stage I to III, breast cancer patients scheduled to receive FEC100 (3 cycles)/docetaxel (3 cycles) myelosuppressive chemotherapy will be enrolled into the study after they meet all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Four (4) Cohorts of 12 patients each will be studied; they will be randomized either in the ANF-RHO™ treatment arm at different doses (10 μg/kg, 20 μg/kg, or 30 μg/kg, for the cohorts 1-3, respectively) or Neulasta® (6 mg / 0.6 ml SC injection, for cohort 4). For the cohorts 1-3, 12 patients from each of the respective ANF-RHO™ cohorts will be randomized with four patients from cohort 4 (Neulasta®). Patients in the ANF-RHO™ cohorts will receive study drug on Day 1 of each Chemotherapy cycle. Patients in the Neulasta® cohort will receive study drug on Day 2 of each Chemotherapy cycle. Doses of ANF-RHO™/Neulasta® will be provided for a total of 6 cycles (21 days each). The total duration of the study 129 ± 2 days (126 Days of treatment period followed by end of study visit)
