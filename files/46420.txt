Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of a Combination of Favezelimab (MK-4280) and Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Hematologic Malignancies (MK-4280-003)
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of favezelimab (MK-4280) in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475) using a non-randomized study design in participants with the following hematological malignancies:

* classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL)
* diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
* indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL)

This study will also evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab or favezelimab administered as monotherapy in participants with cHL using a 1:1 randomized study design.

The study will have 2 phases: a safety lead-in and an efficacy expansion phase. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined in the safety lead-in phase by evaluating dose-limiting toxicities.

There is no primary hypothesis for this study.

Percentage of Participants Experiencing a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT will be defined as any drug-related adverse event (AE) observed during the DLT evaluation period (Cycle 1) that results in a change to a given dose or a delay in initiating the next cycle and reported as the percentage of participants experiencing a DLT defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology for Adverse Events version 4.0., Cycle 1 (up to 21 days)|Percentage of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), Percentage of participants experiencing an AE defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study treatment, From time of signing informed consent form (ICF) until the end of follow-up (up to approximately 27 months)|Percentage of Participants with Treatment Discontinuations Due to an AE, Percentage of participants discontinuing study treatment due to an AE, From time of signing informed consent form (ICF) until the end of study treatment (up to approximately 24 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response or a Partial Response per lymphoma disease response criteria (Cheson et. al., 2007) as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 24 months
Per protocol amendment 7, the secondary serum concentration endpoints were removed and will not be reported.
