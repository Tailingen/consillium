NP137 Clinical and Biological Activities Assessment in Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors Treated by Standard Anti PD-1/PD-L1 Immunotherapies
This study is a multicenter, open-label, proof-of-concept study aiming to assess the clinical and biological impact of NP137 when added to standard PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy in 3 independent cohorts of advanced or metastatic solid tumors with various sensitivity to anti-PD-1/PD-L1:

* Cohort 1 \[Stable Disease\]: Patients with a radiological documentation of SD according to RECIST V1.1 criteria following at least 12 weeks under standard anti PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Note: This treatment arm closed on 27/09/2024 due to non-feasibility.
* Cohort 2 \[primary refractory\]: Patients with documented radiological PD or short-term SD (\< 6months) according to RECIST V1.1 but with clinical benefit under PD-1/PD-L1 standard therapy.
* Cohort 3 \[secondary refractory\]: Patients with documented radiological PD following an initial Objective Response or long-term SD (i.e. â‰¥6 months) according to RECIST V1.1, with clinical benefit under standard PD-1/PD-L1.

DRUG: NP137|DRUG: anti-PD-1/PD-L1
Objective Response Rate (ORR-12W), Cohort 1 (SD): rate of patients with CR or PR according to RECIST V1.1 after the first 12 weeks of the NP137 as add on therapy., 12 weeks|Progression Free Rate at 12 weeks (PFR-12W), Cohort 2 \& 3 (primary and secondary refractory refractory): defined as the proportion of patients without documented disease progression according to RECIST V1.1 or documented clinical disease progression after the first 12 weeks of the NP137 as add on therapy., 12 weeks
Objective Response Rate (ORR-12W), Cohort 2 \& 3: defined as the rate of patients with CR or PR according to RECIST V1.1 after the first 12 weeks of the NP137 as add on therapy, 12 weeks|Time to objective response (ToR), All cohorts: defined as the time from C1D1 to the first documented and confirmed objective response as per RECIST V1.1, Every 12 weeks, up to 52 weeks|Duration of Response (DoR), All cohorts: defined as the time interval from the date of first occurrence of a documented objective response (CR or PR, whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that disease progression or death is documented, whichever occurs first. DOR will be assessed in patients who had an objective response. Patients who have not progressed and who have not died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment. If no tumor assessments were performed after the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR or PR, DOR will be censored at the date of the first occurrence of a documented CR or PR plus 1 day. DoR will be analysed using central read tumor assessments, Every 12 weeks, up to 52 weeks|Safety profile, any AEs graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V5.0., from the date of first intake of study drug until 90 days after study drug discontinuation or at time of initiation of a new anti-cancer treatment
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) score evolution under treatment, Measurement of the EMT score under treatment on pre and on- treatment tumor biopsies, before first adminitration of NP137, then after 6 weeks of treatment and in case of relapse|Modulation of the tumoral microenvironment, Evolution of tumor immune cells by multi-IF under treatment on pre and on-treatment tumor biopsies, before first adminitration of NP137, then after 6 weeks of treatment and in case of relapse|Netrin-1 and UNC5B expression, Netrin-1 and UNC5B expression by IHC on pre and on-treatment tumor biopsies and correlation between the variation of the Netrin-1/ UNC5B expression and the clinical response., before first adminitration of NP137, then, after 6 weeks of treatment and in case of relapse|Gene expression and gene signature (RNAseq), Gene expression and gene signature (RNAseq) on pre and on-treatment tumor biopsies, before first adminitration of NP137, then, after 6 weeks of treatment and in case of relapse
To be eligible to cohort 1 \[stable disease\], the initial evidence of SD is to be confirmed by a second assessment, no less than 4 weeks from the date of the first documented SD. To be eligible to cohorts 2 and 3 \[primary and secondary refractory patients\], patients must meet all the following criteria:

* Evidence of clinical benefit according to investigator assessment. The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the patient is clinically deteriorating and unlikely to receive any benefit from continued anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment.
* Absence of symptoms and signs (including laboratory values, such as new or worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease,
* Absence of decline in ECOG PS that can be attributed to disease progression,
* Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that cannot be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions.
* No ongoing clinically significant AE related to anti-PD-1/PD-L1.

During this study:

* All patients will receive NP137 (14 mg/kg, IV, Q3W) as add-on treatment to their standard anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 treatment administered.
* To facilitate the study treatments administration and to not over burden patients, the study drug NP137 which is administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) will be associated to standard PD-1/PD-L1 therapies for which dosing are administered every 3 weeks or every 6 weeks (Q3W or Q6W). A treatment delay of up to 3 days is allowed before the start of a new cycle.
