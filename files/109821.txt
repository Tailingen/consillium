The Study of Anti-CD19 CAR NK Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
A single arm, open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness of anti-CD19 CAR NK cells in patients with B-cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma. 9-12 patients are planned to be enrolled in the dose-escalation trial (6×10\^8 cells, 1×10\^9 cells, 1.5×10\^9 cells). The primary endpoints are DLT, MTD. The secondary endpoints are the overall response rates (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR).
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: anti-CD19 CAR NK cells
Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLTs), To characterize the safety, tolerability, and determine the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Anti-CD19 CAR NK Cells for Relapsed/Refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma., within 4 weeks after infusion|Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), To characterize the safety of Anti-CD19 CAR NK Cells for Relapsed/Refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma, up to 48 weeks after infusion
The overall response rate (ORR), To characterize the efficacy of Anti-CD19 CAR NK Cell Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after infusion|Disease control rate (DCR), To characterize the efficacy of Anti-CD19 CAR NK Cell Therapy for R/R Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma., 1, 3, 6, 12 and 12 months after infusion
