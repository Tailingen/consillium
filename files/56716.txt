Short-term Pre-OPerative Durvalumab (MEDI 4736) in Early Small Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients (POP-Durva)
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative Durvalumab in patients with early small (cT1N0) triple negative breast cancer tumors. This study will recruit patients with early HR-negative breast cancer all invasive types (ER \< 10%, PR \< 10%, HER2 negative) and TILs \>=5%, eligible for a short-term treatment with Durvalumab. A total of 200 patients are planned to be enrolled in the study and which will receive 2 administrations of durvalumab 10mg/kg.

After study treatment, patients:

* In whom surgery is the first standard treatment strategy (i.e. after study treatment) no biopsy is required at the end-of-treatment visit.
* In whom neo adjuvant therapy is the first standard treatment strategy (i.e. after study treatment) a breast ultrasound guided biopsy is mandatory at the EoT visit. If the biopsy-proven residual disease is demonstrated, patients will have the option to receive standard neoadjuvant therapy at the discretion of the treating investigator. Those with a complete response may proceed directly to surgery.
Early Small (cT1N0) Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Durvalumab
pCR rate after 2 administrations of durvalumab, Defined as the absence of invasive disease in the breast and negative axillary nodes (ypT0/yTis ypN0), Assessed at Day 29 (for patients performing surgery) or at Day 22 (for patients starting neoadjuvant systemic treatment)
Evaluation of objective response rate (ORR), To assess if 2 administrations of durvalumab are associated with decreased tumor size as determined by the RECIST1.1, After 2 administrations of durvalumab|Severity of adverse events, as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, From baseline to 30 days after last administration of durvalumab|Incidence of adverse events, as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, From baseline to 30 days after last administration of durvalumab|Nature of adverse events, as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, From baseline to 30 days after last administration of durvalumab
