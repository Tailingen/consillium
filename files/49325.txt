Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Immunotherapy With Axitinib in Advanced Collecting Duct Carcinoma
This is a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with axitinib for previously treated advanced collecting duct carcinoma.
Collecting Duct Carcinoma
DRUG: PD-(L)1 inhibitor|DRUG: Axitinib
ORR assessed by investigators per RECIST 1.1, The treatment effect of with ICI plus axitinib will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 to determine tumor response., Up to approximately 2 years
PFS assessed by investigators per RECIST 1.1, The treatment effect of with ICI plus axitinib will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 to determine tumor response., Up to approximately 2 years
Patients meeting specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in two stages, 8 patients in stage 1 and 22 patients in stage 2. Stage 2 will enroll if 1 or more patients exhibit a response at week 9 or later in stage 1 in the study. All enrolled patients will be treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with axitinib until disease progression. Efficacy will be assessed by tumor measurements using CT and MRI (when indicated) scans and physical exam at baseline, and scans and physical exam of all disease-involved areas every 9 weeks until progression. Safety will be assessed by periodic physical exams, clinical laboratory studies, and adverse events. All patients will have a follow-up visit 90 days following last study drug treatment.
