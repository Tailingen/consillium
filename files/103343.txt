Cisplatin and S-1 With or Without Nimotuzumab in Untreated Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma
In this open-label, single-center, small sample size, randomised, parallel-group, controlled study, the investigators aim to assess efficacy and safety of addition of nimotuzumab to CS chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced gastric adenocarcinoma. Sixty-two patients are required and randomly assigned (1:1) to each group.

The control regimen (CS chemotherapy) is recommended as the standard first-line regimen for advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction in japan.
