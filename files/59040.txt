Study of Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy Versus Treatment of Physician's Choice in Patients With Previously Untreated Locally Advanced Inoperable or Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) between sacituzumab govitecan-hziy (SG) versus treatment of physician's choice (TPC) in participants with previously untreated, locally advanced, inoperable or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer whose tumors do not express programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) or in participants previously treated with anti-programmed cell death (ligand or protein) 1 (Anti-PD-(L)1) Agents in the early setting whose tumors do express PD-L1.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer|PD-L1 Negative
DRUG: Sacituzumab Govitecan-hziy|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objective progressive disease (PD), or death (whichever comes first)., Randomization up to approximately 57 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause., Randomization up to approximately 57 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by BICR per RECIST Version 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that is confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response., Randomization up to approximately 57 months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by BICR per RECIST Version 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive PD or death from any cause (whichever comes first)., Randomization up to approximately 57 months|Time to Response (TTR) as Assessed by BICR per RECIST Version 1.1, TTR is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first documentation of CR or PR., Randomization up to approximately 57 months|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), First dose date up to approximately 57 months plus 30 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities, First dose date up to approximately 57 months plus 30 days|Change from Baseline in the Physical Functioning Domain as Measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Core Questionnaire, Version 3.0 (EORTC QLQ-C30)., The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients, it is composed of 30 questions (items) to assess 15 scales; 1 global health status/quality of life (QOL), 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), and 9 symptom/item scales(fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of function, a high score for the global health status/QOL represents a high QOL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems., Randomization up to approximately 57 months|Time to Deterioration (TTD) of Fatigue Scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30, TTD is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of assessment at which a patient experienced a deterioration (â‰¥ 10 points deterioration from baseline in the fatigue scale) or death., Randomization up to approximately 57 months
