A Study of Intratumoral Injection of Interleukin-2 and Ipilimumab in Patients With Unresectable Stages III-IV Melanoma
This is a single center, open phase I dose escalation study. This study will assess the highest tolerable intratumoral dose of ipilimumab (Yervoy) in combination with IL-2 (Proleukin) in patients with unresectable stages III-IV melanoma with accessible cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or nodal lesions. The objective is to primarily assess the safety of the drug combination, and to secondarily obtain preliminary data on the clinical efficacy of the combination.
