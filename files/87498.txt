A Study to Test How Well Different Doses of Obrixtamig (BI 764532) in Combination With Ezabenlimab Are Tolerated by People With Small Cell Lung Cancer and Other Neuroendocrine Tumours That Are Positive for DLL3
This study is open to adults with small cell lung cancer and other neuroendocrine tumours that are positive for the tumour marker Delta-like 3 (DLL3). The study is in people with advanced cancer for whom previous treatment was not successful or no standard treatment exists.

The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of obrixtamig that people can tolerate when taken together with another medicine called ezabenlimab. Obrixtamig and ezabenlimab may help the immune system fight cancer. Participants get obrixtamig and ezabenlimab as infusions into a vein.

If there is benefit for the participants and if they can tolerate it, the treatment is given for a maximum of 3 years. During this time, participants visit the study site about every week. The visits also depend on the response to the treatment. At the study visits, the doctors check the health of the participants, take necessary laboratory tests, and note any health problems that could have been caused by the study treatment.
