Combination Chemotherapy Plus Trastuzumab in Treating Patients With Advanced, Recurrent, or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying combination chemotherapy plus trastuzumab to see how well it works in treating patients with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: trastuzumab|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: leucovorin calcium|DRUG: oxaliplatin
Response rate, Every 2 tx cycles|Time to progression, Every 2 tx cycles|Overall toxicity, Each cycle during tx
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate of patients who overexpress HER-2/neu with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma who have progressed on at least 1 prior, but no more than 2 prior, chemotherapy regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and trastuzumab (Herceptin).
* Determine the time to progression of these patients treated with this regimen.
* Determine the overall toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15, and then followed by leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Fluorouracil IV is administered at the midpoint of the leucovorin calcium infusion on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-45 patients will be accrued for this study.
