A Study of JNJ-64264681 in Participants With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
The purpose of the study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D\[s\]) in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in Part 1 and to evaluate the safety of JNJ-64264681 at the RP2D(s) in Part 2.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin|Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell
DRUG: JNJ-64264681
Part 1: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The DLTs are based on drug related adverse events and defined as any of the following events: hematological or non-hematological toxicity of grade 3 or higher (as specified in protocol)., Up to 21 days|Part 1 and Part 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., Up to 2 years
Plasma Concentration of JNJ-64264681, Plasma concentration of JNJ-64264681 will be evaluated., Up to 2 years|Percentage Occupancy of the Target, The pharmacodynamics of JNJ-64264681 will be assessed by determining the percentage of target occupancy. Blood samples will be obtained for pharmacodynamic assessments (target occupancy)., Up to 2 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) or better according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) Response Criteria and International Workshop for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (IWWM) Response Criteria., Up to 2 years|Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined for participants who achieved PR or CR as the time from the first dose of study drug to first response of PR or CR according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and iwCLL Response Criteria and IWWM Response Criteria., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined for participants who achieved PR or CR as the time between the date of initial documentation of PR or CR to the date of either the first documented evidence of disease progression or death according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and iwCLL Response Criteria and IWWM Response Criteria., Up to 2 years|Complete Response (CR) Rate, CR rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve a best response of CR according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and iwCLL Response Criteria and IWWM Response Criteria., Up to 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of the study drug to the date of either the first documented disease progression (according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and iwCLL Response Criteria and IWWM Response Criteria), or death due to any cause., Up to 2 years
The purpose of the study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D\[s\]) in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in Part 1 and to evaluate the safety of JNJ-64264681 at the RP2D(s) in Part 2.
