Trial of TRC105 and Pazopanib Versus Pazopanib Alone in Patients With Advanced Angiosarcoma
This is a study of TRC105 in combination with standard dose pazopanib compared to single agent pazopanib in patients with angiosarcoma not amenable to curative intent surgery (e.g., metastatic or bulky disease, and disease for which surgical resection would carry an unacceptable risk to the patient) who have not received pazopanib or TRC105 previously.

Progression Free Survival of Patients With Unresectable Angiosarcoma, Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Progression free survival is defined as time from randomization to either first disease progression (per independent radiology review of images by RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause., from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to cut off date of interim analysis (25 months)
Objective Response Rate of Patients With Unresectable Angiosarcoma, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions: Complete Response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR) is \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR. Overall response rate is defined as the number of patients with a best response designation of complete response or partial response recorded between the date of randomization and the date of documented progression., from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to cut off date of interim analysis (25 months)|Overall Survival of Patients With Unresectable Angiosarcoma, Overall survival is the number of death events at 25 months, including all on-study and off-study deaths (past post-treatment 28-day follow up visit), from beginning of study to cut off date of interim analysis (25 months)|To Characterize Patient Reported Outcomes Between the Two Arms of the Study, Patient reported outcomes as measured by the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). The EORTC QLQ-C30 health scale is on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being poor health and 7 being excellent health. The EQ-5D-5L scale is on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst health one can imagine, and 100 being the best health one can imagine., Screening and 9 weeks (Cycle 3 Day 1)
TRC105 (carotuximab) is a monoclonal antibody to endoglin (CD105), an essential angiogenic target highly expressed on tumor vessels that is distinct from VEGFR. Endoglin is also expressed directly on tumor cells in angiosarcoma and is upregulated following VEGF inhibition. TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models and complements the activity of bevacizumab and multi-kinase inhibitors that target the VEGFR.

Pazopanib is an oral inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression.

By targeting a non-VEGF pathway that is upregulated following VEGF inhibition, TRC105 has the potential to complement VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and could represent a major advance in the treatment of angiosarcoma. Together, the use of TRC105 with pazopanib may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy over that seen with pazopanib alone.
