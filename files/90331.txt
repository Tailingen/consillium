DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Zinc
Quality of life scores, Quality of life (QOL) will be evaluated through patient subjective responses to the QOL survey., Up to 4 months after study start
Serum zinc level, Zinc levels will be monitored monthly with blood tests. Low zinc will be defined as under 60 mcg., Up to 4 months after study start|Serum albumin level, Albumin levels will be monitored monthly with blood tests. Low albumin will be defined as under 3.5 gm/dl., Up to 4 months after study start
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Assess the effects on quality of life (QOL) when supplementing zinc in upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients while they are receiving chemotherapy.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Correlate hypoalbuminemia with serum zinc deficiency.

II. Correlate zinc deficiency with neutropenia.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

GROUP I: Patients receive zinc orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) for months 1 and 2 only of the first 4 months on therapy.

GROUP II: Patients receive zinc orally (PO) TID for months 3 and 4 only of the first 4 months on therapy.
