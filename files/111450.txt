Irreversible Electroporation + Nivolumab for Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
The trial investigates the safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation in combination with checkpoint inhibition in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
Pancreas Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|DEVICE: Irreversible electroporation (IRE)
Incidence of treatment related adverse events [Safety and Tolerability], Determined by the incidence and severity of treatment related adverse events according to CTCAE version 4.0, 6 months after start of treatment
Tumor response by CT, Based on CT chest/abdomen scans according to RECIST version 1.1, Baseline compared to 3 and 6 months after start of treatment|Tumor response by ultrasound, Based on contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) utilizing the standardized and quantitative method Dynamic CEUS (DCEUS), Baseline compared to 3 and 6 months after start of treatment|Progression free survival, In terms of months, From start of treatment until unequivocal disease progression, assessed up to 5 years|Overall survival, In terms of months, From start of treatment until unequivocal disease progression, assessed up to 5 years|Quality of life using EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-C30, Baseline compared to 14 days, 3 and 6 months after start of treatment
The trial is designed as an investigator initiated prospective phase 2 study in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (PC) to determine the efficacy and safety of checkpoint inhibition administered concurrently with irreversible electroporation.

A recently published preclinical study by Zhao et al. (2019) showed that the combination of IRE and PD-1-inhibitor suppressed the tumour growth and increased the survival of mice bearing pancreatic cancer.

The aim of the trial is to initiate an abscopal response, leveraging the patient's immune system in eliciting a sufficient immune response.
