Gemcitabine and Hodgkin's Disease Chemotherapy Followed by Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Rescue for Hodgkin's Disease
This is a phase 2 study of gemcitabine + high-dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) rescue for Hodgkin's Disease
Hodgkin Disease|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Lymphoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Vinorelbine|DRUG: Carmustine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|PROCEDURE: Autologous HCT
Dose-limiting Toxicity of Gemcitabine Due to Non-hematologic Toxicity, Reported as the number of Phase 1 participants by gemcitabine dose that experienced non-hematologic toxicity, ie, drug-related adverse events., 6 months
Pulmonary Toxicity (BCNU Pneumonitis), Pulmonary toxicity as assessed by the number of participants that experience BCNU pneumonitis, ie, pneumonitis due to carmustine (BCNU)., 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Reports the percentage of participants surviving 6 months after PBSC infusion (transplant)., 2 years|Relapse Post-transplant, Reports the percentage of participants that experienced relapse post-transplant., 2 years|Survival Measures, Reports the survival measures:

* Freedom from progression (FFP)
* Event-free survival (EFS)
* Overall survival (OS)

EFS and OS were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method

Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 2 years
To assess the non-hematologic toxicity and determine the phase 2 dose of gemcitabine in combination with vinorelbine followed by carmustine, etoposide and cyclophosphamide and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation \[aka peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)\].
