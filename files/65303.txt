Pilot Study of Epoetin Alfa for Patients Having Abdominal or Pelvic Surgery for Cancer
This pilot study is looking at how well epoetin alfa, given in the immediate post-operative period, works in reducing anemia and the need for transfusions.
Anemia
DRUG: Epoetin Alfa group|OTHER: Placebo group
Post-operative hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and immature reticulocyte fraction measured on post-operative days 1, 4, 8, and between days 20 and 30, 1,4,8 and between 20 and 30 days post op
Post-operative quality of life related to anemia measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anemia (FACT-An) between post-operative day 20 and 30 and post-operative transfusion requirement, between 20 and 30 days postop
This is a pilot, single center, prospective, double blinded, randomized study comparing epoetin alfa versus placebo. Eligible patients will just have undergone a major abdominal operation for malignancy (esophagectomy, gastrectomy, partial hepatectomy, partial pancreatectomy, or low anterior resection of rectum) and have a post-operative hemoglobin greater than 8 g/dL and less than 11 g/dL on post-operative day #1. On post-operative day #1 patients enrolled in the study will be randomized to receive either 40,000 units of epoetin alfa or placebo. On post-operative day #8, the patients will receive an additional dose of epoetin alfa or placebo (depending on randomization assignment and Hgb level). Hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and immature reticulocyte count will be measured on days 1, 4, 8, and once between post-operative days 20 and 30. Pre-operatively and between post-operative days 20 and 30 patients will complete a quality of live assessment tool (FACT-An) to assess their fatigue related to anemia.
