Phase 2 Study of Tanezumab in Subjects With Moderate to Severe Pain Due to Schwannomatosis
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the administration of tanezumab, an anti-nerve growth factor (NGF) antibody, improves pain relief in schwannomatosis patients receiving background non-NSAID therapy.

Schwannomatosis is characterized by the predisposition to develop multiple schwannomas and, less commonly, meningiomas. Pain is the most frequent symptom reported by these patients, with 68% experiencing chronic pain.

The investigators propose to test the efficacy and tolerability of tanezumab as a treatment for schwannomatosis patients with chronic pain who have had inadequate pain relief in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which could form the basis of a larger, randomized controlled trial in the future.

The study is designed with a total duration of 281 days (40 weeks) and will consist of four periods: Pre-treatment, Double-Blind Treatment, Single Arm Treatment, and 24-Week Safety Follow-up. The Pre-Treatment Period lasting up to 30 days, followed by a Double-Blind Treatment Period lasting up to 8 weeks, followed by a Single Arm Treatment Period lasting up to 8 weeks, and a 24-Week Safety Follow-Up Period ending with the End of Study Visit at Week 40.
