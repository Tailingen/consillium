Tosedostat With Capecitabine in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
There are two parts to this study: the goal of the first part of the study is to find the best dose of tosedostat when given in combination with capecitabine. The goal of the second part of the study is to look at how participants respond to treatment with tosedostat and capecitabine.
Pancreatic Cancer|Cancer of Pancreas|Cancer of the Pancreas|Pancreas Cancer
DRUG: Tosedostat|DRUG: Capecitabine|PROCEDURE: Fresh tissue biopsy
Phase I Only: Recommended Phase II Dose of Tosedostat, The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle. If 0 or 1 of 6 patients in Dose Level 1 experience DLT during the first cycle, Dose Level 1 will be presumed to be the RP2D.

DLTs are followed through completion of the first cycle., Completion of cycle 1 of all participants in Phase I portion of study (approximately 14 months)|Phase I Only: Number of Participants Who Experience Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), * Possibly/probably/definitely related to study treatment in 1st cycle (cyc)

  \*Grade (Gr) 4 neutropenia \>7 day, Febrile neutropenia of any duration with temperature ≥ 38.5 °C, Gr 4 anemia requires transfusion therapy on more than 2 occasions in 7 days, Gr 4 thrombocytopenia
* Possibly/probably/definitely related gr. 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity that occurs 1st cyc with the following EXCEPTIONS:

  * Gr 3 nausea/vomiting/diarrhea/anorexia \<72 hours that returns to Gr 1 prior to the start of cyc 2, Gr 3 hand-foot syndrome will only be considered a DLT for patients who have received 1 week of supportive care treatment with no improvement, Gr 3 fatigue that returns to Gr 1 prior to the start of cyc 2, Gr 3 flu-like symptoms \<72 hours that returns to Gr 1 prior to start of cyc 2, Gr 3 arthralgia or myalgias \<72 hours that return to Gr 1 prior to the start of cyc 2, Gr 3 potassium/phosphorus/magnesium that is asymptomatic or of non-clinical significance \<72 hours, Gr 3 hypoalbuminemia, Completion of cycle 1 of all participants in Phase I portion of study (approximately 14 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate, * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive disease (PD)

  * Target lesions: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).
  * Non target lesions: Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase., 3 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), * ORR = Complete response + partial response
* Target lesions

  * Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
  * Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Non target lesions \*Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis)., Up to 18 months|Time-to-progression (TTP), -Progressive disease (PD)

* Target lesions: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).
* Non target lesions: Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase, Up to 24 months|Overall Survival Rate (OS), Up to 1 year from completion of treatment (median treatment length 81.50 days (28.00-346.00)|Number of Participants With a CA19-9 Response, * CA19-9 is a tumor marker that is used in the management of pancreatic cancer. Rising CA19-9 levels may mean the tumor is growing and decreasing CA19-9 levels may mean the tumor is shrinking or the amount of cancer in the body is decreasing
* A CA19-9 response means that the tumor marker has decreased over baseline (before treatment started) levels, Completion of treatment (median treatment length 81.50 days (28.00-346.00)
