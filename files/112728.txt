68Ga-FAPI-FS PET/CT and PET/MR in Pancreatic Cancer
This is a preliminary study of 68Ga-FAPI-FS PET/CT or PET/MR in patients with confirmed or suspicious pancreatic cancer. The goal is to determine the safety, biodistribution, and tumor uptake of 68Ga-FAPI-FS.

This is a preliminary phase 0 study in patients with confirmed or suspicious pancreatic cancer. Each patient will receive one dose of 68Ga-FAPI-FS by intravenous route. Dedicated whole-body PET/CT imaging will be performed. A comparative 18F-FDG PET/CT will also be performed within a week.
