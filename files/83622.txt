Study of Perioperative Chemotherapy Combined With Tislelizumab and Trastuzumab in the Treatment of GC/EGC
Perioperative chemotherapy improves overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) compared with surgery alone in patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GEJA). The addition of tislelizumab and trastuzumab to chemotherapy improves outcomes in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer (GC), and the investigators aimed to explore its role in the perioperative setting.
Stomach Cancer
DRUG: Tirelizumab|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: S1|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Percentage of Participants With Pathological Complete Response (pCR), pCR was defined as an absence of any invasive cancer cell of the primary tumor after the time of major neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with or without surgery., 2 years
Percentage of Participants With Complete Tumor Resection (R0), R0 resection was defined as having performed a complete resection of the tumor with adequate tumor-free margins and regional lymph node extirpation., 75 days|Percentage of Participants With Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS was the time elapsed from the time of surgery (for complete resection \[R0\] participants) until the date on which progression or death from any cause was documented (whichever occured first). Progression was defined as target lesions greater than (\>) 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD) taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the treatment started (nadir) and minimum 5 millimeter (mm) increase over the nadir. When the sum becomes very small, increases within the measurement error (2-3 mm) can lead to a 20% increase. Participants who did not present progression and who had not died were censored on the last date on which it was known that there was no progression (last response assessment)., 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the final analysis were censored at the date of the last follow-up. OS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and median OS (95% CI) in months was reported for PD-L1 positive participants by treatment group., 2 years|Percentage of All Participants That Discontinued Study Treatment Due to AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE. The percentage of participants that discontinued study treatment due to an AE was reported for all participants by treatment group., 2 years
This study will evaluate the pathologic complete response rate of a perioperative chemotherapy combined with tislelizumab and Trastuzumab in patients with resectable gastric cancer. Prior to surgery to resect the tumor, tislelizumab (intravenously, 200 mg on day 1 of every cycle) and trastuzumab (intravenously, 8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg on days 1 of every cycle) will be administered for four cycles and the perioperative chemotherapy contains docetaxel (intravenously, 50 mg/m2 on day 1 of every cycle) and S1 (orally, 400mg/m2 BID on day 1\~14 of every cycle) and Oxaliplatin(intravenously, 100 mg /m2 on day 1 of every cycle) will be administered for three cycles prior to surgery.If complete resection, R0 or microscopic residual tumor R1 is achieved, patients will continue with three cycles of SOX and tislelizumab and trastuzumab and then for completion of 12 months treatment with tislelizumab and trastuzumab alone.
