Number of patients with adverse events (AE) and serious AEs (SAE), Assessment of the safety and tolerability of adavosertib following oral dosing in patients with advanced solid tumours., From screening (Day -28 to Day -1) until end of study (within 30 [±7] days of adavosertib dose)
The aim is to recruit approximately 8 patients with a minimum number of 4 pharmacokinetics (PK) evaluable patients.

Each patient will be admitted to the study site pre-dose on Day -1 and will remain at the study site until at least Day 8. Patients will receive a single administration of \[14C\]adavosertib as an oral solution on Day 1. During this study, whole blood, plasma, urine, faeces, and vomit samples (if presented) will be collected at various time points to characterise the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and PK of adavosertib.

The duration of the residential period will be evaluated following treatment of the first patient and may be adjusted to ensure recovery of at least 90% of the total radioactivity following the dose of \[14C\]adavosertib and/or until less than 1% of dose is recovered in urine and/or faeces within a 24-hour period.
