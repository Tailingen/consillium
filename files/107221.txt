Quality of Life in Patients With Unresectable Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma on Palliative Metallic Stent Versus Plastic Stent
The purpose of this study is to compare the quality of life in patients with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma on palliative metallic stent versus plastic Stent.
Unresectable Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma
DEVICE: biliary stent
To assessment of the quality of life of patient with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma after palliative biliary stent., 2-4 weeks
To assessment of early and late complication after palliative stent., After stent insertion for sixth month and one year or until patients were expired|Survival rate at sixth month and one year., After stent insertion for sixth month and one year or until patients were expired
In the patient with unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma,palliative biliary stent is the one way to help him.

The aim of palliative treatment is to improve quality of life and relief symptom,or sometime ,extended survival rate.

There are two types of biliary stent:

1. plastic stent made from polyethylene or polytetrafluoroethylene
2. metalic stent braided in the form of a tubular mesh from surgical-grade stainless steel alloy and designed to expand to a maximum diameter of 10mm.

The main drawback of plastic stent is relatively high occlusion rate, but its advantage is the lower cost.

In the reasons of higher occlusion rate , the lower cost of plastic stent versus metallic stent that should be stent exchange when occluded, so we would to know about quality of life in both group.
