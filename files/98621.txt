Home-Based Programs for Improving Sleep in Cancer Survivors
RATIONALE: Following a program that uses written materials and pre-recorded mp3 devices may help improve the sleep of cancer survivors. It is not yet known which home-based program is more effective in improving the sleep of cancer survivors.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is comparing two home-based programs for improving sleep in cancer survivors.
Cancer Survivor|Fatigue|Psychosocial Effects of Cancer and Its Treatment|Sleep Disorders
BEHAVIORAL: Home-based sleep intervention
Change of the (3 Day) Sleep Latency Time and Time to Fall Back Asleep After Awakening During the Night From Baseline to the End of Study at Week 7, The primary analysis will compare the change in time (in minutes) to fall asleep from baseline to week 7 as reported by question 3 in the sleep diary: "How long did it take you to get to sleep last night?" and time to fall back asleep after awakening during the night as reported by question 6A on sleep dairy: "When waking up after first falling asleep, how long did it take you to fall back to sleep?" \>

\> Data were analyzed as a percent change from baseline to week 7. The percent change were compared between arms using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test., Baseline and 7 weeks
Efficacy of Home-based Interventions on the Number of Awakenings After Sleep, Sleep Quality, Sleep Difficulty, and Sleep Latency at Baseline and Weeks 4 and 7., Overall efficacy was analyzed as a composite of 4 outcomes: 1. sleep difficulty, 2. sleep quality, 3. Number of awakenings, and 4. Sleep latency. These 4 outcomes were measured by the responses to the following questions, respectively:\>

1. How difficult was it to get to sleep last night? (scale 1-5, 5 meaning very easy)\>
2. How deeply did you sleep last night? (scale 1-5, 5 meaning very deeply)\>
3. How many times did you awaken last night?\>
4. How long did it take you to get to sleep last night?\> \> The 4 questions were analyzed as percent change from baseline after week 4 and after week 7. The percent change between arms was analyzed using a Wilcoxon test., Baseline and 7 weeks|Comparing the Efficacy of Two Home-based Sleep Interventions as Therapy for Sleep-wake Disturbances as Measured by the Percent of People Who Show Improved Sleep Per the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), The PSQI has 19 items and seven component scales: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep-wake disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. The scoring algorithm yields seven component scales on 0-3 scales which are summed to produce a global score on a 0-21 scale with higher values representing more severe sleep difficulty. The percentage of patients that showed improvement or worsening in sleep score from baseline to Week 7 were analyzed and compared using a Chi-squared test., Baseline and 7 weeks|Total Mood Disturbance as Measured by Profiles of Mood States B (POMS-B), The POMS-B is a shortened version of the original POMS with 30 items each asking the patient to select how he/she has been feeling during the past week with respect to an adjective such as "tense", "angry", "worn out", etc., on a 0-4 scale (0=not at all; 4=extremely). The POMS-B consists of six identifiable mood states (tension/anxiety, depression/dejection, anger/hostility, vigor/activity, fatigue/inertia, and confusion/bewilderment) and measures the patient's total mood disturbance. This study analyzed total mood disturbance (total scale score) as a secondary endpoints. Possible weekly scores ranged from 0-120. Week 7 scores were analyzed as a percentage change from baseline with a negative score representing a worsening condition. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare treatment arms., At baseline and week 7|Distress at Week 6, The Distress Thermometer is a single-item tool which asks patients to describe how much distress he/she has been experiencing in the past week on a scale of 0 to 10 (0=no distress, 10=extreme distress). The Distress Thermometer was selected for this study due to its brevity. Week 7 distress measures were analyzed as percent change from baseline and analyzed between arms with a t-test., From baseline to week 7
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To compare the efficacy of two home-based sleep interventions as therapy for sleep-wake disturbances,as measured by sleep latency or time to fall back asleep after initial sleep onset per sleep diaries, at baseline (week 1) and at the end of week 7 in cancer survivors.

Secondary

* To compare the efficacy of these interventions as therapy for sleep-wake disturbances as measured by the number of awakenings after sleep, sleep quality, sleep difficulty, and sleep latency at baseline (week 1) and weeks 4 and 7 in these participants.
* To compare the efficacy of these interventions as therapy for sleep-wake disturbances as measured by the percentage of participants in each group who show improved sleep per the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.
* To compare the effects of these interventions on fatigue, mood disturbance, sleep, benefit, and distress in this patient population.
* To describe the side effects associated with these interventions in these patients.
* To describe patient practice habits and adherence measured via a sleep behavior record.
* To explore symptom clusters in this patient population and look at distress as a mediating variable. (Exploratory)
* To explore predictors of sleep quality. (Exploratory)

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to current (≥ 1 per week in the past 4 weeks) pharmacological treatment, including anxiolytics, for insomnia or mood (yes vs no), current pharmacologic treatment for pain (yes vs no), sleep difficulty period (≤ 1 month vs \> 1 month), and age (≤ 50 vs 51-70 vs \> 70 years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention groups.

* Group 1: Participants receive a home-based sleep intervention comprising a Sleep Hygiene Education booklet, printed stimulus-control guidelines, instructions on sleeping restrictions, and a guided-imagery pre-recorded mp3 device. Participants meet with study personnel for intervention refinement and are asked to practice behaviors consistent with the stimulus-control sheet, to read the sleep hygiene booklet one chapter per day for 7 days during the first week, and then as needed during study. They are also instructed to use the CD, with or without headphones, in a quiet and comfortable place without lights for up to 30 minutes every day for 6 weeks before bedtime. Participants are instructed to go to sleep and wake at the same time every day during study intervention.
* Group 2: Participants receive a home-based sleep intervention comprising a Sleep Hygiene Education booklet, printed stimulus-control guidelines, and a pre-recorded mp3 device containing short stories and essays. Participants meet with study personnel and are instructed to practice behaviors consistent with the stimulus control sheet, to read the sleep hygiene booklet, and use the CD as in group 1. Participants are not instructed about sleeping restrictions. They are offered the guided-imagery CD after study completion.

Patients complete a Three-Day Sleep Behavior Record for 3 consecutive days at baseline and during weeks 4 and 7 of study intervention. Patients also complete questionnaires on Numeric Analog Sleep for Pain Scale, daily use of CD, Sleep Hygiene Practice, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Profile of Mood States, Brief Fatigue Inventory, Distress Thermometer, Side-Effect Questionnaire, and a Subject Global Impression of Change at baseline, during weeks 2 and 6, and after completion of study intervention.
