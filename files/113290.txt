The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio to Exclude Pancreatic Fistula
There is still no consensus on whether drain fluid amylase (DFA) level, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, or complex scores predict clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula (CR-POPF). The aim of this study is to determine the accuracy of simple biochemical parameters (leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, Neutrophil to Lymphocytes Ratio (NLR), at postoperative days 1 and 3) to exclude the diagnosis of CR-POPF.
Pancreas Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: pancreatoduodenectomy (PD)
Incidence of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula, Clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula according to the 2016 International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery definition, at hospital discharge assessed up to 30 days
Biological markers, Identification of biological markers to exclude clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula, Postoperative day one and three
From January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2020, consecutive patients underwent PD performed at Institut Paoli-Calmettes for various pathologies. Data were entered prospectively into a clinical database (NCT02871336).

The cohort was split into 3 groups:

* a training cohort ;
* an internal validation cohort (Paoli Calmettes institute);
* an external validation cohort (Rennes Pontchaillou Hospital).
