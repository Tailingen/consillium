Study Of Sunitinib Plus FOLFOX In Patients With Solid Tumors
This study determined the maximum tolerated dose and safety of SU011248 (sunitinib malate, SUTENT) in combination with FOLFOX \[Leucovorin + Fluorouracil (5-FU) + Oxaliplatin\]. Three different dosing regimens with starting doses of sunitinib at 37.5 mg/day (Schedule 2/2, Schedule 4/2, and Continuous Dosing) were tested in patients with advanced solid tumors, including colorectal cancer.

Objective Response (OR), From the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence. OR=confirmed Complete Response (CR) or confirmed Partial Response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR = disappearance of all target lesions. CR was confirmed if it persisted on repeat imaging study ≥ 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. PR = ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.
