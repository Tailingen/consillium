DAREONâ„¢-9: A Study to Test How Well Different Doses of BI 764532 Are Tolerated by People With Small Cell Lung Cancer When Taken Together With a Single Agent Chemotherapy
This study is open to adults with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. The study is in people with advanced cancer that had previously received platinum-based chemotherapy and are eligible to receive a single agent chemotherapy treatment.

The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of BI 764532 that people can tolerate when taken together with a single agent chemotherapy. BI 764532 is an antibody-like molecule that may help the immune system fight cancer.

Participants may continue to take BI 764532 as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. During this time, participants visit the study site regularly. The visits also depend on the response to the treatment. At the study visits, the doctors check the health of the participants, take necessary laboratory tests, and note any health problems that could have been caused by the study treatment.
