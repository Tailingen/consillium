Intrapleural Bevacizumab Injection for Malignant Effusion in Lung Cancer
Malignant pleural or pericardial effusion is common in lung cancer, and intrapleural drugs injection is important in the treatment. Non- cytotoxic drugs include those with a sclerosing effect that produces pleurodesis, which is easy to cause severe chest pain despite of no influence on the following chemotherapy. Tumor angiogenesis is important in producing MPE. Bevacizumab has been administrated locally in treating optic nerve sickness successfully by anti-VEGF mechanism. So we hypothesize that intrapleural bevacizumab is also effective in treating MPE.
