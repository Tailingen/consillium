Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Central Nervous System Metastasis
Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from the cerebrospinal cavity of non-small cell lung cancer patients with central nervous system metastasis, blood was obtained from veins, and metastatic lung cancer tumor tissue was obtained from surgically resected brain tumors or meningeal tumors. Then comprehensively analyze the exosomes contained in the aforementioned samples, and compare and analyze the clinical data of the patients, so as to explore whether the cancer cell-related substances contained in the cerebrospinal fluid, blood and tumor tissue can be used to predict lung cancer metastasis and Bioindicators of treatment effect.
