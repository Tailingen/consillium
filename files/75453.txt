A Study of Subcutaneous Nivolumab + Relatlimab Fixed-dose Combination (FDC) in Previously Untreated Metastatic or Unresectable Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the study drug exposure level of the nivolumab + relatlimab FDC subcutaneous (SC) formulation is not worse than nivolumab + relatlimab FDC intravenous (IV) administration in participants with previously untreated metastatic or unresectable melanoma.
