Study of the Safety and Efficacy of LHC165 Single Agent and in Combination With PDR001 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
The purpose of this trial was to explore the clinical utility of two investigational agents in patients with advanced cancer.

This was a multi-center, open-label Phase I/Ib study. The primary objectives of the trial were:

* To characterize the safety and tolerability of intratumoral LHC165 in patients with solid tumors as a single agent and in combination with PDR001
* To determine and evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose (RD) for LHC165 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001

This was a multi-center, open-label Phase I/Ib study. The study consisted of four dose escalation parts and two dose expansion parts testing LHC165 as a single agent or LHC165 in combination with PDR001. The dose escalation parts estimated the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE) and were planned to test two different dosing schedules for LHC165 single agent (Group A and B) and LHC165 in combination with PDR001 (Group C and D).

The dose expansion parts of the study were planned to use the MTD/RDE for each the LHC165 single agent (Group E) and LHC165 in combination with PDR001 (Group F), determined in the respective dose escalation parts to assess the activity, safety and tolerability of LHC165 as a single agent or LHC165 in combination with PDR001 in patients with specific types of solid tumors.

The study was terminated due to business reasons. Groups B, D and E were not opened for enrollment.
