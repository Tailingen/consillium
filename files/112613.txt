A Study to Investigate BGB-3245 (Brimarafenib) With Panitumumab in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic RAS Mutant Colorectal and Pancreatic Ductal Cancers
The primary objectives of Part 1 of this study are to:

* Assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of BGB-3245 and panitumumab in participants with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a known mutation status and tumor harboring an oncogenic mutation of v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B; B-RAF proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), or neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) with documented disease progression during or after at least 1 line of prior therapy.
* Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BGB-3245 in combination with panitumumab and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination.

The primary objective of Part 2 of this study is to determine the objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by initial investigator review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 with BGB-3245 and panitumumab combination treatment at the RP2D.
