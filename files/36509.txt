Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of Refractory Myasthenia Gravis
This is a single-arm, open-label, single-center, phase I study. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of CD19 CAR-T therapy for patients with refractory myasthenia gravis, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of CD19 CAR-T in patients.
