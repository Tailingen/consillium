A Phase IB Study to Determine the Safety and Tolerability of Canakinumab and Tislelizumab in Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in the Neo-adjuvant Treatment of Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
The goal of this Single Arm Phase Ib clinical trial is to test standard of care chemotherapy and anti PD1 and IL1b to evaluate the safety and preliminary toxicity of this quadruplet regimen prior to resection in patients with pancreatic cancer. The main objectives it aims to answer are to:

* Determine the recommended Phase II dose regimen of canakinumab and tislelizumab in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
* Estimate the proportion of patients who proceed to surgical resection.
* Determine the safety and tolerability of canakimumab in combination with tislelizumab, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine
* Assess the preliminary clinical anti-tumor activity of canakimumab in combination with tislelizumab, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine
* Assess whether therapy has any impact on surgical options

Participants will have labs drawn, CT scans, and a treatment administered consisting of:

* Gemcitabine
* Nab-paclitaxel
* Canakinumab
* Tislelizumab
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Canakinumab|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Number of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event (AE) or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first 8 weeks of study treatment. NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be used for all grading., 56 days|Number of patients who proceeded to surgical resection, The study team will collaborate with the surgical team to review whether there are any delays or change in outcome in surgery that is attributed to study drug., End of treatment (up to 6 months)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), according to RECIST 1.1., Up to 6 months post treatment|R0 resection rate (R0), R0 is defined by a surgery that completely removes the visible tumor and that is deemed to be margin negative on final pathology report. If tumor is not completely removed this is will be deemed to have failed to achieve an R0 resection., At surgery post treatment (up until 6 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first documented disease progression based on local investigator assessment as per RECIST 1.1 (assessed by investigator) or death due to any cause., Up to 6 months after patients last treatment|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of first dose of study treatment to date of death due to any cause. If a subject is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the latest date the subject was known to be alive (on or before the cut-off date)., Up to 6 months after patients last treatment|Number of delays outcome of surgery that is attributed to study drug, The surgical team will review whether there are any delays in outcome in surgery that is attributed to study drug., At surgery post treatment (up until 6 months)|Number of changes in outcome of surgery that is attributed to study drug, The surgical team will review whether there are any change in outcome in surgery that is attributed to study drug., At surgery post treatment (up until 6 months)
