Esthesioneuroblastoma: Outcomes After Treatment
The purpose of this study is to collect and organize data into a repository to gather relevant information for future research from patients diagnosed with a rare malignant sinonasal cancer called esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) and are scheduled to undergo endonasal skull base surgery. Data being collected includes surgical data, demographics, disease presentation, MRI, CT, PET imaging, and post-operative assessments including pathology tests. After surgery, the investigators will collect chemotherapy and radiation data. Participants will also complete quality of life questionnaires at their follow-up visits.
