Trilateral retinoblastoma
Go to Patient Version
Retinoblastoma is a pediatric cancer that requires careful integration of multidisciplinary care. Treatment of retinoblastoma aims to save the patient's life and preserve useful vision. For patients presenting with extraocular retinoblastoma, treatment with systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy is likely to be curative. However, extraorbital disease requires intensive chemotherapy and may include consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue with or without radiation therapy. While a large proportion of patients with systemic extra–central nervous system (CNS) metastases can be cured, the prognosis for patients with intracranial disease is dismal.
Incidence
Retinoblastoma is a relatively uncommon tumor of childhood that arises in the
retina. It accounts for about 3% of the cancers occurring in children younger
than 15 years.
Retinoblastoma is a cancer of the very young child. Two-thirds of all cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed before age 2 years.[
1
]  Thus, while the estimated annual incidence in the United States is approximately 3 cases per 1 million children younger than 20 years, the age-adjusted annual incidence in children aged 0 to 4 years is 18.4 cases per 1 million.[
2
]
Anatomy
Retinoblastoma arises in the retina, and it may grow under the retina and/or toward the vitreous cavity. Involvement of the ocular coats and optic nerve occurs as a sequence of events as the tumor progresses.
Focal invasion of the choroid is common, although massive invasion occurs in cases of advanced disease. After invading the choroid, the tumor gains access to systemic circulation and creates the potential for metastases. Further progression through the ocular coats leads to invasion of the sclera and the orbit. Tumors that invade the anterior chamber may gain access to systemic circulation through the canal of Schlemm. Progression through the optic nerve and past the lamina cribrosa increases the risk of systemic and CNS dissemination (see
Figure 1
).

Screening
Consensus reports from the American Association of Ophthalmic Oncologists and Pathologists and the American Association for Cancer Research Childhood Cancer Predisposition Workshop describe screening guidelines for children at risk of developing retinoblastoma.[
3
,
4
]
In children with a positive family history of retinoblastoma, early-in-life screening by fundus examination is performed under general anesthesia at regular intervals. Examinations are performed according to a schedule based on the absolute estimated risk, as determined by identification of the
RB1
variant in the family and the presence of the
RB1
variant in the child.[
3
,
4
]
Infants born to affected parents have a dilated eye examination under anesthesia as soon as possible in the first month of life, and a genetic evaluation is performed. Infants with a positive genetic test are examined under anesthesia on a monthly basis. In infants who do not develop disease, monthly examinations continue throughout the first year. The frequency of those examinations may be decreased progressively during the second and subsequent years. Screening children with a positive family history of retinoblastoma can improve their prognosis, in terms of globe sparing and use of less intensive, ocular-salvage treatments (see
Table 1
and
Figure 2
).[

Figure 2.  Management guidelines for childhood screening for
retinoblastoma
. The presented schedules are general guidelines and reflect a schedule for examinations in which no lesions of concern are noted. It may be appropriate to examine some children more frequently. Decisions regarding examination method, examination under
anesthesia
(EUA) versus nonsedated examination in the office, are complex and best decided by the clinician in discussion with the patient's family. The preference of the majority of the clinical centers involved in the creation of this consensus statement is reflected, but individual centers may make policy decisions based on available resources and expert clinician preference. Examination under anesthesia will be strongly considered for any child who is unable to participate in an office examination sufficiently to allow thorough examination of the retina. *A minority of clinical centers also prefer EUA for high- and intermediate-risk children (calculated risk >1%) from birth to 8 weeks of age.

It is common practice to use ophthalmic examinations to screen the parents and siblings of patients with retinoblastoma to exclude an unknown familial disease. However, in the absence of genetic testing, the screening plan for a child with a biological parent who had unilateral retinoblastoma is not well defined.[
5
]
Clinical Presentation
Age at presentation correlates with laterality. Patients with bilateral disease present at a younger age, usually in the first 12 months of life.
Most patients present with leukocoria, which is occasionally first noticed after a flash photograph is taken. Strabismus is the second most common presenting sign and usually correlates with macular involvement. Very advanced intraocular tumors present with pain, orbital cellulitis, glaucoma, or buphthalmos.
As the tumor progresses, patients may present with orbital or metastatic disease. Metastases occur in the preauricular and laterocervical lymph nodes, in the CNS, or  systemically (commonly in the bones, bone marrow, and liver).
In the United States, Hispanic children and children living in lower socioeconomic conditions have presented with more advanced disease.[
6
]
Diagnostic and Staging Evaluation
Diagnostic evaluation of retinoblastoma includes the following:
Eye examination.
Intraocular retinoblastoma is usually diagnosed without pathological confirmation. An examination under anesthesia with a maximally dilated pupil and scleral indentation is required to inspect the entire retina. The number, location, and size of tumors; the presence of retinal detachment and subretinal fluid; and the presence of subretinal and vitreous seeds must be documented in detail.
Ocular ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Bidimensional ocular ultrasonography and MRI can be useful to differentiate retinoblastoma from other causes of leukocoria and in the evaluation of extrascleral and extraocular extension in children with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma. Optic nerve enhancement by MRI does not necessarily indicate involvement. Cautious interpretation of those findings is needed.[
7
]
Patients with suspected extraocular extension by imaging or high-risk pathology in the enucleated eye (i.e., massive choroidal invasion or involvement of the sclera or the optic nerve beyond the lamina cribrosa) may need to be evaluated for the presence of metastatic disease. Patients presenting with these pathological features in the enucleated eye are at high risk of developing metastases. In these cases, the following procedures may be performed:[
8
]
Bone scintigraphy.
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
Lumbar puncture.
Genetics and Genomics of Retinoblastoma
Retinoblastoma is a tumor that occurs in heritable (25%–30%) and nonheritable (70%–75%) forms.
Heritable Retinoblastoma
Heritable retinoblastoma is defined by the presence of a germline pathogenic variant of the
RB1
gene. This germline pathogenic variant may have been inherited from an affected progenitor (25% of cases) or may have occurred in a germ cell before conception or
in utero
during early embryogenesis in patients with sporadic disease (75% of cases). The presence of positive family history or bilateral or multifocal disease is suggestive of heritable disease.
Heritable retinoblastoma may manifest as  unilateral or bilateral
disease. The penetrance of the
RB1
variant (laterality, age at diagnosis, and number of tumors) is probably dependent on concurrent genetic modifiers such as
MDM2
and
MDM4
polymorphisms.[
9
,
10
]  All children with bilateral disease 
 and approximately 15% of patients with unilateral disease are presumed to have the   heritable form, even though only 25% have an affected parent. In a series of 482 patients with unilateral retinoblastoma, germline pathogenic variants were identified in 33% of infants younger than 12 months, 6% of children aged 12 to 24 months, and 7% of children aged 24 to 39 months. The highest incidence of germline retinoblastoma was in patients younger than 1 year compared with patients older than 1 year (odds ratio, 2.96).[
11
][
Level of evidence C2
]
Children with heritable retinoblastoma tend to be diagnosed at a younger age than  children with the nonheritable form of the disease.[
12
]
Nonheritable Retinoblastoma
The genomic landscape of retinoblastoma is driven by  alterations in
RB1
that lead to biallelic inactivation.[
13
,
14
]  A rare cause of
RB1
inactivation is chromothripsis, which may be difficult to detect by conventional methods.[
15
]
Recurrent changes in genes other than
RB1
are uncommon in retinoblastoma but do occur. Variants or deletions of
BCOR
and amplification of
MYCN
are the most frequently reported events.[
13
-
18
] A study of 1,068 unilateral nonfamilial retinoblastoma tumors reported that 2% to 3% of tumors lacked evidence of
RB1
loss and approximately one-half of these cases without evidence of
RB1
loss showed
MYCN
amplification.[
14
] However,
MYCN
amplification is also observed in retinoblastoma tumors that have
RB1
alterations, suggesting that inactivation of
RB1
by a variant or an inactive retinoblastoma protein is a requirement for the development of retinoblastoma, independent of
MYCN
amplification.[
19
]
Genetic Counseling
Genetic counseling is an integral part of the management of patients with retinoblastoma and their families, regardless of clinical presentation. Counseling includes a discussion of the main forms of retinoblastoma, which helps parents understand the genetic consequences of each form of retinoblastoma and estimate the risk of disease in family members.[
20
] Counseling also includes guidance toward appropriate screening for both patients and their families, especially if the risk of developing a second primary malignancy is increased.
Genetic counseling, however, is not always straightforward. Approximately 10% of children with retinoblastoma have somatic genetic mosaicism, which contributes to the difficulty of genetic counseling.[
21
] Children with mosaic alleles have fewer tumors, and the tumors are more likely to remain unilateral.[
22
] In addition, for one specific variant, the risk of retinoblastoma in a sibling may depend partly on whether the variant is inherited from the mother or father.[
23
] For more information, see
Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling
.
Genetic Testing
Blood and tumor samples can be tested to determine whether a patient with retinoblastoma has a germline or somatic variant in the
RB1
gene. Once the patient's genetic variant has been identified, other family members can be screened directly for the variant with targeted sequencing.
A multistep assay that includes the following may be performed for a complete genetic evaluation of the
RB1
gene:[
24
]
DNA sequencing to identify variants within coding exons and immediate flanking intronic regions plus the promoter regions.
Duplication/deletion analysis.
Methylation analysis of the
RB1
promoter region on DNA isolated from the tumor.
In cases of somatic mosaicism or cytogenetic abnormalities, the variants may not be easily detected. More exhaustive techniques such as karyotyping, fluorescence
in situ
hybridization, and methylation analysis of the
RB1
promoter may be needed. Deep (2500x) sequencing of an
RB1
genomic amplicon from lymphocyte DNA can reveal low-level mosaicism.[
25
] Because mosaicism is caused by a postzygotic variant, such a finding obviates the need for serial examination of siblings under anesthesia. Current technologies will not discover some mosaic variants at very low levels of amplification, variants outside of the
RB1
coding exons or the flanking intronic regions, variants not found in lymphocytes but in other tissues (mosaic), or mosaic large rearrangements of
RB1
.[
25
] Combining the above techniques, a germline pathogenic variant may be detected in more than 90% of patients with heritable retinoblastoma.[
20
,
26
,
27
]
The absence of detectable somatic
RB1
variants in approximately 3% of unilateral, nonheritable retinoblastoma cases suggests that alternative genetic mechanisms may underlie the development of retinoblastoma.[
28
] In one-half of these cases, high levels of
MYCN
amplification have been reported. These patients had distinct, aggressive histological features and a median age at diagnosis of 4 months.[
14
] However,
MYCN
amplification has also been reported to coexist with
RB1
variants.[
19
] In another small subset of tumors without detectable somatic
RB1
variants, chromothripsis is responsible for inactivating the
RB1
gene.[
15
]
Postdiagnosis Surveillance
Children with a germline
RB1
pathogenic variant may continue to develop new tumors for a few years after diagnosis and treatment. For this reason, these patients need to be examined frequently. It is common practice for examinations to occur every 2 to 4 months for at least 28 months.[
29
] The interval between examinations is based on the stability of the disease and age of the child (i.e., less frequent visits as the child ages).
A proportion of children who present with unilateral retinoblastoma will eventually develop disease in the opposite eye. Periodic examinations of the unaffected eye are performed until the germline status of the
RB1
gene is determined.
Because of the poor prognosis for patients with trilateral retinoblastoma, screening with neuroimaging until age 5 years  is a common practice in the monitoring of children with the heritable form of the disease. For more information, see the
Trilateral retinoblastoma
section.
Causes of Retinoblastoma-Related Mortality
While retinoblastoma is a highly curable disease, the challenge is to preserve life and to prevent the loss of an eye, blindness, and other serious effects of treatment that reduce the patient's life span or quality of life. With improvements in the diagnosis and management of retinoblastoma over the past several decades, metastatic retinoblastoma is observed less frequently in the United States and other developed nations. As a result, other causes, such as   trilateral retinoblastoma and subsequent neoplasms (SNs), have become significant contributors to retinoblastoma-related mortality in the first and subsequent decades of life. In the United States, before the advent of chemoreduction as a means of treating heritable or bilateral disease and the implementation of neuroimaging screening, trilateral retinoblastoma contributed to more than 50% of retinoblastoma-related mortality for patients in the first decade after their diagnosis.[
30
] For more information about SNs, see the
Late Effects of Retinoblastoma Therapy
section.
Trilateral retinoblastoma
Trilateral retinoblastoma is a well-recognized syndrome that occurs in 5% to 15% of patients with heritable retinoblastoma. It is defined by the development of an asynchronous intracranial
midline neuroblastic tumor, which typically develops between the ages of 20 and 36 months.[
31
]
Because of the poor prognosis and the apparent improved survival with early detection and aggressive treatment of trilateral retinoblastoma, screening with routine neuroimaging could potentially detect most cases within 2 years of the first retinoblastoma diagnosis.[
31
] Routine baseline brain MRI is recommended at diagnosis because it may detect trilateral retinoblastoma at a subclinical stage.  In a small series, the 5-year overall survival rate was 67% for patients with tumors that were detected at baseline, compared with 11% for the group with a delayed diagnosis.[
32
]
Although it is not clear whether early diagnosis can impact survival, screening with MRI has been recommended as often as every 6 months for 5 years for patients suspected of having heritable disease or those with unilateral disease and a positive family history.[
33
] Computed tomography scans are generally avoided for routine screening in these children because of the risk related to ionizing radiation exposure.
A cystic pineal gland, which is commonly detected by surveillance MRI, needs to be distinguished from a cystic variant of pineoblastoma. In children without retinoblastoma, the incidence of pineal cysts has been reported to be 55.8%.[
34
] In a case-control study that included 77 children with retinoblastoma and 77 controls, the incidence of pineal cysts was similar (61% and 69%, respectively), and the size and volume of the pineal gland was not significantly different between the groups.[
35
] However, a cystic component has been described in up to 57% of patients with histologically confirmed trilateral retinoblastoma.[
32
] An excessive increase in the size of the pineal gland seems to be the strongest parameter indicating a malignant process.[

Tumor Pathology of Retinoblastoma
Maturing cone precursor cells appear to be the cell of origin in human retinoblastoma.[
1
,
2
] Microscopically, the appearance of retinoblastoma depends on the degree of differentiation. Undifferentiated retinoblastoma is composed of small, round, densely packed cells with hypochromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Several degrees of photoreceptor differentiation have been described and are characterized by distinctive arrangements of tumor cells, as follows:
Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes
are specific to retinoblastoma. These structures consist of a cluster of low columnar cells arranged around a central lumen that is bounded by an eosinophilic membrane analogous to the external membrane of the normal retina. The lumen contains rosettes that are seen in 70% of tumors.
Homer Wright rosettes
are composed of irregular circlets of tumor cells arranged around a tangle of fibrils with no lumen or internal-limiting membrane. Homer Wright rosettes are infrequently seen in retinoblastoma and are most often seen in other neuroblastic tumors, such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma.
Retinoblastomas
are characterized by marked cell proliferation, as evidenced by high mitosis
counts, extremely high MIB-1 labeling indices, and strong diffuse nuclear immunoreactivity for
CRX
, a useful marker to discriminate retinoblastoma from other malignant, small, round cell tumors.[
3
,
4
]
Cavitary retinoblastoma, a rare variant of retinoblastoma, has ophthalmoscopically visible lucent cavities within the tumor. The cavitary spaces appear hollow on ultrasonography and hypofluorescent on angiography. Histopathologically, the cavitary spaces have been shown to represent areas of photoreceptor differentiation.[
5
]
Cavitary retinoblastoma has been associated with minimal visible response to intravenous and intra-arterial chemotherapy, which is thought to be a sign of tumor differentiation.[
6
,
7
] Despite the blunted clinical response, patients with cavitary retinoblastoma have favorable long-term outcomes, with good tumor response and globe salvage that is similar to that in patients with noncavitary retinoblastoma.
A pathologist experienced in ocular pathology and retinoblastoma should examine the enucleated specimen, particularly to determine risk features of extraocular dissemination.  For more information, see the
Treatment of Intraocular Retinoblastoma
section.

Reese-Ellsworth Classification for Intraocular Tumors
The staging of patients with retinoblastoma requires close coordination of radiologists, pediatric oncologists, and ophthalmologists. Several staging and grouping systems have been proposed for retinoblastoma.[
1
] Overall assessment of retinoblastoma extension is documented by staging systems. The extent of intraocular disease, which is relevant for ocular salvage, is documented by grouping systems. For treatment purposes, retinoblastoma is categorized
into intraocular and extraocular disease.
Intraocular Retinoblastoma
Intraocular retinoblastoma is localized to the eye. It may be confined to the
retina or may extend to involve other structures such as the choroid, ciliary body, anterior chamber, and optic nerve head. Intraocular retinoblastoma, however, does not extend beyond
the eye into the tissues around the eye or to other parts of the body.
Extraocular Retinoblastoma
Extraocular retinoblastoma extends beyond the eye.  It may be confined to
the tissues around the eye (orbital retinoblastoma), it may have spread to the central
nervous system, or it may have spread systemically to the bone marrow or lymph nodes (metastatic retinoblastoma).
Staging Systems
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system
Several staging systems have been proposed over the years. The newest standard for state-mandated cancer reporting to the North American Association of Cancer Registries requires AJCC staging, according to  the 8th edition of the staging manual.[

This staging system affects cases diagnosed in 2018 and thereafter. Retinoblastoma staging is the first to acknowledge the role of genetic predisposition by incorporating an
H
category. H1 refers to patients with bilateral or trilateral retinoblastoma, a family history of retinoblastoma, or the presence of an
RB1
variant (see

To further assess the significance of tumor seeding, a multicenter, international, registry-based analysis of  eyes with retinoblastoma investigated whether the distribution and clinical characteristics of retinoblastoma seeds in cT2b eyes affect local treatment failure.  Of the 624 eyes in which eye salvage was attempted, 592 had complete data for globe-salvage analysis.  The distribution of seeds was focal in 143 eyes (24.2%) and diffuse in 449 eyes (75.8%). At presentation, diffuse seeding was associated with a 2.8-fold risk of eventual local treatment failure, compared with focal retinoblastoma seeding.  The 5-year Kaplan-Meier cumulative globe-salvage rate (without external-beam radiation therapy) was 78% for eyes with focal seeding and 49% for eyes with diffuse seeding.  This subclassification  of retinoblastoma seeding is not currently included in the AJCC staging system.[

Size criteria
No uniform size criteria exist for intraocular retinoblastoma associated with the presence of high-risk pathological features. An international, multicenter, registry-based, retrospective case series from 13 countries was used to assess the association of high-risk pathological features at diagnosis (defined as AJCC stages pT3 and pT4) with high-risk clinical features (defined as AJCC stages cT2 and cT3) and a newly proposed AJCC Ophthalmic Oncology Task Force (OOTF) Size Grouping system.  AJCC-OOTF divided intraocular tumor size into the following four groups:[
4
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Size Group 1: Less than one-half of the globe volume involved.
Size Group 2: More than one-half but less than two-thirds of globe volume involved.
Size Group 3: More than two-thirds of globe volume filled with tumor.
Size Group 4: Diffuse infiltrating retinoblastoma.
Of the 942 eyes with retinoblastoma that were treated by primary enucleation, 282 (30%) showed high-risk pathological features.  Both the clinical staging (cT subcategories) and AJCC Size Groups were associated with high-risk pathological features.
Compared with cT2a tumors (intraocular tumors with retinal detachment, vitreous seeding, or subretinal seeding with subretinal fluid >5 mm based on any tumor), iris neovascularization with glaucoma (cT3c) (odds ratios [OR],  2.3), intraocular hemorrhage (cT3d) (OR, 2.5), and aseptic orbital cellulitis (cT3e) (OR, 3.3) were predictive factors for high-risk pathological features.
Compared with Size Group 1, Size Groups 3 (OR, 3.3) and 4 (OR, 4.1) were the best predictive factors for high-risk pathological features.
These clinical risk factors can potentially be used to predict the presence of high-risk pathological features and facilitate treatment decisions.
This same international, multicenter, registry-based, retrospective case series was used to assess the risk of metastatic death. The analysis was based on presenting features (n = 1,814 patients with clinical cT2 or cT3 stages; n = 1,416 patients for tumor size) and treatment in patients with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma.  Advanced retinoblastoma for this study was defined by AJCC categories cT2 and cT3 and AJCC-OOTF Size Groups.  Treatments were primary enucleation, systemic chemotherapy with secondary enucleation, and systemic chemotherapy with eye salvage.[
5
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Increasing cT3 subcategories were associated with a higher risk of metastatic death.  There was an estimated 4.9-fold risk for cT3c, a 14.0-fold risk for cT3d, and a 19.6-fold risk for cT3e, compared with cT2a.
Increasing age at presentation (median age of diagnosis, 22 months vs. 16 months;
P
< .001) and attempt at eye salvage by systemic chemotherapy were also significant risk factors for metastasis.
Increasing intraocular Size Group was associated with an increased risk of metastatic death. There was a 10.0-fold risk for Size Group 3 tumors and a 41.1-fold risk for Size Group 4 tumors, compared with Size Group 1 tumors.
International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS)
The more simplified IRSS has been proposed by an international consortium of ophthalmologists and pediatric oncologists.[
6
] The IRSS is more widely used in the clinical setting than the AJCC staging system (see
Table 11
). A retrospective German study found that the IRSS predicted survival in 633 children with heritable retinoblastoma, 582 of whom presented with IRSS stage 0 or I disease.[

Grouping Systems
The following grouping systems are relevant for assessment of intraocular disease extension and are helpful predictors of ocular salvage:
International Classification of Retinoblastoma
.
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), 8th edition
.
Reese-Ellsworth classification for intraocular tumors (historical)
.
International Classification of Retinoblastoma
The International Classification of Retinoblastoma grouping system was developed with the goal of providing a simpler, more user-friendly classification that is more applicable to current therapies. This newer system is based on the extent of tumor seeding within the vitreous cavity and subretinal space, rather than on tumor size and location (see
Table 12
). The use of this system seems to better predict treatment success.[
8
-
10
] This system may also help predict high-risk histopathology. In a study of more than 500 patients with retinoblastoma, histopathological evidence of high-risk disease was noted in 17% of Group D eyes and 24% of Group E eyes.  This can be helpful in counseling parents regarding the potential need for postoperative systemic therapy.[

Reese-Ellsworth Classification for Intraocular Tumors
Reese and Ellsworth developed a classification system for
intraocular retinoblastoma    that has been shown to have prognostic significance
for maintenance of sight and control of local disease at a time when surgery and external-beam radiation therapy were the primary treatment options.  However, developments in the conservative management of intraocular retinoblastoma have made the
Reese-Ellsworth grouping system
less predictive for eye salvage and less helpful in guiding treatment.[
9
] This grouping system is seldom used and serves largely as a historical reference.

Radiation Therapy
Treatment planning by a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists—including a pediatric oncologist, ophthalmologist, and radiation oncologist—with
experience treating ocular tumors of childhood is required to optimize treatment outcomes.[
1
] Evaluation at specialized centers is highly recommended before the initiation of treatment to improve the likelihood of ocular salvage and vision preservation.
The goals of therapy include the following:
Eradicate the disease to save the patient's life.
Preserve as much vision as possible.
Decrease risk of late sequelae from treatment, particularly subsequent neoplasms (SNs).
Many treatments considered to be standard of care have not been studied in a randomized fashion.
Treatment of retinoblastoma depends on the intraocular and extraocular disease burden, disease laterality,  germline
RB1
gene status, and the potential for preserving vision. For patients presenting with intraocular disease, particularly those with bilateral eye involvement, a conservative approach consisting of tumor reduction with intravenous or intra-arterial chemotherapy (ophthalmic artery chemotherapy), coupled with aggressive local therapy, may result in high ocular salvage rates.[
2
] Radiation therapy, one of the most effective treatments in retinoblastoma, is usually reserved for cases of intraocular or extraocular disease progression.
A risk-adapted, judicious combination of the following therapeutic options should be considered:
Enucleation
.
Local treatment (cryotherapy, laser therapy, and brachytherapy)
.
Systemic chemotherapy
.
Intra-arterial chemotherapy (ophthalmic artery infusion of chemotherapy)
.
Intravitreal chemotherapy
.
Intracameral chemotherapy

Enucleation
Upfront removal of the eye is indicated for large tumors filling the vitreous for which there is little or no likelihood of restoring vision,  in cases of extension to the anterior chamber, or in the presence of neovascular glaucoma. Patients must be monitored closely  for orbital recurrence of disease, particularly in the first 2 years after enucleation.[
3
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Enucleation is also used as a salvage treatment in cases of disease progression or recurrence in patients receiving eye-salvage management. The pathology specimen must be carefully examined to identify patients who are at high risk of extraocular dissemination and who may require adjuvant chemotherapy.[

In a retrospective, multicenter, global cohort of patients (n = 1,411) who underwent primary enucleation, the pathological classification of the primary tumor (pT) category (based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] Cancer Staging Manual, 8th edition) was predictive of orbital tumor recurrence, tumor-related metastasis, and tumor-related death. Not receiving adjuvant therapy was associated with increased tumor-related death in pT3a (
P
< .001), pT3b (
P
= .009), pT3c (
P
= .018), and pT4 (
P
< .001) eyes.[
5
]
Enucleation in patients younger than 3 years does not allow for the proper orbital growth during subsequent development, causing asymmetry of the final orbital size.[
6
]
Local Treatment (Cryotherapy, Laser Therapy, and Brachytherapy)
For patients undergoing eye-salvage treatments, aggressive local therapy is always required. Local treatment is administered by the ophthalmologist directly to the tumor.
Cryotherapy.
Cryotherapy is based on the application of a cryoprobe to the sclera in the immediate vicinity of the retinal tumor. Cryotherapy is used as  primary therapy or with chemotherapy for tumors smaller than 4 disc diameters (DD)  in the
anterior portion of the retina.
Laser therapy.
Laser therapy may be used as primary therapy for small tumors or in combination with chemotherapy for larger tumors. Traditional photocoagulation (argon laser), in which the laser was applied around the tumor to target the tumor vasculature, has given way to thermotherapy (diode laser). Thermotherapy is delivered directly to the tumor surface via infrared wavelengths of light.[

,
8
]
Brachytherapy (plaque radiation therapy).
For larger tumors that are not amenable to cryotherapy or laser therapy, brachytherapy can provide an effective means for local control.  For more information, see the
Radiation Therapy
section.
Systemic Chemotherapy
Systemic chemotherapy plays a role in the following situations:
Adjuvant setting for patients with high-risk pathology.
Different regimens have been used in the management of patients with high-risk pathology in the enucleated specimen. Most regimens include a three-drug combination of vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin, either alone or alternating with cyclophosphamide and an anthracycline.[

Treatment of patients with extraocular and metastatic disease.
Patients with extraocular disease benefit from more intensive therapy. While a standard treatment has not been determined, responses to cisplatin-based regimens, with consolidation using high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue for patients with extraorbital disease, have been reported.[
12
-
15
]
Chemoreductive treatment in conjunction with aggressive local treatment for patients undergoing ocular salvage treatments.
During the past two decades, the standard of care has been systemic chemotherapy to reduce tumor
volume (chemoreduction) to facilitate the use of local treatments and to avoid the long-term effects of radiation
therapy.[
16
] The success rate for eye salvage varies from center to center, but overall good ocular outcomes are consistently obtained for discrete tumors without vitreous seeding.
In a large cohort analysis of 994 eyes in 554 patients who were treated with intravenous chemotherapy and had long-term outcome data, investigators found that tumor control was strongly dependent on the
International Classification of Retinoblastoma
group designation per eye.  Frontline intravenous chemotherapy consisting of six cycles of vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin plus additional intra-arterial chemotherapy and/or plaque radiation therapy led to tumor control for Groups A (96%), B (91%), C (91%), D (71%), and E (32%) by year 2.  With the aforementioned treatment, enucleation or external-beam radiation therapy could be avoided, and the tumor-controlling effect lasted up to 20 years.[
17

Level of evidence C1
]
Eye grouping, as defined by the International Classification of Retinoblastoma, is the best predictor of ocular salvage using this approach, with salvage rates ranging from 60% to 100%.[
16
]
Prolonged chemotherapy  instead of enucleation, in the context of persistent intraocular disease activity, should be used cautiously because this approach has been associated with an increased risk of metastatic disease.[

Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy (Ophthalmic Artery Infusion of Chemotherapy)
Direct delivery of chemotherapy into the eye via cannulation of the ophthalmic artery is a feasible and effective method for ocular salvage when performed at high-volume centers that have specialized services of an interventional radiologist skilled in this area and a pediatric anesthesiologist. The Children’s Oncology Group conducted a multi-institutional study (

) to evaluate the feasibility of administering intra-arterial therapy to newly diagnosed patients with Group D retinoblastoma. The  study failed to meet the feasibility goals, highlighting the importance of referring patients to high-volume institutions that have expertise in the procedure.[
20
] Responses to chemotherapy using this approach can be further consolidated with local control measures, as described above.
Melphalan is the most common and most effective agent used for intra-arterial chemotherapy. It is often combined with topotecan or carboplatin when responses are suboptimal or there is very advanced intraocular disease.[
21
,
22
]
Outcome after intra-arterial chemotherapy correlates with the extent of intraocular burden, as follows:
Patients with early intraocular disease (Group B and C eyes) have an excellent outcome, with ocular salvage rates exceeding 85%. These patients may be treated with single-agent therapy.[
22
]
Patients with Group D eyes have a worse outcome, with ocular salvage rates below 60%.[
22
] However, ocular salvage rates higher than 80% have been reported in specialized centers.[
21
,
23
] For patients with very advanced intraocular disease, an alternative treatment is the use of systemic chemotherapy followed by consolidation with intra-arterial melphalan.[
24
]
Ocular salvage rates when intra-arterial chemotherapy administration is used as salvage treatment for patients with recurrent or progressive disease are consistently lower, with globe survival rates of 50% to 75%.[
21
-
23
] Best results are reported using a more intensive three-drug regimen with melphalan, topotecan, and carboplatin.[
25
]
The role of intra-arterial chemotherapy in ocular salvage has been further clarified in a multicenter randomized clinical trial. This trial compared intra-arterial chemotherapy with systemic chemotherapy for children with unilateral advanced (Group D or E) retinoblastoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either four cycles of intra-arterial melphalan combination chemotherapy (two cycles with carboplatin and two cycles with topotecan) or six cycles of systemic chemotherapy with vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide. Local control was performed based on standard practice. The 2-year progression-free ocular salvage rates were 53% for patients in the intra-arterial chemotherapy group and 27% for patients in the intravenous chemotherapy group. The ocular salvage rates were 71% for patients who received intra-arterial chemotherapy and 51% for patients who received intravenous chemotherapy.[
26
]
Patients with bilateral disease can undergo tandem intra-arterial chemotherapy administration.[
27
] In those circumstances, patients are at higher risk of systemic toxicity caused by melphalan exposure,[
28
] and single-agent carboplatin may be used to treat the less-advanced eye during the tandem procedure.[
29
] For neonates and very young infants in whom the cannulization of the ophthalmic artery is not feasible, bridge treatment with single-agent systemic carboplatin until the infant is aged 3 months  or weighs 6 kg, followed by consolidation with intra-arterial chemotherapy, has been shown to be very effective. In one study, the 1-year radiation-free ocular survival rate was 95%.[
30
]
In a study of 39 infants younger than 3 months  with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma (Group D and E eyes), patients received intra-arterial chemotherapy as primary treatment (29 eyes) or secondary treatment (13 eyes previously treated with intravenous chemotherapy) using a microcatheterization procedure. The middle meningeal artery was used when the ophthalmic artery could not be catheterized.[
31
]
The globe salvage rate was 96% for the 23 Group D eyes and 33% for the 6 Group E eyes, but the 2-year overall ocular survival rate was 81% because of an increased incidence of phthisis bulbi.
The incidence of complete vision loss was high.
Follow-up was limited, ranging from 6 months to 6 years; therefore, later effects are unknown.
The addition of intravitreal chemotherapy to intra-arterial chemotherapy appears to markedly improve the overall effectiveness in eyes with vitreous seeds, especially those with vitreous seed clouds.[
21
,
32
,
33
]  For more information, see the
Intravitreal Chemotherapy
section.
In patients presenting with total retinal detachment, ophthalmic artery chemosurgery  has been shown to promote retinal  reattachment.[
34
]
Complications related to intra-arterial chemotherapy include the following:[
22
,
26
,
35
]
Retinal detachment (up to 19.3%).[
36
]
Vitreous hemorrhage (up to 18.1%).
Ptosis (13.6%).
Dysmotility (6.5%).
Vascular and ischemic effects, including ophthalmic artery stenosis (18%) and occlusion (up to 9%).
Optic atrophy (3.4%).
Phthisis (2.7%).
Major vascular complications related to the procedure are very rare. Strokes or significant acute neurological events have not been reported by the most experienced groups.[
21
,
22
,
37
] However, stenosis of the ophthalmic artery and occlusion of the retinal artery have been documented.[
35
,
37
] The risk of thrombosis is significantly increased in children with thrombophilia.[
38
] In a large series of 196 patients who were treated with 682 infusions of intra-arterial chemotherapy, ophthalmic vascular events were reported in 17% of the treated eyes.[
35
]
The impact of the intraocular vascular changes on vision has not been fully assessed because of the young age of the first cohorts of patients treated. Most patients do not have substantial electroretinographic changes,[
39
] and preservation of central vision has been reported.[
40
] A proportion of patients with abnormal electroretinograms (ERGs) with or without retinal detachment may have improved ERGs in the years after intra-arterial chemotherapy.[
41
] However, in patients with heavily pretreated eyes, intensive intra-arterial chemotherapy may result in worsening of retinal function.[
25
]
Another risk associated with intra-arterial chemotherapy is the exposure to ionizing radiation during fluoroscopy. Mean total radiation doses of 42.3 mGy have been reported in very experienced centers.[
42
] After multiple procedures, cumulative doses can reach 0.1 to 0.2 Gy, which can be cataractogenic and potentially carcinogenic in this susceptible population.[
43
] There has been no increase in the incidence of second malignancies.[
44
,
45
] However, longer follow-up is required to fully ascertain the risks associated with the procedure.
The risk of metastatic progression with direct ocular delivery of chemotherapy appears to be very low.[
2
] However, up to 20 cases of patients treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy who subsequently developed metastases have been reported.[
22
]
Intravitreal Chemotherapy
Studies suggest that direct intravitreal injection of melphalan or topotecan may be effective in controlling active vitreous seeds.[
46
,
47
]; [
48
,
49
][
Level of evidence C2
] A retrospective study  of 264 eyes (250 children) treated with intravitreal melphalan for vitreous seeds over a two-decade period reported a complete remission rate of 68%.  There was a low incidence of extraocular spread as a result of the injection that occurred in children with high-risk features.[
50
][
Level of evidence C2
]
Because of initial concerns about the potential for tumor dissemination,  the use of intravitreal chemotherapy was limited. However, additional reports have estimated that the proportion of patients with extraocular tumor spread, as the result of intravitreal injection, is negligible.[
51
,
52
] While this procedure is safe and well tolerated, recent studies have shown a direct correlation between the number of injections and a decrease in retinal function, as measured by ERG.[
52
]; [
53
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Preliminary data support that intra-arterial chemotherapy plus  intravitreal chemotherapy (as needed for vitreous seeding) may improve globe salvage in eyes with advanced retinoblastoma when compared with children who were treated in earlier years with intra-arterial chemotherapy alone.[
52
]; [
32
][
Level of evidence C2
] Compared with the children treated in the earlier era, children treated in the later era received a combination of intra-arterial and intra-vitreal chemotherapy, which demonstrated shorter time to regression, fewer recurrences, fewer enucleations, and no increased toxicity, including no difference in loss of retinal function as measured by ERG.[
33
][
Level of evidence C3
]
As experience with the use of intra-vitreal chemotherapy expands, studies have demonstrated its efficacy in controlling subretinal seeds and recurrent retinal tumors, suggesting a potential role beyond the control of vitreous seeds as an adjunctive therapy in the globe-sparing treatment of retinoblastoma.[
54
]
Intracameral Chemotherapy
A retrospective, single-institution study reported on the treatment of anterior chamber seeding with the injection of aqueous melphalan. Ocular salvage was achieved in 6 of 11 eyes (median, four injections), with a mean follow-up of 17 months.[
55
]
Radiation Therapy
Retinoblastoma is a very radiosensitive malignancy.
EBRT.
EBRT doses ranging from 35 Gy to 46 Gy usually result in long-term remissions. 
Because of the need to sedate young children and the intricacies of field
planning, special expertise in pediatric radiation therapy is important.
 Radiation therapy is used in cases of progression after conservative approaches, in patients with extraocular extension, and as part of the management of patients with metastatic disease.
Newer methods of delivering EBRT are being applied to reduce adverse long-term effects.   This includes
intensity-modulated radiation therapy
and proton-beam radiation therapy (
charged-particle radiation therapy
).[
56
-
59
] Preliminary data suggest that proton radiation therapy is associated with a lower risk of radiation-induced malignancy in survivors of heritable retinoblastoma.
In a nonrandomized study that compared two contemporary cohorts of patients with heritable retinoblastoma who were treated with either photon or proton radiation therapy, the 10-year cumulative incidence of radiation-induced SNs was significantly different between the two groups (0% for proton radiation vs. 14% for photon radiation,
P
= .015).[
60
]
EBRT in infants causes growth failure of the orbital bones and results in cosmetic deformity. EBRT also increases the risk of SNs in children with heritable retinoblastoma.
Brachytherapy (plaque radiation therapy).
Indications for plaque radiation therapy include solitary tumors with a diameter ranging between 6 mm and 15 mm, tumor thickness of 10 mm or less, and tumor location of more than 3 mm from the optic disc or fovea. The most commonly used radioisotope is  iodine I 125, although others such as iridium Ir 192 and ruthenium Ru 106 are also effective. In combination with the appropriate use of chemotherapy and other forms of focal consolidation, brachytherapy can be very effective in the treatment of localized retinal tumors that are not amenable to other means of local therapy.[

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Transplant surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy.  Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis. Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.[
3
-
5
] Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[
3
,
6
,
7
] Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer

Treatment of Unilateral Intraocular Retinoblastoma
Treatment options for unilateral intraocular retinoblastoma include the following:
Enucleation for large intraocular tumors, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy based on pathology risk, when the eye cannot be saved
.
Conservative ocular salvage approaches when the eye and vision can be saved
:
Chemoreduction with either  systemic  or intra-arterial chemotherapy with or without intravitreal chemotherapy.
Local treatments, including cryotherapy, thermotherapy, and plaque radiation therapy.
Enucleation with or without adjuvant chemotherapy
Because  unilateral disease is usually massive and there is often no
expectation that useful vision can be preserved, up-front surgery (enucleation) is
commonly performed. Careful examination of the enucleated specimen by an experienced pathologist is necessary to determine whether high-risk features for metastatic disease are present. These
high-risk features
include the following:[

Anterior chamber seeding.
Massive choroidal involvement.
Tumor beyond the lamina cribrosa.
Scleral and extrascleral extension.
Pre-enucleation magnetic resonance imaging has low sensitivity and specificity for the detection of high-risk pathology.[
7
]
High-risk pathology has been associated with the presence of minimal dissemination in bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid using quantitative polymerase chain reaction for detection of
CRX
or GD2 synthase. In a group of 96 children with nonmetastatic retinoblastoma and high-risk pathology, the 3-year disease-free survival rate was 78% for patients with detectable minimal dissemination, compared with 98% for those without detectable disease (
P
= .004).[
8
]
Systemic adjuvant therapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide or with vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide has been used to prevent the development of metastatic disease in patients with certain high-risk features assessed by pathological review after enucleation.[

The Children’s Oncology Group
ARET0332 (NCT00335738)
trial prospectively studied the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in 321 eligible children with newly diagnosed enucleated unilateral retinoblastoma. Central histopathological review was performed for all patients' pathology slides. Defined indications for adjuvant chemotherapy included massive choroid replacement defined as posterior uveal invasion grades IIC and IID, any posterior uveal involvement less than 3 mm with concomitant optic nerve involvement, and optic nerve involvement posterior to the lamina cribrosa. Treatment consisted of six cycles of carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine administered every 4 weeks.[

and

Central review of enucleated eyes by ophthalmic pathologists identified a group of children (19% of all eligible patients) who were misclassified by the institutional pathology report.
The importance of universal guidelines for handling and interpreting retinoblastoma specimens is instrumental in the recognition and categorization of high-risk features.
For all patients on the study, the overall 2-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 98%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was 99%.
For patients with high-risk features requiring adjuvant chemotherapy, the 2-year EFS rate was 96%.
For patients with low-risk features for whom observation was indicated, the 2-year EFS rate was 99%.
The combination of extensive involvement of both the choroid and the optic nerve  posterior to the lamina cribrosa represents the highest risk of recurrence and supports the need for more intensive chemotherapy for this group.
The average time to first recurrence was less than 12 months, and the time to death after recurrence was approximately 8 months.
Conservative ocular salvage approaches
Conservative ocular salvage approaches, such as systemic chemotherapy and local-control treatments, may be offered in an attempt to save the eye and preserve vision.[
9
] Ocular salvage rates correlate with intraocular grouping. The possibility of saving the eye without the use of external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) exceeds 80% for children with early intraocular disease.  However, the ocular outcomes for children with advanced intraocular disease are poor  using systemic chemotherapy and local treatments, with less than 40% ocular salvage rates, even after the use of EBRT.[
10
] Plaque brachytherapy has been used as a salvage therapy for patients with unilateral retinoblastoma. In one series, 12 eyes in 12 children were treated with ruthenium plaque brachytherapy. Globe salvage was achieved in 75% of the patients. The ultimate local control rate was 66%.[
11
]
Caution must be used when delaying enucleation by extending treatment with systemic chemotherapy when tumor control does not appear to be possible, particularly for Group E eyes. Pre-enucleation chemotherapy for eyes with advanced intraocular disease may result in downstaging and underestimate the pathological evidence of extraretinal and extraocular disease, thus increasing the risk of dissemination.[
12
]
The delivery of chemotherapy via ophthalmic artery cannulation as initial treatment for advanced unilateral retinoblastoma appears to be more effective than systemic chemotherapy for chemoreduction, particularly for Group D eyes.[

] In a multidisciplinary state-of-the-art center, intra-arterial chemotherapy to treat patients with advanced intraocular unilateral retinoblastoma may result in ocular salvage rates of approximately 70% to 90%.[

Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy (Ophthalmic Artery Infusion of Chemotherapy)
section.
Electroretinography, a technique that measures the electrical responses of various cell types in the retina, including the photoreceptors, can be used to assess retinal function during and after treatment with intra-arterial chemotherapy. In one study, pretreatment electroretinography correlated with final visual acuity after treatment with intra-arterial chemotherapy, suggesting that this technique may potentially be used to help with treatment strategy decisions and prioritization of interventions.[

The following is an example of a national and/or institutional clinical trial that is currently being conducted:
ARET2121 (NCT05504291)
(A Study to Give Treatment Inside the Eye to Treat Retinoblastoma)
:
This trial is exploring the feasibility of incorporating intravitreal melphalan injections during neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy (carboplatin, vincristine, and etoposide).  Patients are eligible if they have unilateral Group D retinoblastoma with vitreous seeding or bilateral retinoblastoma with the worst eye categorized as Group D and vitreous seeding.
Follow-up after treatment of unilateral intraocular retinoblastoma
Because a proportion of children who present with unilateral retinoblastoma
will eventually develop disease in the opposite eye, these children undergo genetic counseling and testing and periodic examinations
of the unaffected eye, regardless of the treatment they receive.  Asynchronous bilateral disease occurs most
frequently in patients with affected parents and in children diagnosed during the first months of life.
Treatment of Bilateral Intraocular Retinoblastoma
The goal of therapy for bilateral retinoblastoma is ocular and vision preservation and the delay or avoidance of EBRT and enucleation.
Treatment options for bilateral intraocular retinoblastoma include the following:
Enucleation for large intraocular tumors, followed by pathology-based, risk-adapted chemotherapy when the eye and vision cannot be saved.
Conservative ocular salvage approaches when the eye and vision can be saved:
Chemoreduction with either systemic or intra-arterial chemotherapy with or without intravitreal chemotherapy.
Local treatments, including cryotherapy, thermotherapy, and plaque radiation therapy.
EBRT.
Intraocular tumor burden is usually asymmetrical, and treatment is dictated by the most advanced eye.
 Systemic therapy is generally  selected based on the eye with more extensive disease. Treatment options described for unilateral disease may be applied to one or both affected eyes in patients with bilateral disease. While up-front enucleation of an advanced eye and risk-adapted adjuvant chemotherapy may be required, a more conservative approach using primary chemoreduction and aggressive local treatments with close monitoring for response is usually the treatment of choice.
EBRT is now reserved for patients whose eyes do not respond adequately to primary systemic or intra-arterial chemotherapy and local consolidation.[
20
]
Several large centers have published trial results that used systemic chemotherapy in conjunction with aggressive local consolidation for patients with bilateral disease.[
21
] The backbone of  chemoreduction has generally been carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine. While the less toxic combination of vincristine and carboplatin can provide disease control for a significant proportion of patients, ocular salvage appears to be superior when etoposide is included in the regimen.[
22
][
Level of evidence B1
] A single-institution study achieved similar results when topotecan was substituted for etoposide in a combination regimen.[

Level of evidence C3
] While tandem administration is feasible, bilateral administrations increase the risk of systemic toxicity caused by melphalan exposure.[
25
] In these circumstances, intra-arterial chemotherapy with single-agent carboplatin may be used to treat the less-advanced eye during the tandem procedure.[
26
] These treatments should only be performed in  an experienced center with a state-of-the-art treatment infrastructure and a dedicated multidisciplinary team. For more information, see the sections on
Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy (Ophthalmic Artery Infusion of Chemotherapy)
and
Intravitreal Chemotherapy
.
For patients with large intraocular tumor burdens with subretinal or vitreous seeds (Group D eyes), the administration of higher doses of carboplatin coupled with subtenon carboplatin, and the addition of lower doses of EBRT (36 Gy) for patients with persistent disease has been explored. Using this intensive approach, eye survival may approach a rate of 70% at 60 months.[

Treatment of Extraocular Retinoblastoma
In This Section
Treatment of Orbital and Locoregional Retinoblastoma
Treatment of CNS Disease
Treatment of Synchronous Trilateral Retinoblastoma
Treatment of Extracranial Metastatic Retinoblastoma
Current Clinical Trials
In high-income countries, few patients with retinoblastoma present with extraocular
disease.  Extraocular disease may be localized to the soft tissues surrounding
the eye or to the optic nerve beyond the margin of resection.  However, further
extension may progress into the brain and meninges, with subsequent seeding of the
spinal fluid and as distant metastatic disease involving the lungs, bones,
and bone marrow.
Treatment of Orbital and Locoregional Retinoblastoma
Orbital retinoblastoma occurs as a result of tumor progression through the emissary vessels and sclera. For this reason, transscleral disease is considered to be extraocular and should be treated as such. Orbital retinoblastoma is isolated in 60% to 70% of cases.
Treatment options for extraocular retinoblastoma (orbital and locoregional) include the following:
Chemotherapy.
Radiation therapy.
Enucleation (for extraocular extension).
Treatment includes systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. With this treatment approach, 60% to 85% of patients can be cured. Because most recurrences occur in the central nervous system (CNS), regimens that include drugs with well-documented CNS penetration are used.
The Children’s Oncology Group (COG) performed a prospective international trial (
ARET0321 [NCT00554788]
) that included patients with extraocular retinoblastoma. The study showed that intensified therapy improved the outcomes of patients with stage II, III or IVa disease, compared with historical controls.  However, stage IVb patients need more effective therapy.[
1
][
Level of evidence B4
]
Patients with stage II or III retinoblastoma (n = 19) received four cycles of chemotherapy (vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide) followed by involved-field radiation therapy (45 Gy).
The median follow-up was 7.3 years.
The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 88.1%.
Patients with stage IVa retinoblastoma (n = 18) received four cycles of induction therapy (noted above). Patients with more than a partial response underwent autologous hematopoietic stem cell support. Patients with residual tumor after chemotherapy received radiation therapy.
The 3-year EFS and OS rates were 76.7%.
Patients with stage IVb retinoblastoma (n = 20) received the same treatment as patients with stage IVa disease.
The 1-year EFS rate was 28.3%, and the OS rate was 42.1%.
The 3-year EFS rate was 14.2%, and the OS rate was 12.3%.
Six patients developed secondary malignancies. There was one case each of osteosarcoma (8 years after treatment), thyroid papillary carcinoma (9 years after treatment), glioblastoma multiforme (8 years after treatment), large B-cell Epstein-Barr virus–associated lymphoproliferative disorder (8 months after treatment), acute myeloid leukemia (2 years after treatment), and alveolar soft part sarcoma of the bladder (5 years after treatment). Five patients had unilateral retinoblastoma, two of whom received radiation therapy (one each with unilateral and bilateral).
For patients with macroscopic orbital disease, delay of surgery until response to chemotherapy is achieved (usually after receiving two or three courses of treatment) has been effective. Patients then undergo enucleation  and receive an additional four to six courses of chemotherapy. During consolidation, the patient receives local control therapies with orbital irradiation (40–45 Gy). Using this approach, orbital exenteration is not indicated.[
2
]
Patients with isolated involvement of the optic nerve at the transsection level are considered to have extraocular disease and are treated using  systemic therapy, similar to that used for macroscopic orbital disease, and irradiation of the entire orbit (36 Gy) with a 10 Gy boost to the chiasm (total of 46 Gy).[
3
]
Treatment of CNS Disease
Intracranial dissemination occurs by direct extension through the optic nerve. The prognosis for these patients is dismal. Treatment includes platinum-based, intensive systemic chemotherapy and CNS-directed therapy. Although intrathecal chemotherapy has been used traditionally, there is no preclinical or clinical evidence to support its use.
Treatment options for extraocular retinoblastoma (CNS disease) include the following:
Systemic chemotherapy  and CNS-directed therapy with radiation therapy.
Systemic chemotherapy followed by myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell rescue with or without radiation therapy.
The administration of radiation therapy to these patients is controversial. Responses have been observed with craniospinal radiation using 25 Gy to 35 Gy to the entire craniospinal axis and a boost (10 Gy) to sites of measurable disease.[
1
]
The COG conducted a prospective study (
ARET0321 [NCT00554788]
) of patients with extraocular retinoblastoma, which included patients with stage IVb disease who were treated with four cycles of induction therapy (vincristine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide).[
1
][
Level of evidence B4
]
Patients who had more than a partial response were then treated with high-dose carboplatin, thiotepa, and etoposide with autologous hematopoietic stem cell support.
Patients with residual disease after chemotherapy received radiation therapy.
In the 20 patients with stage IVb disease, the 1-year EFS rate was 28.3%, and the OS rate was 42.1%. The 3-year EFS rate was 14.2%, and the OS rate was 12.3%.
Treatment of Synchronous Trilateral Retinoblastoma
Trilateral retinoblastoma is usually associated with a pineal lesion or, less commonly, a suprasellar lesion.[
4
-
6
] In patients with the heritable form of retinoblastoma, CNS disease is less likely the result of metastatic or regional spread than of a primary intracranial focus, such as a pineal tumor. The prognosis for patients with trilateral retinoblastoma is very poor. Most patients die of disseminated neuraxis disease in less than 9 months.[
7
,
8
] However, with increased surveillance  and aggressive therapy, there has been improvement in survival, from 6% (patients treated before 1995) to 44% (patients treated after 1996).[
9
]
Treatment options for synchronous trilateral retinoblastoma include the following:
Systemic chemotherapy followed by surgery and myeloablative chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.
Systemic chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiation therapy.
While pineoblastomas occurring in older patients are sensitive to radiation therapy, current strategies are directed towards avoiding radiation by using intensive chemotherapy followed by consolidation with myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell rescue. This approach is similar to those being used in the treatment of brain tumors in infants.[

Treatment of Extracranial Metastatic Retinoblastoma
Treatment options for extracranial metastatic retinoblastoma include the following:
Systemic chemotherapy followed by myeloablative chemotherapy with stem cell rescue and radiation therapy.
Hematogenous metastases may develop in the bones, bone marrow, and, less frequently, the liver. The COG conducted a prospective international trial (
ARET0321 [NCT00554788]
) for patients with extraocular retinoblastoma. The study showed that intensified therapy improved the outcomes of patients with stage IVa disease.[

Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Progressive or Recurrent Retinoblastoma
Current Clinical Trials
The prognosis for a patient with progressive or recurrent retinoblastoma
depends on the site and extent of the progression or recurrence and previous treatment received.
The introduction of intravenous chemotherapy for the treatment of retinoblastoma in the early 1990s revolutionized retinoblastoma management. In a retrospective review of 869 eyes in 551 patients with retinoblastoma who were treated with chemoreduction,  64% of the eyes experienced a recurrence and 94% of the recurrences or new tumors were detected within the first 3 years of treatment.  Risk factors for recurrence included the following:[
1
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Younger patient age at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.02 per 1 month decrease;
P
= .02).
More advanced International Classification of Retinoblastoma group (OR, 1.24 per 1 more advanced group;
P
= .01).
Closer tumor distance to the optic disc  (OR, 1.11 per 1 mm decrease;
P
= .03).
Presentation with subretinal seeds (OR, 1.66;
P
= .02).
Presence of germline pathogenic variants, which contributed to the risk of new tumor formation.
Intraocular and extraocular recurrences have very different prognoses and are treated in different ways.
Treatment of Progressive or Recurrent Intraocular Retinoblastoma
Treatment options for progressive or recurrent intraocular retinoblastoma include the following:
Enucleation.
Radiation therapy (external-beam or plaque radiation therapy).
Local treatments (cryotherapy or thermotherapy).
Salvage chemotherapy (systemic or intra-arterial chemotherapy).
Intravitreal chemotherapy, especially for refractory or recurrent vitreous seeding.
For more information about the use and potential applications of intra-arterial and intravitreal chemotherapy, see the sections on
Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy (Ophthalmic Artery Infusion of Chemotherapy)
and
Intravitreal Chemotherapy
.
New intraocular tumors can arise in patients with the heritable form of disease whose eyes have been treated with local control measures only because every cell in the retina carries the
RB1
variant. This event should not be considered a recurrence. Even with previous treatment consisting of chemoreduction and local control measures in very young patients with heritable retinoblastoma, surveillance may detect new tumors at an early stage. Additional local control therapy, including plaque radiation therapy, can successfully eradicate  these tumors.[
2
]
When the recurrence or progression of retinoblastoma is confined to the eye and is small, the prognosis for sight and survival may be excellent with local therapy only.[
3
][
Level of evidence C3
]  If the recurrence or progression is confined to the
eye but is extensive, the prognosis for sight is poor; however, survival
remains excellent.
Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) into the ophthalmic artery has been effective in patients who relapse after systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy.[
4
,
5
] Rescue IAC, usually with other agents, has also been used after primary IAC.[
6
]  Plaque radiation therapy is an option for patients who have a retinoblastoma recurrence after IAC treatment.[
7
][
Level of evidence C3
] Radiation therapy should be considered for patients who have not been previously irradiated. Finally, enucleation may be required in cases of progressive disease after all eye-salvaging treatments have failed.
Treatment of Progressive or Recurrent Extraocular Retinoblastoma
Treatment options for progressive or recurrent extraocular retinoblastoma include the following:
Systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy for orbital disease.
Systemic chemotherapy followed by myeloablative chemotherapy with stem cell rescue and radiation therapy for extraorbital disease.
Recurrence in the orbit after enucleation is treated with aggressive chemotherapy in addition to local radiation therapy because of the high risk of metastatic disease.[
8
][
Level of evidence C1
] After enucleation for recurrence, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging with orbital coils can be helpful in distinguishing orbital recurrence from postsurgical enhancement.[
9
]
If the recurrence or progression is extraocular, the
chance of survival is poor.[
10
]  However, the use of intensive systemic chemotherapy and consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue may improve the chance of a cure, particularly for patients with extracranial recurrence. For patients with disease recurrence after those intensive approaches, clinical trials
may be considered.  For more information, see the
Treatment of Extraocular Retinoblastoma
section.
Treatment Options Under Clinical Evaluation for Progressive or Recurrent Retinoblastoma
One approach under investigation for patients with progressive intraocular retinoblastoma includes the use of an oncolytic adenovirus that targets

Late Effects of Retinoblastoma Therapy
In This Section
Subsequent Neoplasms (SNs)
Other Late Effects
In a report from the Retinoblastoma Survivor Study (N = 470), 87% of survivors of retinoblastoma (mean age, 43 years; median follow-up, 42 years) had at least one medical condition and 71% had a severe or life-threatening condition.  Compared with patients without retinoblastoma, the adjusted relative risk of a chronic condition in survivors was 1.4 (
P
< .01). The relative risk of a grade 3 or 4 condition was 7.6 (
P
< .01).  After excluding ocular conditions and subsequent neoplasms (SNs), this excess risk was found to persist only for patients with bilateral disease.[
1
]
Subsequent Neoplasms (SNs)
SNs are the most common cause of death in patients with retinoblastoma. SNs contribute to about 50% of deaths in patients with both bilateral disease and genetically defined heritable retinoblastoma.[
2
-
4
] Survivors of retinoblastoma have a high risk of developing SNs.
Factors that influence the risk of SNs include the following:
Heritable retinoblastoma.
Patients with heritable retinoblastoma have a markedly increased
incidence of SNs, independent of treatment with radiation therapy.[
2
,
3
,
5
] In a German series of 643 patients with heritable retinoblastoma, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy was the only significant risk factor for the onset of second cancers outside the periorbital region.[
3
] A possible association between the type of
RB1
variant and incidence of SNs may exist, with complete loss of
RB1
activity associated with a higher incidence of SNs.[
6
] Patients who are heterozygous for regular-penetrance
RB1
variants may be at a higher risk of developing SNs than patients with incomplete-penetrance
RB1
variants.[
7
] Regular penetrance refers to patients with heritable disease and classic multifocal bilateral tumors. Incomplete penetrance, while rare, is a clinical phenotype in which affected family members may not develop retinoblastoma or they present with unilateral disease. With the increase in survival of patients with heritable retinoblastoma, it has become apparent that they are also at risk of developing epithelial cancers late in adulthood. A marked increase in mortality from lung, bladder, and other epithelial cancers has been described.[
8
,
9
]
In a large series from two institutions, 2,053 patients with retinoblastoma (diagnosed between 1914–2016) were identified, with a maximum of 70 years of follow-up. Most deaths occurred in patients with hereditary retinoblastoma (518 of 1,129), and 267 of these deaths were caused by SNs. Increased  risk of death resulting from cancers of the pancreas, large intestines, and kidney were reported. Overall risk of SNs was greater for patients who were treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with patients who were treated with radiation therapy alone, although patterns varied by organ site.   In a cohort of 143 retinoblastoma survivors diagnosed between 1997 and 2006, continued improvements in mortality were seen.[
4
][
Level of evidence C1
] For patients with nonhereditary retinoblastoma, only 27 deaths in 924 patients were attributed to SNs.
Among retinoblastoma survivors with heritable retinoblastoma, those with an inherited germline pathogenic variant are at a slightly higher risk of developing an SN than are those with a de novo variant. Melanoma was the most common SN seen in patients with germline pathogenic variants.[
10
]
Past treatment for retinoblastoma with radiation therapy.
The cumulative incidence of SNs was reported to be 26% (± 10%) in nonirradiated patients and 58% (± 10%) in irradiated patients by 50
years after diagnosis of retinoblastoma, resulting in a rate of about 1% per year.[
11
]
A German series of 633 patients with heritable retinoblastoma demonstrated a 5-year survival rate of 93%. However, 40 years later, only 80% of patients survived, with most  succumbing to radiation-induced SNs (hazard ratio, approximately 3).[
12
] Other studies analyzing cohorts of patients treated with more advanced radiation planning and delivery technology have reported the SN rates to be about 9.4% in nonirradiated patients and about 30.4% in irradiated patients.[
13
]
In a nonrandomized study that compared two contemporary cohorts of patients with hereditary retinoblastoma who were treated with either photon (n = 31) or proton (n = 55) therapy, the 10-year cumulative incidence of radiation-induced SNs was significantly different between the two groups (0% for proton radiation vs. 14% for photon radiation;
P
= .015).[
14
] Longer follow-up is required to further define the risk of SNs associated with proton radiation.
The most common SN is sarcoma, specifically osteosarcoma, followed by soft tissue sarcoma and melanoma. These malignancies may occur inside or outside of the radiation field, although most are radiation induced. The carcinogenic effect of radiation therapy is associated with the dose delivered, particularly for subsequent sarcomas. A step-wise increase is apparent at all dose categories. In irradiated patients, two-thirds of SNs occur within irradiated tissue, and one-third of SNs occur outside the radiation field.[
5
,
11
,

,
15
]
In a cohort of 952 irradiated survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma who were originally diagnosed between 1914 and 2006, 105 bone sarcomas and 125 soft tissue sarcomas were identified. Approximately two-thirds of these cancers occurred in the head and neck. The  incidence rates were 2,000-fold higher for bone sarcomas and 500-fold higher for soft tissue sarcomas than was expected in the general population.  Head and neck bone and soft tissue sarcomas were diagnosed in early childhood and continued into adulthood, with a 60-year cumulative incidence of 6.8% for bone sarcomas and 9.3% for soft tissue sarcomas.  Bone and soft tissue sarcomas diagnosed elsewhere in the body were increased 169-fold and 45.7-fold, respectively, compared with the general population.  Bone sarcomas primarily occurred in the long bones during adolescence. The incidence of soft tissue sarcomas was rare until age 30 years, when it rose steeply (60-year cumulative incidence, 6.6%), particularly for females (9.4%).   The soft tissue sarcomas that occurred in females were leiomyosarcomas  and were mainly located in the abdomen and pelvis.[

Age at time of radiation therapy.
The risk of SNs also appears to depend on the patient's age at the time that external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is administered, especially in children younger than 12 months. The histopathological types of SNs may be influenced by age.[
13
,
17
,
18
]
Previous SN.
Patients who survive SNs are at a sevenfold increased risk of developing another SN.[
19
] The risk increases an additional threefold for patients treated with radiation therapy.[
20
]
The issue of balancing long-term tumor control with the consequences of chemotherapy is unresolved.    Most patients who receive chemotherapy are exposed to etoposide, which has been associated with secondary leukemia in patients without a predisposition to cancer. However, most patients are exposed at modest rates when compared with the risks associated with EBRT in heritable retinoblastoma.
Despite the known increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with the use of etoposide, patients with heritable retinoblastoma are not at an increased risk of developing this SN.[
21
-
23
] An initial report conducted by informal survey methods described 15 patients who developed AML after chemotherapy. One-half of the patients also received radiation therapy.[
22
] This finding has not been substantiated by formal studies. In a  single-institution study of 245 patients who received etoposide, only 1 patient developed acute promyelocytic leukemia after 79 months.[
21
] Additionally, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program calculated standardized incidence rates for secondary hematopoietic malignancies in 34,867 survivors of childhood cancer. The observed-to-expected ratio of secondary AML in patients treated for retinoblastoma was zero.[
24
]
Survival from SNs is certainly suboptimal and varies widely across studies.[
8
,
25
-
29
]  However, with advances in therapy, it is essential that all SNs in survivors of retinoblastoma be treated with curative intent.[
30
]
Other Late Effects
Other late effects that may occur after treatment for retinoblastoma include the following:
Diminished orbital growth.
Orbital growth is somewhat diminished after enucleation. However, the impact of enucleation on orbital volume may be minimized after placement of an orbital implant.[
31
] Asymmetry of orbital size that develops after enucleation is greater in younger children and infants, but enucleation after age 3 years does not result in orbital asymmetry.[
32
]
Visual-field deficits.
Patients with retinoblastoma demonstrate a variety of long-term visual-field defects after treatment for their intraocular disease.  These defects are related to tumor size, location,  and treatment method.[
33
]
One study of visual acuity after treatment with systemic chemotherapy and local ophthalmic therapy was conducted in 54 eyes of 40 children. After a mean follow-up of 68 months, 27 eyes (50%) had a final visual acuity of 20/40 or better, and 36 eyes (67%) had a final visual acuity of 20/200 or better. The clinical factors that predicted visual acuity of 20/40 or better were a tumor margin of at least 3 mm from the foveola and optic disc and an absence of subretinal fluid.[
34
]
Strabismus.
In a study of 42 survivors of retinoblastoma (64 eyes) who underwent successful conservative treatment,  69% of patients were noted to have strabismus at final follow-up (mean, 93.7 months). Exotropia was  the most common type of strabismus reported. Conservative treatments included intravenous chemotherapy (62 eyes), intra-arterial chemotherapy (10 eyes), brachytherapy (11 eyes), transpupillary thermotherapy (22 eyes), cryotherapy (47 eyes), and external-beam radiation therapy (4 eyes). On multivariate analysis, only foveal involvement was found to be a significant risk factor for developing strabismus (
P
< .001).[
35
]
Hearing loss.
Because systemic carboplatin is now commonly used in the treatment of retinoblastoma, concern has been raised about hearing loss related to therapy. For more information about treatment, see  the sections on
Treatment of Intraocular Retinoblastoma
and
Treatment of Extraocular Retinoblastoma
.
While two large studies that included children treated with six cycles of carboplatin-containing therapy (18.6 mg/kg per cycle) showed an incidence of treatment-related hearing loss of lower than 1%,[
36
,
37
] a separate series documented some degree of hearing loss in 17% of patients.[
38
] In the latter study, younger age (younger than 6 months at the time of treatment) and higher carboplatin systemic exposures correlated with an increased risk of ototoxicity.[
38
,
39
]
Neurocognitive functioning.
Early studies of intellectual functioning in survivors of retinoblastoma suggested above average intelligence among survivors of bilateral disease compared with unaffected siblings and the general population, especially in those who were blind as a result of their disease.[
40
-
42
]
Later studies have yielded mixed results with conflicting findings, in part, resulting from the low test-retest reliability of measures used to assess cognitive outcomes at a very young age, as well as temporal differences in treatment exposures.
Serial assessment of cognitive and adaptive functioning in a group of survivors younger than 6 years revealed declines in developmental functioning over time, with the most pronounced declines observed in patients with 13q deletions.[
43
]
Further longitudinal follow-up of this cohort identified improvement in adaptive functioning in all treatment groups and improvement in cognitive functioning in survivors who were treated with enucleation alone between the ages of 5 years and 10 years.[
44
]
At age 10 years, overall functioning was generally within the average range, although estimated intelligence quotient was significantly below the normative mean for children who were treated with enucleation alone.[
44
]
A study of very long-term adult survivors of retinoblastoma, who were on average 33 years postdiagnosis, demonstrated largely average cognitive functioning across domains of intelligence, memory, attention, and executive function.[
