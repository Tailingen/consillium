A Study of SHR-1210 in Combination With Apatinib in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC)
This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase II study of intravenous (IV) SHR-1210 at 200mg,q2w in combination with Apatinib at two dose levels in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

The study is composed of two parts. Part 1 of the study will determine the safety ,tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SHR-1210 in combination with Apatinib.

Part 2 includes a randomized comparison of Apatinib 250mg/d or 500mg/d plus SHR-1210 .

Subject's tumors will be screened at baseline for EGFR mutations, EML4-ALK translocation, and PD-L1 expression.But positive tumor PD-L1 expression will not be required for enrollment.

Part 1: Incidence and grade of adverse events (AEs) and Serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs and SAEs assessed by NCI-CTCAE v4.03, up to 24 weeks|Part 2:Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 6 months
Part 1: Apatinib plasma concentrations and serum SHR-1210 concentrations, Apatinib plasma concentrations and serum SHR-1210 concentrations in Expansion cohort, Cycles 1-2(each cycle is 28 days)|Part 1:Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Apatinib and SHR-1210, Cmax of Apatinib and SHR-1210 in Expansion cohort, Cycles 1-2(each cycle is 28 days)|Part 1:Objective response rate (ORR) - RECIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 6 months|Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (DoR) per RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS per RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival rate at 12 months (OSR12), OSR12 will be calculated based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of Overall survival at 12 months, Up to approximately 1 years|Part 1: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hrs, AUC[0-24], AUC\[0-24\] of Apatinib and SHR-1210 in Expansion cohort, Cycles 1-2(each cycle is 28 days)
SHR-1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against Programmed death 1(PD-1). Apatinib is a new kind of selective Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2(VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). A disease-control rate of 61.1% and a mPFS of 4.7 months were showed in Apatinib phase II study in patients with NSCLC.
