Nivolumab-ipilimumab and Chemoradiation for Cervical Cancer
A total of 112 patients with locally advanced cervical cancer will be randomized 1:1 to standard therapy with cisplatin-based chemoradiation or nivolumab-ipilimumab induction followed by cisplatin-based chemoradiation. The primary outcome will be 3-year disease-free survival.

DRUG: Nivolumab 40 mg in 4 ml Injection|DRUG: Ipilimumab 200 MG in 40 ML Injection|RADIATION: Chemoradiation
3-year progression-free survival, No evidence of disease recurrence/regrowth after 3 years of follow-up, 3 years
3-year overall survival, Rate of survival 3 years after the end of chemoradiation, 3 years|Objective response rate, RECIST response, 90 days after the end of chemoradiation|Response duration, Time from maximum response to disease progression, Through study completion, an average of 3 year|To evaluate health related quality of life (HRQoL): defined as the change from baseline of disease-related symptoms and quality of life of patients undergoing treatment Nivolumab-ipilimumab and Chemoradiation for Cervical Cancer, Evaluate health related quality of life using the instrument EORTC QLQ-C30 v3 based on European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). The EORTC QLQ-C30 v3 questionnaire, consisting of 30 questions covering 15 domains, divided into three distinct scales: state scale global health and quality of life (it has only one domain, global health measure); functional scale (physical function, role performance, emotional function, cognitive function and social function domains); and symptom scale (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties). The scores on each scale range from 0 - 100. The global and functional health scales indicate better quality of life as their score approaches 100. For the symptoms scale, the analysis is inverse, with better performance for quality of life when the scores approach the score minimum (zero)., Baseline (time from screening - before starting treatment) and at the end of treatment (56 days after the last dose of radiotherapy).|Evaluate health related quality of life using supplemental cervical cancer module (EORTC CX24) to evaluate patients submitted to treatment with Nivolumab-ipilimumab and Chemoradiation for Cervical Cancer., The EORTC - CX24 questionnaire contains 24 questions, divided into three multiple-item scales and six single-item scales, of which 11 refer to symptoms (questions 31-37, 39 and 41-43), three about body image. (questions 45-47), four questions on sexual/vaginal function (questions 50-53), one on lymphedema (question 38), one for evaluation of peripheral neuropathy (question 40), one for evaluation of menopausal symptoms (question 44) ), one on sexual concerns (question 48), one on sexual activity (question 49) and one on sexual pleasure (question 54). The answers are transformed into a score from 0 - 100 and calculated separately for each scale., Baseline (time from screening - before starting treatment) and at the end of treatment (56 days after the last dose of radiotherapy).|Treatment-related toxicity, Treatment-related toxicity according to CTCAE version 4.0 (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events ), Through study completion, an average of 3 year
Patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, FIGO Stage IB2-IB3 node positive or Stage IIB-IVA will be randomized to conventional cisplatin-based chemo-radiation or to 4 cycles of induction immunotherapy with nivolumab 1mg/kg and ipilimumab 3mg/kg every 3 weeks, followed by cisplatin chemo-radiation with concurrent nivolumab 240mg every 2 weeks. Primary outcome will be 3-year progression-free survival.
