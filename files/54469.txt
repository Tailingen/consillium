Short Contact Protocols to Reduce Pain During 10% ALA Gel Red-light Photodynamic Therapy of Actinic Keratoses
The goal of this clinical trial is to see if shorter Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) treatment times will still be effective at treating actinic keratoses (AK) while reducing or eliminating the pain that patients sometimes experience during conventional PDT treatment. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Will the application of the nanoemulsion (10% ALA gel), in the absence of occlusion, still achieve significant inflammation and lesion clearance?
* Will shortened incubation times of Ameluz still achieve significant inflammation and lesion clearance?
* Will the new test regimens achieve reduced pain during illumination?
* Will the new test regimens be safe?

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment regimens, which will determine the length of time that the topical medication will incubate on the face before red light exposure in PDT treatments. The incubation period will be either 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or 60 minutes.
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: Topical aminolevulinate (10% ALA gel)|DEVICE: Red light illumination
Treatment Efficacy based on Participant AK Lesion Clearance, To test the hypothesis that a short-contact PDT protocol with Ameluz and red light will produce lesion clearance outcomes that are statistically non-inferior to the traditional, painful protocol. This will be measured by Clinical Efficacy, which will be based on the AK lesion counts and lesion clearance rate after two treatments., Lesion clearance at Visit 3 (month 2) and at Visit 4 (month 6)|Differences in Pain Level Reported Throughout Exposure to Red Light, To demonstrate that a short-contact PDT protocol with Ameluz and red light generates less pain during illumination than the standard FDA-approved protocol currently used. Pain will be reported by the participants during illumination will be measured on a subjective 11-point visual-analog scale (VAS) at 1 min, 5 min, and 10 min., Pain measured during illumination with red light (during a 10 min period) at Visit 1 and at Visit 3
Differences in Scores Reported on Patient Satisfaction Survey, To test the hypothesis that a short-contact PDT protocol with Ameluz and red light will be better tolerated and provide higher patient satisfaction than the currently practiced protocol. Participant satisfaction will be measured by completing a Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire survey., At month 6|Number of Participant Reported Adverse Events and side effects, Overall AE Profile and Safety of treatment will be measured using an Adverse Events- Patients' side effects log and Investigator assessment., At day 2-4 post-treatment
