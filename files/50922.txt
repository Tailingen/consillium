Chemotherapy Combination With Local Radiotherapy and rhGM-CSF for Oligometastatic Stage IV NSCLC Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine whether chemotherapy combination with local radiotherapy and rhGM-CSF is safe, effective in the treatment of oligometastatic stage IV NSCLC patients.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
BIOLOGICAL: rhGM-CSF|DRUG: Pemetrexed|RADIATION: Local Radiotherapy|DRUG: Single agent
PFS, Progression-Free-Survival, 2 years
Abscopal effect rate, Radiotherapy-induced immune-mediated tumour regression at sites distant to the irradiated field, At the time point of 4 weeks after completion of rhGM-CSF|OS, Overall survival, 2 years
The purpose of this study is to determine whether chemotherapy combination with local radiotherapy and recombined human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor(rhGM-CSF) is safe, effective in the treatment of oligometastatic stage IV NSCLC patients who were PR or SD after first-line chemotherapyï¼Œand to observe the abscopal effect, whether the scheme can improve PFS and OS.
