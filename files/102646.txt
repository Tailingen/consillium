AST-021p Study in Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and optimal Immunogenic dose of therapeutic cancer vaccine (AST-021p) in patients With advanced solid tumors

A phase 1 study
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: AST-021p
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by AST-021p, After AST-021p administration in patients with advance solid tumor, safety and tolerance are assessed for each dose group(1.2mg,2.4mg, 3.6mg \&4.8mg)

Safety and tolerance evaluation variables :

1)adverse events 2) Vital signs 3)Physical examination 4) ECOG performance evaluation 5)ECG examination 6)Laboratory examination, 6weeks after AST-021p administration in each cohort group
Immunogenicity assessment, ASP-021p specific IFN-γ ELISpot(Interferon Gamma Enzyme-linked immunospot) test results and ASP-021p4 \& ASP-021p5 specific IFN-γ ELISpot ( spots/250,000 Tcell of pre ASP-021p and post ASP-021p), 8weeks after ASP-021p administration (Priming immunization case) or 20weeks after ASP-021p(Priming immunization and Boosting immunization case)|Tumor response assessment, Disease control rate (%), objective response rate(%) and duration of response (days \& weeks), Overall study period approximately up to 5months|Progression-Free Survival rate, PFS rate (%) at End of Study, Overall study period approximately up to 5months|Overall Survival rate, OS rate (%) at End of study, Overall study period approximately up to 5months
Recurrent or advanced solid cancer patients without applicable standard treatments will be included in the 4 dose groups (4 cohort groups- 1.2mg, 2.4mg,3.6mg and 4.8mg) of AST-021p. Participants in each cohort group will be treated 3 times in each dose (3 priming immunications)

This study will apply a modified 3+3 design for dose-escalation.

1 participant will be registered in the lowest dose cohort group(1.2mg) and when the safety and tolerance of the AST-021p(1.2mg) are identified in the the first group, dose will be increased sequentially and accordingly, the safety and tolerance will be assessed for six participants in the other cohort groups (group2(2.4mg), group3(3.6mg) and group4(4.8mg)).

Participants receiving priming immunization only will be assessed up to End of Treatment(EOT) and participants who recive boosting immunization will be evaluated until the end of study(EOS).
