response rate, response rate will be assessed by local MDT every two months, 6 months
overall survival, overall survival will be assessed by researchers every two months during treatment, and telephone follow-up every three month after treatment, 3 years|progression free survival, progression free survival will be assessed by local MDT every two months during treatment, and telephone follow-up every three month after treatment, 3 years
Ras mutant unresectable CRLM patients with primary tumor resection followed by avastin in combination with chemotherapy were included in this study. The tumor response was assessed by local MDT group. Based on tumor response, 58 CRLM patients were classified into two groups (CR+PR vs SD+PD). Primary samples of the two group patients will be sequenced by mass spectrum. After MS sequencing, a prediction model will be estimated. Another 58 CRLM patients will be inclued for validation of the prediction model.
