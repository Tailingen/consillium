CD19 and CD22 Dual-targeted CAR-T Cells for Relapsed or Refractory B-NHL
Although the anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant results in patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. There are patients who resisted anti-CD19 CAR-T cells or with CD19 negative relapse. To make further improvement, combining CD19 and CD22 as dual-targets for CAR-T cells, which adapt the FasT CAR-T cells manufacture technology to shorten the manufacture time and maintain the stemness of CAR-T cells. We launch such a clinical trial using CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cells for patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CD19 and CD22 targeted CAR-T cell therapy.
