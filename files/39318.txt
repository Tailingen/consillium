A Study of E7389 Liposomal Formulation (E7389-LF) Plus Nivolumab in Participants With Solid Tumor
The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of E7389 liposomal formulation (E7389-LF) in combination with nivolumab and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Phase 1b part and to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) of E7389-LF and nivolumab using RP2D in each tumor type in Phase 2 part.
Solid Neoplasms
DRUG: E7389-LF|DRUG: Nivolumab
Phase 1b: Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs are defined as study drug related adverse events (AEs). Toxicity will be evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE 5.0)., Baseline up to Cycle 1 (Cycle length is equal to [=] up to 28 days)|Phase 2: ORR, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The ORR will be assessed by investigator based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Baseline up to End of Treatment (Up to approximately 65 months)
Phase 1b and Phase 2: Number of Participants With AEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or before initiating post anti-cancer treatment, whichever shorter (up to approximately 65 months)|Phase 1b and Phase 2: Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Laboratory Evaluations, Baseline up to End of Treatment (Up to approximately 65 months)|Phase 1b and Phase 2: Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Vital Signs, Baseline up to End of Treatment (Up to approximately 65 months)|Phase 1b and Phase 2: Number of Participants With Clinically Abnormal 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), Baseline up to End of Treatment (Up to approximately 65 months)|Phase 1b and Phase 2: Number of Participants With Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS), Baseline up to End of Treatment (Up to approximately 65 months)|Phase 1b and 2: Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Abnormal Physical Examination Findings, Baseline up to End of Treatment (Up to approximately 65 months)|Phase 1b and Phase 2, Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration of E7389-LF, Phase 1b, Cycle 1 Day 1: 0 to 24 hours, Cycle 1 Days 4 and 8; Phase 2, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8 (Cycle length = up to 28 days)|Phase 1b and Phase 2: Serum Concentration of Nivolumab, Up to Cycle 13 (each Cycle length = up to 28 days)|Phase 1b and Phase 2, Tmax: Time to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of E7389-LF, Phase 1b, Cycle 1 Day 1: 0 to 24 hours, Cycle 1 Days 4 and 8; Phase 2, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8 (Cycle length = up to 28 days)|Phase 1b and Phase 2, AUC: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve Over Time From 0 to Last Measurable Concentration of E7389-LF, Phase 1b, Cycle 1 Day 1: 0 to 24 hours, Cycle 1 Days 4 and 8; Phase 2, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8 (Cycle length = up to 28 days)|Phase 1b and Phase 2, T1/2: Terminal Phase Elimination Half-life of E7389-LF, Phase 1b, Cycle 1 Day 1: 0 to 24 hours, Cycle 1 Days 4 and 8; Phase 2, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8 (Cycle length = up to 28 days)|Phase 1b and Phase 2, CL: Total Body Clearance of E7389-LF, Phase 1b, Cycle 1 Day 1: 0 to 24 hours, Cycle 1 Days 4 and 8; Phase 2, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8 (Cycle length = up to 28 days)|Phase 1b and Phase 2, Vd: Volume of Distribution of E7389-LF, Phase 1b, Cycle 1 Day 1: 0 to 24 hours, Cycle 1 Days 4 and 8; Phase 2, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8 (Cycle length = up to 28 days)|Phase 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first administration of drug to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. The PFS will be assessed by investigator based on RECIST version 1.1., From the first does of the study drug up to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first (up to approximately 65 months)
