TIL Therapy in Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients
Aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in NSCLC patients in a phase II clinical trial.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Combination of TIL Transfer and low dose IL-2
Progression-free rate at 6 months after Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes transfer., Progression-free rate (PFR) (RECIST v1.1 / iRECIST) at 6 months after TIL transfer, defined by the Kaplan-Meier estimator for progression-free survival (RECIST v1.1 / iRECIST) at 6 months (+/- 4 weeks as we allow this interval in the tumor assessment at 6 months)., 5-7 months after TIL transfer
Progression-free survival (PFS), The progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from registration to objective tumor progression (determined by local investigators), or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PFS time for patients who have not progressed or died will be censored at the time of the last tumor assessment, up to one year after TIL transfer|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from registration to the date of death due to any cause, up to one year after TIL transfer|Severity of adverse events (CTCAE v5.0 criteria), Severity of adverse events (CTCAE v5.0 criteria) will be recorded to assess safety of combination of Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with IL-2

CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events): Grade 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = life-threatening, 5 = fatal., up to one year after TIL transfer|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of partial response or better (assessed by the local investigators, up to one year after TIL transfer|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documented response and the date of the first documented tumor progression, death, or the last tumor assessment that occurred before subsequent therapy. DOR time for responders who have not progressed or died will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment, up to one year after TIL transfer|Frequency of adverse events (number), Frequency of adverse events (number) will be recorded to assess safety of combination of Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with IL-2, up to one year after TIL transfer|Incidence of adverse events (%), Incidence of adverse events (%) will be recorded to assess safety of combination of Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with IL-2, up to one year after TIL transfer
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is a personalized immunotherapy. In patients with advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), a phase I clinical trial has investigated TIL-ACT in patients who progressed during ICI-treatment.

For TIL-ACT, tumor-specific T cells are expanded from excised tumor samples and stimulated in cell culture with interleukin-2 (IL-2). The resulting autologous TILs are then re-infused to the patient after a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Activation of TILs in the patient is then supported by IL-2 administration.
