This is a multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose, FIH Phase 1/2a study. Phase 1 adopts an accelerated titration at first dose level followed with classic "3+3" design to identify the MTD and/or RP2D. Phase 2a is a dose expansion phase to confirm the safety, tolerability and explore efficacy in selected malignant solid tumors treated with DB-1311/BNT324 as monotherapy.
