Different Modalities of Management of Odontogenic Keratocysts
Background The odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs) have been one of the maxillofacial region's most contentious pathological phenomena. Decompression/marsupialization (D/M), enucleation (E), enucleation + chemical cauterization with Carnoy's solution (E+CS), enucleation + peripheral ostectomy (E + PO), as opposed to enucleation + chemical cauterization with Carnoy's solution + peripheral ostectomy (E + CS + PO), were used during surgery to ensure that no epithelial remnants were left behind.

Rationale Through the management of OKC a recurrence could occur, the effectiveness of Decompression/marsupialization (D/M), Enucleation (E), Enucleation+Carnoy's solution chemical cauterization (E+CS), Enucleation+peripheral ostectomy (E+PO), Enucleation+Carnoy's solution chemical cauterization + peripheral ostectomy (E+CS + PO), will be analyzed
Odontogenic Cysts
PROCEDURE: Enucleation+ Peripheral Ostectomy+Carnoy's solution chemical cauterization (E+CS + PO)|PROCEDURE: Decompression/ marsupialization (D/M)|PROCEDURE: Enucleation (E)|PROCEDURE: Enucleation+Carnoy's solution (E+CS)|PROCEDURE: Enucleation+ Peripheral Ostectomy (E+ PO)
Healing period, The bone filling will monitored by using computed tomography scans, Starting from the postoperative third month up to the postoperative ninth month|Measurement of the bony cavity, A presence of radiolucent area in the computed tomography scans, At the end of the postoperative ninth month|Recurrence rate, The new occurrence of the previously removed odontogenic keratocyst will be documented, At the end of the postoperative fifth year|Recurrence rate, The new occurrence of the previously removed odontogenic keratocyst will be documented, At the end of the postoperative tenth year
Since the middle of the 20th century, the odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) has been one of the maxillofacial region's most contentious pathological phenomena. It was initially misdiagnosed as a primordial cyst. After that, because of its severe clinical behavior and tendency to recur, it was no longer considered to be a part of its classification, also known as a odontogenic tumor. Then, In 2017, the OKC are re-classified as a cystic lesion. But still there is debate about their management. So, this study will be enrolled with the following objectives: to describe how odontogenic keratocysts are managed, to Discover the most favorable approach to manage OKC with the need to stop it from happening again To categorize the odontogenic keratocyst management outcomes into to the subsequent groups: (1) total resolution, (2) partial resolution; (3) Recurrence.
