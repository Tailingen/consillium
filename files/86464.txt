A Study of BXQ-350 in Children and Young Adults With Relapsed Solid Tumors
This study will evaluate the safety of BXQ-350 and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in children and young adults with relapsed solid tumors, including recurrent malignant brain tumors. All patients will receive BXQ-350 by intravenous (IV) infusion. The study is divided into two parts: Part 1 will enroll patients at increasing dose levels of BXQ-350 in order to determine the MTD. Part 2 will use the MTD to further assess the safety of BXQ-350 as well as preliminary anti-tumor activity.

DRUG: BXQ-350
Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, To determine the safety of BXQ-350 in children and young adults with relapsed solid tumors, including recurrent malignant brain tumors, as evidenced by the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., 6 months|Part 1 - Maximum Tolerated Dose, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BXQ-350, when given as a single agent at escalating doses, according to the investigational product (IP) related dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in children and young adults with relapsed solid tumors, including recurrent malignant brain tumors, 6 months|Part 2 - RECIST, To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of BXQ-350, given as a single agent at the MTD, or highest planned dose level (DL), 3.2 mg/kg, in the absence of a Maximum Administered Dose (MAD). Antitumor activity is defined as maximal radiological response during treatment using:

• Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (v1.1) criteria for relapsed solid tumors, 6 months|Part 2 - RANO, To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of BXQ-350, given as a single agent at the MTD, or highest planned dose level (DL), 3.2 mg/kg, in the absence of a Maximum Administered Dose (MAD). Antitumor activity is defined as maximal radiological response during treatment using:

• Radiographic Response Criteria (RRC) for recurrent malignant brain tumors, 6 months|Part 2 - INRC, To assess the preliminary antitumor activity of BXQ-350, given as a single agent at the MTD, or highest planned dose level (DL), 3.2 mg/kg, in the absence of a Maximum Administered Dose (MAD). Antitumor activity is defined as maximal radiological response during treatment using:

• International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC) for recurrent neuroblastomas, 6 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS-6), · To evaluate progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) in subjects with relapsed solid tumors, including recurrent malignant brain tumors, 6 months|Time to Response, · To evaluate time to response, and duration of response in subjects with relapsed solid tumors, including recurrent malignant brain tumors, 6 months|Duration of Response, · To evaluate duration of response in subjects with relapsed solid tumors, including recurrent malignant brain tumors, 6 months
BXQ-350 is a novel anti-neoplastic therapeutic agent configured from two components: Saposin C (SapC), an expressed (human) lysosomal protein, and the phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidyl-serine (DOPS), a phospholipid located on cell membranes (clinical formulation BXQ-350). Given via intravenous (IV) infusion, data indicate that the agent exhibits the propensity to enter the body and brain, target cells in the tumor mass, and induce cell death.

The study is divided into 2 parts:

Part 1: Dose Escalation and Safety - Sequential cohorts of patients 1-30 years of age with relapsed solid tumors, including recurrent malignant brain tumors will be treated with escalating doses of BXQ-350 until the MTD is established, or in the absence of a Maximum Administered Dose, the highest planned dose level is reached.

Part 2: Safety and Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity - Patients will be enrolled into one of four cohorts and administered BXQ-350 at the established MTD or at the highest planned dose level. The four cohorts will consist of: recurrent ependymoma, recurrent malignant brain tumor, recurrent Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), and relapsed non-central nervous system (non-CNS) solid tumor.
