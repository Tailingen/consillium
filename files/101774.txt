The Criteria for Lymph Node Sorting for Pathological Examination in Gastric Cancer
The aim of this study is intending to provide the optimal procedures of lymph node sorting for pathological examination after curative surgery for gastric cancer, which can discriminate the differences of the status of lymph node metastasis, pTNM classification and prognostic outcome of gastric cancer patients.

PROCEDURE: lymph node sorting for pathological examination
Migration of pN stage in gastric cancer patients, According to the overall survival of all included patients, we will evaluate the optimal lymph node sorting method to obtain the accurately pathological stage of lymph node metastatic counts (pN stage) for prediction the prognosis of patients after curative surgery for gastric cancer., 60 months
