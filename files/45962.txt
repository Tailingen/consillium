There is growing interest in providing integrative medical care in conjunction with specialty medical care to expand the reach of integrative care to more chronically and seriously ill patient populations. At the AIMS Institute, the core specialties are naturopathy, palliative care, psychiatry, physiatry, and naturopathic oncology practiced via coordinated, team-based care by allopathic medical and psychiatric specialists, psychotherapists, specialized naturopathic physicians, advanced practice nurses, and targeted health educators, with the majority of care covered by insurance. Additionally incorporated are novel 'advanced' approaches, such as drug-assisted psychotherapy, medical cannabis education, sympathetic blocks, and some intravenous therapies.

This is an uncontrolled, prospective case series outcomes study of health-related quality of life outcomes in patients who receive care at AIMS Institute. A clinic-wide chart audit of patient characteristics and outcomes will be conducted prior to the start of enrollment.
