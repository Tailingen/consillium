Hydrogen Gas for Cancer Rehabilitation
The aim of this study is the efficacy of hydrogen gas immunotherapy to rehabilitation and prognosis of cancer patients.
Adult Solid Tumor
DEVICE: oxyhydrogen generator (AMS-H-03)|DEVICE: analogue machine
Improvement of sleep, diet and exercise, It will be evaluated by the questionnaire of EORTC QLQ-C30. The scores of each index before and after treatment need to be analyzed by statistical methods to reach a conclusion, and P\< 0.05 is considered to be statistically different, 3 months|Improvement of immune function, It will be evaluated by the blood test, including tumor marker alpha fetoprotein (AFP), lymphocyte subsets (T and NK cells) and circulating tumor cell (CTCs). The reference range of AFP is 0-40 IU/mL, higher than this range indicates tumor risk, and the higher the value is, the faster the tumor growth rate will be. The t-cell range of the lymphocyte subclass is 603-2990 cell/uL, and the NK cell range is 95-640 cell/uL, lower than the reference range indicates low immune function. The CTC reference range is 0-1, and higher than the reference range indicates tumor activity., 3 months
Progress free survival（PFS）, follow-up of CT scan, 1 year|Overall survival（OS）, follow-up survival, 3 years
By enrolling patients of multiple kinds of cancer adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the short and long term efficacy of hydrogen gas.The evaluation indexes include peripheral blood lymphocyte immunoassay, improvement of sleep, diet and exercise, progress free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
