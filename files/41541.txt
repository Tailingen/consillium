Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Radiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer
This is a prospective observational study designed to observe the toxicity and efficacy of PBS proton RT for patients with esophageal cancer undergoing trimodality therapy. The investigators hypothesize that PBS proton RT will be associated with a favorable adverse event profile and quality of life, with similar disease control outcomes, relative to historical comparisons of patients treated with photon RT.
