Post-radiotherapy Rhinosinusitis in Children
Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a frequent complication of facial cancer treatment, mainly related to radiotherapy. However, while radiological involvement is frequent, clinical expression seems less important.

Few studies have investigated the incidence of this condition in the pediatric population while its evolution seems to be very chronic even if a partial improvement may occur with time.

Our objective is therefore to study the impact of CSR in children treated for cancer of the cervicofacial region, to evaluate its incidence and medium-term evolution in order to determine whether it is necessary to set up a specific follow-up in these patients.

The clinical impact of CSR is assessed by a specific SNOT 22 questionnaire in children treated for a head-neck mesenchymal malignancy in comparison with a control population consisting of children treated for a mesenchymal malignancy of non-head-neck location.
