The purpose of this study is to assess the quality of life and educational intervention outcomes of Head and Neck Cancer patients who have a gastrostomy tube placed per standard of care.

A high incident of Gastrostomy tube replacement occurs related to clogged, dislodged, and/or pulled out tubes. In addition, patients not eating or drinking after Gastrostomy tube placement, compounded by complications related to radiation treatment, results in decreased swallowing function. Inadequate swallow function, especially when combined with inadequate use of Gastrostomy tube, due to non-functional tube or insufficient patient knowledge in use of tube, results in poor nutritional status and excessive weight loss.
