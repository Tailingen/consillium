Somatostatin Receptor Imaging in NPC, EBV Related Cancers
The study aims to describe the avidity of somatostatin receptors in locally advanced, metastatic and locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to determine the proportion of NPC patients with high somatostatin receptor density that may benefit from future somatostatin targeted therapeutic trial plans. The investigators also aim to determine the presence of somatostatin receptors in other EBV related cancers.

RADIATION: FDG-PET|RADIATION: Galium-68 DOTATATE
Amount of tracer uptake in the tumour lesions of NPC patients, The maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) will be measured. If the average SUVmax of all the lesions is more than 10, the patient will be considered to have an overall high somatostatin receptor density., From time of tracer injection to time the scan is performed
