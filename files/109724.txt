Masitinib in Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour After Progression With Imatinib
The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib at 12 mg/kg/day to sunitinib at 50 mg/day in the treatment of patients with gastro-intestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after progression with imatinib.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Masitinib|DRUG: Sunitinib
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as time in months from the randomization date to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the date of last known date patient alive., From day of randomization to death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months
Survival rate, Survival rate is defined as the number of patients alive divided by the number of patients in the population of analysis. Assessed at week-8, -16, -24, and every 12 weeks thereafter., Every 12 weeks until study completion, assessed for a maximum of 60 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of earliest evidence of disease progression or death, for participants who progressed or died before subsequent cancer therapy. Disease progression will be assessed by the investigator on CT scan according to RECIST 1.1 criteria and/or CHOI criteria., From day of randomization to disease progression or death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months
Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against wild-type c-Kit, the juxta membrane domain of c-Kit, and PDGFR. Masitinib is also thought to promote survival via modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib at 12 mg/kg/day with respect to sunitinib at 50 mg/day in the treatment of imatinib-resistant gastro-intestinal stromal tumor (GIST).
