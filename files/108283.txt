Study on B7-H3 Targeted Affibody Radioligand Probes for PET Imaging of Solid Tumors
Based on \[68Ga\]B7H3 Affibody-BCH, this study investigates its radioactive uptake and imaging capabilities in tumor patients, with the aim of establishing a correlation between radioactive uptake and B7-H3 receptor expression. Utilizing whole-body PET technology, the pharmacokinetic dynamics of \[68Ga\]B7H3 Affibody-BCH are examined to ascertain its pharmacological characteristics. Ultimately, this research establishes a framework for pharmacokinetic analysis using whole-body PET.
