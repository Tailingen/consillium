Grafts of GSCs Into Brain Organoids for Testing Anti-invasion Drugs
In patients operated for glioblastoma, glioma stem-like cell lines will be obtained from tumor tissue, and IPSCs from skin fibroblasts or PBMCs. Brain organoids will be generated from IPSCs and co-cultured with IPSCs to study brain invasion and ciliogenesis. 3D genome architecture of glioma stem-like cells will be investigated. Gene modulation and pharmacologic strategies to inhibit invasion and restore ciliogenesis will be explored.
