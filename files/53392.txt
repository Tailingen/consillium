A Study of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) and Surgical Stabilization for People With Cancer That Has Spread to the Bone
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) followed by surgical stabilization within 1 week. All participants will have metastatic cancer in the bone (bone metastases), and they will be at risk of pathologic fracture (broken bone caused by a disease). Another purpose of this study is to see if the treatment approach of SBRT followed by surgical stabilization within 1 week prevents cancer from returning to the bone.

RADIATION: Preoperative Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT)
risk of major wound complications, Major wound complications are defined as reoperation for wound revision, clinically diagnosed surgical site infection, readmission for wound care, or prolonged (\>3 weeks postoperatively) active wound care., 6 weeks after preoperative SBRT
rate of local control, Failure of local control is defined as a new lesion within the radiation or surgical field, significant progression of an existing lesion, or reoperation or reirradiation due to tumor progression., 1 year
