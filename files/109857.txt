Safety and Efficacy Study for the Treatment of Non-Aggressive Basal Cell Carcinoma With Photodynamic Therapy
The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness and safety of the medicine Ameluz® (5-aminolevulinic acid) in comparison to methyl-aminolevulinate (MAL), used with photodynamic therapy (PDT), to treat thin, non-aggressive BCC (basal cell carcinoma).
Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
DRUG: BF-200 ALA|DRUG: methyl-aminolevulinate
Overall Patient Complete Response Rate Assessed 12 Weeks After the Last PDT, Overall patient complete response rate assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT. The indicated values give the percentage of overall complete responders. An overall complete responder is defined as a patient in whom all treated lesions were cleared. The PP set is the primary analysis set for the analyses of the primary endpoint., 12 weeks after the last PDT (please note: 2 PDT cycles, each cycle consisting of 2 PDTs (= maximum of 4 PDTs per patient) was possible).
Lesion Complete Response Assessed 12 Weeks After the Last PDT, Lesion complete response (completely cleared individual lesions) assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT. The indicated values give percentage of overall completely cleared individual lesions. The PP set is the primary analysis set for the analysis of the secondary endpoint., 12 weeks after the last PDT (please note: 2 PDT cycles, each cycle consisting of 2 PDTs (= maximum of 4 PDTs per patient) was possible).|Reduction of Lesion Area 12 Weeks After the Last PDT Compared to Baseline, Reduction of total lesion area (summation of sizes of all treated lesions) per patient, assessed 12 weeks after the last PDT. The PP set is the primary analysis set for the analysis of the secondary endpoint.

Please note that the high SD for BF-200 ALA is due to a patient who had increased lesion area fom 63 mm² at baseline to 225 mm² 12 weeks after PDT. This lesion area included a lesion that was later confirmed to be benign skin condition (lentigo solaris)., 12 weeks after the last PDT (please note: 2 PDT cycles, each cycle consisting of 2 PDTs (= maximum of 4 PDTs per patient) was possible).|Patient Complete Response 12 Weeks After PDT-2, Patient complete response (complete clearance of all treated lesions) assessed 12 weeks after PDT-2 (first PDT cycle). The PP set is the primary analysis set for the analysis of the secondary endpoint., 12 weeks after PDT-2 (=PDT cycle 1; please note: in this study 2 PDT cycles, each cycle consisting of 2 PDTs (= maximum of 4 PDTs per patient) was possible).|Cosmetic Outcome 12 Weeks After Last PDT (Including Patients With a Sum Score of 0 at Baseline), Overall cosmetic outcome 12 weeks after last PDT is calculated as difference between 12 weeks after PDT sum score and baseline sum score of all skin quality assessments. Each of the below skin quality characteristics are assessed on a 4-point scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) by the investigator at baseline and 12 weeks after last PDT:

* Skin surface
* Hyperpigmentation
* Hypopigmentation
* Mottled or irregular pigmentation
* Degree of scarring
* Atrophy

Cosmetic outcome categories are:

* Very good: 12 weeks sum score improved by at least 2 points compared to baseline
* Good: 12 weeks sum score improved by 1 point compared to baseline
* Satisfactory: 12 weeks sum score identical to the one at baseline
* Unsatisfactory: 12 weeks sum score worsened by 1 point compared to baseline
* Impaired: 12 weeks sum score worsened by at least 2 points compared to baseline, 12 weeks after the last PDT (please note: 2 PDT cycles, each cycle consisting of 2 PDTs (= maximum of 4 PDTs per patient) was possible).|Cosmetic Outcome 12 Weeks After the Last PDT (Including Patients With a Baseline Sum Score >1), Overall cosmetic outcome 12 weeks after last PDT is calculated as difference between 12 weeks after PDT sum score and baseline sum score of all skin quality assessments.

Patient Recurrence Rate (Overall, Cumulative), Patient recurrence rate defined as the number of patients with at least one recurrent lesion during FU after complete clearance 12 weeks after the last PDT, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 months post-PDT|Lesion Recurrence Rate (Cumulative), Lesion recurrence rate defined as the number of completely cleared lesions 12 weeks after the last PDT showing recurrence during FU. Overall and subgroup analysis (nodular basal cell carcinoma (nBCC) and superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC))., 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 months post-PDT
The treatment comprises of up to 2 PDT cycles, each with two PDT sessions one week apart.

If 12 weeks after the the second PDT all lesions are completely cleared the patient will enter the follow-up phase. In case of remaining lesions the patient will receive a second PDT cycle starting on the same day.
