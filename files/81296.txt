Jaktinib and Azacitidine In Treating Patients With MDS With MF or MDS/MPN With MF.
This phase I/II trial studies how well Jaktinib and azacytidine work in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm with myelofibrosis. Giving Jaktinib and azacytidine may be an effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm with myelofibrosis.
