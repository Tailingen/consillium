A Study of Observation and Follow-up in People With Basal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to find out more about how Basal Cell Carcimonas/BCCs grow and to learn more effective ways to monitor and treat these common cancers. This study will not provide any type of treatment for the participants' cancer; it is a 3-year observational study to monitor participants' cancer.
Basal Cell Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Digital Dermoscopy|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Optical coherence tomography (OCT)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Dermtech tape-stripping|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Total Skin Examinations
Change in Basal Cell Carcinoma growth from Baseline, To adequately measure the growth dynamics of tumors, several imaging modalities will be employed. Longest dimension (millimeters) of the lesion from clinical imaging will be the primary measurement of horizontal extent of the lesion. Maximum lesion depth (millimeters) from OCT imaging will be the primary measured of vertical extension., 3 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To evaluate the feasibility of active follow-up of BCC as a way of managing BCC., up to 3 years
