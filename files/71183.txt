A Study of Herceptin (Trastuzumab) in Combination Chemotherapy in Women With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
This study will assess the efficacy and safety of adding Herceptin to a paclitaxel-containing regimen followed by cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF) chemotherapy in women with locally advanced breast cancer and HER2/c-erbB-2 gene amplification. In a parallel observational study patients with HER2-negative disease will receive the same chemotherapy without Herceptin.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: CMF
Event-Free Survival (EFS) - Percentage of Participants With an Event, EFS was defined as the time between randomization and date of documented occurrence of disease recurrence or progression (local, regional, distant or contralateral) or death due to any cause., Baseline (BL), Presurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-7) and Days 1 and 8 (Cycles 8-10); Postsurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-17); every 6 months up to 60 months after last dose of study drug; yearly thereafter|Event-Free Survival, The median time, in months, between randomization and date of documented occurrence of an EFS event., BL, Presurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-7) and Days 1 and 8 (Cycles 8-10); Postsurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-17); every 6 months up to 60 months after last dose of study drug; yearly thereafter|Percentage of Participants Event Free at 1 Year, BL, Presurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-7) and Days 1 and 8 (Cycles 8-10); Postsurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-17); every 6 months up to 60 months after last dose of study drug; yearly thereafter|Percentage of Participants Event Free at 2 Years, BL, Presurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-7) and Days 1 and 8 (Cycles 8-10); Postsurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-17); every 6 months up to 60 months after last dose of study drug; yearly thereafter|Percentage of Participants Event Free at 3 Years, BL, Presurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-7) and Days 1 and 8 (Cycles 8-10); Postsurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-17); every 6 months up to 60 months after last dose of study drug; yearly thereafter
Percentage of Participants With Breast Pathological Complete Response (bpCR), bpCR was defined as an absence of any invasive cancer cell of the primary tumor at the time of major surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with and without trastuzumab., BL, Day 1 of Cycles 1-10 (pre-surgery)|Percentage of Participants With Total Pathological Complete Response (tpCR), tpCR was defined as a determination of bpCR and an absence of positive axillary nodes on pathology., BL, Day 1 of Cycles 1-10 (pre-surgery)|Percentage of Participants Achieving Either Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria, Assessments were made based on objective tumor measurements of the lesions as recorded in the case report form. In inflammatory cancer, progressive disease (PD) was defined as progression of any of the 2 signs of breast edema and erythema. In non-inflammatory cancer, PD was concluded if either the investigator judged the participant as having progressed at any time prior to surgery, or there was at least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesions (TLs), any new lesion, or clear progression of any nontarget lesion (NTLs). Clear progression of any NTL was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of NTLs compared to BL. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease from BL in the sum of the longest diameter of TLs. CR was defined as no PD as assessed by the investigator and complete disappearance of all lesions., BL, Presurgery: Day 1 of Cycles 1-10|Overall Survival (OS) - Percentage of Participants With an Event, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the death due to any cause., BL, Presurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-7) and Days 1 and 8 (Cycles 8-10); Postsurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-17); every 6 months up to 60 months after last dose of study drug; yearly thereafter|Overall Survival, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the death due to any cause., BL, Presurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-7) and Days 1 and 8 (Cycles 8-10); Postsurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-17); every 6 months up to 60 months after last dose of study drug; yearly thereafter|Percentage of Participants Surviving at 1 Year, BL, Presurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-7) and Days 1 and 8 (Cycles 8-10); Postsurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-17); every 6 months up to 60 months after last dose of study drug; yearly thereafter|Percentage of Participants Surviving at 2 Years, BL, Presurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-7) and Days 1 and 8 (Cycles 8-10); Postsurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-17); every 6 months up to 60 months after last dose of study drug; yearly thereafter|Percentage of Participants Surviving at 3 Years, BL, Presurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-7) and Days 1 and 8 (Cycles 8-10); Postsurgery: Day 1 (Cycles 1-17); every 6 months up to 60 months after last dose of study drug; yearly thereafter
