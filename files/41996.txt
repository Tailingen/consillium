HRYZ-T102 TCR-T Cell for AFP Positive Advanced HCC and Other Solid Tumors
This is a single arm, open-label, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HRYZ-T102 TCR-T Cell in patients with AFP positive advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and other solid tumors refractory to prior systematic treatments.
Hepatic Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: AFP Specific T Cell Receptor T Cells
