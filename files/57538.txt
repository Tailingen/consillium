AK104 Combined With Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Treatment for Advanced Ovarian Cancer
Previous studies have suggested that immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment for ovarian cancer may have a synergistic effect and a manageable safety profile.

AK104 is a bispecific antibody targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK104 combined with chemotherapy as the neoadjuvant treatment for advanced ovarian cancer.
