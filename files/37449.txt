Development of Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Complications After Colonic, Colorectal and Small Intestine Anastomosis in Psychiatric and Non-psychiatric Patient Collectives (P-Study)
Our study aims to lay the basis for a predictive modeling service for postoperative complications and prolonged hospital stay in patients suffering from psychiatric diseases undergoing colorectal surgery.

Furthermore, we aim to investigate the impact of preoperative Risk factors, psychiatric and psychosomatic diseases on the outcomes of colorectal surgery and the complications after colorectal surgeries like anastomosis insufficiency via predictive modeling techniques

The service mentioned above will be publicly available as a web-based application

Anastomotic insufficiency/leakage, Predictive model with an app for the development of anastomosis insufficiency based on the risk factors., From index surgery up to six weeks postoperatively|Complication after surgery/ Comprehensive Complication Index/ Clavian Dindo Score, Impact of psychatric and psychosomatic disorders are having higher complication rates, From index surgery up to six weeks postoperatively|Length of Hospital Stay (in Days), Impact of psychatric and psychosomatic disorders are having longer hospitalization, From surgery up to 12 weeks postoperatively|Intraoperative influid manangment, Impact of Intraoperative influid on the development of anastomotic insuffiency, Time Frame: From index surgery up to six weeks postoperatively|Development of a preoperative score for morbidity/mortality in colorectal surgery, Check the risk for morbidity/mortality in colorectal surgery, From index surgery up to six weeks postoperatively
