Assessment of Clinically Related Outcomes and Biomarker Analysis for Translational Integration in Colorectal Cancer
* A prospective, observational study on clinical outcomes of surgical management of primary and metastatic colorectal cancer
* Prospective collection of tissues to explore potential biomarkers in blood and/or primary or secondary cancers and/or normal colon
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: open and laparoscopic surgery
Cancer-specific survival, Time from surgery to death of cancer, 5-years
Recurrence-free survival, Time from surgery to recurrence of cancer, 3 and 5 years
Prospective project in collecting and assessing clinical outcomes data related to molecular profiling of tumors based on cancer primary or metastatic tissue or tissue from peripheral blood samples. As a future part of the project will be collected patient reported outcomes (PROs) for assessing clinical outcomes in relation to clinical pathways, patient reported results, as well as tumor profiling by molecular methods.
