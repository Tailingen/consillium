The Role of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT in the Diagnosis and the Efficacy Evaluation of Advanced Colorectal Cancer (peritoneal Metastasis With/without Other Metastases)
This study aims to investigate the value of 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT in evaluating the outcome of conversion therapy and the prognosis of advanced colorectal cancer (peritoneal metastasis with/without other metastases)
Advanced Colorectal Cancer
Diagnostic accuracy, 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT was used to diagnose the lesions of the patients, and the diagnostic performance of PET/CT was evaluated by comparing the diagnostic results with the pathological results/clinical evaluation results., Baseline and up to 3 months|Standardized uptake value(SUV), SUV of 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT images for tumor lesions, Baseline and up to 3 months|Target-to-background ratio(TBR), 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG uptake ratio of tumor lesions to mediastinum and liver blood pool on PET/CT images., Baseline and up to 3 months
Progress free survival, Progress free survival, 3 years|Overall survival, Overall survival, 3 years
The investigators will number all participants, create a medical record file, and record their basic information (gender, age) as well as contact information and medical history information. All participants will undergo 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT at baseline and after 3 months of conversion therapy. The imaging response measurements will be compared with the histopathological or clinical assessment results as gold standard.
