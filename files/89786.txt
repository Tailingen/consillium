Dose-escalation Study of Oral Administration of S 55746 in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia and B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile and tolerability of S 55746 in patients with CLL, B-Cell NHL and MM, in terms of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) through safety profile (DLT, MTD), PK profile, PD profile and preliminary efficacy.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)|B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)|Multiple Myeloma (MM)
DRUG: S 55746
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD is the highest drug dosage that is unlikely (\<25% posterior probability) to cause DLT in more than 33% of the treated patients in the first cycle of S 55746 treatment, During cycle 1 (21 days)|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Characterized by severity and seriousness of AEs, laboratory abnormalities and other safety parameters such as electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, From first dose until 30 days after the last dose intake
