Azacytidine for the Treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndromes/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML) With High Risk (Chromosome 7 and or Complex) Cytogenetic Abnormalities
The purpose of this study is to assess the hematological and cytogenetic responses with 5 azacytidine in patients over 55 years of age with MDS/AML due to chromosome 7 abnormalities and to assess the hematological and cytogenetic response rates in patients with relapsed AML and chromosome 7 abnormality.
