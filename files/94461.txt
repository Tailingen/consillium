Pembrolizumab Combined With PLD For Recurrent Platinum Resistant Ovarian, Fallopian Tube Or Peritoneal Cancer
This research study is studying the combination of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD) and Pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for Recurrent Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Peritoneal Cancer that is resistant to platinum therapy.

The following interventions will be used in this study:

* Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD)
* Pembrolizumab
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (PLD)
Clinical Benefit Rate [CBR], The primary objective was to determine the CBR (complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\] + stable disease \[SD\] \>/= 24 weeks) of the combination of pembrolizumab and PLD., 24 Weeks
Safety of the Combination of Pembrolizumab/PLD, Safety is measured by any dose limiting toxicity experienced within the safety lead in group of 6 patients. If 2 out of the first 6 patients develop a DLT, the dose of PLD will be reduced to 30 mg/m2. If no more than 1 patient of the first 6 patients has evidence of dose limiting toxicities, the dose level will be considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), an additional 20 patients will be enrolled to complete the phase II study., 24 weeks|Overall Response Rate [ORR], A secondary objective was to determine the Overall Response Rate \[ORR\] of the combination of pembrolizumab and PLD as defined by the number of participants achieving a partial response \[PR\] or complete response \[CR\]., 24 months|Duration of Response [DOR], The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease evaluation)., 24 Months|Progression-Free Survival [PFS], Progression-Free Survival is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation., 24 weeks|Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive., 24 Months
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

The investigators are looking to see if combining the standard therapy, PLD, and the study drug, Pembrolizumab, will be better than PLD alone. Pembrolizumab is a drug called a monoclonal antibody. Pembrolizumab blocks and interferes with a protein called PD-1; PD-1 can help the cancer cell evade the immune system, and thereby blocking PD-1 may help the immune system recognize and kill cancer cells.

This will be the first time this combination will be tested for participants with Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Peritoneal Cancer. Therefore, a group of 6 participants will be treated in a "safety lead in" portion of the trial. This lead in will determine the safest dose of PLD when given in combination with the study drug Pembrolizumab. These 6 participants will be treated with Pembrolizumab and PLD at the FDA approved dose to see if the combination is well tolerated or too severe. If the combination is well tolerated, 20 additional participants will be added. If the side effects are too severe, the dose of PLD will be lowered.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved PLD as a treatment option for this disease, but has not approved Pembrolizumab.
