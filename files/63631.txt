Effect of Guided Imagery on Chemotherapy-related Nausea and Vomiting
The goal of this randomized controlled study is to assess the effect of guided imagery on chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting in pediatric oncology patients.

Participants will receive either guided imagery+routine care or routine care. The researchers will compare nausea and vomiting and vital signs between groups.

Nausea and vomiting, Nausea and Vomiting Thermometer Scale in Children with Cancer is a 5-likert type scale. An increase in the score indicates an increase in the degree of nausea and vomiting experienced by children with cancer., 30 minutes before the procedure, halfway through the chemotherapy infusion, immediately after the procedure, and for the first 24 hours after the end of chemotherapy
Heart rate, Maintaining or normalizing heart rate within normal range (60 to 110 bpm), 30 minutes before the procedure, halfway through the chemotherapy infusion, and immediately after the procedure,|Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Maintaining or normalizing systolic and blood pressure within normal range (systolic: 90-120 mmHg; diastolic 60-80 mmHg), 30 minutes before the procedure, halfway through the chemotherapy infusion, and immediately after the procedure|Respiratory rate, Maintaining or normalizing respiratory rate within normal range (18-30 breath per minute), 30 minutes before the procedure, halfway through the chemotherapy infusion, and immediately after the procedure|Body temperature, Maintaining or normalizing body temperature within normal range (36-37 CÂ° in tympanic measurement), 30 minutes before the procedure, halfway through the chemotherapy infusion, and immediately after the procedure|Oxygen saturation, Maintaining or normalizing oxygen saturation within normal range (between 95%-100% by pulse oximetry), change from baseline 60 minutes of chemotherapy infusion
Despite significant advances in anti-emetic treatment, chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is considered a major side-effect that significantly reduces the quality of life of children diagnosed with cancer. Guided imagery is one of the methods of distraction that allows the individual to go to an environment or scene that will make the individual comfortable, peaceful, happy, and focused. In this study, the participants will be randomized in a single blind manner (participant) to either intervention or control groups.
