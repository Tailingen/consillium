For single dose Vz/f = Dose/(AUC0-inf\*Lambda Z), where AUC0-inf = (AUC0-t + Clast pred/Lambda Z). Clastpred was the calculated plasma concentration at the last sampling time point at which the measured plasma concentration was at or above the LLQ and Lambda Z = the apparent terminal rate constant determined from the terminal slope of the log-transformed plasma concentration curve., Predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after tepotinib and Osimertinib administration at Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1 (each Cycle is of 21 days) ]|Percentage of Participants With Resistant Mutations of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Gene or Other Pathways as Assessed in Circulating Tumor Deoxyribonucleic Acid (ctDNA), Percentage of participants with resistant mutations of the EGFR gene or other pathways as assessed in ctDNA were reported., From Day 1 of Cycle 3 up to end of treatment (14 days after last dose, approximately assessed up to 35.6 months) (each Cycle is for 21 days)
This study was to assess the antitumor activity, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the Mesenchymal-epithelial Transition Factor (MET) inhibitor tepotinib combined with the 3rd generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib in participants with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
