Neoadjuvant CAPOX Plus Ivonescimab Versus CAPOX for Locally Advanced Colon Cancer
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been validated by several clinical studies to achieve preoperative downstaging and improve survival outcomes in patients with locally advanced colon cancer . Enhancing the efficacy of neoadjuvant treatment further represents a crucial direction for future research.

Recognizing the potential of synergistic effects between immunotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy, the investigators conducted the present randomized study to explore whether Ivonescimab （a PD-1/VEGF bispecific-antibody）combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced colon cancer could potentially further improve treatment outcomes.
Colon Cancer
DRUG: Ivonescimab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine
MPR rate, In the primary tumor (PT), ≤10% residual viable tumor (RVT)., though 12 weeks neoadjuvant treatment，after surgery completed
Pathologic complete response，pCR, Pathological complete response will be made based on assessment of the surgical specimen at the primary treatment site，the absence of any viable tumor cells in the resected primary tumor specimen and all regional lymph node samples., though 12 weeks neoadjuvant treatment，after surgery completed|R0 resection rate, Complete resection of the tumor with negative margins, meaning no residual tumor is present microscopically., after surgery completed，up to 1 month|Disease free survival, Defined as the time from randomization to relapse or death, whichever occurred first, 2 years|Adverse event (AE), The severity of AE and the laboratory findings were graded by the investigators according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0., up to 3 years
This phase II, prospective, randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining CAPOX chemotherapy with Ivonescimab, a PD-1/VEGF-A bispecific antibody, compared to neoadjuvant CAPOX therapy alone in patients with high-risk recurrent MSS/pMMR-type colon cancer.
