CD19 CAR and PD-1 Knockout Engineered T Cells for CD19 Positive Malignant B-cell Derived Leukemia and Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and blood kinetics of autologous T cells genetically modified to express CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor and PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Leukaemia.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Burkitt Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells|BIOLOGICAL: CD19 CAR T-cells
Molecular remission, Efficacy will be assessed by determining Minimal Residual Disease in the bone marrow aspirate using immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and/or Next Generation Sequencing in all patients. The proportion of patients achieving molecular remission at 1 month post CD19 CAR and PD-1 Knockout Engineered T-cell infusion will be determined., 1 month
Long term molecular remission, Number of patients in molecular remission without further therapy at 2 years, 2 years|Frequency of circulating CD19 CAR and PD-1 Knockout Engineered T-cells, Persistence and frequency of circulating CD19 CAR and PD-1 Knockout Engineered T-cells in the peripheral blood by flow cytometry and qPCR analyses., 2 years|Incidence of hypogammaglobulinaemia, Incidence and duration of hypogammaglobulinaemia., 2 years|Relapse rate, Relapse rate monitored during interventional phase and long term follow up for a total of 10 years post cell infusion. Number of patients who relapsed can be summarized as a percentage (for all patients registered to the trial, and also only for those who received the cell infusion)., 10 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is monitored during interventional phase and long term follow up for 10 years post-CD19 CAR and PD-1 Knockout Engineered T-cell infusion. Number of patients alive can be summarized as a percentage (for all patients registered to the trial, and also only for those who received the cell infusion)., 10 years
This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells (CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells) in children and adults (age \<70 years) with high risk, relapsed CD19+ haematological malignancies (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma). Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the CD19 CAR T-cells. Patients will receive the CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD19 CAR and PD-1 knock out engineered T-cells in children with high risk relapsed CD19+ malignancies.
