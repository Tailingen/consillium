Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on the Efficacy and Adverse Effects of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Patients with Breast Cancer
This randomized controlled Phase III trial was designed to evaluate the impact of supplemental vitamin D (VD) on the efficacy and side effects of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer.
Vitamin D|Neoadjuvant Therapy|Breast Cancer|Adverse Reaction|Efficacy|Chemotherapy
DRUG: Neoadjuvant therapy + vitamin D2|DRUG: Neoadjuvant therapy
The objective response rate, Difference in change in the objective response rate from first to last assessment between two arms, 4-6months|The pathological complete response rate, Difference in change the pathological complete response rate from first to last assessment between two arms, 4-6months
The disease control rate, Difference in change the disease control rate rate from first to last assessment between two arms, 4-6months|Evaluation of side effects related to neoadjuvant therapy (CTCAE v5.0)., Side effects of neoadjuvant therapy will be assessed according to the CTCAE v5.0 criteria., From the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy to 21 days after the last cycle of neoadjuvant therapy.|Pathological response assessment using the Miller & Payne scoring system in conjunction with residual disease in lymph nodes following neoadjuvant therapy., The pathological response will be assessed using the Miller \& Payne scoring system, considering residual disease in lymph nodes after neoadjuvant therapy., 4-6months
This is a parallel-group, open-label randomized controlled trial designed to investigate the effects of supplemental vitamin D (VD) on the outcomes and side effects of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer. Both groups will receive standard neoadjuvant therapy on day 1 and for each subsequent cycle. Additionally, vitamin D2 will be randomly administered to both groups.Blood samples and imaging results will be collected and analyzed prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy and after every two cycles. Key outcomes to be recorded include the pathological complete response rate (pCR), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and grade III or higher adverse effects related to neoadjuvant therapy. The primary and secondary study findings, along with adverse events, will be thoroughly evaluated.
