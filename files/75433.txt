Brightline-1: A Study to Compare Brigimadlin (BI 907828) With Doxorubicin in People With a Type of Cancer Called Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma
This study is open to people with a type of cancer called dedifferentiated liposarcoma. People with advanced liposarcoma aged 18 or older who are not receiving any other cancer treatment can participate.

The purpose of this study is to compare a medicine called brigimadlin (BI 907828) with doxorubicin in people with liposarcoma. Brigimadlin (BI 907828) is a so-called MDM2 inhibitor that is being developed to treat cancer. Doxorubicin is a medicine already used to treat cancer including liposarcoma.

During the study, participants get either brigimadlin (BI 907828) or doxorubicin. Every 3 weeks, participants take brigimadlin (BI 907828) as tablets or doxorubicin as an infusion into a vein. Participants can switch to brigimadlin (BI 907828) treatment if they did not benefit from doxorubicin treatment.

Participants can continue treatment in the study as long as they benefit from it and can tolerate it.

Doctors regularly check the size of the tumour and check whether it has spread to other parts of the body. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.
Liposarcoma, Dedifferentiated
DRUG: Brigimadlin (BI 907828)|DRUG: Doxorubicin
Progression-free survival, defined as the time interval from randomization until tumor progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (solely based on blinded central independent review) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 30 months
Objective response (OR), defined as a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1 (based on blinded central independent review) from the date of randomization until disease progression, death, or last evaluable tumor assessment before start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or end of patient's participation in the trial, whichever occurs first., Up to 30 months|Duration of objective response (DOR), defined as the time interval from first documented confirmed OR until disease progression or death among patients with confirmed objective response (based on blinded central independent review), whichever occurs first., Up to 30 months|Overall survival (OS), defined as the time interval from randomization until death from any cause, Up to 50 months|Disease control (DC), defined as a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (based on blinded central independent review)., Up to 30 months|Change from baseline in QLQ-C30 (Quality of Life questionnaire C30), The QLQ C30 rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function, symptoms and financial difficulties and 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life. Includes scores for physical functioning, fatigue, pain, global health status., Up to week 18|Change from baseline in EQ-5D5L (European Quality of Life 5 dimensions 5 level), The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument to assess of health outcome through 5 Likert scale items. In the EQ-5D-5L VAS, the participant rates his or her general state of health at the time of the assessment on a scale from 0 to 100., Up to week 18|Change from baseline in fatigue, Fatigue symptoms are assessed through 25 items selected from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) item library. Items use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) similar to the C30., Up to week 18|Change from baseline in pain, Pain symptoms are assessed through 18 items selected from the EORTC item library. Items use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) similar to the C30., Up to week 18|Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), Up to 30 months|Occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs leading to study drug discontinuation, Up to 30 months
