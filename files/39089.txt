Improving Diagnosis and Treatment of Metastatic Advanced Prostate Cancer
The aim of this study is to provide clinical evidence to determine if Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (WBMRI) with a novel technique called diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can improve current treatment for APC patients, allowing for early identification of disease progression or treatment response, hence facilitating clinical decision-making and leading to improvement in patient care. The IDT study includes two retrospective analyses and a single centre prospective observational study for APC patients.
Advanced Prostate Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Post-treatment CT-guided bone marrow biopsy
Retrospective analysis: WBMRI parameters, Prognostic association of derived pre-treatment WBMRI parameters, total disease volume (tDV) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for prediction of overall survival., Month 1-26|Retrospective analysis: Diagnostic performance of MET-RADS-P, Accuracy of MET-RADS-P to assess response to systemic treatment., Month 1-26|Single centre prospective observational imaging study, Pairwise correlations of percentage of ADC change with:

1. Tumour regression grading according to the international system of Salzer-Kuntschnik
2. Changes in biopsy tumour content and tumour/necrosis ratio
3. Fat fraction percentage with bone marrow adipose tissue/fibrosis reported by histopathology analysis., Month 6-38
Retrospective analysis: WBMRI parameters, Prognostic association of baseline tDV and ADC for prediction of radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS) using Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria (PCWG3) and Skeletal Related Events (SREs)., Month 1-26|Retrospective analysis: Diagnostic performance of MET-RADS-P, Inter-observer agreement - determine prognostic association of MET-RADS-P response for prediction of overall survival., Month 1-26|Single centre prospective observational imaging study, Fraction of bone biopsies with sufficient tumour yield for genomic sequencing., Month 6-38
Metastatic Advanced Prostate Cancer occurs when cancer spreads from the prostate to other parts of the body (bones, lymph nodes or other organs), with bones being the commonest site of spread in prostate cancer. These cancer growths are called metastases. APC metastases are diverse (heterogeneous) in their growth pattern, such that not all metastases will respond to the same treatment.
