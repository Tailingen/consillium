Hydroxychloroquine in Treating Patients With Rising PSA Levels After Local Therapy for Prostate Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well hydroxychloroquine works in treating patients with previously treated prostate cancer. Autophagy destroys proteins and other substances in cells and may be used by prostate cancer cells to survive. Hydroxychloroquine, which blocks autophagy, may slow the growth of and possibly kill prostate cancer cells.
