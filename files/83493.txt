Biomarker-driven Targeted Therapy in Patients With Recurrent Platinum-resistant Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This study is an open-label, multicenter, umbrella study aimed to evaluate the combined, biomarker-driven, targeted treatment efficiency of Pamiparib, Bevacizumab, Tislelizumab, and Nab-paclitaxel in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer (PROC).
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Pamiparib|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Nab paclitaxel|DRUG: Bevacizumab + Nab paclitaxel (intense dose-dense)
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response(CR) and partial response(PR) assessed by the investigator in accordance with the RECIST 1.1 criteria., Up to 3 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first imaging disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). Assessed according to RECIST v1.1 by investigator., Up to 3 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time between enrollment and the patient's death due to any cause., Up to 5 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of the patients with complete response, partial remission, and stable disease after treatment. Assessed according to RECIST v1.1 by investigator., Up to 5 years|Duration of remission (DOR), DOR is defined as the time interval from the first record of disease response to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first). Assessed according to RECIST v1.1 by investigator., Up to 3 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Safety includes the adverse event profile of all drugs included according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0., Up to 5 years
BRCA1/2 gene status and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cell count (CD8 + TILs count) were evaluated as biomarkers using archived tumor tissue samples. Treatment arms were arranged according to pathological diagnosis and biomarker detection results.

Arm1 (Biomarkers: BRCA 1/2 mutant): Pamiparib 40mg PO. bid. plus Bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg IV. D1 (q3w.).

Arm2 (Biomarkers: BRCA 1/2 wildtype and â‰¥3 CD8+ TILs count): Tislelizumab 200mg IV. D1 + Bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg IV. D1 + Nab-paclitaxel 125mg / m2 IV. D1, 8 (q3w).

Arm3 (Biomarkers: BRCA 1/2 wildtype and \<3 CD8+ TILs count): Bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg IV D1, 15 + Nab-paclitaxel 100mg / m2 IV D1, 8, 15 (Q4w).

Treatment would continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination of the study, whichever occurs first.
