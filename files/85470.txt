SafeHeal Anastomosis Feasibility Evaluation (SAFE)-2023 Study
A feasibility study to assess the early safety and effectiveness of the Colovac 2 device in providing temporary protection of the anastomosis in patients undergoing low anterior resection for colon cancer.

A primary diverting stoma is widely used by surgeons to bypass the low rectal anastomosis and reduce morbidity associated with anastomotic leaks. Typically, a stoma is created for all high-risk patients which means that many patients are exposed to potentially serious complications associated with the stoma itself without any clinical benefit.

Colovac is a local, temporary, minimally invasive bypass device that protects the anastomosis and safely postpones stoma creation for 10 days after surgery. By postponing stoma creation for 10 days, Colovac allows stoma avoidance in all patients except those whose anastomosis have not healed by 10 days after surgery, allowing the others to return to normal activity more quickly and safely.
