Carboplatin-Paclitaxel ± Bevacizumab in Advanced (Stage III-IV) or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer
Wright et al (Anticancer Res, 2000) reported the results of a retrospective study on 11 patients with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancers. All patients had multi-site disease and were heavily pretreated with a median of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens. All received bevacizumab combination therapy which was well-tolerated. Two patients had partial responses, 3 had stable disease, while 5 patients progressed. One subject was not assessable for response. The median progression-free interval was 5.4 months for the entire cohort and 8.7 months for those who achieved clinical benefit (PR or SD). The authors concluded that Bevacizumab was well-tolerated and displayed promising anti-neoplastic activity in patients with endometrial cancer.The rationale for combining anti-angiogenic agents, including anti-VEGF antibodies, with cytotoxic chemotherapy stems from a number of preclinical studies showing additive and synergistic anti-tumour activity in a number of solid tumour types. By combining VEGF-targeting agents such as bevacizumab with conventional chemotherapies, it is hoped that these agents will act synergistically, thereby enhancing their anti-tumour efficacy and controlling disease progression.

The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy has been shown to improve PFS and/or OS in a series of large, randomized Phase III clinical trials in a wide range of tumour types, including mCRC, non-squamous NSCLC, metastatic BC (mBC) and mRCC.
