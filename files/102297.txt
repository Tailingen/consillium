Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety of Cemiplimab as First Line Treatment for Advanced Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) Patients
The study is an open-label, singel arm, prospective, multicenter phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Cemiplimab when applied as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which were not pretreated with hedgehog inhibitors (HHI).
Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)|First Line Treatment
DRUG: Cemiplimab
Objective Response Rate (ORR) at six months, ORR@6months, defined as the rate of patients assessed with complete or partial response (CR or PR) according to ERIVANCE-like criteria as best overall response, relative to the total number of patients as evaluated 6 months after treatment allocation., 24 months

Determination of molecular biomarkers and their correlation with objective response rate (ORR), Biosamples will be used for determination of molecular biomarkers and their correlation with objective response rate (ORR) by assessing e.g., gene expression signatures, tumor mutational burden including mutational signatures as well as morphological and cellular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment., 42 months
The present study is an explorative, investigator-initatied, single-arm, multicentre phase II trial. Patients with locally advanced BCC without pretreatment with hedgehog inhibitors such as vismodegib and sonidegib will receive Cemiplimab (350 mg, i.v.) at day 1 of each 21 days cycle for up to 12 months (max. 17 cycles) or until intolerable toxicity or disease progression, whatever occurs first. All patients will be followed up until death or for up to 12 months after last patient last application of Cemiplimab. The treatment response will be assessed every 12 weeks (± 7 days) during the treatment and the follow up phase. In addition, tumor samples will be collected and used for translational research providing the basis for the establishment of potential biomarkers correlating with the efficacy of Cemiplimab. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Cemiplimab when applied as first-line treatment in advanced, HHI naïve BCC measured by objective response rate (ORR) after 6 months of treatment. Secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Cemiplimab as first-line treatment in advanced BCC.
