Adoptive Cell Therapy of Autologous TIL and PD1-TIL Cells for Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme
At present, the investigators want to evaluate safety and efficacy of cell therapy based on Tumor-infiltrating T Lymphocyte (TIL）in glioblastoma. Here, we also constructed a transgenic modified TIL cells, stablely express a high-level full-length PD1 antibody (PD1-TIL cells), which can transduce signals to activate T cells and result in tumor killing. In this study, we design two group patients treated with TIL cells and PD1-TIL cells respectively to determine the safety and efficacy of autologous TILs or genetically modified TILs in patients with glioblastoma.
