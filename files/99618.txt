Relevant data collected as part of routine medical care will be captured on an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). Investigator-subject questionnaires and subject self-questionnaires answers will be collected in a paper booklet. This study is non-interventional, thus if some assessments, are not routinely performed by the investigator, he/she will not complete the corresponding sections in the eCRF.
