The Oncological Safety and Cosmetic Outcome of Areola Sparing Mastectomy : a Single Arm, Prospective, Cohort Study
To balance the oncological safety and cosmetic outcome is the basic principle of modern breast surgery. To preserve the nipple-areolar complex shows attractive cosmetic advantage but concerns regarding local recurrence make the oncological safety of nipple sparing mastectomy a controversial issue. Since the involvement of areolar pigmented skin by cancer is rare compared to that of nipple, we designed the current study to investigate the oncological safety and cosmetic outcome of Areola Sparing Mastectomy.
Breast Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Areola Sparing Mastectomy
Recurrence of areolar area, The frequency of histologically confirmed recurrence on the preserved pigmented areolar area., Five years after initial surgery
Cosmetic effect of reconstructed breast, The cosmetic results evaluated by a surgeon and a nurse through reviewing photographs., 2-4 weeks after surgery; 2 years and 5 years after surgery.|Adverse effect of surgery, Wound dehiscence, infection, suture exposure and extrusion., 4 weeks after surgery.|Disease free survival, Survival time to any recurrence and any cause death., 5 year after surgery
Primary breast cancer originated from areolae is rare. We hypothesized that nipple and areola are two separate anatomy tissue and have different oncological impact on the treatment of breast cancer. Areola Sparing Mastectomy (ASM) is a innovative procedure that involves of removal of nipple and preservation of areola the pigmented skin of which would improve the cosmetic outcome of mastectomy and lead to a illusion of congenital crater nipple in some patients.
