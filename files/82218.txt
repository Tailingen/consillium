Sublingual Methadone for the Management of Cancer-related Procedure Pain in Inpatients
The purpose of this Phase II study is to determine the feasibility of the dose titration and assessment protocol in the impatient population, in the clinical setting of preventing or managing breakthrough pain, before conducting an appropriately powered phase III study. Thus the primary purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of patients who are successfully titrated to an effective dose of sublingual methadone.
