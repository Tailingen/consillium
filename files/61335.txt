PARPi or Capecitabine Combined With PD-1 Inhibitors as Adjuvant Therapy in High-risk TNBC
In TNBC patients who have completed neoadjuvant immunotherapy and local treatment, a 9-cycle regimen of PD-1 inhibitor adjuvant immunotherapy is currently considered the standard approach. Based on the classification according to their BRCA mutation status, patients with BRCA mutations choose the PD-1 inhibitor + PARPi regimen, while patients without BRCA mutations opt for the PD-1 inhibitor + capecitabine regimen. Compared to monotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors, these combination regimens may offer improved efficacy and acceptable tolerability. This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center phase III trial aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of selecting PARPi or capecitabine in combination with PD-1 inhibitors based on germline BRCA1/2 mutations as adjuvant therapy in high-risk TNBC patients who have achieved non-pCR after completion of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in conjunction with chemotherapy and local treatment.

DRUG: As per the germline BRCA1/2 mutation status, the selection of either Fuzuloparib or capecitabine in combination with Camrelizumab is made for adjuvant therapy.|DRUG: 9 cycles of Camrelizumab as adjuvant therapy.
