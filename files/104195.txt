68Ga-AAZTA-093 PET/CT: First-in-human Study
68Ga-AAZTA-093 is a novel radiotracer targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). In this study, we observed the safety, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry and diagnostic value of 68Ga-AAZTA-093 PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer.
Malignant Neoplasm of Prostate
DRUG: 68Ga-AAZTA-093|DRUG: 68Ga-PSMA-11//68Ga-PSMA-617
Safety evaluation, The safety will be assessed by the number and percentage of patients with adverse events; Adverse events were categorized using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0., Within 7 days following PET/CT
Dosimetry data, Calculate the absorbed dose of 68Ga-AAZTA-093 in normal organs., through study completion, an average of 3 months
Diagnostic value, Sensitivity and Specificity of 68Ga-AAZTA-093 for prostate cancer in comparison with 68Ga-PSMA-11/68Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT., through study completion, an average of 3 months|SUV of tumors, Compare the SUV of tumors between 68Ga-AAZTA-093 PET/CT and 68Ga-PSMA-11/68Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT., through study completion, an average of 3 months
Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide in men. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), as known as folate hydrolase I or glutamate carboxypeptidase II, is overexpressed on the cells of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Various low molecular weight radiopharmaceuticals targeting PSMA such as PSMA-11, PSMA-617 for 68Ga- or 177Lu- labeling have been developed. 68Ga-AAZTA-093, a novel radiopharmaceutical targeting PSMA, with the urea fragment of a conjugate that employs the AAZTA chelator for labeling with 68Ga(III). This pilot study was prospectively designed to evaluate the safety, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry and diagnostic value of 68Ga-AAZTA-093 PET/CT and compared with 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT in the same group of prostate cancer patients.
