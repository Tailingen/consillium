A Prospective Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of the Combination Therapy of Irpagratinib, Atezolizumab, and Bevacizumab in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is a phase 2, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Irpagratinib in combination with Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab in patients with advanced or unresectable HCC harboring FGF19 overexpression.

This study composes two parts, a Safety Run-in part to evaluate safety and establish the dose of Irpagratinib for the triple combination, and an Expansion part to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety using Simon's two-stage design.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: irpagratinib
Incidence of DLTs, Safety Run-in: Incidence of DLTs in Cycle 1, Safety Run-in: At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Objective response rate (ORR), Expansion: Objective response rate (ORR) determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, through study completion, an average 21months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) according to RECIST v1.1, through study completion, an average 21months|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) according to RECIST v1.1, through study completion, an average 21months|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) according to RECIST v1.1, through study completion, an average 21months|Time to progression (TTP), Time to progression (TTP) :defined as the time from first dose of study drug (Safety Run-in and Expansion) to the first occurrence of imaging assessment of disease progression, as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, through study completion, an average 21months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS): defined as the time from first dose of study drug (Safety Run-in and Expansion) to death from any cause, every 12 weeks from the last dose of treatment for up to 1 year from the subject's last dose of study treatment|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs), dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of study drug due to toxicity, Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs), dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of study drug due to toxicity; changes from baseline in physical examinations, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms, laboratory parameters and vital signs., through study completion, an average 21months
Safety Run-in This part will enroll 6 or 9 patients administered with Irpagratinib orally 220mg BID or 160mg BID from study ABSK-011-101 in repeated 21-day cycles, plus Atezolizumab 1200 mg and Bevacizumab 15mg/kg given IV Q3W. The tolerability will be evaluated upon the incidence of DLTs observed during Cycle 1. If DLT happened in ≥2 of the 6 DLT evaluable patients in 220mg BID cohort, subsequent enrollment will be stopped and a combination regimen cohort with Irpagratinib orally 160mg BID plus Atezolizumab 1200 mg Q3W+ Bevacizumab 15mg/kg Q3W will be initiated in additional 3 DLT evaluable patients to observe the incidence of DLTs. If DLT happened in ≤1 of the 6 patients in 220mg BID, Irpagratinib 220mg BID + Atezolizumab 1200 mg/Q3W + Bevacizumab 15mg/kg Q3W combination regimen will be recommended for the Expansion part. If DLT happened in ≥2 of the 6 DLT evaluable patients in 220mg BID cohort and ≤1 of the 3 DLT evaluable patients in 160mg BID, Irpagratinib 160mg BID + Atezolizumab 1200 mg/Q3W + Bevacizumab 15mg/kg Q3W combination regimen will be recommended for the Expansion part.

Subsequent patients of Safety Run-in should be dosed at least 7 days after the first patient's (sentinel patient) first dosing for each dose level of Irpagratinib. Eventually, the dose of Irpagratinib selected for the Expansion will be confirmed safe by at least 6 DLT evaluable patients in which ≤1 DLT event happen in 220mg BID or at least 3 DLT evaluable patients in which ≤1 DLT event happen in 160mg BID. Adverse events that meet the DLT definition occurring beyond the DLT observation period in patients will not be taken as a DLT but will be considered as a reference for the assessment of overall safety.

Expansion Up to 24 eligible patients will be treated with Irpagratinib (the recommended dose from Safety Run-in) + Atezolizumab 1200 mg IV Q3W (dosed in 3-week cycles) and Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV Q3W (dosed in 3-week cycles).

The decision for running stage two of the enrollment will be made after 3 responders observed in first evaluable 9 patients with FGF19 overexpression.

Patients who interrupt or discontinue study treatments may continue the remaining treatment if the patients are experiencing clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator and after consultation with the Investigator (e.g., patients who transiently withhold or permanently discontinue from treatment with one of the three drugs due to adverse events may continue with the remaining drug(s)).
