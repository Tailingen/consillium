Long-Term Follow-up Study for Patients Previously Treated With JCAR015
This study will provide long-term follow-up for patients who have received treatment with JCAR015 in a previous clinical trial. In this study, patients will be followed for up to 15 years after their last dose of JCAR015 for evaluation of delayed adverse events, presence of persisting JCAR015 vector sequences, and survival.
