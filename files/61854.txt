Clinical Outcomes and Patient Satisfaction With Use of the Amma System
The primary goal is to conduct a pilot evaluation of the Amma device, to determine whether it is feasible to offer as an option for patients within oncology suites within the PH\&S system.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Amma Cooling Caps
AMMA Feasibility Within PH&S System, The primary goal is to conduct a pilot evaluation of the Amma device, to determine whether it is feasible to offer as an option for patients with early-stage breast cancer within oncology suites within the PH\&S system. Patient satisfaction will be assessed using pre and post treatment questionnaires related to the Amma system and an exit interview., End of Treatment (4 to 8 months, depending on duration of their chemotherapy regimen)
Patient Reported Outcome Utilizing Dean's Score, Patient satisfaction will be assessed via alopecia assessment utilizing Deans Scale collected at baseline and at end of treatment., End of Treatment (4 to 8 months, depending on duration of their chemotherapy regimen)|Patient Reported Outcome Utilizing Body Image Scale, Patient satisfaction will be assessed utilizing the Body Image Scale (BIS) questionnaire., End of Treatment (4 to 8 months, depending on duration of their chemotherapy regimen)|Patient Satisfaction Utilizing the Was It Worth It Questionnaire, Patient satisfaction will be assessed utilizing the Was It Worth It (WIWI) questionnaire., End of Treatment (4 to 8 months, depending on duration of their chemotherapy regimen)
A novel cold capping device, named Ammaâ„¢, is now commercially available for use and FDA approved. The Amma system has the potential to be as effective as the Penguin Cold Cap system, but with key innovations that make it more efficient and feasible in the clinic. Innovations include:

* Portable and battery powered unit, not requiring dry ice
* Form-fitting scalp cap that eliminates the need for frequent cap exchanges The Amma system has not been evaluated for efficacy, and no clinical trials are published.

Because of the ease of use and the self-directed administration of the Amma scalp cooling device, we wish to explore this as an option for patients treated within the PH\&S system. To do this, we propose an observational study that evaluates clinical outcomes and patient-reported satisfaction amongst a cohort of patients who undergo self-directed scalp cooling using the Amma system.
