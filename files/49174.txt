Samarium-153 With Neoadjuvant Hormonal and Radiation Therapy for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of Samarium-153 when given in combination with hormonal and external beam radiation therapy in men with high risk prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Samarium-153|DRUG: Total Androgen Suppression (TAS) with Bicalutamide|DRUG: Total androgen suppression (TAS) with Goserelin Acetate|DEVICE: Radiation Therapy
Maximum Tolerated Dose of Samarium-153, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Samarium as adjuvant to combined hormonal therapy (HT) and external beam radiation therapy (RT).

Dose levels:

Dose I: 0.25 mCi/kg IV Dose II: 0.5 mCi/kg IV Dose III: 0.75 mCi/kg IV Dose IV: 1.0 mCi/kg IV Dose V: 1.5 mCi/kg IV Dose VI: 2.0 mCi/kg IV

Dose-limiting toxicity will be defined as Grade 3 hematologic toxicity per NCI Common Toxicity Criteria. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) will then be the last dose studied or the previous dose, based on clinical judgment of the degree of toxicity seen at the last dose., 5 months (1 month HT, administration of drug, 4 months HT and RT)
The likelihood of prostate cancer cells metastasizing to bone has an early and important influence on the natural history of prostate cancer. Bone-targeted therapy, when given sequentially with hormonal therapy (androgen suppression) and radiation therapy, prolongs the progression of the disease in clinically non-metastatic prostate cancer patients.

The use of Samarium-153 EDTMP in conjunction with hormonal therapy and external beam radiation therapy has never been previously evaluated in high risk clinically localized prostate cancer. Many patients with high-risk prostate cancer develop progressive disease within 2 years of therapy indicating that subclinical metastatic disease may be present at the time of initial diagnosis. In these high-risk patients, there may be a therapeutic benefit of combining hormonal therapy with external beam radiation therapy and Samarium-153 EDTMP to treat localized and subclinical bony disease, respectively.
