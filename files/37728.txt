An Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) Study of Single Oral Dose [14C] GSK2118436 in Subjects With BRAF Mutant Solid Tumors
The study is a Phase 1, open-label study designed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of GSK2118436 following administration of a single oral 14C labeled dose of GSK2118436 as a suspension in subjects with BRAF mutation positive tumors.

GSK2118436 is an orally administered, potent and selective small molecule BRAF inhibitor that is being developed for the treatment of BRAF mutation-positive tumors. The study is a Phase 1, open-label study designed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of GSK2118436 following administration of a single oral 14C labeled dose of GSK2118436 as a suspension in subjects with BRAF mutation positive tumors. A sufficient number of subjects will be enrolled to complete approximately four subjects. Following completion of the study, subjects may continue dosing with GSK2118436 in the rollover study, BRF114144.
