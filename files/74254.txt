A Prospective Cohort Study of Patients with Hepatobiliary Cancer Treated with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
Although immune checkpoint inhibitors including nivolumab and pembrolizumab are now available for the management of hepatobiliary cancers in Korea, there is a lack of data for the efficacy and safety of these agents in the real-world setting. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of safety of nivolumab and pembrolizumab against advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and biliary tract cancer.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab or pembrolizumab
Objective response rate, Proportion of complete response and partial response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, 6 months
Adverse events, Toxicity of nivolumab or pembrolizumab according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, 6 months
Nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenous every 2 weeks has been recently approved by US FDA for the management of patients with sorafenib-failed advanced HCC based on the promising data of Checkmate-040 phase I/II study. Although there is a lack of prospective data for pembrolizumab in biliary tract cancer except for small phase 1 trial, pembrolizumab is now available for use in Korea for the management of advanced biliary tract cancer. Because the approval of these agents was based on the small sample size, further prospective evaluation of nivolumab or pembrolizumab in patients with hepatobiliary cancer is needed.
