Trial of Artificial Intelligence for Chest Radiography
Randomized Clinical Trial of the impact of Chest radiograph AI-assisted triage and report generation upon clinical outcomes and an economic analysis of impact of AI decision support on radiology service delivery.

Report generation time, Time for radiologist to produce each individual CXR report, 12 months|Turnaround Time, Time from patient arrival at radiography department to time for clinical team to receive report, 12 months|Time to discharge, Time from patient arrival at radiography department to time to discharge from hospital, 12 months
30-day patient readmission rate, Rate of readmission of patient to hospital after discharge within 30 days, 12 months
Randomized, prospective selection of patients. Control group involves radiologists reporting chest radiographs as per reference standard clinical workflow Intervention group involves radiologists assisted with AI reporting an AI-triaged worklist of chest radiographs using an AI report generation tool Clinical outcomes on patients are studied at pre-determined study endpoints, including time to discharge from the hospital and re-admission rates.

Economic analysis on cost-avoidance from man-hours saved from report generation and triage.
