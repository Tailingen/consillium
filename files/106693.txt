RAD001 Combined With CHOP in Newly Diagnosed Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas
The urgent need for new effective therapy for T-cell lymphoma patients and promising results observed so far in trials with RAD001(everolimus, mTOR inhibitor) strongly warrants the investigation of RAD001 combined with CHOP as a first-line treatment in peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients.

Thus, we designed a phase I/II study with the combination of RAD001 with CHOP chemotherapy for newly diagnosed peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients.

Phase I

1. Primary objective

   : To define the maximum tolerable dose
2. Secondary objective

   * To evaluate the dose-limiting toxicity
   * To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of RAD001
   * Pharmacogenomic profiling

Phase II

1. Primary objective

   : To evaluate the overall response rate
2. Secondary objective

   * To estimate the time to progression
   * To estimate overall survival
   * Pharmacogenomic profiling
