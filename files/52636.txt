Phase 2 Study of TTX-030 and Chemotherapy With or Without Budigalimab for 1L mPDAC Patients
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, 3-arm, randomized, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TTX-030 with or without budigalimab in combination with chemotherapy (gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel) in subjects with metastatic PDAC who did not have prior treatment for metastatic disease and are eligible to receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy as SOC.
