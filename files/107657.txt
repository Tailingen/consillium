A Series of Study in Testing Efficacy of Pulmonary Rehabilitation Interventions in Lung Cancer Survivors
Aim: To develop and testing a home exercise program for lung cancer survivors to improve their exercise tolerance and quality of life during the rehabilitation phase.

Design: An experimental design will be used in the study. The 90 lung cancer survivors, who were diagnosed with lung cancer within one year and have completed their initial cancer treatment, will be recruited and randomized to the control or intervention group. After pre-test, the intervention participants will receive a 60 minutes of teaching regarding the home rehabilitation exercise program, with a printed exercise manual. The intervention participant will also receive a weekly phone call from the interventionist to enhance their exercise adherence and helping to overcome exercise barriers. The similar outcome measures as study one will be assessed on the baseline, 1th month, 3th month, and 6th month.

Measurements: The study outcomes will be evaluated by three physical measures, six-minute walk test, Modified Borg Scale, 30-second Chair Sit-to-Stand Test, and 30-second Chair Sit-to-Stand Test, as well as a study questionnaire including Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) and FACIT-Fatigue. For study one the following data will be collected from the patient'schart: post-operative pulmonary complications, days of chest tube insertion, and days of hospitalization.

Data analysis: Descriptive analysis will be used to describe patients'demongraphics, disease variables, and outcome variables. The Chi-square, T-test, and General Linear Mix-effect Model will be used to test the efficacy of the study interventions.
Lung Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Home rehabilitation exercise program
six-minute walk test, The six-minute walk test measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The individual is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway., Change from Baseline to 6 months
30-second arm curl test, To measure upper body strength and endurance. The participant is sitting on the edge of a stabile chair, with seat height of 44 cm (originally 43.18 cm). The back is outstretched, the feet resting flat on the ground. A handle weighing 2 kg for women or 3.5 kg for men is held in the dominant hand. The arm is directed downwards, along the chair, perpendicularly to the floor. Participant's task is, at a command given by the testing person, to rotate the hand upwards while simultaneously flexing the extremity in the elbow (flexion with supination), and subsequently to extend the extremity to its baseline position., Change from Baseline to 6 months|30-second chair sit-to-stand test, To test leg strength and endurance. Record the number of stand a person can complete in 30 seconds., Change from Baseline to 6 months|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L), There are two subscales, 27 items of FACT-General and 9 items of Lung Cancer Subscale. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0-4). The total score of the 36 items represents the score of the scale. The higher values represent better quality of life., Change from Baseline to 6 months|The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue, There are 13 items in the scale. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0-4). The total score of the 13 items represents the score of the scale. The possible score for the scale ranges from 0 to 52. The higher values represent more fatigue., Change from Baseline to 6 months
Background: With appropriate treatment, lung cancer patients can be a long-term survivor. However, many patients suffered from post-operative pulmonary complications, limited activity tolerance, and poor quality of life. Nurses in a great position to provide individualized health education regarding exercise for these patients; therefore to develop and test cost-effective nurses-lead lung rehabilitation exercise education programs deserver further scientific efforts.

Significance: The study results will provide evidence for the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation and a home exercise program for enhancing exercise tolerance and quality of life in lung cancer survivors.
