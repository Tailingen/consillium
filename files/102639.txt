Lapatinib + Vinorelbine in ErbB2 Overexpressing, First or Second Line Metastatic Breast Cancer Subjects
This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, Phase II study to determine the activity of vinorelbine plus lapatinib in either first- or second-line setting in women with ErbB2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Sixty subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will receive vinorelbine intravenously once weekly for 3 weeks, followed by a rest week in a 4-week cycle) plus lapatinib daily. Subjects will receive treatment until disease progression or withdrawal from the study. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate overall tumor response rate of lapatinib in combination with vinorelbine. Secondary objectives include progression-free survival, overall survival, duration of response, time to response and time to progression and safety. Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at 4, 8 and 12 week intervals, and at the end of treatment.

Number of Participants With Overall Response (OR), as Assessed by the Investigator, OR is defined as the number of participants achieving either a confirmed complete response (CR: the disappearance of all target lesions \[TLs\]) or partial response (PR: a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter \[LD\] of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD) as assessed by the investigator as the best OR. The best OR is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression (PD: a \>=20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of \>=1 new lesions)/recurrence., From the start of study medication until disease progression, assessed every 8 weeks for up to 2 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), as Assessed by the Investigator, PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the earliest date of disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, if sooner. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., From the start of study medication until disease progression, assessed every 8 weeks for up to 2 years|Duration of Response, as Assessed by the Investigator, Duration of response, for the subset of participants who had a confirmed CR (the disappearance of all TLs) or PR (a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD), is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression (a \>=20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest LD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of \>=1 new lesions) or death due to any cause, if sooner., From the start of study medication until disease progression, assessed every 8 weeks for up to 2 years|Time to Response, as Assessed by the Investigator, Time to response, for the subset of participants who had a confirmed CR (the disappearance of all TLs) or PR (a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the LD of the TLs, taking as a reference the baseline sum LD), is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the first documented evidence of CR or PR (whichever status was recorded first). When tumor response was confirmed at a repeat assessment, the time to response was taken to be the first time that the response was observed., From the start of study medication until disease progression, assessed every 8 weeks for up to 2 years|Time to Progression (TTP), as Assessed by the Investigator, TTP is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the earliest date of disease progression (a \>=20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest LD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of \>=1 new lesions) or death due to breast cancer, if sooner., From the start of study medication until disease progression, assessed every 8 weeks for up to 2 years|Number of Participants With the Indicated Adverse Events Occurring in at Least 5 Participants and Related to the Combination of Lapatinib and Vinorelbine, Qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with the combination of lapatinib and vinorelbine during the study are those adverse events (AEs) that are judged to be related to the study treatment by the investigator. Those AEs occuring in more than 5 participants in the ITT Population are listed here., From the start of study medication until disease progression, assessed every 4 weeks for up to 2 years|Overall Survival, OS is defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the date of death. In the absence of confirmation of death, survival time was to be censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive. Overall survival was not assessed because the study was terminated due to low screening and a low enrollment rate after 3 years. There were no-survival follow-up visits required., From the start of study treatment to the date of death, assessed for up to 3 years
