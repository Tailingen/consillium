22 Gauge Needle for EUS Guided Tissue Acquisition of Samples for Histologic Examination
To determine the yield of tissue biopsy specimen and the diagnostic accuracy of tissue acquisition using a newly developed 22 gauge needle in patients with solid lesions throughout the GI tract.
Abdominal Neoplasms
OTHER: Fine Needle Tissue Acquisition
- Yield, as defined by the percentage of patients in whom a histologically interpretable specimen will be retrieved by EUS-FNTA., diagnostic accuracy, intraoperative
rate of complications, - The rate of complications, divided in procedural complication (perforation, bleeding) occurring during the procedure and late complications (delayed bleeding, infection) occurring during the post-procedural observational period., perioperative
The use of 22 gauge needle to gather tissue samples under EUS guidance has not been associated with an increased risk, and no major complications have been described so far both for the 22 gauge Procore needle and for standard 22 gauge.20, 21 Potential benefits of this new needle are the possibility of increasing the chance of retrieving tissue specimens for histological examination, with the possibility of increasing the diagnostic accuracy of the procedure saving the need and the cost deriving from on-site cytopathology examination. This may reduce the need to repeat EUS procedures or other more invasive sampling procedures, including surgery.
