Minimal Residual Disease Evaluation on Cryopreserved Ovarian Fragments in Younger Patients Treated for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Cryopreservation of ovarian cortex represents an option for fertility preservation in patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and requiring allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

This pilot study aims to evaluate the minimal residual disease on ovarian fragments harvested before allogeneic stem cell transplantation at the time of complete remission.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Percentage of patients without detectable MRD in ovarian tissue, Up to 6 months
Percentage of patients with MRD detected in ovarian tissue and bone marrow., Up to 1 month
