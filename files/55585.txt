Exploratory Interventional Study of Prognostic Serum Biomarkers of Cancer Progression
Exploratory interventional study of prognostic serum biomarkers of cancer progression.

Study of the relationship between the blood levels of soluble PDL1 and β2-microglobulin, and the clinical course of a metastatic solid tumor treated with a first-line therapeutic of checkpoint immune inhibitor.

Primary objective To study the relationship between the blood levels of soluble PDL1 and β2-microglobulin measured at the diagnostic stage, and the clinical course of a metastatic solid tumor (non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, or melanoma) treated with a 1st line therapeutic immune checkpoint inhibitor.

The secondary objectives are:

* To study the relationship between the blood levels of soluble PDL1 and β2-microglobulin measured during treatment, and the clinical course of a metastatic solid tumor treated with a first-line therapeutic immune checkpoint inhibitor.
* To study the correlation between the soluble PDL1 level and the tumor PDL1 level.
* To study the correlation between the blood levels of soluble PDL1 and β2-microglobulin.
* To study the relationship between the blood levels of soluble PDL1 and β2-microglobulin measured during the treatment, and the tolerance of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor in 1st line therapy.
