Contrast Enhanced Mammography or Breast Magnetic Resonance: Which Choice for Optimal Diagnostic Performance?
This study compares the diagnostic performance of Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM) and Breast MRI in evaluating breast lesions. It aims to assess sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy to identify the optimal imaging modality for clinical scenarios such as dense breast tissue and high-risk populations.

Diagnostic Accuracy of CEM vs. MRI for Breast Lesion Detection and Characterization, The primary outcome of the study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of Contrast-Enhanced Mammography (CEM) and Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in detecting and characterizing breast lesions. This will be assessed by evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic performance of both imaging modalities. Findings will be correlated with histopathological results or follow-up imaging to determine the accuracy of each modality in the diagnosis of breast cancer., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months
Sensitivity and Specificity of CEM vs. MRI, This secondary outcome aims to compare the sensitivity and specificity of CEM and MRI in detecting breast lesions. Sensitivity refers to the ability to correctly identify true positives, while specificity refers to correctly identifying true negatives. These metrics will be analyzed to assess the diagnostic capability of each imaging technique., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of CEM vs. MRI, The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) will be calculated for both CEM and MRI. PPV indicates the proportion of positive test results that are true positives, while NPV indicates the proportion of negative test results that are true negatives., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months|Patient Preference and Tolerability of CEM vs. MRI, This outcome will assess patient preference and tolerability between CEM and MRI. Patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their comfort during each imaging procedure, and their preference for one modality over the other will be recorded., From enrollment to the end of treatment at 12 months
