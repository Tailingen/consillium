Study of ACTR087 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
This is a phase 1, multi-center, single-arm, open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of an autologous T-cell product expressing ACTR in combination with rituximab in subjects with refractory or relapsed CD20+ B-cell lymphoma.
