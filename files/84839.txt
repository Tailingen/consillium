Prospective Evaluation of Biliary Tissue Sampling with ERCP
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, outcomes and performance characteristics of multiple biliary sampling techniques including but not limited to: single operator cholangioscopy (SOC) directed biopsies, transpapillary biliary biopsies (TPBx), brushings and bile aspiration for cytology and FISH in patients undergoing ERCP.
Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde|Biliary Stricture|Biliary Tract Diseases|Cholangiocarcinoma
Performance characteristics, Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value for the detection of malignancy with each sampling technique, 1 year after ERCP procedure|Number of adverse events, Adverse events after biliary sampling, Within 30 days of ERCP procedure
Healthcare Utilization, Number of ERCPs, Radiological studies etc needed before accurate diagnosis, through study completion, an average of 2 years
