Autologous Redirected RNA Meso-CIR T Cells
To determine the safety and manufacturing feasibility of IV autologous chimeric immune receptor (CIR) T cells transfected with anti-mesothelin messenger RNA (mRNA) expressing a single chain antibody variable fragment linked to the intracellular CD 3 zeta T cell receptor domain and the 4-1BB costimulatory domain.
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous T cells
Adverse Events, Occurence of study related adverse events greater than to equal to Grade 3 events that are possibly, likely or definitely related to study treatment., Until week 4
Clinical response Rate, Effect of CIR T cell infusion on systemic adaptive and innate immunity, through 6 months post dosing
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of infusing the study product CIR T cells. These T cells are made using T cells obtained through apheresis and introducing the T cells to a temporary gene which will cause them to start making a new type of antibody that will attach mesothelin (this antibody is found on the surface of the cancer cells). In theory, once the modified T cells attach to mesothelin, the cells will be activated to stimulate the subject's own immune system to attack the mesothelin cells. This type of modified cell is called a T cell transduced transfected with chimeric anti-mesothelin immunoreceptor. Subjects will be enrolled serially with all subjects receiving 1xe8 to 1x1e9 modified CIR T cells every other day for 3 infusions. Each patient will be observed for 9 days for toxicity assessment prior to receiving a second cycle of modified CIR T cells every other day for 3 infusions. The preceding subject must have completed the two-cycle regimen and been observed for toxicity through day 21 before the next subject can be enrolled.
