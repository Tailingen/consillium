Standard Maintenance Therapy versus Local Consolidative Radiation Therapy and standard maintenance therapy in 1-5 sites of OligoMetastatic Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial
Oligometastatic Disease|Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Local consolidative radiation therapy|DRUG: Standard maintenance therapy as decided by the treating medical oncologist
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the duration between the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause or the date of last follow-up, whichever is earlier., Upto 2 years
Progression free survival (PFS ), Progression free survival is defined as the duration between the date of randomization to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause or date of last follow-up, whichever is earlier., Upto 2 years|Local control rates of treated sites, Local control rate will be defined as the absence of progressive disease at the treated sites, Upto 2 years|New distant metastases, Time to onset of new distant metastases, Upto 2 years|Health Related QOL using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire, To evaluate patient reported outcomes between the two arms, From randomization every 3 months till 2 years|Health Related QOL using the EORTC- LC13 questionnaire, To evaluate patient reported outcomes between the two arms, From randomization every 3 months till 2 years|Response rates, To compare response rates between the two arms, From randomization every 3 months upto 2 years|Radiotherapy related toxicity using CTC v5.0 (radiotherapy related acute and late toxicity), At baseline and at subsequent follow up till 2 years, Upto 2 years
