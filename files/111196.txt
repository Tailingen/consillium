Sublingual Methadone for the Management of Cancer-related Breakthrough Pain in Outpatients
The purpose of this Phase II study is to determine the feasibility of the dose titration and assessment protocol in the outpatient population before conducting an appropriately powered phase III study. Thus the primary purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of patients who are successfully titrated to an optimal dose of sublingual (Under the tongue) methadone and then studied at that optimal dose with successive episodes of breakthrough pain.
