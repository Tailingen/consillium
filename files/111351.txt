Validation of Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score in Korean Version
In contemporary era of rectal cancer treatment, development of surgical technique and tool, adaptation of chemoradiation therapy, as well as multidisciplinary approach have led increased survival as well as rate of sphincter preservation. However, poor anorectal function, such as fecal incontinence and/or urgency, has also been increased. Such anorectal dysfunction is named as low anterior resection syndrome, and its rate has been reported in 40 to 90% in rectal cancer patients who received sphincter preserving surgery. Low anterior resection syndrome is known to debilitate quality of life in survivors of rectal cancer. Previously, several studies attempted to evaluate the low anterior resection syndrome via questionnaires and scoring system. Adapting the low anterior resection syndrome score system created in Denmark, this study investigates the validity of the scoring system in Korean language.

OTHER: questionnaire
Quality of life in association to the severity of bowel dysfunction, The change in the quality of life will be evaluated based on the questionnaire in regard to bowel dysfunction, 3 months follow-up, 6 months follow-up, 1 year follow-up, 2 year follow-up, 3 year follow-up, 4 year follow-up, 5 year follow-up, beyond 5 year follow-up
In this study, the low anterior resection syndrome score questionnaire proposed by Therese Juul is translated to Korean language by 3 different professional translators. Patients who received sphincter saving surgery to treat rectal cancer will be asked to fill up the questionnaire. Compiling the results, the quality of life after sphincter preserving surgery will be investigated in the association with the low anterior resection syndrome.
