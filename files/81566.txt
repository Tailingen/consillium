Focal Laser Ablation of Low to Intermediate Prostate Cancer Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of MRI-guided focal laser ablation (Laser-Induced Interstitial Thermal Therapy, LITT) to treat low-risk native prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Stage I Prostate Cancer AJCC v8|Stage II Prostate Cancer AJCC v8|Localized Prostate Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Focal laser ablation of the prostate
Success rate, To evaluate the procedural success rate of using the MR-guided laser ablation to target, access, thermally monitor, and focally ablate MR-visible prostate cancer lesions., 3 years|Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, To evaluate patient-related safety by monitoring short and long-term complications related to the procedure such as but not limited to incontinence, impotence, and urethral fistulas., 3 years
Short- and mid-term ablative success, To obtain preliminary data on ablative success using longitudinal MR imaging assessment of treated areas., 3 years
The study is being done to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-guided focal laser therapy with the Visualase Thermal Therapy System to treat low-risk prostate cancer tumors. Unlike surgery or radiotherapy which affects a large portion of the prostate or the entire organ, localized or focal therapy is intended to treat a small portion of tissue in which the cancer has been found by biopsy.
