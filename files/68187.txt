Bortezomib in Combination With Liposomal Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone to Treat Plasma Cell Leukemia
Bortezomib/Liposomal doxorubicin (V-DD) is preferred to bortezomib single agent in salvage therapy for Multiple Myeloma (MM).

The present study is designed to assessment the efficacy and safety study of Bortezomib in combination with Liposomal Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone in treatment of Plasma Cell Leukemia (PCL).

Primary study endpoint is the overall response rate (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR). Secondary endpoints is the rate of complete response (sCR+CR), partial remission rate (VGPR + PR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS).
