Dose Escalation Study of Simultaneous Boost Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
This will be the first study to assess the clinical feasibility of dose escalation with simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. Following screening to confirm eligibility patients will commence a six week treatment period. After this, patients will be followed up by visits to clinic every 3 months for a period of 24 months (2 years). End of study is defined as 24 months after treatment. Patients will be followed up for a minimum of 5 years (as per local policy) after treatment.
