CART-EGFRvIII + Pembrolizumab in GBM
This is an open-label, phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability of EGFRvIII T cells in combination with pembrolizumab (PD-1 Inhibitor) in patients with newly diagnosed, EGFRvIII+, MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma
BIOLOGICAL: CART-EGFRvIII T cells|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Number of subjects with treatment-related adverse events, using NCI CTCAE v5.0., 15 Years
Overall survival Rate, Number of days from the date of the first CART-EGFRvIII infusion to the date of death of any cause. The survival function of OS will be calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method., 15 Years|Progression-free survival (PFS), The number of days from the date of the first CART-EGFRvIII infusion to the first documented disease progression (based on standard MRI evaluation using the modified RANO criteria) or date of death, whichever occurs first. PFS will be calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method., 15 Years|Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) out of the total number of efficacy evaluable subjects. Exact 90%confidence interval for ORR will be computed., 15 Years
