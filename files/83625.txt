Confirmation of Association Between Cystic Fluid Analysis With Pancreatic Cystic Lesions
Through a comprehensive analysis of the pancreatic cystic fluid analysis, the role of the cystic fluid analysis is confirmed in terms of accurate diagnosis of pancreatic cysts, appropriate prediction of treatment response, and to select proper treatment indication through analytic results.
