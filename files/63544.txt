Study to Develop Head Stabilizer for Use During Brain Radiation Therapy
The purpose of this study is to begin to develop a device to stabilize the head during stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). SRS is a therapy for brain disorders and cancers that uses a precise dose of radiation to treat a disease, and is different from whole brain radiation. This study aims to stabilize patient head motions during radiation therapy through the use of a special experimental head holder. The investigators would like to first see how the experimental device works in whole brain radiation.

Access feasibility of the use of an experimental head stabilizer device, Feasibility will be defined as to whether or not the 6D target is ≤ 0.5mm and ≤ 0.5deg for greater than 95% of treatment time, During radiation treatment (5-10 days)
