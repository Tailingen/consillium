A Phase II Single-Arm Clinical Study to Explore the Efficacy and Safety of Hyperbaric Oxygen in the Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer Patients
The goal of the study is to explore the efficacy and safety of hyperbaric oxygen in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients
Breast Cancers
DEVICE: hyperbaric oxygen treatment
pCR rate after hyperbaric oxygen combined with neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients, pCR rate after hyperbaric oxygen combined with neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients, After completion of standard cycle of neoadjuvant therapy (through study completion, an average of half a year)
The Miller and payne classification, After completion of standard cycle of neoadjuvant therapy (through study completion, an average of half a year)|RCB 0/1 rate, RCB (Residual Cancer Burden) is a commonly used metric to assess the extent of residual tumor burden after neoadjuvant therapy, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapy.

RCB 0: Complete response (CR) - No visible residual tumor, complete disappearance of the tumor.

RCB I: Minimal residual disease - Only a small amount of residual tumor remains, with limited tumor volume and few lymph node metastases.

RCB II: Moderate residual disease - Moderate degree of tumor residual is present.

RCB III: Extensive residual disease - A large amount of residual tumor remains, often with more lymph node metastases., After completion of standard cycle of neoadjuvant therapy (through study completion, an average of half a year)|RECIST criteria, After completion of standard cycle of neoadjuvant therapy (through study completion, an average of half a year)|life quality, At the time of patient enrolment, Each cycle of chemotherapy (8cycle, each cycle is 3 weeks), Day before surgery, 3 months after surgery.|Side effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, during the hyperbaric oxygen therapy (up to half a year)|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, through study completion ( an average of half a year)|the Tumor immune microenvironment of the Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy and neoadjuvant therapy, the time when the patient enrollment, at the end of the first cycle of neoadjuvant therapy (at about the first month), surgery
The goal of the study is to explore the efficacy and safety of hyperbaric oxygen in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients
