Incidence and Mortality
Anatomy
Prognosis and Survival
The non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) T-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of T-cell lymphoproliferative malignancies, which account for less than 15% of NHLs.[
1
] About 85% of NHL cases are B-cell lymphomas.  For more information, see
Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
and
Aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment
.
T-cell lymphoma can be divided into cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-LBL/ALL).
T-LBL/ALL arises from very early T cells, often involves the thymus, and is more common in young adults. The lymphoma form is often treated similarly to the leukemia form. For more information, see
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment
.
CTCL starts in the skin and includes mycosis fungoides, Sézary syndrome, primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and others. For more information, see
Mycosis Fungoides  and Other Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphomas Treatment
.
PTCL originates from mature T cells. It usually arises from lymphoid tissues but can spread to other organs. Subsets of PTCL include anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENK/TCL), PTCL not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), and others.
Incidence and Mortality
T-cell lymphomas make up less than 15% of NHL cases. Most T-cell lymphoma subtypes are associated with worse outcomes than those of B-cell lymphomas.[
1
]
Anatomy
NHL usually originates in lymphoid tissues.
Enlarge
The lymph system is part of the body's immune system and is made up of tissues and organs that help protect the body from infection and disease. These include the tonsils, adenoids (not shown), thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes. Lymph tissue is also found in many other parts of the body, including the small intestine.
Prognosis and Survival
Prognosis in PTCL varies depending on subtype, stage, and other factors. In general, PTCL is associated with a poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30% to 40%.[
2
,
3
] While outcomes are better for patients with ALK-positive ALCL, with a median 5-year overall survival (OS) closer to 70% to 80%,[
2
-
4
] other subsets are associated with worse survival, such as ALK-negative ALCL, AITL, PTCL-NOS, HSTCL, EATL, and ENK/TCL.[
5
,
6
]
Unlike B-cell NHLs, which include both indolent and aggressive forms, most PTCLs are considered aggressive.[
7
] As with most other aggressive lymphomas, PTCLs are often curable with systemic therapy, though effective treatment options are more limited, particularly in the relapsed or refractory setting.[
8
,
9
]
Even though existing treatments cure a significant fraction of patients with lymphoma, numerous clinical trials that explore treatment improvements are in progress. If possible, patients can be included in these studies.
In addition to screening for HIV among patients with aggressive lymphomas, active hepatitis B or hepatitis C can be assessed before treatment with chemotherapy.[
10
,
11
] Patients with detectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) benefit from prophylaxis with entecavir.[
12
,
13
] Patients with a resolved HBV infection (defined as hepatitis B surface antigen-negative but hepatitis B core antibody-positive) are at risk of reactivation of HBV and require monitoring of HBV DNA. Prophylactic nucleoside therapy lowered HBV reactivation from 10.8% to 2.1% in a retrospective study of 326 patients.[
14
] Prophylaxis for herpes zoster with acyclovir or valacyclovir and prophylaxis for pneumocystis with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or dapsone are usually given to patients receiving combination chemotherapy.

Late Effects of Treatment of Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
Late effects of treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma


(NHL) have been observed. Impaired  fertility may occur after exposure to alkylating agents.[
1
] For as many as three decades after diagnosis, patients are at a significantly elevated risk of developing second primary cancers, especially the following:[
2
-
5
]
Lung cancer.
Brain cancer.
Kidney cancer.
Bladder cancer.
Melanoma.
Hodgkin lymphoma.
Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
Left ventricular dysfunction was a significant late effect in long-term survivors of high-grade NHL who received more than 200 mg/m² of doxorubicin.[

Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia are late complications of myeloablative therapy with autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell support, as well as conventional chemotherapy-containing alkylating agents.[

,
7
-
14
] Most of these patients show clonal hematopoiesis even before the transplant, suggesting that the hematologic injury usually occurs during induction or reinduction chemotherapy.[
9
,
15
,
16
] A series of 605 patients who received autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) with cyclophosphamide and total-body radiation therapy (as conditioning) were followed for a median of 10 years. The incidence of a second malignancy was 21%, and 10% of those malignancies were solid tumors.[
17
]
A study of young women who received autologous BMT reported successful pregnancies with children born free of congenital abnormalities.[
18
] Late-occurring venous thromboembolism can occur after allogeneic or autologous BMT.[
19
]
Some patients have osteopenia or osteoporosis at the start of therapy; bone density may worsen after therapy for lymphoma.[

Cellular Classification of Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
In This Section
Current Classification Systems
Updated REAL/WHO classification
Subtypes of Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
A pathologist should be consulted before  a biopsy because some studies require special preparation of tissue (e.g., frozen tissue). Knowledge of cell surface markers and immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements may help with diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. The clonal excess of light-chain immunoglobulin may differentiate malignant cells from reactive cells. Because the prognosis and the approach to treatment are influenced by histopathology, outside biopsy specimens should be carefully reviewed by a hematopathologist who is experienced in diagnosing lymphomas. Although lymph node biopsies are recommended whenever possible, sometimes immunophenotypic data are sufficient for diagnosis of lymphoma when fine-needle aspiration cytology or core needle biopsy is preferred.[

Current Classification Systems
Updated REAL/WHO classification
The World Health Organization (WHO) modification of the Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) classification recognizes three major categories
of lymphoid malignancies based on morphology and cell lineage: B-cell
neoplasms, T-cell/natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms, and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). 
Both lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias are included in this classification
because both solid and circulating phases are present in many lymphoid
neoplasms and distinction between them is artificial.  For example, B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma are simply
different manifestations of the same neoplasm, as are lymphoblastic lymphomas
and acute lymphocytic leukemias.  Within the B-cell and T-cell categories, two
subdivisions are recognized: precursor neoplasms, which correspond to the
earliest stages of differentiation, and more mature differentiated
neoplasms.[

Stage Information for Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
In This Section
Staging Subclassification System
Lugano classification
Stage is important in selecting a treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are usually part of the staging evaluation for all patients with lymphoma. The staging system for NHL is similar to the staging system used for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).
It is common for patients with NHL to have involvement of the following sites:
Noncontiguous lymph nodes.
Waldeyer ring.
Epitrochlear nodes.
Gastrointestinal tract.
Extranodal presentations. (A single extranodal site is occasionally the only site of involvement in patients with diffuse lymphoma.)
Bone marrow.
Liver (especially common in patients with low-grade lymphomas).
Cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid may be positive in patients with aggressive NHL. Involvement of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes is less common than in HL. Mediastinal adenopathy, however, is a prominent feature of lymphoblastic lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, entities primarily found in young adults.
Most patients with NHL present with advanced (stage III or stage IV) disease often identified by CT scans or biopsies of the bone marrow and other accessible sites of involvement. In a retrospective review of over 32,000 cases of lymphoma in France, up to 40% of diagnoses were made by core needle biopsy, and 60% were made by excisional biopsy.[
1
] After expert review, core needle biopsy provided a definite diagnosis in 92.3% of cases; excisional biopsy provided a definite diagnosis in 98.1% of cases (
P
< .0001). Laparoscopic biopsy or laparotomy is not required for staging but rarely may be necessary to establish a diagnosis or histological type.[
2
]
Positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose can be used for initial staging. It can also be used  for follow-up after therapy as a supplement to CT scanning.[
3
] Multiple studies have demonstrated that interim PET scans after two to four cycles of therapy do not provide reliable prognostic information. A large cooperative group trial (
ECOG-E344
[NCT00274924])  reported problems with interobserver reproducibility. Two prospective trials  and one meta-analysis showed no differences in outcomes between PET-negative and PET-positive/biopsy-negative patients.[
4
-
7
]
In a retrospective study of 130 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, PET scanning identified all clinically important marrow involvement from lymphoma, and bone marrow biopsy did not upstage any patient's lymphoma.[
8
] A retrospective study of 580 patients with follicular lymphoma from seven National Cancer Institute–sponsored trials showed no improvement in assessing response to therapy when bone marrow biopsy was added to radiological imaging.[
9
] The workup of NHL should include bone marrow biopsy when management would change (e.g., determining limited stage vs. advanced stage) or when evaluating cytopenias.
Staging Subclassification System
Lugano classification
The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has adopted the Lugano classification to evaluate and stage lymphoma.[
10
] The Lugano classification system replaces the Ann Arbor classification system, which was adopted in 1971 at the Ann Arbor Conference,[
11
] with some modifications 18 years later from the Cotswolds meeting.[

b
Stage II bulky may be considered either early or advanced stage based on lymphoma histology and prognostic factors.
c
The definition of disease bulk varies according to lymphoma histology. In the Lugano classification, bulk ln Hodgkin lymphoma is defined as a mass greater than one-third of the thoracic diameter on CT of the chest or a mass >10 cm. For NHL, the recommended definitions of bulk vary by lymphoma histology. In follicular lymphoma, 6 cm has been suggested based on the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index-2 and its validation. In DLBCL, cutoffs ranging from 5 cm to 10 cm have been used, although 10 cm is recommended.
Limited stage
I
Involvement of a single lymphatic site (i.e., nodal region, Waldeyer’s ring, thymus, or spleen).
Enlarge
IE
Single extralymphatic site in the absence of nodal involvement (rare in Hodgkin lymphoma).
II
Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm.
Enlarge
IIE
Contiguous extralymphatic extension from a nodal site with or without involvement of other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm.
Enlarge
II bulky
b
Stage II with disease bulk.
c
Advanced stage
III
Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm; nodes above the diaphragm with spleen involvement.
Enlarge
IV
Diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, with or without associated lymph node involvement; or noncontiguous extralymphatic organ involvement in conjunction with nodal stage II disease; or any extralymphatic organ involvement in nodal stage III disease. Stage IV includes any involvement of the CSF, bone marrow, liver, or multiple lung lesions (other than by direct extension in stage IIE disease).
Enlarge
Note: Hodgkin lymphoma uses A or B designation with stage group. A/B is no longer used in NHL.
Occasionally, specialized staging systems are used. The physician should be aware of the system used in a specific report.
The E designation is used when extranodal lymphoid malignancies arise in tissues separate from, but near, the major lymphatic aggregates. Stage IV refers to disease that is diffusely spread throughout an extranodal site, such as the liver. If pathological proof of involvement of one or more extralymphatic sites has been documented, the symbol for the site of involvement, followed by a plus sign (+), is listed.
Table 2.  Notation to Identify Specific Sites
N = nodes
H = liver
L = lung
M = bone marrow
S = spleen
P = pleura
O = bone
D = skin
Current practice assigns a clinical stage  based on the findings of the clinical evaluation and a pathological stage based on the findings from invasive procedures beyond the initial biopsy.
For example, on percutaneous biopsy, a patient with inguinal adenopathy and a positive lymphangiogram without systemic symptoms might have involvement of the liver and bone marrow. The precise stage of such a patient would be clinical stage IIA, pathological stage IVA(H+)(M+).
Several other factors that are not included in the above staging system are important for the staging and prognosis of patients with NHL. These factors include the following:
Age.
Performance status (PS).
Tumor size.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values.
The number of extranodal sites.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (IPI) for aggressive NHL (diffuse large cell lymphoma) identifies the following five significant risk factors prognostic of overall survival (OS) and their associated risk scores:[
14
]
Age.
<40 years: 0.
41–60 years: 1.
61–75 years: 2.
>75 years: 3.
Stage III/IV: 1.
Performance status (PS) 2/3/4: 1.
Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Normalized: 0.
>1x–3x: 1.
>3x: 2.
Number of extranodal sites ≥2: 1.
Risk scores:
Low (0 or 1): 5-year OS rate, 96%; progression-free survival (PFS) rate, 91%.
Low intermediate (2 or 3): 5-year OS rate, 82%; PFS rate, 74%.
High intermediate (4 or 5): 5-year OS rate, 64%; PFS rate, 51%.
High (>6): 5-year OS rate, 33%; PFS rate, 30%.

Treatment Options for Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
Breast Implant–Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
Current Clinical Trials
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a peripheral T-cell lymphoma associated with the CD30 antigen.  The translocation of chromosomes 2 and 5 creates a unique fusion protein with a nucleophosmin–anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK).[
1
,
2
] Patients whose lymphomas express ALK by immunohistochemistry are usually younger and may have systemic symptoms, extranodal disease, and advanced-stage disease. However, they have a more favorable survival rate than patients with ALK-negative disease.[
3
,
4
] ALK-negative ALCL has been further characterized by
DUSP22
chromosomal rearrangements and the presence of
TP63
pathogenic variants. While
DUSP22
rearrangements are associated with improved prognosis,
TP63
pathogenic variants are associated with poorer outcomes.[
5
]
Treatment Options for Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
A prospective randomized trial included 452 patients with CD30-positive T-cell lymphoma (CD30 expression >10%). Of these patients,  70% had ALCL (22% with ALK-positive disease and 48% with ALK-negative disease). The trial compared the previously used  standard regimen, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), with brentuximab vedotin (an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent) combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (A+CHP regimen).[
6
]
With a median follow-up of 47.6 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 70.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.3%–75.9%) for patients who received A+CHP and 61.0% (95% CI, 54.0%–67.3%) for patients who received CHOP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53–0.99).[
7
][
Level of evidence A1
]
The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 51.4% (95% CI, 42.8%–59.4%) for patients who received A+CHP and 43.0% (95% CI, 35.8%–50.0%) for patients who received CHOP (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53–0.91).
This established A+CHP as a new option for patients with ALCL or other CD30-positive T-cell lymphomas, such as angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified.
For patients with relapsed disease, anecdotal responses have been reported for  brentuximab vedotin,[

In a phase II study (
NCT00866047
), 66% of 58 patients attained a complete response with brentuximab vedotin.[
11
]
At a median follow-up of 58 months, the 5-year PFS rate was 57% (95% CI, 41%–74%), and the 5-year OS rate was 79% (95% CI, 65%–92%). Of the patients achieving a complete response, 42% underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT).[

In a retrospective review, 39 patients with relapsed disease had a 3-year PFS rate of 50% after autologous or allogeneic SCT.[
15
][
Level of evidence C2

A retrospective review of 84 patients with ALK-negative ALCL suggested a survival benefit with autologous SCT. This hypothesis requires confirmation in a randomized prospective trial.[

A retrospective study included 182 patients with relapsed or refractory ALCL (23% ALK-positive, 21% ALK-negative, and 56% ALK-unknown) who underwent allogeneic SCT.[
17
]
The 5-year PFS rate was 41% (95% CI, 34%–49%), and the 5-year OS rate was 41% (95% CI, 49%–64%).[
17
][
Level of evidence C3
]
On multivariate analysis, African American race (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.6–4.8;
P
< .001) and refractory disease at time of allogeneic SCT (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.6–6.2;
P
< .001) were predictive factors for inferior OS.
Despite ALK positivity being a favorable prognostic factor, outcomes after allogeneic SCT in this study did not vary significantly according to ALK status.
ALCL in children is usually characterized by systemic and cutaneous disease and has high response rates and good OS with doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy.[
18
] The ALK inhibitor crizotinib has been combined with chemotherapy for previously untreated pediatric patients, and crizotinib has been used to control disease in multiply relapsed pediatric patients.[
19
,
20
] Crizotinib is associated with a high risk (around 25%) of thromboembolism, especially pulmonary embolism, and prophylaxis is recommended.  There are no reports supporting the use of crizotinib in adults.
Breast Implant–Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
Patients with breast implant–associated ALCL may do well without chemotherapy after capsulectomy and implant removal if the disease is confined to the fibrous capsule, and no associated mass or lymphadenopathy is present.[
21
-
24
] Most patients with breast implant–associated ALCL have a characteristic deletion at 20Q13.13 that may help to diagnostically distinguish it from cutaneous or systemic ALCL.[
25
]
Primary cutaneous ALCL is a distinct entity that is typically ALK-negative and has a very indolent/low-grade clinical course. Breast implant–associated ALCL almost always occurs with implants that have a textured surface (so-called macrotextured implants) that helps adhere to the breast. Warnings, suspensions, and bans of macrotextured implants have occurred worldwide. The risk of breast implant–associated ALCL is approximately 1 in 12,000 people, but this risk may rise with further follow-up.[

Treatment Options for Nodal Lymphomas of T Follicular Helper Cell Origin
Current Clinical Trials
The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification recognized nodal lymphomas of T follicular helper (TFH) cell origin as a distinct subset of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Unified by a CD4+ TFH cell origin, this subset includes:[
1
]
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL or ATCL).
Follicular peripheral T-cell lymphoma (F-PTCL).
Nodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma with follicular helper phenotype (nodal PTCL with TFH phenotype).
AITL  is the most common of these entities and is the second-most common subtype of PTCL.[
2
-
5
] Patients often present with profound lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, weight loss, skin rash, a positive Coombs test, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia.[
6
] Opportunistic infections are frequent because of an underlying immune deficiency.  B-cell Epstein-Barr virus genomes are detected in most affected patients.[
7
] For more information about weight loss, see
Nutrition in Cancer Care
and for more information about skin rash, see
Pruritus
.
The remaining subtypes of nodal lymphomas of TFH cell origin, including F-PTCL and nodal PTCL with TFH phenotype, are derived from the same cell of origin. However, unlike AITL, these subtypes are not associated with hypervascularity on nodal biopsy and often lack the hyperinflammatory symptoms characteristic of AITL.[
1
]
Treatment Options for Nodal Lymphomas of T Follicular Helper Cell Origin
Doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy, such as the CHO(E)P regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone), is commonly used for patients with AITL and other nodal lymphomas of TFH cell origin.[
2
,
5
] For CD30-positive cases, brentuximab vedotin combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone is the proposed standard of care.[

Prognosis
Treatment Options for Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified
Current Clinical Trials
Patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) have diffuse large cell or diffuse mixed lymphoma that expresses a cell surface phenotype of a postthymic (or peripheral) T-cell expressing either CD4 or, less often, CD8.[
1
] PTCL-NOS encompasses a group of heterogeneous nodal T-cell lymphomas that will require future delineation.[
2
,
3
]   Gene expression profiling studies have identified two distinct subtypes of PTCL-NOS based on the transcription factors GATA3 and TBX21. Early investigation and anecdotal reports suggest these subtypes may carry important prognostic implications and could predict response to certain therapies.[
4
]  Additional studies are needed for further characterization of their clinical relevance.
Prognosis
Most investigators report worse response and survival rates for patients with PTCL-NOS than for patients with comparably staged B-cell aggressive lymphomas.[
3
,
5
] Most patients present with multiple adverse prognostic factors (i.e., older age, stage IV, multiple extranodal sites, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase), and these patients have low (<20%) failure-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates at 5 years.[
3
,
5
] As with other lymphomas (e.g., diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL] or follicular lymphoma), event-free survival (EFS) at 24 months predicts a 5-year OS rate of 78%.[

Therapy involves doxorubicin-based combination chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or CHO(E)P (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone). Doses are the same as those used for DLBCL.[

Evidence (CHOP, CHO[E]P, or other options for relapsing disease):
A randomized prospective trial included 104 patients younger than 61 years with stage II, III, or IV PTCL (excluding ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma). Patients received either autologous SCT or allogeneic SCT as consolidation therapy after induction with CHO(E)P followed by DHAP (dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin).[

With a median follow-up of 42 months, the 3-year EFS rate was 43% for patients who received allogeneic SCT and 38% for patients who received autologous SCT.
The 3-year OS rate was 57% for patients who received allogeneic SCT and 70% for patients who received autologous SCT (
P
= nonsignificant).
None of the 21 responding patients who proceeded to allogeneic SCT relapsed, and 36% of patients who proceeded to autologous SCT relapsed.
Eight of 26 patients (31%) who received allogeneic SCT died of graft-versus-host disease, and none of the 41 patients who received autologous SCT died of toxicity.
The benefit of graft-versus-lymphoma effect was negated by increased transplant-related mortality.
In a prospective trial of 109 evaluable patients with relapsing disease, treatment with pralatrexate resulted in a 30% response rate and a median 10-month duration of response.[

Treatment of  Extranodal Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma
In This Section
Treatment Options for Extranodal Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma
Current Clinical Trials
Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is an aggressive lymphoma marked by extensive necrosis and angioinvasion, most often presenting in extranodal sites, in particular the nasal or paranasal sinus region.[
1
] Other extranodal sites include the palate, trachea, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Hemophagocytic syndrome may also occur; historically, these tumors were considered part of lethal midline granuloma.[
2
] Tumor cells are typically NK cells with immunophenotyping showing CD3 and CD56 expression. In nearly all cases, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is detectable in the tumor cells. Aggressive NK cell leukemia (ANKL) is a separate but related diagnosis, which was previously recognized as a subset of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia, and is characterized by mature NK cell neoplastic involvement of the blood or marrow involvement with a particularly aggressive course and poor prognosis.[
3
]  A benign NK-cell enteropathy (EBV negative) on endoscopic biopsy can be distinguished from NK/T-cell lymphoma.[
3
] Extranodal NK-cell lymphoma (ENKL), nasal type is rare in Western countries and more commonly seen in Asia, where it represents 3% to 8% of all lymphoma cases. Most cases present with nasal involvement and localized disease. Both extranasal and advanced-stage (stages III–IV) disease are associated with poor prognosis.[
4
,
5
]
Treatment Options for Extranodal Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma
The management of localized ENKL with nasal involvement involves combined modality therapy with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for those fit for chemotherapy or radiation therapy alone for those unfit for chemotherapy. The management of nonlocalized nasal ENKL and all cases of extranasal ENKL involves combination chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy.[
6
] Because ENKL frequently expresses P-glycoprotein which confers multidrug resistance and reduces the efficacy of traditional anthracycline-based regimens, asparaginase is typically incorporated into the chemotherapy regimens.[
7
,
8
]  Various asparaginase-based combination chemotherapy regimens have been used.
Evidence (asparaginase-based combination chemotherapy):
A phase II study included 28  patients with newly diagnosed stage IV or relapsed or refractory ENKL. Patients received steroids, methotrexate, ifosfamide, [L-]asparaginase, and etoposide (SMILE).[
9
]
The overall response rate after two cycles was 79% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65%–89%), and the complete response rate was 45%. The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 55% (95% CI, 38%–69%).
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 92% of patients, and grade 3 or 4 infections were seen in 61% of patients.[
9
]
A modification to the SMILE regimen (mSMILE) incorporating pegylated asparaginase has demonstrated reduced toxicity.[
10
]
Despite no head-to-head studies, this regimen is used more often in clinical practice, in patients with advanced-stage disease, or in combination with radiation therapy for patients with localized disease. Other asparaginase-based regimens which have been studied include gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and pegaspargase (P-GEMOX);[
10
] gemcitabine, etoposide, pegaspargase, and dexamethasone (GELAD);[
11
] and dexamethasone, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and pegaspargase (DDGP).[
12
]For patients who may not tolerate or who have reactions to asparaginase, a nonasparaginase regimen may be given with concurrent radiation therapy.[

A retrospective study (
NCT02733458
) included 35 patients with newly diagnosed stage III to IV, relapsed, or refractory ENKL. Patients received P-GEMOX.[
10
]
The overall response rate was 80.0%, and the complete response rate was 51.4%. The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 38.6%, and the 3-year OS rate was 64.7%.[

A prospective multicenter study (
NCT02733458
) included 52 patients with newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE ENKL who received two cycles of GELAD followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (50–56 Gy in 25–58 fractions) and two additional courses of GELAD.[
11
]
With a median follow-up of 32 months, the estimated 4-year OS rate was 94.2% (95% CI, 83.2%–93.1%), and the 4-year PFS rate was 90.4% (95% CI, 78.4%–95.9%).[

The overall response rate was 94.2%, and the complete response rate was 92.3%.
A retrospective study included 80 patients with newly diagnosed (n = 48), refractory (n = 23), or first-relapse (n = 9) ENKL. Patients received DDGP.[
12
]
The overall response rate was 91.3% (95% CI, 85.0%–96.3%), and the complete response rate was 60.0% (95% CI, 48.8%–71.3%). The 2-year PFS rate was 81.4% (95% CI, 76.3%–86.5%), and the 2-year OS rate was 87.1% (95% CI, 83.4%–91.4%).[
12
][
Level of evidence C3
]
A phase I/II study of 27 patients with newly diagnosed stage IE or contiguous IIE disease studied the	nonasparaginase-based regimen DeVIC (dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin). Patients received three cycles of DeVIC at the recommended phase II dosing and concurrent radiotherapy dosed at 50 Gy.[
13
]
With a median follow-up of 32 months, the 2-year OS rate was 78% (95% CI, 57%–89%). The overall response rate was 81%, and the complete response rate was 77%.[
13
][
Level of evidence C3
]
The most common grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity was mucositis related to radiation, which occurred in 30% of patients.
Radiation therapy is an essential component of treatment for localized ENKL, nasal type, whether given as a monotherapy or as part of combined modality therapy.
Evidence (radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy):
A retrospective review included 1,273 patients with early-stage disease. Patients were stratified into a low-risk group and high-risk group using stage, age, lactate dehydrogenase level, performance status, and primary tumor invasion.
Low-risk patients fared best with radiation therapy alone,[
14
] while high-risk patients fared best with a strategy of radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy.[
15
-
17
][
Level of evidence C3
]
A retrospective review included 303 previously untreated patients from an international consortium who received nonanthracycline chemotherapy.[
18
]
The OS rates were identical (72%−74% at 5 years) for patients with early-stage disease  who received either concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy or chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy.[
18
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Higher doses of radiation therapy administered at more than 50 Gy are associated with improved outcomes according to anecdotal reports.[
17
] The highly aggressive course, with poor response and short survival with standard therapies, especially for patients with advanced-stage disease or extranasal presentation, has led some investigators to recommend autologous or allogeneic peripheral  stem cell transplant consolidation.[

Treatment Options for Enteropathy-Associated and Monomorphic Epitheliotropic Intestinal T-Cell Lymphomas
Current Clinical Trials
Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL) and monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (MEITL) are rare subsets of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) which together account for less than 5% of PTCL. EATL (sometimes referred to as type 1 EATL) is a complication of celiac disease and is more common in Europe. MEITL (sometimes referred to as type 2 EATL) is not associated with celiac disease and is more common in Asia.
SETD2
pathogenic variants and, to a lesser extent,
STAT5B
pathogenic variants are seen in most cases of EATL and MEITL.[
1
,
2
] Because a gluten-free diet prevents the development of lymphoma in patients with celiac disease, patients diagnosed in childhood rarely develop EATL. The diagnosis of celiac disease is usually made by finding villous atrophy in the resected intestine. Surgery is often required for diagnosis and to avoid perforation during therapy.[
3
]
Treatment Options for Enteropathy-Associated and Monomorphic Epitheliotropic Intestinal T-Cell Lymphomas
Recommended management includes CHO(E)P (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone), but relapse is common and outcomes are generally poor.[

-
6
] Complications of treatment include gastrointestinal bleeding, small bowel perforation, and enterocolic fistulae. Patients often require parenteral nutrition. For more information on parenteral nutrition, see

. Multifocal intestinal perforations and visceral abdominal involvement are seen at the time of relapse. Consolidation with either high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue or allogeneic stem cell transplant is often used in first or later remission.[

Treatment of Indolent T-Cell Lymphoma of the Gastrointestinal Tract
In This Section
Treatment Options for Indolent T-Cell Lymphoma of the Gastrointestinal Tract
Current Clinical Trials
In contrast to the more aggressive forms of T-cell lymphoma with intestinal involvement, indolent T-cell lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract (iTCL-GI) often presents more indolently. iTCL-GI can be difficult to distinguish from inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune disorders with gastrointestinal involvement.[
1
,
2
]
iTCL-GI is often diagnosed when multiple biopsies from different sites show matching clones by T-cell receptor gene rearrangement testing. While the immunophenotype can vary (iTCL-GI is frequently CD4+ but can also be CD8+ or  CD4-/CD8-), Ki-67 is typically very low at 5% to 10%. Unlike some other intestinal lymphomas, Epstein-Barr encoding region staining for Epstein-Barr virus is usually negative. Although initial reports of this rare entity suggested a low likelihood of transformation to a more aggressive process, transformation to peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specific and other aggressive forms has since been documented.[
3
]
Treatment Options for Indolent T-Cell Lymphoma of the Gastrointestinal Tract
Response to multiagent chemotherapy is limited, and many patients can be managed with watchful waiting alone. Limited studies suggest that alterations in the
JAK
/
STAT
pathway or genes involved in epigenetic modification could serve as potential therapeutic targets.[

Treatment Options for Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma
Current Clinical Trials
Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) comprising approximately 1% of PTCL. HSTCL often involves young men. HSTCL appears to be localized to the hepatic and splenic sinusoids, with cell surface expression of the gamma delta T-cell receptor.[
1
-
3
] Characteristic chromosomal abnormalities such as isochromosome 7q and trisomy 8 are also suggestive of the diagnosis.[
4
] While in most cases the neoplastic cells express a gamma delta T-cell receptor (hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell lymphoma), there are reports of alpha beta T-cell receptor expression (hepatosplenic alpha beta T-cell lymphoma).[
5
] This lymphoma has an extremely poor prognosis and an extremely aggressive clinical course.
Treatment Options for Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma
HSTCL is treated  with  induction chemotherapy and stem cell transplant (SCT) consolidation.[

,
6
]
Evidence (induction chemotherapy and SCT consolidation):
A meta-analysis of 118 patients with HSTCL compared CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and CHOP-like induction regimens.[
7
]
Non–CHOP-based regimens (containing cytarabine, etoposide, and/or platinum-based treatment) were associated with improved outcomes, including an overall response rate of  82% versus 52% (
P
= .006) and a median overall survival (OS) of 36.5 months versus 18 months (
P
= .00014).
Consolidation with allogeneic SCT was associated with an improved median OS of 33 months, versus 27 months (
P
= .016) for autologous SCT.[
7
][
Level of evidence C3
]
The use of ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide) or IVAC (ifosfamide, etoposide, and high-dose cytarabine) has resulted in improved responses when compared with CHOP in other smaller studies as well.[
8
][
Level of evidence D
] Given the inadequate responses to CHOP or CHOP-like regimens, many clinicians are using ICE chemotherapy as front-line induction therapy, followed by consolidative allogeneic SCT for patients achieving a first remission. However, the efficacy of this approach is undetermined.

Treatment of  Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma
In This Section
Treatment Options for Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma
Biological and targeted therapies
Cytotoxic chemotherapy and allogeneic SCT
Current Clinical Trials
Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is caused by infection with the retrovirus human T-lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV1) and is frequently associated with lymphadenopathy, hypercalcemia, circulating leukemic cells, bone and skin involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, a rapidly progressive course, and poor response to combination chemotherapy.[
1
,
2
] HTLV1 is endemic to Japan (especially the southern island of Kyushu), central Africa, the Caribbean islands, and some regions of Central and South America, the Middle East, and Australia. This retrovirus is mostly spread by sexual contact or breastfeeding.[
3
]  ATL has been divided into four clinical subtypes:[
3
]
Acute (aggressive course with leukemia, with or without extranodal or nodal involvement).
Lymphoma (aggressive course with lymphadenopathy and no leukemia).
Chronic (indolent course with leukemia and lymphadenopathy).
Smoldering (indolent course with only leukemia).
Treatment Options for Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma
Treatment options for ATL include:
Biological and targeted therapies
.
Mogamulizumab
.
Brentuximab vedotin
.
Lenalidomide
.
Valemetostat
.
Zidovudine and interferon alfa
.
Cytotoxic chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT)
.
Biological and targeted therapies
Mogamulizumab
The anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody mogamulizumab has a targeted lysis of the ATL clone and also reduces the immunosuppressive Treg population, allowing improvement of cell-mediated immunotherapy.[
4
] Single-agent phase II trials in patients with ATL showed response rates ranging from 30% to 50%.[
5
-
7
][
Level of evidence C3
] In a phase II study that combined mogamulizumab with combination chemotherapy, 101 patients had an overall response rate of 65% (95% confidence interval [CI], 55%–75%), a median progression-free survival of 7.4 months (95% CI, 5.7–9.1), and a median overall survival (OS) of 16 months (95% CI, 10.3–21.8).[
8
][
Level of evidence C3
]
A retrospective review evaluated mogamulizumab combined with both the VCAP-AMP-VECP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone; doxorubicin, ranimustine, prednisone; vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, prednisone) regimen and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone)-based regimens versus chemotherapy alone. The review concluded that the 4-year OS rate was 46.3% in the mogamulizumab combination groups, compared with 20.6% in the chemotherapy-alone group.[
9
][
Level of evidence C3
] The best results were seen with CHOP-based regimens. Mogamulizumab is available in the United States but has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with ATL.
Mogamulizumab is often avoided in patients planning allogeneic SCT based on data from Japan that showed an increased risk of severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients who received mogamulizumab before allogeneic SCT.[
10
]  The relevance of these findings in other countries and the impact of different GVHD prophylaxis regimens in this setting remains to be determined.
Brentuximab vedotin
Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate directed at CD30 and is a treatment option for patients with ATL whose tumor expresses CD30.[
11
] Patients with ATL were included in a clinical trial of brentuximab vedotin that mostly involved patients with anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma. A statistical benefit for the very small ATL subgroup could not be established.[
11
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Lenalidomide
In a multicenter phase II study (
NCT01724177
) of 26 patients with relapsed ATL, the overall response rate was 42% (95% CI, 23%–63%) in patients who received the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide.[
12
][
Level of evidence C3
]
Valemetostat
Valemetostat is a selective dual inhibitor of EZH1 and EZH2, which are important histone methyltransferases involved with chromatin folding.[
13
] A multicenter phase II study (
NCT04102150
) enrolled 25 patients with relapsed or refractory ATL, 24 of whom had prior therapy with mogamulizumab.[
14
] With a median follow-up of 6.5 months, the overall response rate was 48% (90% CI, 30.5%–65.9%). There were five complete remissions and seven partial remissions among the heavily pretreated patients.[
14
][
Level of evidence C3
] Responses were seen in patients with the acute, lymphoma, and chronic versions of ATL. Although approved for use in Japan, valemetostat is not approved by the FDA for use in the United States.
Zidovudine and interferon alfa
The combination of zidovudine and interferon alfa has activity against ATL, especially among patients with the chronic and smoldering versions of ATL.[
15
,
16
] Durable remissions of 8 to 12 months and response rates of 20% to 40% have been reported for patients, some of whom had relapsed disease after prior chemotherapy,[
15
,
16
] and some with the acute and lymphoma subtypes of ATL.[
17
,
18
]
Cytotoxic chemotherapy and allogeneic SCT
The acute and lymphoma types of ATL respond poorly to combination cytotoxic chemotherapy and allogeneic SCT,  with a median OS under 1 year.[
19
-
21
] Less than 10% of patients who received combination therapy were alive after 4 years in one retrospective study.[
21
] Durable remissions have been reported after allogeneic SCT and even after subsequent donor lymphocyte infusion for relapses after transplant.[
22
-
24
][
Level of evidence C3
] Among 815 patients who underwent allogeneic SCT in two retrospective reviews, the 3-year OS rates were  36% and 26%.[
25
,
26
][
Level of evidence C1
]
The cytotoxic chemotherapy backbone for patients with ATL in the United States and Europe is the CHOP or CHO(E)P regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone). Brentuximab vedotin has been added to CHOP in rare cases when patients express CD30. For the acute and lymphoma versions of ATL, a series of clinical trials in Japan established VCAP-AMP-VECP as the standard first-line treatment.[
2
,
27
,
28
] This regimen has generally not been implemented outside of Asia since a trial comparing VCAP-AMP-VECP versus CHOP-14 did not show statistically improved OS (3-year OS rate, 24% vs. 13%;
P
= nonsignificant).
Allogeneic SCT is frequently used for patients achieving first or later remission, although results are largely anecdotal.[

About This PDQ Summary
Purpose of This Summary
This PDQ cancer information summary for health professionals provides comprehensive, peer-reviewed, evidence-based information about the treatment of adult peripheral T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.
Reviewers and Updates
This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the
PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board
, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:
be discussed at a meeting,
be cited with text, or
replace or update an existing article that is already cited.
Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.
The lead reviewers for Peripheral T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment are:
Eric J. Seifter, MD (Johns Hopkins University)
