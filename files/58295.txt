Increasing Serrated Polyp Detection With a Brief Awareness Training
In this non-randomized controlled trial, a semi-random group of Dutch endoscopist receive an oral training about the significance of serrated polyps. The primary aim of this training is to improve the endoscopist's awareness of the significance of serrated polyps, ultimately leading to increased detection. In addition, a random group of endoscopists that will not receive this training will be used as a reference group.

Data will be collected as part of routine care within the Nationwide Dutch Bowel cancer screening program. The serrated polyp detectionrate of each endoscopist will be extracted from anonymized data that will be prospectively collected as part of routine care within the Dutch Nationwide bowel cancer screening program. Data will be anonymized and provided by Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) and ScreenIT.
