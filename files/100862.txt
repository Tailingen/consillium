Extension to study 11515 (NCT00661375) which was a multicenter study of sorafenib in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from initiation of treatment to disease progression (radiological or clinical, whichever earlier) or death (if death occurs before progression)., From start of treatment of the first subject until 45 months later, assessed every 8 weeks
Best Tumor Response, Best tumor response, including Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), From start of treatment of the first subject until 45 months later, assessed every 8 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), Time from initiation of treatment to death due to any cause., From start of treatment of the first subject until 45 months later, assessed every 3 months|Overall Response Duration, Time from the date of first objective response (CR or PR, whichever is first recorded) to the date when progressive disease (PD, at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions) is first documented according to RECIST., From start of treatment of the first subject until 45 months later, assessed every 8 weeks|Time to Objective Response, Time from initiation of treatment to the date when an objective response (CR or PR, whichever is first recorded) is first documented according to RECIST., From start of treatment of the first subject until 45 months later, assessed every 8 weeks|Overall Disease Control, Subjects who have a best response rating of CR, PR or Stable Disease (SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started) per RECIST that is maintained for at least 28 days from the first demonstration of that rating., From start of treatment of the first subject until 45 months later, assessed every 8 weeks
