Immunotherapy in Combination With Chemoradiotherapy in Unresectable Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer
SCR-ESCC-02 is a multicenter, phase I/II clinical study to investigate the safety and efficacy of induction immunochemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with anti-PD-1 therapy in patients diagnosed with locally advanced, unresectable esophageal cancer.

Immunotherapy has shown promising results in advanced esophageal cancer, but its optimal integration into the management of unresectable locally advanced disease remains uncertain. The significant tumor regression and reduced tumor residual achieved through immunochemotherapy offer an opportunity to enhance the effectiveness of subsequent radiotherapy. This phase I/II clinical study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of induction immunochemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with anti-PD-1 for patients with unresectable locally advanced esophageal cancer. The study's co-primary endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS) and treatment completion rate.
