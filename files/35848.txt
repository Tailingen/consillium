Echocardiographic Changes During Adjuvant Therapy in Hispanic Women With Her-2 Neu Expressing Breast Cancer
This study retrospectively looks at changes in Echocardiographic parameters while using transtuzumab
Breast Cancer
LVEF, LV ejection fraction, Baseline (prior to therapy), at 3-6 months (mid-therapy), and at 1 year (end of therapy)
Number of Participants Hospitalized for Cardiac Issues., any hospitalization for cardiac issues, 1 year
Transtuzumab based chemo-immunotherapy is commonly administered to patients diagnosed with early stage HER-2 expressing breast cancer, because it decreases the risk of relapse.

Transtuzumab affects cardiac function and potential benefits in decreasing cancer recurrence have to be balanced against short and long term toxicity.

We have previously identified a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes mellitus in our patients with breast cancer. These patients may be particularly susceptible to cardiotoxic effects of transtuzumab based therapy.

Aim of this study is to assess the changes in the cardiac function of women who are undergoing transtuzumab based therapy for early stage breast cancer.
