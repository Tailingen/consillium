A Home-Based Approach Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Alectinib in Locally-Advanced or Metastatic ALK-Positive Solid Tumors
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of alectinib in participants with Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-positive locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors other than lung cancer.
