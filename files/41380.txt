Biological Characterisation of High Risk CHildhood Cancer in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults (MICCHADO)
Methodology:

Prospective, multicentric, open, non-randomised, non-therapeutic, interventional study
Neuroblastoma|Rhabdomyosarcoma|Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors|Osteosarcoma|Leukemia|Central Nervous System Tumor
OTHER: Sampling on blood, bone marrow and cerebrospinal fluid
Number of patients with meaningful molecular genetic alterations, Identification of molecular genetic alterations based on molecular characterisation of tumor at diagnosis, during patient treatment and follow-up (time dimension), At the end of study (6 years)|Number of patients with meaningful immunological features, Identification and characterisation of the tumor microenvironment and the host's immunological profile, at diagnosis and during patient treatment, At the end of study (6 years)|Number of patients with identification of new tumor-specific genetic characteristics during follow-up (clonal evolution), Comparison between genetic variations identified at diagnosis and those identified on circulating tumor DNA during treatment, FU and/or relapse, up to 6 years
Correlation between disease recurrence and molecular and/or immunological biomarkers, To characterise biomarkers, based on molecular analyses of tumour samples from diagnosis, for prognostic and predictive purposes.

To characterise the tumour microenvironment and the host's immunological profile, for prognostic and predictive purposes.

To identify potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers on samples collected during patient's treatment and follow-up, based on changes on circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), detected by molecular biology techniques, and on immunological findings, up to 6 years|Correlation between genetic variations and immune parameters, To compare molecular and immunological findings at diagnosis and during treatment (data integration), up to 6 years|Correlation between disease staging and immunological features, To investigate the impact of the tumour microenvironment and host's immunological profile on the disease staging at diagnosis, by comparing patients with metastatic to patients with localised disease, up to 6 years
To identify and characterise:

* meaningful molecular genetic alterations,
* meaningful immunological features of high risk childhood, adolescents and young adult cancers, at diagnosis, during patient treatment and follow-up (time dimension).
