A Retrospective Study of Immunotherapy in Conversion Therapy of Unresectable Gastric Cancer
This study was an observational, non-interventional, multicenter retrospective study to evaluate the feasibility and safety of sintilimab combined with chemotherapy (SOX or PS) in the clinical practice of unresectable locally advanced or stage IV gastric cancer/gastroesophageal junction carcinoma.
