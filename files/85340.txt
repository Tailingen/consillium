Abstract: (1) Background: Thoracic epidural analgesia is considered the gold standard in post-operative pain management following thoracic surgery. This study was designed to explore the safety of thoracic epidural analgesia and to quantify the incidence of its post-operative side-effects in patients undergoing thoracotomy for major surgery, such as resection of lung malignancies and lung transplantation. (2) Methods: This is a retrospective, dual-center observa-tional study implementing patients that underwent major thoracic surgery including lung trans-plantation and received concurrent placement of thoracic epidural catheters for postoperative an-algesia. An electronic system of referral and documentation of complications was used, and information was retrieved from our electronic critical care charting system. Side effects such as nausea and vomiting , itching, catheter related issues and also major complications such as epidural haematoma, abscess, or permanent nerve damage were investigated.

The study aims to highlight the importance of a solid documentation and recording system alongside with the implementation of safety protocols.
