Food Safety Educational Training Program to Improve Food Safety Knowledge and Behaviors in Cancer Patients Receiving Treatment
This clinical trial evaluates the impact of a food safety educational training program on food safety knowledge and behaviors in cancer patients receiving treatment. Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy, can put patients at risk for foodborne infections and despite this risk, it has been reported that patients do not receive any food safety counseling until they are already experiencing low white blood cell counts. A food safety educational training program may help cancer patients make better choices of low-risk foods and prepare foods safely.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Evaluate the efficacy of a food safety education intervention for cancer patients.

OUTLINE:

Patients attend a food safety educational training program over 50 minutes on study.

After completion of study intervention, patients are followed up at 5 weeks.
