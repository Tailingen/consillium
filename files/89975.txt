Open-label dose escalation of Ulixertinib combined with fixed dose of hydroxychloroquine.
Gastrointestinal Neoplasms
DRUG: Ulixertinib|DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine
Recommended phase 2 dose of ulixertinib in combination with a fixed dose of hydroxychloroquine in subjects with advanced, RAS, non-V600 BRAF, ERK or MEK mutated gastrointestinal malignancies, The incidence of DLTs during the defined DLT period, the day of the first dose, cycle one day one, to cycle one day 28 (Cycle=28 days)
Safety and tolerability of ulixertinib and hydroxychloroquine in the study population: adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), The frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) characterized by type, severity (as defined by the NIH CTCAE, version 5.0), seriousness, duration, and relationship to study treatment, Any patient who has taken at least one dose of both ulixertinib and hydroxychloroquine will be evaluable for toxicity. Assessment will be completed through safety follow-up visit at 60 days after the end of treatment visit.|Efficacy of ulixertinib and hydroxychloroquine in the study population: Objective response rate (PR and CR), Objective response rate (PR and CR) will be described, Patients will be evaluable for response once they have completed the first cycle of treatment and completed the C2D1 CT Scan.Assessment will be completed through safety follow-up visit at 60 days after the end of treatment visit.
This is an open-label Phase I basket trial designed to determine the phase 2 recommended dose of ulixertinib in combination hydroxychloroquine. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined by using a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design with a minimum of 3 evaluable subjects accrued to dose level one and two. Should dose level one be deemed intolerable, enrollment will proceed at dose level 0. The RP2D will be affirmed according to the rules of the 3+3 dose-escalation scheme
