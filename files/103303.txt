Predictive Values of Preoperative [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Patients With Suspected Brain Tumours of Glial Origin
The aim of this study was to analyse usefulness of \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans in preoperative differentiation between HGG and LGG in patients with suspicion of a tumor of glial origin in previously performed imaging examinations. The PET/CT scan will be compared with postoperative histopathological results and with additional immunohistochemical staining for PSMA expression.

PET/CT vs histopathological diagnosis, Comparison of the incidence of positive preoperative \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results with the final histopathological diagnosis based on the 5th edition of the WHO (World Health Organization) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (2021).

The PET scan in this regard will be evaluated qualitatively - in terms of finding accumulation in the projection of the brain tumor (positive result) and lack of accumulation in the projection of the brain tumor (negative result).

The histopathological diagnosis will take into account the subtypes of the tumor according on the 5th edition of the WHO (World Health Organization) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (2021) - including the histopathological examination and the genetic diagnosis - adult-type diffuse gliomas comprise of three distinct types: Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted, and Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, through study completion, an average of 1.5 year
PET/CT semiquantitive parameter - SUVmax vs histopathological diagnosis, Comparison of the preoperative \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT semiquantitative parameters with with the final histopathological diagnosis.

The maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) of each positive lesion were measured using the spherical volume of interest (VOI).

The Target-to-background ratios (TBR) were calculated using SUVmax of the lesion divided by SUVmax of the background measured using a VOI of a similar diameter, placed in a distant, unaffected region, representing normal brain tissue.

Target-to-liver background ratios (TLR) were calculated by dividing SUVmax of the lesion by SUVmean of the liver (the liver VOI of a similar diameter placed in the central area of the right liver lobe was used).

The histopathological diagnosis will take into account the subtypes of the tumor according on the 5th edition of the WHO (World Health Organization) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (2021) - including the histopathological examination and the genetic diagnosis - adult-type diffuse gliomas comprise of three distinct types: Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted, and Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype., through study completion, an average of 1.5 year|PET/CT semiquantitive parameter - SUVmax vs immunohistopathological staining, Comparison of the preoperative \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT with the immunohistopathological staining of the tumour tissue.

The maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) of each positive lesion were measured using the spherical volume of interest (VOI).

The immunoreaction will be analyzed in the endothelium and in tumor cells. A score will be assigned semiquantitatively based on staining intensity and distribution as follows: 0 - negative, 1- faint and weak staining at high power; 2- moderate intensity at low power; and 3- strong reaction at low power., through study completion, an average of 1.5 year|PET/CT vs progession free survival time., Comparison of the incidence of positive preoperative \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results with the progession free survival time.

The PET scan in this regard will be evaluated qualitatively - in terms of finding accumulation in the projection of the brain tumor (positive result) and lack of accumulation in the projection of the brain tumor (negative result).
