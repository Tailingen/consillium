A Study of Treatment-free Remission in Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
To evaluate the efficacy of asciminib adding on tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) to achieve treatment-free remission (TFR) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in chronic phase who failed prior cessation study of TKI
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic Phase
DRUG: Asciminib
MR3.0 or less by 1 year, To evaluate the cumulative incidence of sustained MR3.0 or less by 1 year of cessation of TKI and asciminib, by 1 year
We expect that patients who lost MR3.0 after stopping TKIs, thus failed to maintain treatment-free remission can achieve second sustainable MR4.5 by sustainable MR4.5 for more than 3 years once regained and prolong MRFS by adding asciminib to TKIs. Patients will be restarted on TKIs when they fail sustaining MR3.0 after cessation because restarting TKIs when loss of MR3.0 is reasonable in this situation.
