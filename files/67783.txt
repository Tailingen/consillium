ACE2016 in Adult Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors Expressing Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
ACE2016 is an off-the-shelf, allogeneic gamma delta T (gdT) cell therapy derived from healthy donors, that is under investigation for the treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors Expressing Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).

The ACE2016-001 study is an open-label, Phase I, first-in-human (FIH) study that aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability, persistency, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of ACE2016 in patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors Expressing Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).
