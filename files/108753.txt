Impact of Sarcopenia on Postoperative Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Liver Resection
The investigators will investigate the impact of different biometric parameters (Body mass index, sarcopenia, lean muscle mass, hand-grip strength, gait speed, fat composition) on the postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing liver resections.

Major and minor liver resections will be considered as well as open and minimally invasive techniques.

Benign and malignant indications will be included. Patients characteristics and perioperative variables will be considered for analysis.

Short-term outcomes will be evaluated focusing on 90-days morbidity and mortality and readmission rate.
Liver Neoplasms|Sarcopenia|Postoperative Complications
PROCEDURE: Liver resection
Morbidity, Patients experiencing medical or surgical complications after surgery, within 90 days after surgery
Mortality, Patients dying after surgery, within 90 days after surgery|Readmission rate, patients readmitted to hospital after discharge, within 90 days after discharge
According to the null hypothesis, no difference in postoperative morbidity between the two groups would be expected. To calculate sample size, a 42% morbidity rate would be expected in sarcopenic patients while a 22% rate would be expected in the non-sarcopenic group. Considering a two-sided α=0.05 and β=0.1, the minimal sample size required to achieve statistical significance was 224 subjects. Considering a 10% drop-out rate of patients undergoing explorative laparoscopy or laparotomy without parenchymal resection a total of 249 patients will be required for completion of the study
