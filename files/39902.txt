Study of Regorafenib and Sildenafil for Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1 study of sildenafil in combination with regorafenib in patients with progressive advanced solid tumors. A modified 3+3 dose escalation design will be conducted for the dose escalation of the treatment combination: additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD until a total of 12 patients have been treated at the MTD.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Regorafenib|DRUG: Sildenafil Citrate
To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of regorafenib and of sildenafil when given to patients with advanced solid tumors., Patients' treatment dosing level, dose modification, DLTs, and evaluability for DLTs will be listed and summarized by basic descriptive statistics (such as frequency and proportion). The MTD/RP2D will be found based on the Definitions of Dose-Limiting Toxicity, Maximum Tolerated Dose, and Recommended Phase 2 Dose. RP2D for the combination of regorafenib and sildenafil that is less than or the same as the MTD., 28 days
To evaluate the safety and toxicity of the regorafenib and sildenafil combination, Adverse events reported according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0. Adverse events (AEs) characterized and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0) to determine safety and toxicity of the combination of regorafenib and sildenafil., Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment|To explore the antitumor effects of the regorafenib and sildenafil combination, Tumor response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.1), Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment|To determine the pre-treatment expression of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in tumor samples, Pre-treatment PDE5 expression identified by immunohistochemistry using archived tumor tissue. Pre-treatment PDE5 expression identified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using archived tumor tissue., 12- 24 months|To evaluate the impact of sildenafil on the pharmacokinetics of regorafenib, Regorafenib plasma concentration measured at a total of 6 time points: at baseline (pre-treatment) and at 5 time points in cycle 1. Plasma concentration of regorafenib measured at 6 time points: at baseline (pre-treatment) and in cycle 1 on day 1 (post-treatment), on day 15 (pre- and post-treatment), and on day 21 (pre- and post-treatment), 12-24 months
To explore the PD relationships between regorafenib and tumor response, Quantity of total and free regorafenib measured by in vitro RAF-1 kinase activity inhibition using plasma samples collected at baseline (pre-treatment) and in cycle 1 (post-treatment on day 1, pre- and post-treatment on day 15, and pre- and post-treatment on day 21), 12-24 months|To assess the feasibility of isolating, enumerating, and analyzing CTCs to characterize cGMP within tumor cells, Characteristics of cGMP found in CTCs isolated and enumerated using the ApoStream DEPfff enrichment device with blood samples collected at baseline (pre-treatment), on days 1 and 15 in cycle 1, and at the time of each tumor response assessment, Up to 30 days after completion of study treatment|To assess the bioactivity of sildenafil in plasma, Quantity of total sildenafil measured by elevated VASP-1 phosphorylation ex vivo using plasma samples collected at baseline (pre-treatment) and in cycle 1 (post-treatment on day 1, pre- and post-treatment on day 15, and pre- and post-treatment on day 21), 12-24 months|To assess the cytokine/growth factor levels in plasma, Quantity of cytokines/growth factors measured using a Bio-Rad MAGPIX multiplex reader ex vivo using plasma samples collected at baseline (pre-treatment) and in cycle 1 (post-treatment on day 1, pre- and post-treatment on day 15, and pre- and post-treatment on day 21), Up to day 21 of course 1
This study is a single-arm, open-label, phase 1 trial to determine the RP2D of the combination of regorafenib and sildenafil. Both study medications will be taken orally on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle.

Using a modified 3+3 dose escalation design, 3-6 patients with an advanced solid tumor will be enrolled at each dose level. Additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD until a total of 12 patients have been treated at the MTD.

Eligible patients will have received available standard treatments. Patients with solid tumors for which regorafenib would be considered a standard treatment are eligible as long as regorafenib has not been previously administered.

Blood samples will be collected for correlative studies including PK, PD, and CTCs. Tumor samples archived from a previous biopsy or surgery will also be collected for correlative studies.
