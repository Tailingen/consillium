Psychological Intervention Using Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain
The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test a novel medical intervention (STAMP+CBT app) that will help patients track their pain, mood, opioid use and side effects while delivering tailored education and self-management advice for patients with advanced cancer.

Proportion of patients who complete more than 2/3rd of the study modules at the end of 4 weeks of intervention to determine feasibility of the STAMP+CBT app, Patients will be assigned surveys at baseline, 4-week intervention period and 2 weeks post intervention period (6 weeks from baseline). Based on that patient's overall adherence rate/app retention rates will be calculated and intervention will be considered feasible if more than 70% of subjects complete complete any activity on the app at least 50% of days on study., 4-weeks|Proportion of patients who rate the acceptability items 4 or higher on the app., Patients will be assigned surveys at baseline, 4-week intervention period and 2 weeks post intervention period (6 weeks from baseline). In response to the survey's patient will be assigned tailored psychological intervention for advanced cancer pain. During the trial, these interventions will be considered acceptable only if 80% or more of the acceptability items are rated 4 or higher/5; Lower rating will lead to app refinements., 6-weeks
The primary purpose of this project is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel mobile health application (STAMP+CBT app). The STAMP+CBT app (Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain + Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) seeks to provide education about pain medications alongside cognitive behavioral therapy techniques for pain to patients with advanced cancer. The application uses multi-media educational materials and survey algorithms assessing pain, medication usage, mood, stress, and sleep to improve pain management in this population. In this study, patients with advanced cancer at OU will participate in a single-arm, 6-week study of STAMP+CBT (4-week intervention period and a 2-week post-intervention period).
