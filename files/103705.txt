Metastatic Cancer|Melanoma|Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma|Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: VE800|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Vancomycin Oral Capsule
Safety and Tolerability of VE800 in Combination With Nivolumab: Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability of VE800 in combination with nivolumab: Number of Participants with Adverse Events, From the first dose to the last dose (up to 56.7 weeks), plus 100 days of post-treatment follow-up|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 18 months (first patient enrolled to last patient visit completed)
Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from first documentation of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until the time of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST 1.1.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to two years|Best Overall Response, Best response among all overall responses from cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) until disease progression or start of new anticancer therapy.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The percentage of patients who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) from cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1) until disease progression (DP) or start of new anticancer therapy.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from start of treatment to the earlier date of assessment of progression or death by any cause in the absence of progression.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, From the first dose to the last dose (up to 56.7 weeks), plus 100 days of post-treatment follow-up and then follow-up for survival every 90 days.|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) as measured from the date of start of treatment to the date of death by any cause will also be evaluated., 18 months (first patient enrolled to last patient visit completed)|Detection of VE800 Bacterial Strain Colonization in Stool, Detection of VE800 bacterial strain colonization in stool was measured by pharmacokinetics (PK) of VE800, 18 months (first patient enrolled to last patient visit completed)|Degree of VE800 Bacterial Strain Colonization in Stool, Measured by pharmacokinetics (PK) of VE800 colonization in stool, 18 months (first patient enrolled to last patient visit completed)|Duration of VE800 Bacterial Strain Colonization in Stool, Measured by pharmacokinetics (PK) of VE800 colonization in stool, 18 months (first patient enrolled to last patient visit completed)
CONSORTIUM-IO was the first-in-human multicenter, open-label study; the main objectives were to evaluate:

* Safety and tolerability of VE800 in combination with nivolumab
* Efficacy as measured by objective response rate

The study planned to enroll approximately 111 patients with melanoma, gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, or microsatellite-stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC).

Nivolumab is already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however, it is not approved for the study cancer indications. VE800 was the investigational product, which was designed to enhance the immune response to the tumor.
