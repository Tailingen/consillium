Prospective Evaluation of the Prognostic Impact of Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) Within a Phase III Study Comparing a Fixed Duration Therapy Versus Continuous Therapy With Daratumumab, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone for Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Requiring a First Salvage Treatment.
We propose to conduct an ancillary prospective evaluation of the impact of Dara-Len-Dex discontinuation after 2 years, on the persistence of MRD negativity in patients that were MRD negative at 2 years.
