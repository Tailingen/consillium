Efficacy and Safety of Aflibercept in Combination With FOLFIRI Chemotherapy as 1st Line Treatment for Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
One of the treatments generally used to treat this disease is a chemotherapy called FOLFIRI. The purpose of this study is to improve the efficacy of the chemotherapy by adding a protein, similar to immunoglobulins, aflibercept, and to assess their tolerance.

Aflibercept is a protein that has already been studied in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers, in combination with a chemotherapy involving irinotecan in addition to 5FU (fluoropyrimidine) ( (FOLFIRI) as 2nd line treatment. It is marketed in Europe and it is authorized in the United States. Its addition to this chemotherapy combination has in fact brought about a benefit in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of this combination rather in the initial approach to the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancers and hence to evaluate it as 1st line treatment
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFIRI Protocol|DRUG: Aflibercept Injection
Rate of Patients Alive and Progression-free 6 Months After Inclusion., Progression was evaluated by CT scan, according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1) definition by the investigator. Death was also considered as an event (all causes).

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions compared the little sum of diameters observed during the study (NADIR), or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 6 months
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of the patient's inclusion to the patient's death (all causes). For alive patients the date of the latest news is taken into account, Up to 2 years after the end of the treatment|Progression-free Survival, The progression-free survival is the time from inclusion to the first radiological progression or death (all causes). For patients alive without progression date of last news will be considered.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions compared the little sum of diameters observed durin the study (NADIR), or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, up to 12 months
