In the present study, we propose a mixed methods approach to characterize and address the sexual health needs among women with breast cancer at the time of diagnosis and throughout treatment. The objectives are as follows:

1. To characterize the sexual well-being of women longitudinally throughout the continuum of care, from initial diagnosis into survivorship.

   We predict that treatment will adversely affect sexual well-being, and that patient factors, clinical factors, and treatment choices will influence changes in sexual well-being.
2. To identify gaps is sexual health education provided at the time of diagnosis or during treatment and to determine the appropriate timing of sexual health education delivery.
