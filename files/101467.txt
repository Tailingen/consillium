Cholesterol Metabolites Analysis in Human Thyroid and Iodine Resistance
The study team previously shown that a cholesterol metabolite, dendrogenin A (DDA) differentiates anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines and that its mRNA expression is diminished in human radioiodine refractory thyroid cancer samples. The team aim to quantify via mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry DDA and other cholesterol metabolites in thyroid cancer versus healthy thyroid tissue human samples.

Retrospective study to analyze tissue samples of patients after thyroid surgery at Claudius Regaud Institute Toulouse, France, for thyroid cancer or thyroid aggressive lymphoma or benign thyroid pathology or other head\&neck pathology necessitating total thyroidectomy despite normal thyroid.

Analysis focused on cholesterol metabolites quatification by mass spectrometry in liquid and gas phase.
