Prognostic Factors for Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
Go to Patient Version
Thyroid cancer includes the following four main types:
Papillary.
Follicular.
Medullary.
Anaplastic.
For clinical management of
the patient, thyroid cancer is generally divided into the following  two  categories:[
1
]
Differentiated thyroid cancer, which includes well-differentiated tumors, poorly differentiated tumors, and undifferentiated tumors (papillary, follicular, or anaplastic).
Medullary thyroid cancer.
Well-differentiated tumors (papillary and follicular thyroid cancer) are highly treatable and usually curable.  Poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid tumors (anaplastic thyroid cancer) are less common, aggressive, metastasize early, and have a poorer prognosis. Medullary thyroid cancer is a neuroendocrine cancer that has an intermediate prognosis.
The
thyroid gland may occasionally be the site of other primary tumors, including
sarcomas, lymphomas, epidermoid carcinomas, and teratomas. The thyroid may also be the site
of metastasis from other cancers, particularly of the lung, breast, and kidney.
Incidence and Mortality
Estimated new cases and deaths from thyroid cancer  in the United States in 2025:[
2
]
New cases: 44,020.
Deaths: 2,290.
Thyroid
cancer affects women more often than men and usually occurs in
people aged 25 to 65 years.  The incidence of this malignancy has
been increasing over the last decade.  Thyroid cancer commonly presents
as a so-called cold nodule. It is detected as a palpable thyroid gland during a physical examination and evaluated with iodine I 131  scans. Scintigraphy shows that the isotope is not taken up in an area of the gland.  The overall incidence of cancer in a cold nodule is 12% to
15%, but it is higher in people younger than 40 years and in people with calcifications present on preoperative ultrasonography.[

Anatomy
Thyroid gland tissue envelops the upper trachea just below the thyroid and cricoid cartilages that make up the larynx. The gland has an isthmus and often asymmetric right and left lobes; usually four parathyroid glands lie posteriorly. When swallowing, the thyroid may be felt to rise with the larynx—most commonly in the presence of a disease process.

Risk Factors
Patients with a history of radiation therapy administered in infancy or childhood for
benign conditions of the head and neck (such as
enlarged thymus, tonsils, or adenoids; or acne) have an increased risk of cancer and
other abnormalities of the thyroid gland.  In this group of patients,
malignancies of the thyroid gland appear as early as 5 years
after radiation therapy and may appear 20 or more years later.[
5
] Radiation exposure as a consequence of nuclear fallout has also been associated with a high risk of thyroid cancer, especially in children.[

8
]
Other risk
factors for thyroid cancer include:[
9
]
Family history of thyroid disease or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.
A
RET
pathogenic variant.[
2
,
10
]
A history of goiter.
Female sex.
Asian race.
Diagnostic and Staging Evaluation
The following tests and procedures may be used in the diagnosis and staging of thyroid cancer:
Physical examination and history.
Laryngoscopy.
Blood hormone studies.
Blood chemistry studies.
Ultrasonography.
Computed tomography scan.
Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid.
Surgical excision.
Prognostic Factors for Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
Age appears to be the
single most important prognostic factor.[
11
] The prognosis for differentiated
carcinoma (papillary or follicular) without
extracapsular extension or vascular invasion is better for patients younger than 40 years.[
11
-
15
]
Patients considered  at low risk according to age, metastases, extent, and size risk criteria include women younger than 50 years and men younger
than 40 years without evidence of distant metastases.  The low-risk group also includes older patients with primary papillary tumors    smaller than 5
cm without evidence of gross extrathyroidal
invasion, and older patients with follicular cancer without major capsular invasion or blood
vessel invasion.[
13
]  Using these criteria, a retrospective study of 1,019
patients showed that the 20-year survival rate was 98% for patients with low-risk disease and
50% for patients with high-risk disease.[
13
]
A
retrospective surgical series of 931 previously untreated patients with
differentiated thyroid cancer found that age older than 45 years, follicular histology, primary tumor   larger than 4
cm (T2–T3), extrathyroidal extension (T4), and distant metastases were adverse prognostic factors.[
16
,
17
] Favorable prognostic factors included female sex, multifocality, and
regional lymph node involvement.[
16
]    
However, other studies have shown that regional lymph node involvement had no
effect [
18
,
19
] or  had an adverse effect on survival.[
14
,
15
,
20
]
Another retrospective series of 1,807 patients found that the presence of distant metastases was most predictive of survival, followed by age.[
21
]  An age cutoff of 55 years was identified as most predictive of survival.  This led to an international multi-institutional validation of age 55 years as a cutoff for risk stratification in the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) staging system for well-differentiated thyroid cancer. This analysis of 9,484 patients was responsible for the change in age cutoff from 45 years  to 55 years in the
AJCC Cancer Staging Manual
, 8th edition, using AJCC/UICC staging for well-differentiated thyroid cancer.[
22
]
The prognostic significance of lymph node status is controversial.  Use of sentinel lymph node biopsy may aid in identifying patients with occult metastases who might benefit from central neck dissection.[
23
]
Diffuse, intense
immunostaining for vascular endothelial growth factor in patients with
papillary cancer has been associated with a high rate of local recurrence and
distant metastases.[
24
]  An elevated serum thyroglobulin level correlates
strongly with recurrent tumor when found in patients with differentiated
thyroid cancer during postoperative evaluations.[
25
,
26
]  Serum thyroglobulin
levels are most sensitive when patients are hypothyroid and have elevated serum
thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.[
27
]  Expression of the
TP53
tumor suppressor
gene has also been associated with an adverse prognosis for patients with
thyroid cancer.[

Cellular Classification of Thyroid Cancer
In thyroid cancer, cell type is an important determinant of prognosis and treatment.  The thyroid has two cell types: follicular cells and parafollicular C cells.  The management of thyroid cancer depends on the cell of origin and how well the integrity of the cell type is maintained. The four  main types of thyroid cancer are divided into the following two categories for clinical management:[
1
]
Differentiated (follicular cell) thyroid cancers.
Well-differentiated.
Papillary thyroid  carcinoma.
Follicular thyroid carcinoma.
Hürthle cell carcinoma, a variant of follicular carcinoma with a poorer prognosis.[
2
,
3
]
Poorly differentiated.
Undifferentiated.
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
Parafollicular C cell thyroid cancers.
Medullary thyroid carcinoma.
Other types (not derived from thyroid cells).
Lymphoma.
Sarcoma.
Carcinosarcoma.

Clinical Features and Prognosis
The clinical features and prognosis of well-differentiated thyroid tumors vary by stage.
Most papillary cancers have some follicular elements. These follicular elements may outnumber the papillary formations, but they do not
change the prognosis.
Follicular adenomas, which are characterized by their lack of invasion through
the capsule into the surrounding thyroid tissue, must be distinguished from follicular thyroid carcinoma. While follicular cancer has a good prognosis, it
is less favorable than that of papillary carcinoma.  The 10-year survival is better for
patients with follicular carcinoma without vascular invasion than it is for
patients with vascular invasion.
Papillary carcinomas metastasize more frequently to regional lymph nodes than
to distant sites. Follicular carcinomas more commonly invade blood vessels and metastasize hematogenously to the lungs and to the bone rather than through the
lymphatic system.  When metastases occur, treatment with radioiodine is initially effective, but prognosis worsens as resistance to radioiodine ensues.
Staging and prognosis of papillary and follicular thyroid cancer are determined by the patient's age and site of the disease.  Patients with papillary thyroid cancer have the following clinical features and prognoses:
Stage I papillary or follicular thyroid cancer
is localized to the thyroid gland in patients aged 55 years or older. In those younger than 55 years, the cancer may have spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes but not to other parts of the body. In as many as 50% of the cases, papillary thyroid cancer is multifocal.
Stage II papillary or follicular thyroid cancer
is defined by either of the following descriptions: (1) patients are younger than 55 years and the  tumor has spread from the thyroid to distant parts of the body, or (2) patients are aged 55 years or older: and the  tumor is confined to or has limited invasion outside of the thyroid, with or without lymph node involvement, but without spread to distant parts of the body. Stage II is the most advanced stage possible in a patient younger than 55 years.
Stage III papillary or follicular thyroid cancer
is only possible in patients aged 55 years or older.  The thyroid tumor demonstrates extension into surrounding soft tissues, larynx, trachea, esophagus, or recurrent laryngeal nerve. There may or may not be lymph node involvement, but there is no distant spread to other parts of the body.
Stage IVA papillary or follicular thyroid cancer
is only applicable for patients aged 55 years or older.  The thyroid tumor demonstrates extension into surrounding soft tissues that includes either prevertebral fascia or encases the carotid artery or mediastinal vessels. There may or may not be lymph node involvement, but there is no distant spread to other parts of the body.
Stage IVB papillary or follicular thyroid cancer
is only applicable for patients aged 55 years or older.  It is defined by the presence of distant spread to other parts of the body. The lungs and bones are the most frequent sites of distant spread.
Hürthle cell carcinoma is a variant of follicular carcinoma with a similar prognosis and is treated in the same way as equivalent stage non-Hürthle cell follicular carcinoma.[

Treatment  Options for Papillary and Follicular Thyroid Cancer
Localized/regional papillary  and follicular thyroid cancer
Surgery is the therapy of choice for all primary lesions.  Surgical options
include total thyroidectomy or lobectomy.  The choice of procedure is
influenced mainly by the age of the patient and the size of the nodule. 
For patients with early-stage disease, survival rates are similar when comparing the two procedures; however, the rates of surgical complications and local recurrences are different.[

Surgery
The objective of surgery is to completely remove the primary tumor, while minimizing treatment-related morbidity, and to guide postoperative treatment with RAI. The goal of RAI is to ablate the remnant thyroid tissue to improve the specificity of thyroglobulin assays, which allows the detection of persistent disease by follow-up whole-body scanning. For patients undergoing RAI, removal of all normal thyroid tissue is an important surgical objective. Additionally, for accurate long-term surveillance, RAI whole-body scanning and measurement of serum thyroglobulin are affected by residual, normal thyroid tissue. In these situations, near total or total thyroidectomy is required. This approach facilitates follow-up thyroid scanning.
Total thyroidectomy
Total thyroidectomy is often used because of the high
incidence of multicentric involvement of both lobes of the gland and the
possibility of dedifferentiation of any residual tumor to the anaplastic cell
type.
Evidence (total thyroidectomy):
An analysis of the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) registry identified 52,173 patients who underwent surgery for papillary thyroid cancer. Of these individuals, 43,227 (82.9%) underwent total thyroidectomy, and 8,946 (17.1%) underwent lobectomy.[
9
][
Level of evidence C1
]
For a papillary thyroid cancer tumor that measured less than 1 cm, the extent of surgery did not impact recurrence (
P
= .24) or survival (
P
= .83).
For tumors that measured 1 cm or larger, lobectomy resulted in higher risk of recurrence (
P
= .04) and death (
P
= .009).
To minimize the influence of larger tumors, 1-cm to 2-cm lesions were examined separately. Lobectomy resulted in a higher risk of recurrence (
P
= .04) and death (
P
= .04).
For patients with papillary thyroid cancer tumors that measured 1 cm or larger, total thyroidectomy resulted in lower recurrence rates and improved survival compared with lobectomy.
In a pattern-of-care study that used the NCDB registry from 1985 to 2003, 57,243 patients with papillary thyroid cancer whose tumors measured 1 cm or larger underwent total thyroidectomy or lobectomy. Trends in the extent of surgery were examined for patients with papillary thyroid cancer over two decades. Logistic regression was used to identify factors that predicted the use of total thyroidectomy compared with lobectomy.[
10
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Use of total thyroidectomy increased from 70.8% in 1985 to 90.4% in 2003 (
P
< .0001).
Patients treated at high-volume medical facilities or academic centers were more likely to undergo total thyroidectomy than were patients examined at low-volume medical facilities or community hospitals (
P
< .0001).
Lobectomy
Thyroid lobectomy alone may be sufficient treatment for small (<1 cm), low-risk, unifocal, intrathyroidal papillary carcinomas in the absence of previous head and neck irradiation or radiologically or clinically involved cervical nodal metastases. This procedure is associated with a lower incidence of
complications, but approximately 5% to 10% of patients will have a recurrence
in the thyroid after a lobectomy.[
11
]
Abnormal regional lymph nodes are biopsied at the time of
surgery.  Recognized involved nodes are removed at initial surgery, but
selective node removal can be performed,  and radical neck dissection is usually not
required.
This
results in a decreased recurrence rate but has not been shown to improve
survival.
Follicular thyroid cancer commonly metastasizes to lungs and bone. When a remnant lobe remains, use of iodine I 131 as ablative therapy is compromised because the radioiodine will be preferentially taken up by the remnant normal tissue rather than by the tumor.
Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy
Studies have shown that a postoperative course of therapeutic
(ablative) doses of radioiodine 131I results in a decreased recurrence rate among high-risk patients with papillary
and follicular carcinomas.[
5
] RAI  may be given in addition to exogenous thyroid
hormone but is not considered routine.[
12
] RAI treatment is optimal after total thyroidectomy with minimal thyroid remnant. With a large thyroid remnant, a low thyroglobulin level cannot be achieved, which increases the chance of requiring multiple doses of RAI.
Consideration of RAI for remnant ablation is based on the following pathological risk features:
The size of the primary tumor.
The presence of lymphovascular invasion.
Capsule invasion.
The number of involved lymph nodes.
RAI may be given with one of two methods of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH/thyrotropin) stimulation:
Withdrawal of thyroid hormone.
Administration of recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH).
Administered rhTSH maintains quality of life and reduces the radiation dose delivered to the body compared with thyroid hormone withdrawal.[
13
]  Patients  presenting with papillary
thyroid microcarcinomas (tumors <10 mm),   which are  considered to be  very low risk, have an excellent prognosis when
treated surgically. Additional therapy with 131I would not be expected to
improve the prognosis.[
14
]
The role of RAI in low-risk patients is not clear because disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) benefits have not been demonstrated.
Evidence (surgery with or without RAI):
One study reviewed 1,298 patients with low-risk disease from the French Thyroid Cancer Registry.[
15
]  Patients were identified as having low-risk papillary or follicular cancer as defined by the following American Thyroid Association and European Thyroid Association criteria:
Complete tumor resection.
Multifocal tumors 1 cm or smaller confined to the thyroid.
Tumors larger than 1 cm but no larger than 4 cm confined to the thyroid.
No lymph node involvement or distant metastatic disease.
Of the 1,298 patients, 911 patients received RAI after surgery, and 387 patients did not receive RAI after surgery.  The follow-up period was 10.3 years.
In multivariate analyses, there were no differences in OS (
P
= .243) or DFS (
P
= .2659),  according to RAI use.[
15
]
Long-term complications of RAI with 131I include:
Second malignancies.
Sialadenitis.
Lacrimal and salivary gland dysfunction.
Options for decreasing radiation exposure in patients with low-risk thyroid cancer have been explored. These options have included reducing the amount of RAI in each dose and   giving RAI in combination with rhTSH  injections.
Evidence (thyroid hormone withdrawal or use of rhTSH with 131I):
A phase III, randomized, noninferiority study included patients with low-risk thyroid cancer. The study compared two thyrotropin-stimulation methods (thyroid hormone withdrawal or use of rhTSH) and two 131I doses (1.1 GBq [30 mCi] and 3.7 GBq [100 mCi]), using a 2 × 2 factorial design.[
16
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Thyroid ablation rates were equivalent between high- and low-dose 131I at 6 to 10 months after administration of 131I.
Patients with more advanced T stage (T1–T3, N0–1) and with less than a total thyroidectomy were included with a lower overall ablation rate of 85%.
Another phase III, randomized, noninferiority study of patients with low-risk thyroid cancer compared two thyrotropin-stimulation methods (thyroid hormone withdrawal or use of rhTSH) and two 131I doses (1.1 GBq [30 mCi] and 3.7 GBq [100 mCi]), using a 2 × 2 factorial design. The inclusion criteria consisted of a low-risk, homogeneous cohort. All of the patients underwent total thyroidectomy and had pathological TNM stage pT1 (≤1 cm) and N1 or NX, pT1 (>1–2 cm) and any N, or pT2, N0 without thyroid capsule extension/distant metastases.[
17
][
Level of evidence C1
]
Thyroid ablation rates were equivalent between high- and low-dose 131I at 6 to 10 months after administration of 131I.
Complete thyroid ablation rate was 92%.
Patients who underwent thyroid hormone withdrawal had more  symptoms of hypothyroidism associated with deterioration in quality of life than the patients who received rhTSH.
Neither study assessed the effect of low-dose RAI on long-term recurrences or survival. The studies also did not address whether RAI could be safely omitted in specific low-risk groups.
Thyroid-suppression therapy
After thyroid surgery, all patients, except those undergoing lobectomies, require thyroid hormone replacement therapy. For patients who have undergone thyroidectomy, supratherapeutic doses of thyroid hormone are routinely given to suppress TSH levels.  The degree of TSH suppression recommended depends on  the risk of recurrence and the comorbidities of the patient.  Studies have suggested that TSH suppression improves progression-free survival (PFS), but there is no definitive evidence that it improves OS.[
18
,
19
]
External-beam radiation therapy (EBRT)
EBRT is typically reserved for palliative treatment of unresectable or metastatic papillary or follicular thyroid cancer.  In some cases, it may be appropriate to give EBRT in the adjuvant setting if there is confirmed or suspected microscopic residual disease that is confirmed or suspected to be refractory to RAI.  There are no randomized trials to guide the selection of patients who might benefit from treatment with EBRT.  The decision to use EBRT is based on retrospective data and clinical judgment.[
20
]
Metastatic papillary and follicular thyroid cancer
Total thyroidectomy is still recommended as the initial treatment for metastatic papillary or follicular thyroid cancer. RAI is the second treatment and is given to ablate the remnant thyroid and treat the metastatic disease.  If a thyroidectomy is not done, then RAI is not a treatment option for the patient.  The most common sites of distant metastases are the lungs and bones.  Treatment of distant
metastases is usually not curative but may produce significant palliation.
Genomic testing to identify actionable variants like
RET
and
NTRK
gene fusions should be considered for patients with advanced progressive disease. Treatment options for iodine-sensitive and iodine-resistant metastatic papillary and follicular thyroid cancer are described below.
Treatment options for iodine-sensitive thyroid cancer
Treatment options for iodine-sensitive thyroid cancer include:
RAI therapy.  Metastases that demonstrate uptake of this isotope may be ablated
by therapeutic doses of 131I.

Treatment-related adverse events (all grades) occurred in 97.3% of patients in the lenvatinib group and 59.5% of patients in the placebo group.
Grade 3 or higher adverse events were observed in 75.9% of patients who received lenvatinib and 9.9% of patients who received placebo.
The most common adverse events in the lenvatinib group were hypertension (67.8%), diarrhea (59.4%), fatigue (59%), decreased appetite (50.2%), decreased weight (46.4%), and nausea (41%).
Adverse events led to discontinuation of the study drug in 14.2% of patients who received lenvatinib and 2.3% of patients who received placebo.
In the lenvatinib group, 6 of 20 deaths occurring during the treatment period were considered drug related.
Surgery
Resection of limited metastases, especially symptomatic metastases, should be considered when the tumor has no uptake of 131I.

Recurrent papillary and follicular thyroid cancer
Approximately 10% to 30% of
patients thought to be disease free after initial treatment develop
recurrence and/or metastases.  Of these patients,  approximately 80% develop recurrence
with disease in the neck alone, and 20% develop recurrence with distant metastases.  The lungs are the most
common site of distant metastasis.  In a single series of 289
patients who developed recurrences after initial surgery, 16% died of cancer at
a median time of 5 years after recurrence.[

The prognosis for patients
with clinically detectable recurrences is generally poor, regardless of cell
type.[
30

Surgery with or without 131I ablation can be useful in
controlling local recurrences, regional node metastases, or occasionally,
metastases at other localized sites.[

]  Approximately 50% of the patients
who undergo surgery for recurrent tumors can be rendered free of disease with a second
operation.[
30
]  Local and regional recurrences detected by 131I scan and not
clinically apparent can be treated with 131I ablation and have an excellent
prognosis.[
34
]
Up to 25% of recurrences and metastases from well-differentiated thyroid cancer
may not show 131I uptake.  For these patients, other standard imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography scans may detect recurrent or metastatic disease.
Patients unresponsive to 131I should consider enrolling in clinical trials testing new approaches to treating this disease.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
Sorafenib
Sorafenib is an orally active, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sorafenib as a treatment option when recurrent disease does not

COSMIC-311
[NCT03690388])  was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib in patients aged 16 years and older with RAI-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Objective response rate was the primary end point in the first 100 randomly assigned patients (the objective response rate intention-to-treat [OITT] population), and PFS was the primary end point in all randomly assigned patients (the  intention-to-treat [ITT] population).[
35
]
Of 187 patients, 	63% had received previous therapy with lenvatinib, 60% had received previous therapy with sorafenib, and 24% had received previous therapy with both lenvatinib and sorafenib. Most patients (76%) had experienced disease progression while receiving sorafenib or lenvatinib.
In the OITT population, 15% of patients (99% CI, 5.8%–29.3%) in the cabozantinib group had a confirmed partial response, and median duration of response had not been reached at the data cutoff.
In the ITT population, after a median follow-up of 6.2 months, patients who received cabozantinib showed significant improvement in PFS compared with patients who received placebo (median not reached [96% CI, 5.7–not estimable (NE)] vs. 1.9 months [1.8–3.6]) (HR, 0.22; 96% CI, 0.13–0.36;
P
< .0001). Median OS was not reached in either ITT group (95% CI, NE–NE) (HR, 0.54; 95% CI,  0.27–1.11). The 6-month OS rate was 85% (95% CI, 75%–91%) in the cabozantinib group and 73% (58.4%–83.7%) in the placebo group.
Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 57% of patients who received cabozantinib and 26% of patients  who received placebo, and included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (10%), hypertension (11%), fatigue (8%), diarrhea (7%), and hypocalcemia (7%). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 20 of 125 patients (16%) in the cabozantinib group and 1 of 62 patients (2%) in the placebo group. There were no treatment-related deaths.
In 2021, the FDA reviewed a new drug application for the use of cabozantinib in patients aged 12 years and older with differentiated thyroid cancer because there are no standard-of-care treatments for this population after anti-VEGFR therapy, such as lenvatinib or sorafenib.

Adverse events led to a dose reduction in 38.9% of patients in the selpercatinib group and 77.3% of patients in the control group. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 4.7% of patients in the selpercatinib group and 26.8% of patients in the control group.
Pralsetinib
Pralsetinib is an oral RET-targeted therapy. In December 2020, the FDA approved pralsetinib for patients aged 12 years and older and for adults with advanced or metastatic
RET
-altered medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or
RET
fusion–positive RAI-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.
Evidence (pralsetinib):
A phase I/II, multicenter, open-label study (
ARROW
[NCT03037385]) evaluated the efficacy and safety of pralsetinib.[
38
]
At data cutoff, 147 patients had
RET
-altered MTC and 22 patients  had
RET
fusion–positive differentiated thyroid cancer. A total of 142 patients with
RET
-altered MTC or
RET
fusion–positive differentiated thyroid cancer initiated the phase II dose of pralsetinib at 400 mg once daily.
There were 61 patients with
RET
-altered MTC who had previously received cabozantinib, vandetanib, or both, and 23 patients were  treatment-naïve.
In patients with
RET
fusion–positive differentiated thyroid cancer, the overall response rate was 89% (95% CI, 52%–100%), all of which were partial responses. Duration of response was not reached after a median follow-up of 9.5 months. Median PFS was not reached (95% CI, NE), with an estimated 1-year PFS rate of 81% after a median follow-up of 12.9 months. Median OS was also not reached, with an estimated 1-year OS rate of 91% (95% CI, 74%–100%) after a median follow-up of 15.8 months.
The most frequent all-cause adverse events were anemia (45%), musculoskeletal pain (45%), constipation (44%), increased AST (42%), and hypertension (40%). Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events included hypertension (17%), neutropenia (13%), lymphopenia (12%), and anemia (10%). Serious adverse events were reported in 15% of patients; the most frequently reported serious adverse event was pneumonitis (4%).
Of note, in patients with
RET
-altered MTC previously treated with cabozantinib, vandetanib, or both, the overall response rate was 60% (95% CI, 46%–73%). One patient (2%) had  a complete response. However, in 2023 pralsetinib was withdrawn from FDA approval for this indication.[

NTRK inhibitors
Larotrectinib
Larotrectinib is a potent and highly selective small-molecule inhibitor of the TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC proteins.
Evidence (larotrectinib):
An expanded pooled efficacy analysis included 159 patients with
TRK
fusion−positive cancers treated with larotrectinib. The safety analysis included 260 patients treated with larotrectinib, regardless of
TRK
gene fusion status.[
40
]
For the 24 patients with thyroid cancer, the overall response rate was 79% (95% CI, 58%−93%). The median duration of response was NE  (14.8 months−NE).[
40
][
Level of evidence C2
]
Of the 260 patients in the safety analysis, 13% had grade 3 treatment-related adverse events and less than 1%  had grade  4  treatment-related  adverse  events.
The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were increased alanine aminotransferase (3%), anemia (2%), and decreased neutrophil count (2%).
Doses   were   reduced   in   8%   of  patients   with
TRK
fusion–positive   cancer because   of   adverse   events.   The drug was   discontinued   in  2%  of  patients because   of   treatment-related   adverse   events.
Entrectinib
Entrectinib is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of the TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, ROS1, and ALK proteins.
Evidence (entrectinib):
A pooled analysis of three phase I/II trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of  entrectinib  in  patients with metastatic or locally advanced or unresectable
NTRK
fusion−positive solid tumors. The efficacy analysis included 54 adult patients  with  advanced  or  metastatic
NTRK
fusion−positive solid tumors.[
41
]
The objective response rate was 57% (95% CI, 34.2%−70.8%). Seven percent of patients had a complete response, and 50% of patients had a partial response.[
41
][
Level of evidence C2
]
The median duration of response was 10 months (95% CI, 7.1−NE), and the median PFS was 11 months (95% CI, 8−14.9).
For the five patients with thyroid cancer, the overall response rate was 20% (95% CI, 1%−72%).
In the overall safety population (n = 355), the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events were dysgeusia (41%), fatigue (28%), dizziness (26%), constipation (23%),  and diarrhea (22%).
The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were increased weight (5%) and anemia (5%).
EBRT
EBRT or intraoperative radiation therapy can be
useful in controlling symptoms related to local tumor recurrences.[
42
]
Chemotherapy
Systemic
chemotherapy can be considered.  Chemotherapy has been reported to produce
occasional objective responses, usually of short duration.[

Current Clinical Trials
Sporadic and Hereditary Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC)
MTC occurs in two  forms, 
sporadic and hereditary.  In sporadic MTC, the tumor is usually unilateral. 
In the hereditary form, the tumor is almost always bilateral.  In addition, hereditary MTC may be associated with benign or malignant tumors of other
endocrine organs, commonly referred to as the multiple endocrine neoplasia
(MEN) syndromes types 2A and 2B (MEN2A or MEN2B).
These syndromes are associated with pheochromocytoma of the adrenal
gland and parathyroid hyperplasia.
Approximately 25% of reported MTC cases are hereditary. 
Hereditary MTC syndromes include MEN2A, which is
the most common, MEN2B, and hereditary non-MEN syndromes.  Any patient with a
hereditary variant is screened for other associated endocrine tumors,
particularly parathyroid hyperplasia and pheochromocytoma.  Medullary carcinoma usually secretes
calcitonin, a hormonal marker for the tumor, and may be detectable in blood
even when the tumor is clinically occult.  Measuring calcitonin
levels is useful for diagnostic purposes and for following the results of treatment. For more information, see
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 (MEN2)
.
Patients with MTC (whether hereditary or sporadic) are
tested for
RET
pathogenic variants, and if
RET
variants are detected, family members will
also be tested.  Family members may be screened for calcitonin elevation and the
RET
proto-oncogene variant. These tests can identify others at risk of developing
hereditary MTC. Because a  modest elevation of calcitonin may lead to a false-positive diagnosis of MTC, genetic testing for the
RET
pathogenic variant is
the optimal approach.  Family members who carry the
RET
pathogenic variant may choose to undergo
prophylactic thyroidectomy at an early age.[

]
Clinical Features  and Prognosis
MTC accounts for 3% to 4% of all thyroid cancers. 
These tumors usually present as a hard mass in the neck or thyroid, often associated
with lymphadenopathy.[
3
]   MTC can also be diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy.  Cytology
typically reveals hypercellular tumors with spindle-shaped cells and poor
adhesion.[
4
]  Metastases to regional lymph nodes
are found in about 50% of the cases.
The overall survival (OS) rate of patients with MTC is 86% at 5 years and 65% at 10 years.
Prognosis depends on the following factors:[
5
]
Extent of disease at
presentation.
Presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases.
Completeness of the surgical resection.
Poor prognostic
factors include:[
4
,
6
,
7
]
Advanced age.
Advanced stage.
Previous neck surgery.
Associated MEN2B.
Stage Information for MTC
Several staging systems have been employed to correlate extent of disease with
long-term survival in MTC.  The clinical staging system of
the American Joint Committee on Cancer  correlates survival to size of the primary tumor (T), presence or absence
of lymph node involvement (N), and presence or absence of distant metastasis (M). 
Patients who are diagnosed with hereditary MTC after positive genetic testing for a
RET
pathogenic variant have the best prognoses.[

Treatment Options for MTC
Localized disease
Treatment options for localized MTC include:
Total thyroidectomy
.
External-beam radiation therapy (EBRT)
.
Radioactive iodine is not used in the treatment of patients with MTC.
Total thyroidectomy
Patients with MTC are treated with total
thyroidectomy unless there is evidence of distant metastasis.  In patients
with clinically palpable MTC, the incidence of
microscopically positive nodes is more than 75%. Routine central and bilateral
modified neck dissections are generally done.[
9
]  When cancer is confined to
the thyroid gland, the prognosis is excellent.
EBRT
EBRT has been used for palliation of locally recurrent
tumors without evidence that it provides any survival advantage.[
10
]
Locally advanced and metastatic disease
Treatment options for locally advanced and metastatic MTC include:
Targeted therapy
.
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
.
RET kinase inhibitors
.
Palliative chemotherapy
.
Targeted therapy
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
Vandetanib
Vandetanib is an oral inhibitor of rearranged during transfection (RET) receptor kinase, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and epidermal growth-factor receptor.
Evidence (vandetanib):
A placebo-controlled prospective trial (
NCT00410761
)  evaluated vandetanib in 331 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive vandetanib or placebo.[
11
][
Level of evidence B1
]
With a median follow-up of 24 months, progression-free survival (PFS) favored vandetanib (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31–0.69;
P
< .001), with a median PFS estimated at 30.5 months for vandetanib versus 19.3 months for placebo.
OS was not different at 24 months. Longer follow-up will be required because all but 47 patients were alive at the time of analysis, and there was a crossover to the study drug on progression from placebo, making analysis of OS problematic.
Vandetanib treatment produces significant side effects, including diarrhea, rash, hypertension, and QT prolongation.  Quality of life was not formally assessed in this trial.
Cabozantinib
Cabozantinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of RET receptor kinase, hepatocyte growth factor receptor MET, and VEGFR-2.
Evidence (cabozantinib):
Cabozantinib was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial (
EXAM
[NCT00704730]). The study included 330 patients with metastatic MTC and radiographic progression of disease. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib (140 mg per day) or placebo. Patients who received placebo were not permitted to cross
	over to cabozantinib. The primary end point was PFS. Additional outcomes included response rate, OS, and safety.[

The estimated median PFS was 11.2 months in the cabozantinib group and 4.0 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19‒0.40;
P
< .001). A difference in PFS was observed across all subgroups and was independent of previous tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment and
RET
pathogenic variant status.
During a planned interim analysis of OS, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.63‒1.52).
The objective response rate was 28% in the cabozantinib group (all partial responses) and 0% in the placebo group (
P
< .001). The median estimated duration of response was 14.6 months (95% CI, 11.1‒17.5 months). Responses were observed regardless of
RET
pathogenic variant status.
The most common cabozantinib-associated adverse events  (all grades) included diarrhea (63.1%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (50%), decreased weight (47.7%), decreased appetite (45.8%), nausea (43%), and fatigue (40.7%)
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 69% of patients in the cabozantinib group and 33% of patients in the placebo group.
Adverse events resulted in treatment discontinuation in 16% of patients who received cabozantinib and in 8% of patients who received placebo.
RET kinase inhibitors
Selpercatinib
Selpercatinib is an orally active, highly selective, small-molecule RET kinase inhibitor.
Evidence (selpercatinib):
A phase I/II trial (
LIBRETTO-001
[NCT03157128]) evaluated the safety and efficacy of selpercatinib in adolescent and adult patients with any solid tumor type harboring an activating
RET
alteration. The primary end point was an objective response (complete response or partial response). The trial enrolled 55 patients with
RET
-altered MTC who were previously treated with vandetanib, cabozantinib, or both; and 88 patients with
RET
-altered MTC  who were not previously treated with vandetanib or cabozantinib. Eighty two percent of previously treated patients received the recommended phase II dose of 160 mg twice daily, and 98% of previously untreated patients received 160 mg twice daily.[

For patients with
RET
-altered MTC who were previously treated with vandetanib or cabozantinib:
The objective response rate was 69% (95% CI, 55%−81%); 9% of patients had a complete response, and 60% of patients had a partial response.
At 1 year, 86% of responses were ongoing (95% CI, 67%−95%), and 100% of patients were progression-free.
For 	patients with
RET
-altered MTC who were not previously treated with vandetanib or cabozantinib:
The objective response rate was 73% (95% CI, 62%−82%); 11% of patients had a complete response, and 61% of patients had a partial response.[

Level of evidence C2
]
At 1 year, 91% of responses were ongoing (95% CI, 72%−97%), and 92% of patients were progression-free.
Treatment-related adverse events (any grade) occurred in 94% of patients.
Grade 3 adverse events were observed in 28% of patients, and  grade 4 adverse events were observed in 2% of patients.
The most frequent adverse events were dry mouth (46%), hypertension (43%), diarrhea (38%), fatigue (38%), increased aspartate aminotransferase level (35%), nausea (35%), and constipation (35%).
Thirty percent of patients had dose reductions because of treatment-related adverse events, and 2% of patients discontinued the drug because of adverse events.
Palliative chemotherapy
Palliative chemotherapy has been reported to produce occasional responses in
patients with metastatic disease.[

considered standard.  Some patients with distant metastases will experience
prolonged survival and can be managed expectantly until they become
symptomatic.

Clinical Features and Prognosis
Undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinoma is a highly malignant type of thyroid cancer.   It grows rapidly and extends to structures beyond the thyroid.   It typically presents as a hard, ill-defined mass, often with
extension into the structures surrounding the thyroid.  Anaplastic
thyroid cancer must be carefully distinguished from lymphoma, which can have a similar presentation.  This tumor
usually occurs in an older age group and is characterized by extensive local
invasion and rapid progression.[
1
]
Patients with this tumor have poor 5-year survival rates. 
Death is usually from uncontrolled local cancer in the neck, often within
months of diagnosis.
Stage Information for Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer
All patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer are considered to have stage IV disease.

Treatment Options for Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer
Treatment options for anaplastic thyroid cancer include:
Surgery
.
External-beam radiation therapy  (EBRT)
.
Systemic therapy
.
Surgery
If the disease is localized, which is rare, total thyroidectomy is warranted to
reduce symptoms caused by the tumor mass.[
2
,
3
] Tracheostomy is frequently necessary.
EBRT
EBRT may be used in patients who are not surgical candidates or whose tumor cannot be surgically
excised.
Systemic Therapy
Anaplastic thyroid cancer is not responsive to iodine I 131 therapy.
Treatment with individual anticancer drugs has been reported to produce partial
remissions in some patients.  Approximately 30% of patients achieve a partial
remission with doxorubicin.[
4
]  The combination of doxorubicin plus cisplatin
appears to be more active than doxorubicin alone and has produced more complete responses.[
5
]
The combination of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy  after complete
resection may provide prolonged survival in some patients, but this treatment combination has not been compared with any one
modality alone.[
6
,
7
]
An estimated 25% of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancers have an activating
BRAF
V600E variant.[
8
]
Evidence (dabrafenib and trametinib):
A phase II trial of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, dabrafenib and trametinib, included 16 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer and a
BRAF
V600E variant.[
9
][
Level of evidence C2
]
The confirmed overall response rate was 69%. The median duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were not reached.
Twelve-month estimates were 90% for duration of response, 79% for PFS, and 80% for OS.
Based on  this data, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer with a
BRAF
V600E variant. Molecular testing for the
BRAF
V600E variant is advised for patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer.
