DCs Vaccine Combined With Cytokine-induced Killer Cells in Patients With AML
The aim of this Phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dendritic cells (DCs) vaccine combined with cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells in patients with AML. Experimental recombinant adenovirus-transfected DCs, which engineered to express MUC1 and Survivin are used for DCs-based immunotherapy. Based on the results of our previously performed preclinical study with DCs vaccine combined with CIK cells, the investigators plan to perform the clinical trial.
High-risk Soft Tissue Sarcoma
BIOLOGICAL: Adenovirus-transfected DC + CIK
PFS/OS, 1 years after DC/CIK treatment
Number of participants with adverse events, 3 days within DC/CIK treatment
