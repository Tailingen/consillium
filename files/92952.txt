Uncut Roux-en-Y vs Roux-en-Y
Uncut Roux-en-Y vs Roux-en-Y reconstruction after distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer
Uncut Roux-en-Y|Roux-en-Y|Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Uncut Roux-en-Y reconstruction|PROCEDURE: Roux-en-Y reconstruction
the incidence of Roux stasis syndrome, the incidence of Roux stasis syndrome after Roux-en-Y reach an incidence of over 30% which involve nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. So the incidence of both reconstructions should be compared., 3 month after surgery
the incidence of other complications after operation, one month after surgery|the quility of life according to the RGB standards, the RGB standards in Terms of Gastritis, Bile Reflux, and Gastric Residue, 12 month after surgery
To search which is the better reconstructions by comparing and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages between Uncut Roux-en-Y and Roux-en-Y reconstructions after laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.

Method: It's a prospective study including all patients underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) in the First Hospital of Jilin University. All surgical procedures will be performed by the single surgery team, which is leaded by professor Wang Quan. The reconstruction method will be selected randomly from Uncut Roux-en-Y and Roux-en-Y anastomosis preoperatively without distinct indications. All clinical data, operation data, perioperative complications and related physiological indexes after surgery will be compared.
