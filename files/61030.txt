Exercising Our ABC's (African- American Breast Cancer Survivors)
Recent studies have shown that some behavioral factors such as physical activity and exercise may improve quality of life and outcome in patients with breast cancer as well as decrease body fat, increase lean mass and reduce cancer-promoting hormones. None of these studies have been performed in African-American women with breast cancer. The medical field needs to understand how exercise may benefit cancer patients, particularly African Americans, and how to optimize these benefits to improve the quality of life, prognosis and survival.

Identify factors contributing to or limiting the success of development of the community-academic partnership., The primary endpoint is to determine if a successful partnership can be established between a community program, The Gathering Place, committed to providing support services to all community individuals with all types of cancer and academic researchers and clinicians at CWRU, Cleveland Clinic, UHCMC focused on modifying factors associated with energy balance to improve physical and psychological quality of life in cancer patients and provide the basis for future studies and programs to improve prognosis and survival., 30 weeks
Number of African-American women that participate, comply, adhere and sustain an aerobic and resistance exercise program., A secondary endpoint is to determine if African-American women at the completion of initial therapy for stage I-III breast cancer can be engaged to participate, comply, adhere and sustain an aerobic and resistance exercise program accompanied by psychosocial counseling to improve physical and psychological quality of life., 30 weeks|Change in circulating levels of known cancer promoting cytokines, adipokines and hormones and other measurements of fitness and well-being., Ascertain if a graded program to increase aerobic and resistance exercise activities along with psychosocial counseling can be used in African-American women at the completion of initial therapy for breast cancer to improve circulating levels of known cancer promoting cytokines, adipokines and hormones and other measurements of fitness and well-being., 30 weeks
All exercise training will take place at the Gathering Place, Beachwood OH, in the new Wellness Center that is equipped with state-of-the-art aerobic and resistance training apparati. All exercise will be performed under the supervision of the Gathering Place trained and certified staff. The patient group will perform a 20 week aerobic and resistance exercise training program to evaluate (compared to baseline) changes: in body composition (fat, lean tissue and bone mass); cytokines including insulin, leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, and TNFÎ±; oxidative stress including urine isoprostane; cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max); upper and lower body strength (assessed using a dynamometer); sleep (assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index \[PSQI\]); fatigue and quality of life (Qol) (assessed using the SF-36, FACIT instruments). Patients will be evaluated before and after a 20 week intervention and a 10 week post-intervention period. Participants also will be evaluated for motivation barriers and compliance. These feasibility parameters will provide the basis and guidance for an NCI grant application to focus on mechanisms and extend our evaluation to larger cohorts of African-American patients.
