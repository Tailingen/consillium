Intraoperative OCT Guidance of Intraocular Surgery II
The overall five-year goals of the project are to develop novel technology to provide actionable new information through provision of live volumetric imaging during surgery, improving surgical practice and outcomes. The investigators believe this technology will enable novel ophthalmic and other microsurgeries not possible due to current limitations in surgical visualization.
