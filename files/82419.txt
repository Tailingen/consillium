Postoperative Oral Nutritional Supplementation After Major Gastrointestinal Surgery
Patients who underwent major gastrointestinal surgery is potentially at risk of malnutrition due to reduced oral intake, increased nutritional need, reduced gastrointestinal absorption function, and/or metabolic changes after surgery. The postoperative malnutrition is associated with low quality of life and seems to be related long-term nutritional status. This study is a multicenter, open-labeled prospective randomized clinical trial to examine the effect of postoperative oral nutritional supplements (ONS) after major gastrointestinal surgery by comparing the change of body weight and other nutritional parameters between the experiment group that is supplied with ONS and the control group without ONS.
