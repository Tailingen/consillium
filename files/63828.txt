High Dose-Rate Brachytherapy and/or Intensity Modulated External Beam Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer
The principal objective of this study is to demonstrate that patients can safely receive combined High Dose Rate brachytherapy and Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy without experiencing a treatment limiting toxicity.
Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate
PROCEDURE: high dose-rate brachytherapy|PROCEDURE: intensity-modulated radiation therapy
To demonstrate that patients can safely receive combined HDR brachytherapy and IMRT teletherapy to a total dose consistent with current treatment policies and without experiencing a treatment limiting toxicity, 10 years
Patients will receive a single High Dose Rate brachytherapy dose of 6 Gy to the prostate, followed by 61 Gy delivered to the prostate and nearby tissues using Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy in 28 treatments.
