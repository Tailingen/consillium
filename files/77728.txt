This trial aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of a multimodal prehabilitation program in high-risk patients undergoing lung resection surgery. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of the intervention on: i) Healthcare resuorces use; ii) clinical outcomes; and, iii) patient's and professionals experience with the program.

The program includes X main interventions: i) A motivational interview; ii) A high-intensity exercise training program; iii) A plan for physical activity incentivation; iv) A nutritional optimization program; v) A psicologichal support program; and, vi) A smoking cessation program.
