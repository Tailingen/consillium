Study of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel With or Without Investigational Drug (CS-7017) in Subjects With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The study has a safety and a Phase 2 portion. In the safety portion of the study, subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer will be treated with study drug (CS-7017) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel to evaluate safety. In the Phase 2 portion of the study, subjects will receive study drug (CS-7017) or placebo in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel to evaluate effectiveness and safety. The study will find out if adding CS-7017 to carboplatin and paclitaxel will be safe and improve progression free survival in subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: CS7017 tablets|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Placebo Tablets
Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival at 18 Weeks Following Administration of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel With or Without CS-7017 in Chemotherapy-naïve Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earlier of the dates of the first objective documentation of disease progression (based upon radiographic tumor assessments) or death. As per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors v1.0, disease progression was characterized as confirmed complete response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target lesions, confirmed partial response (PR) defined as ≥30% decrease from baseline, stable disease (SD) defined as neither progressive disease (PD) nor PR, and PD defined as ≥20% increase from smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since treatment started., 18 weeks postdose|Percentage of Participants With Progression-Free Survival Based on Radiologic and Clinical Assessments and Death After Carboplatin/Paclitaxel With or Without CS-7017 in Chemotherapy-naïve Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earlier of the dates of the first objective documentation of disease progression (based upon radiographic tumor assessments) or death. Disease progression was determined in accordance with the RECIST version 1.0 criteria., 18 weeks postdose
Summary of Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Overall Survival Following Administration of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel With or Without CS-7017 in Chemotherapy-naïve Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death resulting from any cause., Baseline to date of death, up to approximately 2 years postdose|Number of Participants With Best Overall Tumor Response and Objective Response Rate Following Administration of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel With or Without CS-7017 in Chemotherapy-naïve Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, As per Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors v1.0, the best overall response was characterized as confirmed complete response (CR) defined as disappearance of all target lesions, confirmed partial response (PR) defined as ≥30% decrease from baseline, stable disease (SD) defined as neither progressive disease (PD) nor PR, and PD defined as ≥20% increase from smallest sum of longest diameter recorded since treatment started. Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as CR + PR., Baseline to disease progression, death, or withdrawal from study, up to approximately 2 years postdose|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to CS-7017/Placebo Following Administration of Carboplatin/Paclitaxel With or Without CS-7017 in Chemotherapy-naïve Participants With Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, Baseline up to approximately 2 years postdose
