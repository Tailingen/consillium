Impact of "Teaching the Teachers" Concept on Global Education and Application of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Diagnosis Guidelines
This study evaluates a concept called 'Teaching the Teachers' and whether it is helpful in disseminating guidelines on the national and international levels. "Teaching the Teachers" involves teaching the guidelines to experts who later teach the same guidelines to other radiologists, trainees, and physicians to assume the teacher's role and disseminate the guidelines and so on.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
OTHER: Survey Administration
Teaching rates of the hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis guidelines, Paired comparisons will be performed on the proportion of learners using the practice guidelines. Will perform a multivariate analysis to assess the effect of demographic characteristics (e.g., number of years of experience, type of practice) on the teaching rate of the HCC diagnostic guidelines., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate the magnitude of teaching of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnostic guidelines after applying "Teaching the Teachers" concept.

II. Assess the effect of "Teaching the Teachers" concept on application of guidelines in clinical practice.

OUTLINE:

Participants complete surveys immediately after completion of a HCC diagnostic guideline webinar, monthly thereafter, and again at 6 months.
