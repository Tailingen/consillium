The aim is to generate real-life data on treatment patterns of the EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC patients receiving first- or second-generation EGFR TKI in first line of therapy as provided per routine practice in eight countries. An approximate number of 820 patients will take part in the REFLECT study.

It is anticipated that data, generated from the proposed large cohort across centers in Europe, will facilitate a better understanding of unmet medical needs in first line of treatment and will provide a platform for improving patients' management.
