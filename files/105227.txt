Phase I Study of the BBP-398 in Patients With Advance Solid Tumors
This is an open label, dose escalation and expansion, two-part Phase I study for SHP-2 inhibitor BBP-398 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, determine MTD and/or RP2D, and preliminary anti- cancer activity in Chinese subjects with advanced solid tumors and in Chinese subjects with advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Advanced or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: BBP-398
Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of BBP-398, The MTD will be based on DLT, Completion of 1 Cycle (28 days)|Determination of anti-tumor activity of BBP-398, Anti-tumor activity will be defined by objective response rate (ORR, complete response + partial response rate) and duration of response (DOR) according to RECIST v1.1, Completion of 1 Cycle (28 days)
Part A:Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of BBP-398, Maximum plasma concentration of BBP-398 after single and multiple dose administration of BBP-398, Approximately 6 months|Part A:Time to reach Cmax (Tmax) of BBP-398, The amount of time to reach Cmax after single and multiple dose administration of BBP-398, Approximately 6 months|Part A: Terminal half-life (t1/2) of BBP-398, Terminal half-life (t1/2) after single and multiple dose administration of BBP-398, Approximately 6months|Part A: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of BBP-398, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve after single and multiple dose administration of BBP-398, Approximately 6 months|Part A: Concentration of BBP-398 in urine, To evaluate BBP-398 excretion via urine after single and multiple dose administration of BBP-398., Approximately 6 months|Part B: Concentration of BBP-398 in plasma, To evaluate BBP-398 plasma concentration after multiple dose administration of BBP-398., Approximately 6 months
The Part A of this phase I trial is an abbreviated dose escalation study of BBP-398 following the USA mono dose escalation study (Study NAV- 1001, clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT04528836). The purpose of this part is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-cancer activity in Chinese subjects with advanced solid tumors. The Part B of this study is to explore the safety, tolerability and efficacy of BBP-398 in Chinese subjects with advanced or metastatic EGFR- mutant NSCLC at MTD and/or RP2D. This Phase I study will provide supportive data to enable Chinese patients to join the combo dose escalation and expansion studies and/or other clinical trials of BBP-398.
