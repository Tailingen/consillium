Evaluating Mepitel in Post-mastectomy Patients and the Role of the Skin Microbiome in Radiation Dermatitis
The aim of this study is to examine alterations in the skin microbiome that occur during radiation therapy. The study design will examine changes secondary to ionizing radiation, and correlate these changes with the development and severity of radiation dermatitis. The goal is to improve understanding of the mechanism of radiation dermatitis.
