Ovarian Tumor Biopsies to Study Response to Treatments
This is a research study to look at differences in tumor tissue from ovarian cancer patients that may help to determine response and resistance to treatments.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
PROCEDURE: Blood Draw|PROCEDURE: Tumor Tissue Biopsy
Pearson correlation for changes between kinome and CA125, 5 years|Paired T-test for differences in kinome between responders and non-responders, 5 years
Ovarian cancer participants will be asked to have two tumor biopsies during the research study. The first biopsy will be done prior to receiving the participants' assigned treatments as a part of their cancer care and the second biopsy will be done about 3-7 days after starting treatment. Participants who will undergo neoadjuvant treatment and then surgery, will also have their tumor tissue collected during surgery. Participants whose disease worsens while on treatment will also be asked to have an additional, optional tumor biopsy.

The tumor tissue samples will be studied to look at certain proteins and enzymes, including enzymes called kinomes, that may be important in determining response and resistance to the treatment that participants will receive as a part of their cancer care.
