Nutrition, Exercise, and Breast Cancer Survivorship
The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of resistance training on the reasons (mechanisms) underlying the development of fatigue, muscle weakness and wasting (sarcopenia), and impaired physical functioning (poor balance and walking) associated with breast cancer survivorship.

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, representing 26% of all female cancers. It is also the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the US for women. Side effects of the cancer and treatment therapies may result in inactivity and inadequate intakes of various nutrients, including protein and vitamin D, associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes. High concentrations of systemic and local inflammation correlate well with CVD and diabetes risk. There is substantial evidence to support that incorporating physical activity and nutrition into one's lifestyle can reduce inflammation and, ultimately, the progression to CVD and diabetes. Understanding the role of exercise and diet management in the health of breast cancer survivors will allow us to translate these findings into therapy guidelines.
