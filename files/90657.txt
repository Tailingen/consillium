PSMA-RLT in Biochemically Recurrent PCa
Prospective single-center one-arm phase II study in patients with prostate cancer and confirmed biochemical recurrence (BCR) with PSA of ≥ 0.2 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy (RP) or PSA \> nadir + 2ng/ml after radiotherapy (RT) but not radio-morphological local recurrence after primary therapy with curative intent receive systemic therapy with only 2 cycles of highly standardized (3 GBq in first cycle and 6 GBq in the second cycle) PSMA-RLT at 6-week intervals.
