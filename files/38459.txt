Investigation of Cisplatin-Related Kidney Toxicity
The purpose of this study is to identify novel biomarkers of kidney injury in patients receiving cisplatin.

This study will also collect DNA for future analysis.

Change in urine biomarker (NGAL) after cisplatin, while on drug and up to 35 days after end of treatment
Change in blood and urine cystatin C, while on drug and up to 35 days after end of treatment|Change in blood NGAL while receiving cisplatin, while on drug and up to 35 days after end of treatment|Genetic markers of kidney toxicity, while on drug and up to 35 days after end of treatment
This study will look for novel biomarkers of kidney injury in patients receiving cisplatin in patients currently receiving cisplatin.

DNA will be collected both prospectively and retrospectively (from patients that have previously received cisplatin.
