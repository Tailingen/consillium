Safety and Tolerability Study Which Evaluate Intravesical Instillation With Mitomycin C Mixed With TC-3 Drug Retaining Hydrogel Device In Patients With Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of intravesical instillation of TC-3 Hydrogel disposable device for retention of mitomycin C chemotherapeutic drug in the urinary bladder.
Carcinoma of Urinary Bladder, Invasive
DEVICE: TC-3 gel|DEVICE: TC-3 gel mixed with Mitomycin C (MMC)
Assessment of systemic and urine pharmacokinetics of MMC following intravesical instillation of TC-3 mixed with MMC for safety evaluation., Study participants undergoing bladder instillation with MMC mixed with TC-3 6 hours prior to radical cystectomy. During these six hours the MMC levels in urine and blood will be measured every hour and the Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax)and Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be calculated and compared to the standard toxicity level in patients treated with MMC in saline (standard of cure). In addition, patient tolerability to treatment will be evaluated., 6 hours
Assessment of the levels of MMC in patients urinary bladder following intravesical instillation of TC-3 mixed with MMC., Study participants undergoing bladder instillation with MMC mixed with TC-3 6 hours prior to radical cystectomy. Local (bladder) tissue levels of MMC will be evaluated and compared to MMC levels detected following treatment with MMC in saline (standard of cure)., 6 hours
Non-muscle-Invasive Bladder cancer is mainly treated by tumor resection (Trans Urethral Resection - TUR), followed by series of intravesical instillations of prophylactic chemotherapeutic drugs as Mitomycin C (MMC).This treatment approach is limited due to rapid dilution the chemotheraputic drug by the incoming urine and clearance by urination.

TheraCoat core technology is based on a reverse thermal (low viscosity at 5Â°C) degradable gel (TC-3)for MMC retention in the urinary bladder.

Prior to instillation, the TC-3 hydrogel,in a liquid state, is mixed with MMC.TC-3 mixed with MMC is instilled to the bladder by a catheter.Following gel insertion to the bladder, the gel solidifies and forms a drug reservoir inside the bladder. Upon contact with urine the gel dissolves and is cleared out from the bladder.

Intravesical MMC using TheraCoat gel is expected to increase treatment efficiency due to prolongation of treatment duration and consequently improving bladder exposure to MMC.
