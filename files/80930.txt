Assessment of Cellular Proliferation in Tumors by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Using [18F]ISO-1
The main purpose of this study is to see if Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with a radioactive tracer called 18F-ISO-1 can accurately identify how quickly cancer cells are growing or dividing. A second purpose for this study is to determine, by taking pictures, what tissues and organs of the body take up 18F-ISO-1 naturally and to determine how that uptake changes over time.

The primary out come is to assess the diagnostic quality of [18F]ISO-1-PET/CT images at the proposed 8 mCi dose., 3 years
Secondary outcome is to quantitatively determine the relationship between tumor [18F]ISO-1 uptake and Ki-67, S-phase, mitotic index and sigma-2 receptors content of the tumor., 3 years
