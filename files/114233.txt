Induction Therapy for Patients With FLT3 Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a pilot study designed to identify the effect of daunorubicin-cytarabine liposome (CPX-351) in combination with a FLT3-inhibitor (midostaurin) as induction and consolidation therapy for patients with high-risk FLT3 mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and subsequent CD34+-selected allogeneic stem cell transplant from HLA compatible related or unrelated donors.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: CPX-351|DRUG: Midostaurin|DRUG: Busulfan|DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Fludarabine|BIOLOGICAL: CD34+ selected allogeneic stem cell transplant from an HLA-compatible donor
Change in the complete remission rate, Assess the complete remission rate following induction therapy with CPX-351 plus midostaurin when administered to patients, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|Change in Progression Free Survival (PFS), to determine the PFS of these patients following allo SCT. To estimate PFS the Kaplan-Meier method will be used., 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|Change in Overall Survival (OS), to determine the OS of these patients following allo SCT. To estimate OS the Kaplan-Meier method will be used., 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Change in the rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity, Ascertain the rate of MRD negativity by next generation sequencing at sequential time post following induction treatment at complete remission prior to allo Stem Cell Transplantation (SCT), 3, 6, 12 and 24 months|Correlation of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), Correlation of duration of MRD negative status with duration of complete remission of these patients will be assessed using Spearman's correlation with reported p value., 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
