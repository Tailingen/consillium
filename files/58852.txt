This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study investigating REM-422, a potent, selective, and oral small molecule mRNA degrader that reduces expression of the MYB transcription factor for patients with higher risk MDS or relapsed/refractory AML.

This study includes a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase. The purpose of the Dose Escalation Phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REM-422 in patients with higher risk MDS or relapsed/refractory AML. The purpose of Dose Expansion is to further evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of the RP2D carried forward from Dose Escalation.

Participation in this study will continue until disease progression, therapy intolerance, or participant withdrawal.
