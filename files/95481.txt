Study of Safety,Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of CT-1530 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia
This is a phase I study of BTK inhibitor CT-1530 in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM).

The purpose of the study is to determine the MTD/RP2D of CT-1530, and evaluate its safety and tolerability as monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM).
