A Safety Study of SGN-CD19B in Patients With B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
The study will examine the safety profile of SGN-CD19B administered as a single agent. The main purpose of the study is to estimate the highest dose that does not cause unacceptable side effects of SGN-CD19B in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Grade 3 follicular lymphoma (FL3). Additionally, the pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor activity of SGN-CD19B will be assessed.
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|DLBCL|Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma|Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: SGN-CD19B
Incidence of adverse events, Through 1 month following last dose|Incidence of laboratory abnormalities, Through 1 month following last dose
Blood concentrations of SGN-CD19B, Through 3 weeks after dosing|Incidence of antitherapeutic antibodies, Through 1 month following last dose|Objective response rate, Through 1 month following last dose|Rate of response, Through 1 month following last dose|Progression-free survival, Up to approximately 3 years
SGN-CD19B will be given to patients at increasing doses every 28 days (or on an alternative dosing schedule of every 42 days).

Individual expansion cohorts of up to approximately 20 patients will be opened at dose levels selected by the Safety Monitoring Committee based on the aggregate known safety and activity data to further define the safety and antitumor activity in refractory and relapsed disease subgroups.
