This study aims to develop and validate a new non-invasive detection method for early detection and postoperative monitoring of gastric cancer in the blood. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, ROC curve area, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the new biomarkers in the diagnosis of gastric cancer will be compared with that of tumor biomarkers CA19-9, CEA, and CA72-4. Blood will also be collected at various time points post-operatively. The investigators will determine whether these new biomarkers can be used as prognostic biomarkers to predict tumor recurrence and metastasis. The investigators will also determine whether these new biomarkers detect tumor recurrence and metastasis earlier than methods currently used in the clinic such as imaging and tumor biomarkers CA19-9, CEA, and CA72-4.

This study is a prospective and multi-center study.
