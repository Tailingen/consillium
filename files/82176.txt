131I-MIBG Alone VS. 131I-MIBG With Vincristine and Irinotecan VS131I-MIBG With Vorinostat
This study will compare three treatment regimens containing metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and compare their effects on tumor response and associated side effects, to determine if one therapy is better than the other for people diagnosed with relapsed or persistent neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma
RADIATION: 131I-MIBG|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Vorinostat
Objective Tumor Response After One Course of Therapy, To identify the MIBG treatment regimen associated with the highest overall response rate after one course of treatment on the three arms. The response evaluation was based on central review (intent to treat analysis). Responders defined as meeting CR/MRD/PR criteria. Response was based on NANT response criteria v1.2 (https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.26940). RECST 1.1 criteria was used for measurable tumors with PR criteria \> 30% decrease in target tumor size. Curie score was used with PR criteria \> 50% decrease in Curie score. Complete Response- disappearance of all target lesions, Curie score of 0 and no detectable bone marrow disease. Overall Response (OR)=CR+PR., 43-50 days from study day 1
Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Greater Non-hematologic Toxicities, Compare toxicity profiles for grade 3 or greater toxicities associated with each of 131I-MIBG treatment regimens; single-agent 131I-MIBG; Vincristine/Irinotecan/131I-MIBG; or Vorinostat/131I-MIBG, All toxicities from enrollment through 30 days following end of protocol therapy, an average of 6 months
