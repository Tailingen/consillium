FKBP51s: a New Molecular Biomarker for Glioblastoma? Pre- and Post-operative Blood Levels Evaluation of FKBP51s Protein and Correlation With MRI Phenotype
The aim of this interventional study is to investigate the correlation between Magnetic Resonance Phenotype and levels of FKBP51s protein pre and post surgery in adult patients affected by Glioblastoma
