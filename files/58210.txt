Feasibility Trial of Extracorporeal Iron Purification in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Myelofibrosis
In transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndromes patients, regular blood transfusions lead to iron overload, which can cause organ damage, hormonal imbalances, and increased infection risk, ultimately impacting patient survival. Standard oral iron chelation therapies can be intolerable for some patients due to adverse effects. The MEX-CD1 device (class III) could potentially offer an alternative for these patients by reducing serum iron levels through a novel, extracorporeal approach.

MEXIRON clinical investigation focuses on the use of MEX-CD1, a medical device designed for extracorporeal chelation therapy to reduce serum iron overload in patients suffering from transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myelofibrosis.

MEXIRON aims to evaluate the device's use feasibility, safety, and effectiveness in reducing serum free iron levels. Transfusions needs, patient experience and quality of life are also assessed.

Each enrolled patients will undergo three low-volume continuous veno-venous haemodialysis cycles within one week.

Following the three- haemodialysis cycles, patients will be monitored through on-site follow-up visits at 7 days, 28 days, and 90 days post-treatment to assess long-term effects.
