Combination Vaccine Immunotherapy (DRibbles) for Patients With Definitively-Treated Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will test an investigational vaccine, called DRibbles, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesize that vaccination with the DRibble vaccine will cause an immune responses against proteins contained in the DRibble vaccine and the protein antigens targeted by this strong immune response will include common antigens shared by both the vaccine and the patient's tumor.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|BIOLOGICAL: DRibble vaccine|DRUG: Imiquimod|DRUG: GM-CSF|BIOLOGICAL: HPV vaccine
Identify the regimen that produces the strongest antibody response, The best regimen will be defined as the one that generates the greatest increase in the number of strong antibody responses as defined by a greater than 15-fold increase in antibody, as measured using the Immune Response Biomarker Profiling Array (Invitrogen) on the day 95 serum sample., 95 days
Safety, To evaluate the overall safety of allogeneic NSCLC DRibble vaccine alone or in combination with either imiquimod or GM-CSF, as adjuvant treatment for definitively-treated patients with Stage IIIA or B NSCLC. During the treatment period, patients will be seen in clinic 13 times over a 22-week period; performance status and side-effects will be evaluated at each visit., 43 weeks|Progression free survival, Evaluate progression-free survival. Tumor measurements by CT scan will be obtained at week 16 and subsequently at the discretion of the treating investigator. After the treatment period, patients will be seen every 3 months for 2 years, or until progressive disease., 2 years|Immune response and progression-free survival correlation., Evaluate whether any immune response data correlate with progression-free survival. Immune response data will be collected 12 times over the first 43 weeks and then every 3 months until two years or progressive disease. This data will be correlated with progression-free survival., 2 years
This is an open-label, randomized study in which the first 33 patients will be assigned to receive the either:

* DRibbles vaccine and HPV vaccine
* DRibbles vaccine, HPV vaccine, and imiquimod
* DRibbles vaccine, HPV vaccine, and GM-CSF After 11 patients have been assigned to each group, the study arm with the greatest number of vaccine-induced strong antibody responses will then continue with enrollment of 15 further patients. The primary objective is to determine the best strategy to induce strong (\>15 fold) tumor-specific or tumor-associated antibody responses in patients with stage III A and B NSCLC. The goal is to select one regimen to advance to additional clinical trials.
