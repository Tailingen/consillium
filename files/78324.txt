Study of Postoperative 3D-CRT/IMRT in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatectomy is difficult when the tumor is adjacent to the big vessels of the liver and some patients can not receive radical resection. Such patients have high risk of recurrence. Tumor resection and postoperative radiation is an option for such patients to achieve radical treatment and radiation may reduce local recurrence.

Patients with risk factors of recurrence receive postoperative radiotherapy using intensive modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT). The clinical target volume includes tumor bed. The dose will be 50-60Gy/25-30f. Overall survival, local-recurrence free survival, disease free survival and toxicity need be observed.
