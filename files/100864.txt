EndoRotor® Ablation of Barrett's Esophagus: Safety and Feasibility Study
The aim of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of the EndoRotor® for the ablation of Barrett's esophagus.
Barretts Esophagus With Dysplasia
DEVICE: The EndoRotor®
Safety of EndoRotor® ablation of Barrett's mucosa; Number of participants with treatment related adverse events, such as bleeding, perforation or post procedural stenosis, Participants will have follow-up visits after the procedure during which the occurence of adverse events will be assessed. Adverse events will be classified according to the severity and onset timing., 3 months|Feasibility of EndoRotor® for the ablation of Barrett's mucosa, The percentage of endoscopically visible surface regression of Barrett's epithelium after 3 months post EndoRotor® treatment, 3 months
To assess the patient discomfort (recorded using the Numeric Rating Scale - grade 1-10), The discomfort score will be recorded in a diary during the first 30 days post procedure, 1 month|To assess the dysphagia-score (recorded using the Ogilvie score), The dysphasia score will be recorded in a diary during the first 30 days post procedure, 1 month|To assess a variety of symptoms (recorded using a 7 point Likert scale), The symptoms will be recorded in a diary during the first 30 days post procedure, 1 month|Total time to resect tissue, Procedure time is recorded during the EndoRotor® procedure, Procedure|Ease of performing the EndoRotor® procedure, Procedural performance of the endoscopist will be assessed, using a predefined questionaire., Procedure
Prospective pilot study, to be performed in 30 patients with Barrett's esophagus that have an indication for ablation treatment. These include patients with low grade dysplasia (LGD), high grade dysplasia (HGD) or residual Barrett's after a complete endoscopic resection of a lesion containing HGD or esophageal adenocarcinoma. Ablation treatment will be performed by the EndoRotor ablation device, followed by surveillance endoscopy at 3 months where the feasibility for ablation will be assessed. During the 3 months follow-up, all adverse events such as perforation, post-procedural bleeding, stricture, and pain will be registered.

The EndoRotor® System is in automated mechanical endoscopic mucosal resection system for use in the gastrointestinal tract. The EndoRotor suctions up the tissue and cuts it, automatically sending the tissue to a collection trap for histological evaluation.
