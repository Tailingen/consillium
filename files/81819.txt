Efficacy and Safety of Yttrium-90 Microspheres Selective Internal Radiotherapy Combined with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Anti-angiogenesis Drugs Sequential HAIC for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) based on transarterial radioembolization with yttrium (90Y) microspheres combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors and anti-angiogenic-drug sequential hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) for the treatment of initially unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with transformation potential.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Combination Productï¼št: SIRT-Y90 +HAIC+Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab
ORR mRESIST, from the date of enrollment to death from any cause., Prior to surgery
Transformation success rate, Defined as having at the same time: 1) R0 resection can be achieved and sufficient residual liver volume (FLR) can be preserved; 2) Child-Pugh A or B; 3) ECOG PS score 0 - 1;(4) There is no tumour thrombosis in the main internal secretion vein or inferior vena cava. (5)No tumour thrombus in the main and inferior vena cava; 5) No contraindication to hepatectomy;, Up to approximately 48 months|R0 Resection Rate, R0 resection rate (proportion of resected participants obtaining an R0 resection). R0 resection is defined as a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no tumor (gross or microscopic) remains in the primary tumor bed., Up to approximately 48 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from randomization to the date of tumor progression at any site in the body or death from any cause, whichever is earlier. For those who remain alive and have not progressed, PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment on or before the time of analysis or the end of study treatment, whichever is earlier., Up to approximately 48 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 3 years)|Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate, pCR rate is defined as the proportion of participants with an absence of residual tumor at the time of surgery, as assessed by central pathological review., Up to approximately 48 months
