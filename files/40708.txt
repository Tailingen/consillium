Local Bisphosphonate Effect on Recurrence Rate in Extremity Giant Cell Tumor of Bone
The purpose of the clinical study is to investigate whether the local delivery of bisphosphonate as a surgical adjuvant can decrease the chance of a giant cell tumor of bone coming back to the same location. The hypothesis is that the local administration of bisphosphonate will decrease the rate of the tumor returning compared to traditional aggressive surgical removal of the tumor.
Giant Cell Tumor of Bone
DRUG: Zoledronic Acid
The endpoint for patient participation will be local recurrence, Local recurrence of giant cell tumor of bone, Followed for 2 years postoperatively for study end points
MSTS Score, The Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system is a validated and well-accepted functional scoring system used in orthopaedic oncology research, Followed for 2 years postoperatively for study end points|Surgical site infection, The surgical site will be assessed for a surgical site infection (SSI) as defined by CDC guidelines after surgery and during scheduled follow-up as outlined in time frame below., Follow-ups will consist of clinical visits. The clinical visits will be at 2 weeks postoperatively, 6 weeks postoperatively, and then every three months for the first two years after surgery.|Wound healing, The surgical site will be assessed after surgery and during scheduled follow-up as outlined in time frame below for wound healing issues/concerns., Follow-ups will consist of clinical visits. The clinical visits will be at 2 weeks postoperatively, 6 weeks postoperatively, and then every three months for the first two years after surgery.|Potential bisphosphonate complications related to systemic administration, Patients will be followed for atypical femur fractures and avascular necrosis (AVN) of jaw, Followed for 2 years postoperatively for study end points
The purpose of the clinical study is to investigate whether the local delivery of bisphosphonate (BP-loaded PMMA bone cement) as a surgical adjuvant can decrease the local recurrence rate of giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone. The investigators will evaluate whether bisphosphonate as a surgical adjuvant improves secondary outcomes, such as pain, function, fever, or wound complications. The hypothesis is that the local administration of bisphosphonate will decrease the recurrence rate of GCT compared to traditional aggressive intralesional curettage.
