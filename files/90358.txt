Evaluation of Heart Function in Breast Cancer Patients Using Trastuzumab
By dynamically observing the changes of echocardiogram and biomarkers in breast cancer patients using trastuzumab, evaluate the effect of trastuzumab on cardiac function; determine the sensitivity of echocardiography and biomarker indicators And specificity, explore effective and specific early warning indicators, and provide technical support for the evaluation of the cardiac safety of anti-tumor drugs.

DRUG: Trastuzumab
Time ending, 180 days after chemotherapy, 6 months
Thirty female breast cancer patients using trastuzumab, collected demographic and clinical information of all patients before chemotherapy, performed echocardiography (conventional echocardiography, three-dimensional spot tracking technology), and collected blood samples to detect plasma biology Markers (TnT, BNP, GDF-15, topoisomerase), follow-up echocardiography and biomarkers at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after chemotherapy.
