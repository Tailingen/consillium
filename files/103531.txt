Exatecan Mesylate in Treating Patients With Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of exatecan mesylate in treating patients who have advanced soft tissue sarcoma.
Sarcoma
DRUG: exatecan mesylate
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the anticancer activity of exatecan mesylate, in terms of objective response and duration of response, in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma.
* Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histological diagnosis (leiomyosarcoma vs other histologies).

Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression. After disease progression, patients are followed every 12 weeks for survival.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32-50 patients (16-25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
