A Randomized Phase II Trial Comparing Therapy Based on Tumor Molecular Profiling Versus Conventional Therapy in Patients With Refractory Cancer
SHIVA is a proof of concept randomized phase II trial which compares two treatment strategies for patients with refractory cancer.

From a tumor biopsy, a molecular profile of the disease is established (mutations, amplifications, hormone receptor status). If a molecular abnormality is identified for which an approved targeted agent is available, patients are randomized randomized between two arms:

* Targeted therapy based on the molecular profile
* Conventional therapy based on investigator's choice.

A cross-over is proposed at disease progression.
