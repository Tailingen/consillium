Natural Killer (NK) Cell Therapy for B-Cell Malignancies
This is an open-label, Phase I study of QN-019a (allogeneic CAR-NK cells targeting CD19) as monotherapy in relapsed/refractory B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) and in combination with Rituximab in relapsed/refractory B-cell Lymphoma.

This clinical study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of QN-019a in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma or B-ALL. Up to 22-36 patients will be enrolled.
