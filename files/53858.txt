REal World Data in LYmphoma and Survival in Adults
REALYSA cohort is a population-based epidemiological platform in real-life for lymphomas designed to enrich prognostic data, by integrating together epidemiological, clinical and biological data.

REALYSA is a platform perfectly set up to

* Study prognostic factors using integrated epidemiological and biological data (genetics), to better characterize the determinants of refractoriness and relapse in patients with lymphoma, to follow the growing number of survivors and describe median to long-term sequela, second cancer, quality of life (QoL)...
* Document treatment effectiveness in real life and observance
* Address socio-economical questions

Representativeness of the included population, Study population must show a good representativeness of the source population regarding demographic or diseases characteristics, to be able to generalize our results. Indeed, the representativeness of the study population can only be evaluated in areas covered by population-based cancer registries (PBCR) by comparing cases included in the REALYSA project to incident lymphoma cases registered in the general population (PBCR of the FRANCIM network)., 5 years|Representativeness of the included population, Study population must show a good representativeness of the source population regarding demographic or diseases characteristics, to be able to generalize our results.
