S-1 and Radiotherapy for Elderly Esophageal Cancer Patients
To investigate the efficacy and toxicity of S-1 with concurrent radiotherapy in older patients with esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Cancer|S-1|Radiotherapy
DRUG: S-1|RADIATION: radiotherapy
response rate, Response rate will be done after 4 weeks following the last radiotherapy session., week 4
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) will be calculated from the date of CCRT initiation to the date of documented failure (local recurrence or metastasis occurrence) or the date of the last follow-up for those remaining., year 0 - year 2|Acute and late toxicities assessed based on the common toxicity criteria for adverse events version 3.0 (CTCAEv3.0), Acute and late toxicities will be assessed based on the common toxicity criteria for adverse events version 3.0 (CTCAEv3.0)., year 0 - year 1|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) wiil be determined as the time (in months) between the first day of therapy and the last follow-up or the date of death., year 0 - year 2
Dysphagia score, Dysphagia score was measured according to the following scale: 0, able to consume a normal diet; 1, able to swallow certain solid foods; 2, able to swallow only semisolid foods; 3, able to swallow liquids only; and 4, unable to swallow anything., month 0 - month 6
Older patients with esophageal cancer have been correlated with poor prognosis because of having little chance to receive aggressive local therapy, including concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In this phase II trial, the efficacy and toxicity of S-1 with concurrent radiotherapy will be investigated in this setting.
