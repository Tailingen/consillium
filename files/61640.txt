This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for Hepatocellular Carcinoma or Biliary Tract Cancer.

The interventions involved in this study are:

* Durvalumab
* Tremelimumab
* Radiation Therapy
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Tremelimumab|DRUG: Durvalumab|RADIATION: Radiation
Best Overall Response rate, The number of participants that achieve either a complete response or partial response. Response rate (ORR) is assessed using irRECIST (Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors). Response is evaluated with the use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Participants are evaluated for response for the duration of treatment.Treatment continues until disease progression, treatment is considered a safety risk, physicians decision, withdrawal from the study, or until the participant is lost to follow up. The best overall response recorded for each participant is reported.

* Complete Response: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm (the sum may not be "0" if there are target nodes)
* Partial Response: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, Start of cycle 3, start of cycle 5, and then the start of every subsequent cycle for the remainder of treatment. One cycle is 4 weeks. (approximately 3 years)
Number of Participants With Treatment Related Adverse Events, The number of participants that experience treatment related adverse events as assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4). Participants are evaluated for adverse events for the duration of treatment.Treatment continues until disease progression, treatment is considered a safety risk, physicians decision, withdrawal from the study, or until the participant is lost to follow up., From the start of treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study drug is received (approximately 5 years)|Overall Survival, The median overall duration of survival as measured from the start of treatment until the time of death due to any cause or until the participant is lost to follow-up., From the start of treatment until the time of death or loss to follow-up (approximately 7 years)|Disease Control Rate, The number of participants that achieve a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as their best overall response as evaluated using irRECIST (Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors). Participants are evaluated for response for the duration of treatment. Treatment continues until disease progression, treatment is considered a safety risk, physicians decision, withdrawal from the study, or until the participant is lost to follow up.

* CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm (the sum may not be "0" if there are target nodes)
* PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters
* SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study, Screening, start of cycle 3, start of cycle 5, and then the start of every subsequent 4-week cycle for the remainder of treatment (approximately 3 years)|Progression Free Survival, The median amount of time from the start of treatment until the the first documentation of radiographic disease progression (per irRECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who are alive with no documented disease progression by the data cutoff date for progression free survival analysis will be censored at the date of their last evaluable disease assessment.

â€¢ Prior Progressive Disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions may be considered progression.), From the start of treatment until the time of death or loss to follow-up, whichever occurs first (approximately 7 years)|Duration of Response, The median duration of time from first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression (per irRECIST). For participants who are alive and no documented progressive disease at the time of data cutoff for analysis, duration of response will be censored at the last evaluable disease assessment date., From first documentation of response to treatment until the time of disease progression (approximately 2 years)|Time to Disease Progression, The median duration of time from the start of treatment to the first documentation of radiographic disease progression (perirRECIST). Participants with no documented progressive disease by the data cutoff date for time to progression analysis will be censored at the date of their last evaluable disease assessment., From the start of treatment until the time of disease progression (approximately 7 years)
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of investigational drugs to learn whether the drugs work in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drugs are being studied.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

The FDA has not approved tremelimumab as a treatment for any disease.

Both durvalumab and tremelimumab are antibodies (proteins that work with the immune system) that target proteins produced by the cancer cells. These cancerous proteins suppress the immune system which allows the cancer cells to grow. The study drugs may target these cancerous proteins and stop the cancer cells from suppressing the immune system.

The investigators hope that the combination of these study drugs with radiation therapy will help stop the cancer cells from growing and spreading.
