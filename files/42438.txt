Real World Treatment Experience of Patients With Breast, Lung, Ovarian, Multiple Myeloma, or Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Using Remote Symptom Monitoring
The goal of this study is to create a data set to add to Carevive's registry from real world clinical and patient reported data collected using an electronic care planning system (CPS) with remote symptom monitoring that is used in routine care for cancer patients on active treatment.

Patients will complete a baseline survey in person using a secured device or remotely using their own electronic device in a location of their choice. Weekly electronic patient reported outcome (PRO) surveys are collected from the patients using the Carevive platform for a minimum of 12 weeks. Patients may continue weekly surveys as long as they are receiving treatment.
