Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) or Placebo With Chemoradiation in Participants With Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (MK-3475-412/KEYNOTE-412)
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab given concomitantly with chemoradiation (CRT) and as maintenance therapy versus placebo plus CRT in participants with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA HNSCC). The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab in combination with CRT is superior to placebo in combination with CRT with respect to event-free survival (EFS).
Head and Neck Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Accelerated Fractionation (AFX) Radiotherapy|RADIATION: Standard Fractionation (SFX) Radiotherapy
Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS is the time from date of randomization to the date of first record of any of the following events: death due to any cause; progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR) or biopsy as indicated for locoregional progression or recurrence or distant metastasis. As well as the first record of the following types of surgery: salvage surgery for persistent or residual disease at the primary tumor site requiring surgical removal when invasive cancer is present on final pathology; neck dissection or surgery (performed for clinical or radiological disease progression per RECIST 1.1) â‰¤ 20 weeks from end of CRT when invasive cancer is present; or neck dissection or surgery \>20 weeks from end of CRT when invasive cancer is present. From product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data., Up to approximately 62 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from randomization to death due to any cause, from product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The hypothesis was that pembrolizumab in combination with CRT is superior to placebo in combination with CRT; but based on the protocol, because the statistical criterion for success in the primary EFS hypothesis was not met, the OS hypothesis was not tested, Up to approximately 62 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study drug. An AE is any sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study therapy., From time of first dose of study treatment until 90 days after last dose (up to approximately 19 months)|Number of Participants Discontinuing Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study drug. An AE is any sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study therapy., From time of first dose of study treatment until the end of treatment (up to approximately 16 months)|Change From Baseline in Global Health Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QoL), The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) contains 30 items and measures five functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom items (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single items (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global health and QoL scale. Using linear transformation, raw scores are standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100, so that a higher score indicates a better overall GHS. A change from baseline of 10 points on the 100-point EORTC QLQ-C30 scale is considered as clinically relevant. Based on a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model with the patient reported outcomes (PRO) scores as the response variable with covariates for treatment, time, treatment by time interaction, and stratification factors of human papilloma virus (HPV) status and overall cancer stage., Prior to the first dose of study treatment (Baseline) and up to Week 45|Change From Baseline in Swallowing, Speech, and Pain Symptoms, EORTC QLQ Head and Neck Questionnaire (H\&N35) consists of 7 multi-item scales (pain in the mouth, problems with swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact, and sexuality), Raw scores were standardized by linear transformation so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more problems. Change from baseline in swallowing, speech, and pain symptoms was measured. A change from baseline of 10 points on the 100-point EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 is considered as clinically relevant. Based on a cLDA model with the PRO scores as the response variable with covariates for treatment, time, treatment by time interaction, and stratification factors of HPV status and overall cancer stage., Prior to the first dose of study treatment (Baseline) and up to Week 45|Change From Baseline in Physical Functioning, Participant responded to 5 questions from the EORTC QLQ-C30 about their physical functioning scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at All to 4=Very Much). Using linear transformation, raw scores were standardized, so that scores range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates a better quality of life. A change from baseline of 10 points on the 100-point scale is considered as clinically relevant. Based on a cLDA model with the PRO scores as the response variable with covariates for treatment, time, treatment by time interaction, and stratification factors of HPV status and overall cancer stage., Prior to the first dose of study treatment (Baseline) and up to Week 45
