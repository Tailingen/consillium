Short-course Radiation (SCRT) Followed by 6 Cycles of Cadonilimab Plus MFOLFOX6 As Neoadjuvant Therapy for Patients with Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer (LARC): a Multicenter, Two-arm Parallel, Open-label, Randomised Phase III Trial (NeoCaCRT-III)
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if neoadjuvant short-course radiation (SCRT) followed by 6 cycles of cadonilimab plus mFOLFOX6 works to treat patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). It will also learn about the safety of the combined regimen. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does the neoadjuvant SCRT plus dual immunotherapy and chemotherapy can improve pathological complete response(pCR) rate? What medical problems do participants have when receiving chemotherapy plus cadonilimab compared to chemotherapy only?

Participants will:

Receiving cadonilimab plus mFOLFOX6 or mFOLFOX6 every 2 weeks for 3 months Visit the clinic once every 2 weeks for checkups and tests
