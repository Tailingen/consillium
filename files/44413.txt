Imaging Study on Halcyon 4.0 System for Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy
This prospective imaging study is evaluating the feasibility of using the Halcyon 4.0 radiotherapy system for radiation therapy planning in patients with cancer. The Halcyon 4.0 system has been engineered to decrease the image acquisition time and the radiation exposure, but the system has not yet been clinically validated for use in radiation planning. This pilot study will evaluate images obtained on the Halcyon 4.0 system to assess if the quality is sufficient for radiation treatment plan construction.
Brain Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Lung Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Colon Cancer
DEVICE: Halcyon 4.0 system
Percentage of images that are of sufficient quality for patient primary treatment plan construction, If the treatment target and surrounding organs at risk can be visualized and contoured for treatment planning purposes and a treatment plan created that meets the stated objectives ( or better than the stated objectives), then the kV CBCT images will be deemed feasible., At 9 weeks
