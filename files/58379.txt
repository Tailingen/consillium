A Study of Giredestrant in Participants With Grade 1 Endometrial Cancer
This Phase II, global, single-arm study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of giredestrant monotherapy in participants with Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Giredestrant
Percentage of Participants Who Have Regression at 6 Months, The percentage of participants who have regression is defined as participants who have a decrease in the proportion of cancer in their endometrial biopsy or the proportion of cancer is not increased, but there is an increase in non-cancer/non-atypical hyperplasia at the 6-month assessment compared with baseline., Baseline, 6 Months|Number of Participants with at Least One Adverse Event, with Severity Determined According to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0), From Baseline until 30 days after the final dose of study drug (up to 1 year, 6 months)
Percentage of Participants Who Have Complete Regression at 6 Months, The percentage of participants who have complete regression is defined as participants having an assessment of 100% of non-cancer/non-atypical hyperplasia at the Month 6 assessment., Baseline, 6 Months|Median Duration of Regression, From first regression to first relapse (up to 1 year, 6 months)|Median Time to First Regression, From first study treatment to first regression (up to 1 year, 6 months)|Median Time to Relapse or Loss of Clinical Benefit, From first study treatment to relapse or loss of clinical benefit, whichever occurs first (up to 1 year, 6 months)|Plasma Concentration of Giredestrant at Specified Timepoints, Predose on Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6; 3-4 hours Postdose on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2 (each cycle is 28 days)
