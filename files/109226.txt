IL-2 PET Imaging in Advanced Solid Tumours
This is an investigator-initiated, single-center, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and PK of the PET tracer \[18F\]AlF-RESCA-IL2 in patients prior to and during treatment.
Metastatic Solid Tumor
OTHER: [18F]AlF-RESCA-IL2 PET scan
Incidence of adverse events related to [18F]-AlF-RESCA-IL2 administration as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Safety assessment through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory test results (if evaluation is indicated) and changes in vital signs. Adverse event data will be recorded and summarized according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, 2 years|Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND), To evaluate the pharmacokinetic behaviour of 18F-AIF-RESCA-IL2 through activity in venous blood samples, dynamic imaging, and pharmacokinetic modeling., 2 years|Total volume of distribution (VT) of the tracer in the tumour, To evaluate the pharmacokinetic behaviour of 18F-AIF-RESCA-IL2 through activity in venous blood samples, dynamic imaging, and pharmacokinetic modeling., 2 years|Biodistribution of [18F]-AlF-RESCA-IL2, Evaluation of \[18F\]AlF-RESCA-IL2 biodistribution in cancer patients on the PET images by measuring standardized uptake values in tumours, healthy tissues and organs., 2 years
Correlation of 18F-AlF-RESCA-IL2 uptake in tumours, with T cell infiltration in tumour biopsy samples, as determined by IHC., Results of immunohistochemical (IHC) scoring of immune cell IL-2R expression will be described as a semi-quantitative score using the percentage of positive cells (continuous variable), intensity and pattern of staining (discrete variable). These IHC results will be compared with imaging tracer standardized uptake value (SUV) in defined volumes of interest (VOIs) of tumor lesions on the PET scan images., 2 years|Correlation of 18F-AlF-RESCA-IL2 PET measurements with radiologic response to treatment, according to (i)RECIST v1.1 criteria., Response to therapy will be assessed according to the RECIST or iRECIST guidelines. These results will be compared with imaging tracer standardized uptake value (SUV) in defined volumes of interest (VOIs) of tumor lesions on the PET scan images., 2 years|Assessment of changes in tumour and normal organ tracer uptake after 2 weeks of treatment, expressed as standardized uptake values., Patients will undergo a PET scan at baseline and another one during treatment. tracer uptake will be quantified and expressed as standardized uptake value (SUV) in defined volumes of interest (VOIs) for both scans. The results of both PET scans will be compared to assess changes in imaging tracer uptake over time., 2 years
