Different Radiation Dose of Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation for Resectable Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Carcinoma
Esophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, while more than half new cases and deaths occurred in China. Surgery is the main curative treatment for this disease, the 5-year survival of EC remains poor, since most diseases are diagnosed at advanced stages.

In last decades, several large clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery can significantly increase the overall survival of patients with EC compared with surgery alone, while no effect of nCRT was apparent on postoperative health-related quality of life . However, the optimal radiation dose and surgery timing are still unknown.

The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive higher dose (50.4Gy/28F) of neoadjuvant chemoradiation will have better pathologic response and progress-free survival compared to lower dose (41.4Gy/23F) of chemoradiation followed by surgery.
Esophageal Carcinoma|Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy|Surgery
RADIATION: Higher dose (50.4Gy/28F) of neoadjuvant chemoradiation|RADIATION: Lower dose (41.4Gy/23F) of neoadjuvant chemoradiation
Progression free survival, Time from randomization to tumor progression or any deaths, 2 year
R0 resection rate in each arm, no cancer cells seen microscopically at the resection margin, analysis is completed 4 weeks after surgery|Complete pathological response rate, using the Chirieac grading system, analysis is completed 4 weeks after surgery|Postoperative complications in each study arm, According to the NCI CTC3.0, 30 and 90 days after surgery|Treatment failure pattern, including local recurrence or distant metastasis or both, 2 year|Overall survival, by intention to treat and per protocol analyses in each study arm, 5 year
