Evaluating the Impact of Baduanjin Exercise Intervention on Quality of Life in Breast Cancer Survivors Receiving Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy
A 12-week randomized controlled trail was conducted in 72 Chinese breast cancer survivors who had received aromatase inhibitors treatment for more than 6 months. All participants were assigned to either 12 weeks of Baduanjin classes which involved to two 90-minute sessions per week or a wait-list control. Participants completed fitness assessments, measurements of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinﬂammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β(IL-1β) ,C-reactive protein (CRP) ，BMI，BMD and questionnaires to measure QoL, fatigue, sleep quality, Aromatase Inhibitor-Induced Arthralgia, symptoms of climacteric syndrome were completed at baseline and 3 months.
