Stereotactic Radiotherapy in Association With Immunotherapy for the Treatment of NSCLC Brain Metastases
The study's primary objective is the evaluation of toxicities reported during RS or HFSRT in patients with brain metastases from NSCLC undergoing immunotherapy (Safety), with particular reference to the rate of symptomatic radionecrosis and intralesional hemorrhage. Others primary objectives of the study are the Feasibility and the intracranial control of the disease, both local (site radiotherapy treatment) and at a distance (intracranial, but at a distance from the site of the disease treated with stereotaxic radiotherapy). The secondary objectives concern quality assessment of life of the patients under study (Quality Of Life, QoL).
