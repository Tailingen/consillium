Investigator Initiated Trial to Further Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Trans-perineal Focal Laser Ablation of Localized Prostate Cancer Using High Frequency Micro-ultrasound Imaging
Trans-perineal focal laser ablation represents a promising alternative focal therapy option for patients with low-risk or favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer. FLA has been extensively utilized for over a decade in the treatment of PCa using different anatomical approaches. The proposed study differs from past ones in that a trans-perineal approach with reduced risk of infection will be used in contrast to the current trans-rectal approach. In addition, high frequency micro-ultrasound imaging will be used to enhance imaging and facilitate accurate needle placement and FLA of the index lesions.

The aim of this study is to evaluate FLA as a potential optimal therapeutic intervention based on safety, ease of use, efficacy, and cost.1 FLA holds promise for the management of localized tumors. The combination of the trans-perineal focal laser ablation and micro-ultrasound imaging will enable targeted trans-perineal fusion laser induced thermal therapy of prostate cancer lesions. This approach offers significant potential advantages over traditional interventions including:

* Improved dynamic ultrasound imaging of the lesion to be treated compared to traditional ultrasound techniques.
* Enhanced ability to visualize and spare critical structures within the prostate, including the bladder neck, neurovascular bundle (NVB), urethral sphincter and organs in close proximity including the rectum.
* Sparing these structures should translate into improved preservation of ejaculation, limited changes in sexual function and minimal transient incontinence following treatment.

Safety and Tolerability: Number of Adverse Events Related to the Treatment, AE and SAE will be evaluated during all visits using the CTCAE scale. Grade 3 or greater AEs based on the CTCAE v5.0 within 5 days post procedure will be considered severe and related to the study procedure., 12 months
Efficacy: Extent of Tumor Ablation by Laser Application, To evaluate the efficacy of FLA in ablating the index tumor lesion, as well as clinical outcomes: erectile and sexual function and urinary control. Volumetric changes in prostate lesions, prostate size and cancer control in treated areas assessed by mpMRI and prostate needle biopsy. Determine the presence or absence of csPCa in the index lesion ablation zone at the 12 month post procedure biopsy. Evaluate the ability of high frequency micro-ultrasound imaging to identify the mpMRI detected index lesion in the prostate. Evaluate the ability of micro-ultrasound to image the index lesion ablation size and compare ablation sizes using post procedure MRI. Evaluate duration of treatment using trans-perineal focal laser ablation., 12 months
Device: TRANBERG® Transperineal Micro Ultrasound guided laser ablation of Prostate Cancer A perineal local anesthesia block is performed with the patient in lithotomy. The micro-ultrasound, secured to a digital stepper, is inserted and advanced. The live ultrasound image is displayed on the micro-ultrasound machine. The urologist advances the laser fiber introducer, temperature probes, and laser fiber to desired positions in the prostate using micro-ultrasound guidance. One laser fiber will be used for single or multiple treatment applications.

Target treatment is achieved once the laser applicator position is confirmed. The urologist will instruct on the desired treatment parameters to be entered into the TRANBERG® console. Real-time monitoring of the ablation zone will be done using the micro-ultrasound and temperature probes. Once the individual treatment has been completed, the applicator will be relocated to the next location, if necessary. Patients will be discharged home with instructions and contact information once stable.

Primary Outcome Measures:

The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety \& tolerability of a tandem approach using micro-ultrasound imaging for FLA in patients with organ confined localized low or favorable intermediate risk Prostate Cancer.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of FLA in ablating the index tumor lesion, as well as clinical outcomes: erectile and sexual function as well as urinary control. In addition, volumetric changes in prostate lesions, prostate size as well as cancer control in treated areas will be assessed by both imaging (mpMRI) and pathology (prostate needle biopsy). Additional secondary objectives include:

* Determine the presence or absence of csPCa in the index lesion ablation zone (in- treatment field) at the 12 month post procedure biopsy.
* Evaluate the ability of high frequency micro-ultrasound imaging to identify the mpMRI. detected index lesion in the prostate.
* Evaluate the ability of micro-ultrasound to image the index lesion ablation size and compare ablation sizes using post procedure MRI.
* Determine the cost-benefit effectiveness of the treatment with trans-perineal focal laser ablation in office treatment under local anesthesia supplement with Nitrous Oxide sedation.
* Evaluate duration of treatment using trans-perineal focal laser ablation.
