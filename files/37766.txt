Exercise Prehabilitation Among Older Patients With Hematological Malignancies Preparing For CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy
The purpose of the study is to evaluate an exercise program for individuals preparing for Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy for hematological malignancies.
Lymphoma|Leukemia|Myeloma
BEHAVIORAL: Resistance Training|BEHAVIORAL: Aerobic Exercise|BEHAVIORAL: Optional Aerobic Exercise Procedure|RADIATION: Optional In-Person Exercise Sessions
Percentage of Participants that Enroll and Consent - Enrollment Feasibility, Enrollment will be considered feasible if ≥60% of eligible and approached patients actually consent and enroll, Up to 12 Months|Percentage of Participants that Complete Study Assessments - Retention Feasibility, Retention will be considered feasible if ≥70% of participants complete study measures, Up to 3 Months|Adherence - Feasibility, Adherence will be based on participants attending ≥ 70% of tele-RT sessions on average and performing ≥ 70% of prescribed moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, Up to 3 Months|Participant Evaluation of Feasibility and Acceptability - Acceptability, Participants evaluation of feasibility and acceptability will be assessed with a questionnaire, adapted to fit the intervention. The questionnaire includes both Likert Scale and open-ended questions. An item-by-item basis and as average item score, with scores ≥4 ("agree" to "strongly agree") indicating acceptability. Open-ended responses will be analyzed qualitatively to inform intervention improvement., Up to 3 Months|Participant Self-Reported Musculoskeletal Injuries - Safety, The numerator of the safety variable will be the number of musculoskeletal injuries or adverse health events reported as "likely related" or "definitely related" the exercise programming and that caused at least some limitation of daily activity lasting more than 3 days. The denominator of the safety variable will be the number of exercise sessions performed by the participant (tele-resistance training plus aerobic exercise sessions lasting ≥10 minutes). The intervention will be considered safe if the rate of musculoskeletal injuries (i.e., muscle strains or pulls, sprains, exacerbated bone pain, fractures or breaks, or other adverse health events incurred during exercise sessions) is lower than the published metric of 11.9 injuries per 1000 sessions, as used as a benchmark in previous exercise oncology research, Up to 3 Months|Objective physical functioning and fitness - Baseline, Physical functioning and fitness will be assessed using the 30-second chair stand test,30-second arm curl test, and treadmill 6-minute walk test., At Baseline|Objective physical functioning and fitness - Follow-up, Physical functioning and fitness will be assessed using the 30-second chair stand test,30-second arm curl test, and treadmill 6-minute walk test., Up to 3 Months|Participant Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) - Baseline, Participants SMI will be measured using Tomovision SliceOMatic software and clinical, computerized tomography (CT) scans, Baseline|Participant Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) - Follow-up, Participants SMI will be measured using Tomovision SliceOMatic software and clinical, computerized tomography (CT) scans, After CAR-T Therapy, Up to 6 Months|Participants Health-Related Quality of Life - Baseline, Participants health-related quality of life will be measured using the 12-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Survey, Baseline|Participants Health-Related Quality of Life - At 3 Months, Participants health-related quality of life will be measured using the 12-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Survey, Up to 3 Months|Participants Health-Related Quality of Life - At 6 Months, Participants health-related quality of life will be measured using the 12-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Survey, Up to 6 Months|Participant Self Reported Exercise - Baseline, Participant self-reported exercise will be measured using a modified Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire to assess both aerobic and resistance exercise, Baseline|Participant Self Reported Exercise - At 3 Months, Participant self-reported exercise will be measured using a modified Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire to assess both aerobic and resistance exercise, Up to 3 Months|Participant Self Reported Exercise - At 6 Months, Participant self-reported exercise will be measured using a modified Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire to assess both aerobic and resistance exercise, Up to 6 Months
