A Study Evaluating FT-SW in Unilateral Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema Patients
The objective of the study is to demonstrate equivalency in treatment effect, as determined by objective measurements, between the modified therapy cycle software and the FDA-cleared Flexitouch therapy cycle software.

DEVICE: Flexitouch Plus|DEVICE: Flexitouch Plus FT with software modification
Lymphatic Activation, Comparison of the change in the rate of lymphatic propulsion events from the pre-treatment values to the post-treatment values for both the affected and contralateral limbs using the investigational technique of near infrared-fluorescent (NIRF) imaging., Baseline and following a single treatment, an average of one hour|Changes in Swelling - MoistureMeterD, Comparison of the percent change in local tissue water from the pre-treatment values to the post-treatment values on the affected limb using MoistureMeterD., Baseline and following a single treatment, an average of one hour|Changes in Swelling - Perometry, Swelling in the affected and contralateral limb as assessed using local tissue water content, Baseline and following a single treatment, an average of one hour|Percent Change in Skin Thickness From Baseline to After Treatment., Skin changes on the affected and contralateral limb as assessed by skin thickness (Ultrasound)., Baseline and following a single treatment, an average of one hour|Incidence of Adverse Events, Adverse events reported between treatment and the 24-hour follow-up, 24-Hour Follow-Up|Post-Treatment Functional Vessel Assessment Via Near Infrared-fluorescent (NIRF) Imaging, Comparison of the number of subjects with an increase in vessels for both the affected and contralateral limbs via near infrared-fluorescent (NIRF) imaging., Baseline and following a single treatment, an average of one hour|Projected Area or Extent of Dermal Backflow Via Near Infrared-fluorescent (NIRF) Imaging, Comparison of the change in dermal backflow from the pre-treatment values to the post-treatment values as the sum of the volume of area for all locations for both the affected and contralateral limbs via near infrared-fluorescent (NIRF) imaging, Baseline and following a single treatment, an average of one hour|Swelling in the Affected and Contralateral Limb as Assessed Using: Perometry (LymphaTech 3D Scanner), Compare the percent of participants by arm demonstrating a decrease in limb volume for the affected and contralateral limbs via Perometry (LymphaTech 3D Scanner), Baseline and following a single treatment, an average of one hour|Skin Changes on the Affected and Contralateral Limb as Assessed by: Skin Thickness (Ultrasound), Comparison of the percent of participants by arm demonstrating a decrease in thickness for each site, separating skin and subcutaneous changes, on the affected limb via Ultrasound, Baseline and following a single treatment, an average of one hour|Absolute Change in Skin Thickness From Baseline to After Treatment, Skin Changes on the affected and contralateral limb as assessed by skin thickness (Ultrasound)., Baseline and following a single treatment, an average of one hour.
