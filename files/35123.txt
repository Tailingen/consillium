Effects of Resistance and Endurance Training in Pediatric Cancer Patients During Intensive Treatment Phase
The purpose of this study is to determine whether combined endurance and resistance training can improve muscle strength in children and adolescents with cancer during the intensive treatment phase.
Pediatric Oncology
BEHAVIORAL: Exercise Training
Muscle strength: lower limb, Lower limb muscle strength measured by the load (kg) sustained in one repetition maximum test, Six weeks (pre-post intervention)
Muscle strength: upper limb, Upper limb muscle strength measured by the load (kg) sustained in one repetition maximum test, Six weeks (pre-post intervention)|Biomarker in Blood, Immune status and metabolic status, At the beginning of the intervention and three and six weeks after the beginning. Comparing the two time points inbetween study groups|Body composition, Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis, Six weeks (pre-post intervention)|Six-minute-walk performance, Six weeks (pre-post intervention)|Fatigue, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, six weeks (pre-post intervention)|Quality of Life, KINDL: health related quality of life questionnaire, Six weeks (pre-post intervention)|Cardiorespiratory performance, Ergospirometry, Six weeks (pre-post intervention)
