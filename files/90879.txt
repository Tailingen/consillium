A Phase 1 Clinical Study of NXP800 in Subjects with Advanced Cancers and Expansion in Subjects with Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of the dose escalation phase is to evaluate the safety profile of escalating doses and dose schedules of NXP800. In the expansion phase the preliminary efficacy in subjects with ARID1a mutated ovarian clear cell and ovarian endometrioid cancers will be estimated.

DRUG: NXP800
Part A: Number of patients with treatment related adverse events, clinical laboratory abnormalities, dose limiting toxicities, Day 28|Part B: Estimates of disease response by RECIST v 1.1, Baseline to 30 days post last dose of NXP800|Part B: Number of patients with treatment related adverse events, and/or clinical laboratory abnormalities., Baseline to 30 days post last dose of NXP800
Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of NXP800, First dose through Day 29|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of NXP800, First dose through Day 29|Time to peak concentration (Tmax) of NXP800, First dose through Day 29|Half-life (T1/2) of NXP800, First dose through Day 29
Part A of the study is a dose escalation by cohort study of NXP800 administered to patients with advanced cancers. The study will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and propose dose and dose schedules for future studies.

In Part B doses selected in Part A are administered to patients with platinum-resistant, ARID1a-mutated ovarian carcinoma.
