TGR-1202 Alone and in Combination With Either Nab-paclitaxel + Gemcitabine or With FOLFOX in Patients With Select Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 multi-center study to assess the safety and efficacy of TGR-1202 as a single agent or in combination with nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine or with FOLFOX in patients with select relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

TGR-1202 will be evaluated alone or in combination with nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine or with FOLFOX in patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, adenocarcinoma of the colon, rectum, gastric and GE junction cancer, and GI Stromal Tumor (GIST) who have relapsed from or are refractory to prior treatment.
