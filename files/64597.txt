Breast Radiotherapy Audio Visual Enhancement for Sparing the Heart
This study investigates the Breathe Well device to test whether it is superior to the existing treatment standard of the Varian Realtime Position Management (RPM) system in assisting patients with deep inspiration breath hold.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Breathe Well|DEVICE: RPM
Accuracy of Breathe Well, The accuracy will be measured by comparing 'Breathe Well' and RPM measurements with images acquired of the breast during the radiation treatment using an electronic portal imaging device (EPID)., 2 years
Difference in set up times for Breathe Well vs RPM, The setup times for both systems, the 'Breathe Well' and the modified RPM system; will be measured for all fractions., 2 years|Patient comfort, To investigate patient comfort in using 'Breathe Well' via a patient survey., 2 years|Staff perception of Breathe Well, To investigate staff perception of 'Breathe Well' via a technology assessment survey., 2 years|To develop the use of EPID for real time MLC tracking during breast radiotherapy, 2 years|To compare actual and planned doses, Using dose reconstruction estimate the dose distribution delivered during radiotherapy and compare this with the planned dose., 2 years
Recent studies have demonstrated an increased risks of cardiac disease in breast cancer radiotherapy patients. For patients diagnosed \<50 years old, the risks for cardiovascular diseases/events were increased by 24-82% comparing left and right breast radiotherapy. The deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) technique addresses this problem by reducing the heart dose by up to half, thus potentially reducing the increased rate of major coronary events by 20%. Providing patients with visual feedback in addition to audio guidance has been demonstrated to improve the reproducibility of the DIBH technique by 95% and stability by 80%.

Breathe Well is a new audiovisual feedback device that may increase the accuracy and workflow of implementing DIBH for breast cancer patients.
