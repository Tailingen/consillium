Accuracy of Convex Probe EBUS-TBNA Versus FDG-PET/CT Imaging in Diagnosis and Staging of Lung Malignancies
Lung cancer is a prevalent cause of cancer-related mortality on a global scale. Appropriate staging of lung cancer is of paramount importance, as it customizes treatment and predicts prognosis. Fludeoxyglucose-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) combined with low dose contrast computed tomography (CT) and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are two diagnostic modalities widely used in the field of staging \& diagnosis of lung malignancies, the former depends on image analysis while the later enables real-time sampling of lymph nodes under sonographic guidance with concurrent cytological examination. The present research aims to compare the diagnostic and staging accuracies of (EBUS-TBNA) versus FDG-PET /CT as two diagnostic modalities in patients with suspected lung malignancies. However as a secondary outcome this study aims at monitoring the possible complications arising post EBUS-TBNA procedure.
Lung Malignancies|Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Endo bronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration(EBUS-TBNA)
Comparing the diagnostic accuracies of both EBUS TBNA and FDG-PET /CT, Comparing the diagnostic yield of both modalies as they are considered primary main diagnostic and staging modalities for lung malignancies, 2 years|Comparing the staging accuracies of both convex probe EBUS-TBNA versus FDG - PET/CT, Accurate staging of lung malignancies is considered crucial in determining the prognosis and specifying the treatment plan., 2 years
Determine the complications, EBUS TBNA is a minimally invasive procedure having a very low rate of complications compared to mediastinoscopy, this study aims to monitor complications (if present), 2 years

Objective: To compare the diagnostic and staging accuracy of convex probe EBUS-TBNA versus FDG - PET/CT as two diagnostic modalities in diagnosis of suspected lung cancer \& staging of concurrent mediastinal lymphadenopathy Patients and Methods: This prospective, interventional cohort research was performed on 40 cases with suspected lung malignancies. All cases were examined via FDG-PET/CT followed by convex probe EBUS-TBNA for diagnosis of suspected lung cancer \& staging of concurrent mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
