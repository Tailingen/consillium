Study of ES414 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The study will be conducted in 2 Stages. The primary objective of Stage 1 of the study is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ES414 administered intravenously to patients with mCRPC. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity, cytokine response, and clinical activity of ES414.

The primary objective of Stage 2 of the study is to evaluate the clinical activity of ES414 in patients that have or have not received prior chemotherapy. Secondary objectives are to further characterize the safety profile, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of ES414.
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: ES414
Maximum Tolerated Dose of ES414, Identify the maximum tolerated dose in dose-escalation stage (Stage 1) by assessment of dose-limiting toxicities, during first 28 days of treatment
Safety Profile of ES414, The safety profile of ES414 will be assessed by monitoring incidence and severity of adverse events, Patients will be followed for the duration of treatment, an expected average of 6 months, and for 28 days following last treatment|Maximum Serum Drug Concentration (Cmax), Blood samples will be obtained from all patients for determination of the maximum serum concentration of ES414., Pre- and post-infusion at least weekly during first 28-day cycle, and on Days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles for an expected duration of 6 months, and for up to 8 weeks following last treatment|Area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC), Blood samples will be obtained from all patients for determination of the AUC of ES414., Pre- and post-infusion at least weekly during first 28-day cycle, and on Days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles for an expected duration of 6 months, and for up to 8 weeks following last treatment|Elimination half-life (T1/2), Blood samples will be obtained from all patients for determination of the T1/2 of ES414., Pre- and post-infusion at least weekly during first 28-day cycle, and on Days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles for an expected duration of 6 months, and for up to 8 weeks following last treatment|Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC), Investigator measurements of target lesions, Baseline and 6 months|Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), Investigator measurements of target lesions, Baseline and 6 months|Pharmacodynamics of ES414, Blood samples will be collected from all patients and evaluated by flow cytometry for changes in lymphocytes, Patients will be followed for the duration of treatment, an expected average of 6 months, and for 28 days following last treatment|PSA Response, Blood samples will be collected from all patients and tested for PSA, Baseline and 6 months|Circulating Tumor Cells, Blood samples will be collected from all patients and evaluated for the number of circulating tumor cells, Patients will be followed for the duration of treatment, an expected average of 6 months, and for 28 days following last treatment|Immunogenicity of ES414, Blood samples will be collected from all patients and tested for antibody formation to ES414., Patients will be followed for the duration of treatment, an expected average of 6 months, and for 8 weeks following last treatment
Stage 1 - Dose Escalation: The dose escalation stage of the study will test weekly doses of 0.2 mcg/kg to 300 mcg/kg over 9 dose levels (cohorts). Cohorts 1 to 3 consist of single patients and Cohorts 4 - 9 will consist of a minimum of 3 patients; an additional 3 patients may be added to the cohort if adverse events possibly related to ES414 or dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) occur. The next dose cohort will only enroll after the patient(s) in the current dose cohort have completed the first cycle of dosing (4 weeks) with no significant adverse events or DLTs. Six patients will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and this dose will be used for Stage 2.

Stage 2 - Expansion: The continuous intravenous infusion MTD dose regimen will be further examined in 2 expansion cohorts; the first cohort are patients that have received prior chemotherapy, such as docetaxel for mCRPC, and the second cohort are those that have not received prior chemotherapy for mCRPC. Serum samples will be collected for serial PK assessment for ES414 drug levels and antibody formation. Response will be assessed every 2 months during the first 6 months of treatment and then every 3 months until progression of mCRPC, intolerable side effects, or withdrawal of consent.
