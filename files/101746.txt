Brentuximab Vedotin With or Without Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CD30+ Lymphoma
This phase II pilot trial studies how well brentuximab vedotin with or without nivolumab works in treating patients with CD30+ lymphoma that has come back after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Biological therapies, such as brentuximab vedotin, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving brentuximab vedotin with or without nivolumab may work better in treating patients with CD30+ lymphoma.

Overall response rate as measured by the Cheson 2007 criteria, No formal statistical measures will be pre-specified. This protocol will be deemed a "success" if the absolute response rate in this group of patients is ≥20% in Arm A or ≥40% in Arm B., For Arm A: Up to 5 weeks after completion of study treatment. For Arm B: within 6 months following treatment.
OUTLINE:

ARM A (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL): Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM B: Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-5 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4 years.
