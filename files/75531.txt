A Study of SCG101 in the Treatment of Subjects With Hepatitis B Virus-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This Phase 1/ 2a study is a multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SCG101 in subjects with hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatitis B Virus Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrent
BIOLOGICAL: SCG101
Safety and tolerability of SCG101, Based on incidence of adverse events (AE) using NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Start of SCG101 infusion until 100 days post SCG101 infusion|Tumor response of SCG101 (Phase 2), Start of SCG101 infusion until a complate response or partial response is observed, disease progression, and long term survival follow up up to 15 years
Preliminary clinical efficacy of SCG101, Objective response rate, Start of SCG101 infusion until a complete response or partial response is observed after 28 days from SCG101 infusion.|Antiviral activity before and after SCG101 infusion, Based on changes in serum levels of HBsAg, Start of SCG101 infusion and throughout DLT and PFS until disease progression, an average of 24 months.|Change in pharmacodynamic markers (PD) before and after SCG101 infusion, Based on changes in serum from the liver function, Start of SCG101 infusion and throughout DLT and PFS until disease progression, an average of 24 months.|Persistence of viral vector copy number (VCN) after SCG101 infusion, Start of SCG101 infusion until disease progression, an average of 24 months.
This study will be conducted in 2 parts: In Phase 1 dose escalation, cohorts of 3-6 subjects each will be sequentially assigned to escalating dose level of SCG101. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be selected based on the safety, PK/ PD and antitumor activities if the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not reached from the planned dose levels.

In Phase 2a, subjects will be enrolled to characterize the safety and evaluate the efficacy of SCG101.
