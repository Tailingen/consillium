Savolitinib Plus Durvalumab Versus Sunitinib and Durvalumab Monotherapy in MET-Driven, Unresectable and Locally Advanced or Metastatic PRCC
A clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of savolitinib plus durvalumab versus sunitinib in MET-driven (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), unresectable and locally advanced or metastatic PRCC (Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma).
Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: savolitinib|DRUG: durvalumab|DRUG: sunitinib

This is a Phase III, randomised, open label, 3 arm, multi-centre, international study assessing the efficacy and safety of savolitinib plus durvalumab compared with sunitinib in participants with MET-driven (without co-occurring FH mutations), unresectable and locally advanced or metastatic PRCC, who have not received any prior systemic anti-cancer therapy in the metastatic setting. The study will also investigate the contribution of durvalumab to the savolitinib plus durvalumab combination.

Approximately 200 participants will be randomised in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of the following intervention groups: savolitinib (600mg, oral, once daily) plus durvalumab (1500mg IV Q4W), sunitinib (50mg, oral, once daily for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a sunitinib-free interval of 2-weeks, Q6W), or durvalumab monotherapy (1500mg IV Q4W).

Participants will continue to receive study intervention until objective radiological PD per RECIST 1.1 is assessed by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity occurs, consent is withdrawn or another discontinuation criterion is met.

Depending on the preferred subsequent therapy, participants randomised to the durvalumab monotherapy arm will be eligible to switch to receive savolitinib in combination with durvalumab at the time of objective radiological PD assessed by BICR per RECIST 1.1, without any intervening systemic anti-cancer therapy following discontinuation of durvalumab monotherapy.
