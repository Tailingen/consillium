Efficiency and Safety of Different Treatment Strategies in Adults With Pituitary Adenomas With Hypothalamic Involvement
Prospective and randomized evaluate efficiency and safety of different treatment strategies for hypothalamus-invading pituitary adenomas (HIPA)
Pituitary Adenoma
PROCEDURE: Total resection|PROCEDURE: Staged resection|PROCEDURE: Subtotal resection followed by stereotactic radiation therapy
Change of QoL (Quality of Life, EQ-5D) for the first surgery, EQ-5D will be evaluated before the first surgery and after the first surgery in 2 years, baseline (before the first surgery), 2 years after the first surgery|Change of QoL (Quality of Life, EQ-5D) for the second intervention, EQ-5D will be evaluated before the second intervention and after the second intervention in 3 months, baseline (before the second intervention), 3 months after the second intervention
Change of Visual Acuity statue, Visual Acuity statue will be evaluated using Snellen's chart before the first surgery and after the first surgery in 2 years, baseline (before the first surgery), 2 years after the first surgery|Change of Visual Field statue, Visual Field statue will be evaluated using a Humphrey visual field analyser before the first surgery and after the first surgery in 2 years, baseline (before the first surgery), 2 years after the first surgery|Change of Hormone Replacement Therapy, Whether the Hormone Replacement Therapy was used (Yes or No) before the first surgery and after the first surgery in 2 years, baseline (before the first surgery), 2 years after the first surgery|Extent of resection, Volumetric analysis of tumor volume before the first surgery, intraoperatively and 3 months and 2 years after the first surgery will be performed. In addition, Tumor volume will be evaluated before the second intervention and intraoperatively. Gross total resection is defined as no tumor present in gadolinium enhanced T1 sequences., baseline (before the first surgery), 2 years after the first surgery
There are various treatment strategies for hypothalamus-invading pituitary adenomas (HIPA), such as total resection (TR), subtotal resection with radiosurgery (STR+RS), etc. However,the optimal treatment of HIPA is still controversial. In this study, we want to evaluate the efficiency and safety of different treatment strategies in adults with HIPA.
