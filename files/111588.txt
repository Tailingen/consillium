Erivedge (Vismodegib) in the Treatment of Pediatric Patients With Refractory Pontine Glioma
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate an investigational drug (Vismodegib) for Pontine Glioma that is growing or has come back (reoccurred). This study will look at the tumors response to the study drug, Vismodegib, and will also look at the safety and tolerability of Vismodegib.

Vismodegib has been tested in multiple adult clinical trials and one pediatric trial. Laboratory testing in pontine gliomas suggests that this drug may be effective in treating this disease.
Pontine Glioma
DRUG: Vismodegib
Number of Days Participants Experienced Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or the appearance of new lesions., 5 years
Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, To determine the safety and tolerability of Vismodegib as a single agent in pediatric and young adult patients with refractory or recurrent pontine glioma, 2 years|Determine the Median Overall Survival (OS) of Participants, Overall Survival (OS) and clinical benefit (ORR + stable disease, SD), 2 years|Evaluate the Impact of Quality of Life of Children Receiving Vismodegib Using PedsQL Questionnaires, Evaluate the impact of Quality of Life of children receiving Vismodegib using PedsQL questionnaires, 2 years|Determine the Response Rates of Participants Based on Activation (or no Activation) of Their Hedgehog Signaling Pathway, To determine the objective response rates (partial and complete response) for patients without and with evidence of activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway in their tumors, 3 years
