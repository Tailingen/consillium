Clinical Study on Safety and Efficacy of Anti-CLL1 /+CD33 CAR T Cells in the Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a single-center, single-arm, open, intravenous drug administration of the safety and efficacy of clinical study.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CLL1/+CD33 CAR-T
Changes in cytokine level after CLL1/+CD33 CAR-T infusion, Calculate the change of cytokine level in peripheral blood by flow cytometry after CAR-T infusion., CAR T cell infusion before and 12 months after infusion|The change characteristics of chimeric antigen receptor(CAR)-T cell number in patients after infusion., Track CAR-T cells expansion in patients after infusion by flow cytometry, CAR T cell infusion before and 12 months after infusion|The change characteristics of chimeric antigen receptor(CAR)-T cell copy number in patients after infusion., Track CAR-T cells expansion in patients after infusion by Real-time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction（qPCR）, CAR T cell infusion before and 12 months after infusion
Event-free survival, Counting from the beginning of cell transfusion until treatment failure, recurrence, or death (various causes). Subjects without any of these events were counted up to the last follow-up examination date. For patients without CR or CRi, EFS is calculated from the beginning of cell transfusion until disease progression or death. Based on the initial event., Up to 12 months after CLL1/+CD33 CAR-T infusion|Overall survival, Death from any cause from the beginning of cell transfusion, Up to 12 months after CLL1/+CD33 CAR-T infusion|Duration of Overall Response, The time from the start of cell infusion when CR or PR is first achieved to disease progression., Up to 12 months after CLL1/+CD33 CAR-T infusion|MRD negative rate, The rate of MRD negative subjects was determined by flow cytometry., Up to 12 months after CLL1/+CD33 CAR-T infusion
The primary objective of the clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single dose infusion of anti-CLL1 /+CD33 CAR T cells in patients with refractory/recurrent acute myeloid leukemia. A total of about 5 patients with refractory/recurrent acute myeloid leukemia were enrolled in this study, and the target dose range was 1.00\~2.50x10\^6/kgCAR-positive T cells.
