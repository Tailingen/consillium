A Study of ASP-1929 Photoimmunotherapy in Combination With Pembrolizumab in First-line Treatment of Locoregional Recurrent Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck With No Distant Metastases
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if ASP-1929 photoimmunotherapy (PIT) in combination with pembrolizumab works to treat recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (HNSCC) with no distant metastases. It will also learn about the safety of ASP-1929 PIT in combination with pembrolizumab.

Researchers will compare ASP-1929 PIT in combination with pembrolizumab to pembrolizumab alone or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin or cisplatin, plus 5-fluorouracil or paclitaxel or docetaxel) according to physician's choice (control arm).

The overall primary study hypothesis being tested is whether ASP-1929 PIT plus pembrolizumab combination treatment improves the overall survival (OS) of the population defined by the inclusion/exclusion criteria over the control arm.

In addition, any serious AE with an onset date more than 30 days after the last dose of study treatment assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment will be considered a TEAE., Up to approximately 48 months|Proportion of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) by CTCAE v5.0, Any TEAE (defined in Outcome 10) for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational treatment caused the adverse event., Up to approximately 48 months|Proportion of serious adverse events (SAEs) by CTCAE v5.0, An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered 'serious' if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it meets one or more of the following criteria (21 CFR 312.32 (a)): Results in death, Is life-threatening, Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or Important medical event., Up to approximately 48 months|Quality of Life assessment: EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire- Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Each scale or item score is standardized to a range of 0 to 100. Higher scores on the functional scales reflect better functioning, whereas higher scores on the symptom scales indicate more severe symptoms or greater levels of distress. Similarly, higher scores on the global health status scale denote better overall health and quality of life. Thus, an optimal quality of life profile is characterized by high scores on the functional and global health status scales, combined with low scores on the symptom scales. The summed scores of Functional scales, Symptom scales, and Global health status domains of EORTC-QLQ-C30 are compared between treatment arms., Up to approximately 28 months|Quality of Life assessment: EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Module (QLQ-H&N35), EORTC QLQ-H\&N35 is a 35-item questionnaire developed to assess QoL of head and neck cancer participants and consists of 7 multi-item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact and sexuality. Each scale or item score is standardized to a range of 0 to 100. Lower score on each scale represents fewer symptoms and less impact on the patient's daily life. The summed scores of the scales of EORTC-QLQ-H\&N35 are compared between treatment arms., Up to approximately 28 months|Population pharmacokinetics (PK) - Clearance (Experimental Arm Only), A structural compartment model with population factors such as age, race, ECOG, and sex will be utilized to analyze concentration levels. The clearance estimates associated with different factors will be reported., Before the start of 1st ASP-1929 infusion, 0.25 hours, 4 hours, 24 hours, 192 hours, 360 hours after end of 1st infusion; same timepoints for 2nd ASP-1929 infusion|Presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) (Experimental Arm Only), Average concentration level of ADAs at baseline and 15 days after ASP-1929 infusion for the first 2 treatments., Before the start of 1st ASP-1929 infusion, 15 days after end of 1st infusion; same timepoints for 2nd ASP-1929 infusion
This is a phase 3 multicenter, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ASP-1929 photoimmunotherapy (PIT) in combination with pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab-based standard of care (SOC) as first-line treatment of locoregional recurrent HNSCC in patients with no distant metastases.

Patients will be enrolled into the study starting with 3 treatment arms, ASP-1929 PIT at doses of 320 mg/m\^2 or 640 mg/m\^2 in combination with pembrolizumab treatment arms or a SOC treatment arm in which patients may receive pembrolizumab alone or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy according to physician's choice.

Treatment assignment within the SOC treatment arm will be based on the decision of the site investigator. To ensure that the SOC treatment arm is appropriately balanced, a 50% enrollment cap will be imposed on pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, so that approximately the same number of patients will have been treated within each category.

At the start of the study all patients will be randomized 2:2:1 ratio to ASP-1929 PIT 320 mg/m\^2 plus pembrolizumab versus ASP-1929 PIT 640 mg/m\^2 plus pembrolizumab versus SOC (pembrolizumab alone or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy according to physician's choice).

An interim analysis (IA) will be conducted for this study as part of the dose optimization process. Patient enrollment will continue during the period of preparation and conduct of this IA. Based on the findings from the first interim analysis (IA1), the Sponsor will have the option to close one of the two ASP-1929 PIT treatment arms for enrollment. The final decision on the optimized ASP-1929 PIT dose for this study will be made in agreement with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
