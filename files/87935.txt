Allogeneic Human Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Localized Prostate Cancer
The objective of this study is to determine if systemically infused allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) home to sites of prostate cancer in men with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate that are planning to undergo a prostatectomy. Investigators plan to systemically infuse MSCs 4, 6 or 8 days prior to enrolled subjects' planned prostatectomies. Investigators will then quantify the relative amount of donor MSC DNA to recipient DNA present in patients' explanted prostate specimens. This will be accomplished via BEAMing digital PCR. This trial will provide the foundation for future studies aimed at engineering MSCs to deliver a toxin to sites of metastatic prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Allogeneic Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells
Amount of systemically infused (MSC) DNA relative to recipient DNA at sites of prostate cancer in men with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate that are scheduled to undergo a prostatectomy, Allogeneic MSCs will be quantified through tissue BEAMing and the percent of MSCs per total cell number will be calculated., Up to 3 years
Feasibility of infusing MSCs into men with localized prostate cancer who plan to undergo a prostatectomy., The percentage of screened subjects that agreed to receive a pre-prostatectomy infusion of MSCs at the pre-specified time point and subsequently undergo a radical prostatectomy., Up to 3 years|Determine the proportion of MSC to recipient DNA in the peripheral blood, Proportion of MSC to recipient DNA is calculated by number of MSCs over the number of recipient DNA (\[number of MSC\]/\[number of recipient DNA\]) in the peripheral blood., Up to 3 years|Determine the proportion of MSC to recipient DNA within the seminal vesicle., Proportion of MSC to recipient DNA is calculated by number of MSCs over the number of recipient DNA (\[number of MSC\]/\[number of recipient DNA\]) in the seminal vesicle., Up to 3 years|Changes in the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) survey post-prostatectomy., The SHIM is a measure of sexual function with a score ranging from 1 (severe erectile dysfunction) to 25 (normal function). Participants are required to have a score of \>=17 to be eligible for the study., Up to 3 years|Change in urinary function as assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) survey post-prostatectomy, Change in total urinary function score (possible score range from 5-51) on the EPIC survey., Baseline to Up to 3 years|Change in bowel habits as assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) survey post-prostatectomy, Change in total bowel habits score (possible score range from 8-62) on the EPIC survey., Baseline to Up to 3 years|Change in sexual function as assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) survey post-prostatectomy, Change in total sexual function score (possible score range from 10-61) on the EPIC survey., Baseline to Up to 3 years|Change in hormonal function as assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) survey post-prostatectomy, Change in total hormonal function score (possible score range from 5-49) on the EPIC survey., Baseline to Up to 3 years|Change in overall satisfaction as assessed by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) survey post-prostatectomy, Change in overall satisfaction score (possible score range from 1-5) on the EPIC survey with a higher score reflecting higher overall satisfaction., Baseline to Up to 3 years|Safety as assessed by number of participants experiencing adverse events, Number of participants experiencing adverse events as defined by the revised National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC), version 4.0 published 14 June 2010., Up to 3 years|Safety as assessed by number of participants experiencing serious adverse events, Number of participants experiencing serious adverse events as defined by the revised National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC), version 4.0 published 14 June 2010., Up to 3 years|Safety as assessed by number of participants experiencing treatment-related adverse events, Number of participants experiencing treatment-related adverse events as defined by the revised National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC), version 4.0 published 14 June 2010., Up to 3 years
