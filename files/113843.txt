Multi-arm Multi-modality Therapy for Very High Risk Localized and Low Volume Metastatic Prostatic Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to test if treatment with medications that reduce the male hormone level in the participant's body for a few months before surgery can shrink prostate cancer as much as possible, which might reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the future. These treatments include a hormone injection given monthly or every three months and the study drugs, which include abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and apalutamide.

These medications are being used in combination with surgery and maybe radiotherapy because studies have shown that any single approach on its own is not sufficient to control or get rid of the cancer especially if they have high risk or aggressive features. The researchers hope to learn if combining the study drugs with surgery and radiation will get rid of the cancer from participants' prostates and reduce their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to an undetectable level.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: Abiraterone Acetate|DRUG: Prednisone|PROCEDURE: Radical Prostatectomy|PROCEDURE: Extended Pelvic lymphadenectomy|DRUG: GnRH agonist/antagonist|RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
Pathologic complete response, The primary efficacy measure of pathological complete response and minimal residual disease is defined as the less than or equal to 5 mm of morphologically identifiable carcinoma in the RP specimen., 24 months|Minimal residual disease (MRD), ≤ 5mm tumor, 24 months
PSA Response Rate, defined as percentage of patients with an undetectable PSA at 10 months from randomization (after completion of all protocol treatment), 10 months from randomization|Time to PSA Progression, Time from the start of treatment to the date of first evidence of disease progression (serum PSA ≥0.2ng/mL, which is confirmed by a second determination with a PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL, according to the 2007 American Urological Association Prostate Guidelines). This will be estimated by the cumulative incidence function. For each arm, time to PSA progression will be presented for all patients as well as by metastatic status, 24 months
