Naxitamab and Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GMCSF) and Isotretinoin for Consolidation of Patients With High-Risk Neuroblastoma in First Remission.
This is a single-arm, uncontrolled, international, multi-center, clinical,phase 2 trial, in patients ≥ 12 months of age with high-risk neuroblastoma in first remission. 120 patients will be enrolled to receive naxitamab + GM-CSF in combination with isotretinoin.
