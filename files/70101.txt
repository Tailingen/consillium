Prevalence of Asymptomatic Thrombosis in Multiple Myeloma
Malignant hemopathies, such as solid cancers, increase the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic events. The incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolic events is particularly high in myeloma, linked to the usual risk factors for venous thromboembolic disease, biological risk factors specific to myeloma, and especially to its treatments.

The prevalence of asymptomatic venous thromboembolic events and arterial events are not known to date and remain important data for planning a possible randomized study to determine the most suitable thromboprophylaxis in these patients.
