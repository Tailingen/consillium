Comparison of Erector Spinae Plane Block With Thoracic Paravertebral Block for Breast Surgery
Postoperative analgesia in breast surgery is a difficult and overworked issue due to etensive surgery and complex innervation of the breast. Erector spinae plane block (ESB) is a new defined and promising regional anesthesia technique for thoracic analgesia. Main purpose of this study is to compare the analgesic effect of ultrasound guided ESB with thoracic paravertebral block - the golden standard method for postoperative regional analgesia technique in breast surgery.
