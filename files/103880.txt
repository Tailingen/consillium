Evaluation of the Effect of Mediterranean Diet on Breast Cancer Patients
In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effect of the Mediterranean diet on body composition, oxidant stress and proinflammatory markers in overweight and obese breast cancer women.
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Mediterranean Diet
Change in body weight, Body weight (kg) was measured using the InBody 270 brand device., Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in body mass indexs, The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m\^2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres., Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in fat mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analyzer, Fat mass (kg) was measured using the InBody 270 brand device., Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in fat-free mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analyzer, Fat-free mass (kg) was measured using the InBody 270 brand device., Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in resting metabolic rate (RMR) measured by bioelectrical impedance analyzer, RMR (kcal) was measured using the InBody 270 brand device., Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in interleukin 6 (IL-6), Blood was drawn from participants for assessment of IL-6 (pg/mL) at the beginning and end of the study after fasting for at least 8 hours, Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), Blood was drawn from participants for assessment of TNF-α (pg/mL) at the beginning and end of the study after fasting for at least 8 hours, Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in malondialdehyde (MDA), Blood was drawn from participants for assessment of MDA (mmol/L) at the beginning and end of the study after fasting for at least 8 hours, Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in total antioxidant status (TAS), Blood was drawn from participants for assessment of TAS (mmol/L) at the beginning and end of the study after fasting for at least 8 hours, Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in total oxidant status (TOS), Blood was drawn from participants for assessment of TOS (µmol/L) at the beginning and end of the study after fasting for at least 8 hours, Baseline, 8 weeks
Change in waist circumference, Waist circumference (cm) was measured with a non-stretch tape measure., Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in hip circumference, Hip circumference (cm) was measured with a non-stretch tape measure., Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in dietary inflammatory index (DII), Dietary inflammatory index (DII) was calculated with 3-day food consumption record., Baseline, 8 weeks|Change in oxidative stress index (OSI), The oxidative stress index (OSI) value expressed as a percentage of the ratio of serum total oxidant status (TOS) levels to total antioxidant status (TAS) levels was calculated., Baseline, 8 weeks
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women in both developed and developing countries and is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Breast cancer is a disease that can develop and progress for various reasons. In addition to unchangeable factors such as increasing age and genotype, modifiable factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity, malnutrition, and obesity play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Breast cancer risk increases with increasing body mass index (BMI) in postmenopausal women. Chronic inflammation in obesity is associated with an increase in the release of proinflammatory factors (such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6). This situation; It is a risk factor for many types of cancer such as colon, stomach, breast and prostate carcinomas and supports a cause-effect relationship between obesity and cancer. These proinflammatory factors act as signal converters for tumor growth and progression. Obese women have elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the circulation, and this is associated with the development and progression of breast tumors.

The Mediterranean Diet, which consists of high amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids, fruits, vegetables and whole grains, has been widely evaluated and indicated as an important factor in preventing tumor formation from inflammatory pathways.

Weight loss improves the antitumor immune system, lowers estrogen levels, reduces the risk of breast cancer and has been associated with better outcomes in obese patients. Lifestyle intervention studies strongly suggest that weight loss is possible and observational studies can actually improve breast cancer survival.In this regard, a healthy lifestyle and diet are the first steps to prevent breast cancer.
