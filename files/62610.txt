Compare Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of Proposed Rituximab Biosimilar (DRL_RI) With MabThera® in LTB Follicular Lymphoma
The primary objective of the current study is to demonstrate the equivalent efficacy of rituximab (DRL_RI) and MabThera® in subjects with Low Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma (LTB-FL).

Also evaluated by Pharmacokinetic, safety, and immunogenicity assessment between a proposed biosimilar (DRL_RI) and the RMP, as an component of clinical study program, and collectively providing the evidence of biosimilarity.

The study will compare the safety and efficacy of DRL_RI vs MabThera in patients with Low Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma (LTB-FL). The primary objective is to establish comparative efficacy as measured by ORR up to week 28

Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) for Low Tumor Burden Follicular Lymphoma, Best Overall Response Rate (BORR) is defined as the proportion of participants in each treatment group that achieved a best overall response of either Complete response (CR), unconfirmed Complete response (CRu) or Partial response (PR), up to Month 7 (Week 28) based on central radiology review in accordance with the Cheson, 1999 response criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas. As per Cheson 1999, response criteria for target lesions and assessed by radiology: Complete response (CR): All lesions with a longest diameter should be regressed to normal size (≤ 15 mm) or short axis regressed to ≤ 10 mm with confirmed Bone marrow normalization; unconfirmed Complete response (CRu): All lesions with a longest diameter should be regressed to normal size (≤ 15 mm) or short axis regressed to ≤ 10 mm with non-confirmed Bone marrow normalization; Partial Response (PR): ≥ 50 % decrease of sum of products of diameter(SPD) of all the target lesions; Overall Response (OR)=CR+CRu+PR., Month 7 (Week 28)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), The overall response rate (ORR) is defined as proportion of participants in each treatment group achieved a complete response or partial response at week 12 and week 28 based on central radiology review in accordance with published response criteria for malignant lymphoma. As per Cheson 1999, response criteria for target lesions and assessed by radiology: Complete response (CR): All lesions with a longest diameter should be regressed to normal size (≤ 15 mm) or short axis regressed to ≤ 10 mm with confirmed Bone marrow normalization; unconfirmed Complete response (uCR): All lesions with a longest diameter should be regressed to normal size (≤ 15 mm) or short axis regressed to ≤ 10 mm with non-confirmed Bone marrow normalization; Partial Response (PR): ≥ 50 % decrease of sum of products of diameter(SPD) of all the target lesions; Overall Response (OR)=CR+uCR+PR., Week 12, Week 28|Complete Response Rate, Complete Response rate is defined as the proportion of participants in each treatment group who achieved complete response up to particular visit based on investigator assessment in accordance with the response criteria for malignant lymphoma. As per Cheson 1999, response criteria for target lesions and assessed by radiology: Complete response (CR): All lesions with a longest diameter should be regressed to normal size (≤ 15 mm) or short axis regressed to ≤ 10 mm with confirmed Bone marrow normalization., Week 28|Complete Response Rate as a Best Response, Complete Response Rate as a Best Response is defined as the proportion of participants in each treatment group that achieved the best complete response up to Week 28 based on central radiology review in accordance with the Cheson 1999, response criteria for malignant lymphoma. As per Cheson 1999, response criteria for target lesions and assessed by radiology: Complete response (CR): All lesions with a longest diameter should be regressed to normal size (≤ 15 mm) or short axis regressed to ≤ 10 mm with confirmed Bone marrow normalization., Week 28|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) defined as the time from date of the first documentation of tumor response (Complete Response, unconfirmed complete response or partial response) to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or to death due to any cause up to 52 weeks/ End of study (EOS). Progression is defined as per Cheson 1999, response criteria is:

Target Nodal SPD Progression: at least one node must be abnormal, and the SPD of all nodes must increase by ≥ 50% from its nadir SPD.

Target Extranodal SPD Progression: at least one extranodal lesion must be present and the SPD of all extranodal lesions must increase by ≥ 50% from its nadir SPD.

Also, if a patient had any unequivocal progression in non-target lesions; and detection of any new nodal lesion (longest diameter \[LDi\] 15mm with an absolute increase of 5mm) his/her response was considered as Progressive disease., Week 52|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of documented progressive disease or death due to any cause. Progression is defined as per Cheson 1999, response criteria is:

Target Nodal SPD Progression: at least one node must be abnormal, and the SPD of all nodes must increase by ≥ 50% from its nadir SPD.

Target Extranodal SPD Progression: at least one extranodal lesion must be present and the SPD of all extranodal lesions must increase by ≥ 50% from its nadir SPD.

Also, if a patient had any unequivocal progression in non-target lesions; and detection of any new nodal lesion (LDi 15mm with an absolute increase of 5mm) his/her response was considered as Progressive disease., Week 52|Overall Survival (OS), The Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death from any cause up to 52 weeks or EOS., Week 52|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, The safety and tolerability of DRL_RI and MabThera® in participants with CD20-positive, LTB-FL was evaluated., From Screening (Day -28 to -1) up to 52 weeks|Number of Participants With Positive Anti-drug Antibody (ADA), The immunogenicity of the Proposed Rituximab Biosimilar (DRL_RI) with MabThera® among trial participants was compared., On Day 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 12 post dose
It is planned to randomise approx. 312 subjects at approximately ≥ 130 study sites worldwide. Subjects with LTB-FL will be randomized to receive either DRL_RI or MabThera®. Till date, 68 patients have been randomized for the study.

The study specific objectives are mentioned below:

Primary Objective:

• To demonstrate the equivalent efficacy of DRL_RI (biosimilar rituximab) and MabThera in subjects with CD20-positive, LTB FL, as measured by overall response rate (ORR) up to Week 28 evaluated in accordance with Cheson, 1999 response criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas.

Secondary Objectives:

* To compare the progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of response (DOR) of DRL_RI with MabThera® in subjects with CD20-positive, LTB FL.
* To compare the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of DRL_RI with MabThera in subjects with CD20-positive, LTB-FL.

Exploratory Objectives

* To explore the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of DRL_RI and MabThera, using a population-PK modelling approach.
* To explore the pharmacodynamic parameters of DRL_RI and MabThera.
