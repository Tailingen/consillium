Prospective, Longitudinal Biocollection in Thoracic Oncology, Including Newly Diagnosed Lung Cancer Patients
In clinical trials, patients are selected according to strict eligibility criteria (inclusion and exclusion criteria). These criteria aim to ensure homogeneity within the trial population, but may omit patients with specific characteristics, comorbidities or co-medications. Indeed, patients of advanced age, with comorbidities or brain metastases, who are frequently encountered in clinical practice, are often excluded from clinical trials. Real-life data in oncology play a vital role in assessing the efficacy of therapies and therapeutic strategies, complementing data from controlled clinical trials. They make it possible to analyze a larger population and take into account multiple variables such as patient history, co-medications and comorbidities, but also to analyze efficacy and toxicity data in populations not represented in clinical trials. The establishment of a prospective cohort including various stages and histologies will make it possible to set up a platform of available data, including a maximum of data linked to the patient, his tumor and his treatments, collected longitudinally until the patient's death (or the end of the study).

In parallel with this cohort, the project aims to set up a longitudinal plasmatheque (from diagnosis to death, or at the end of the study), as well as a tumorotheque (samples systematically stored as part of care by the CHU tumorotheque, and for which patient consent allows their use in research depending on the material available) for patients with available tumor samples. This will enable the construction of ancillary projects to validate research hypotheses, for example concerning the identification of mechanisms of resistance to therapies.

Overall survival, Overall survival will be defined as the time elapsed between the date of the initial diagnosis of lung cancer and the date of death, regardless of the cause. Patients still alive at the end of the follow-up period will complete their participation in the cohort., up to 5 years

Assess the time intervals between different steps in the initial management of lung cancer., The care pathway will be described through the collection of dates (surgery, radiotherapy, presentation at multidisciplinary consultation meetings, etc.) and types of medical consultations., up to 5 years|Evaluate the return to work for patients of working age who have been treated for lung cancer., Proportion of patients who returned to work after treatment, measurement of the average time taken, and factors associated with the return to work., up to 5 years|Identify specific biomarkers of lung cancer cells (primary tumors or metastatic tissues) in comparison to healthy lung tissues., Quantitative comparison and characterization of biomarkers (extracellular vesicles and miRNA signatures) between tumor tissues and non-cancerous tissues., up to 5 years|Evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of circulating biomarkers at diagnosis and during systemic treatments., Association between levels of circulating biomarkers and overall survival as well as treatment response., up to 5 years
