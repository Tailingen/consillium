A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Activity of RO7566802 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Atezolizumab in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamic, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of RO7566802 as a single agent and in combination with atezolizumab in participants with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic incurable solid tumor malignancies. Participants will be enrolled in 2 stages: dose escalation and expansion.
