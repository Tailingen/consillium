A Multicentre Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of AD 923 in Comparison to MSIR for the Treatment of CBP in Subjects
Purpose:

The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of AD 923 to the most widely used current treatment (MSIR) in the management of target BTP in subjects with malignancies who are taking a stable dose of background opioids. The efficacy evaluation criteria have been designed to determine whether AD 923 provides superior analgesia compared with MSIR as measured by the primary endpoint.
