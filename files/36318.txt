A Safety and Pharmacokinetics Study of Niraparib Plus an Androgen Receptor-Targeted Therapy in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (BEDIVERE)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of niraparib when administered in combination with an androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy (apalutamide or abiraterone acetate plus prednisone) in adult men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who may or may not have deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-repair anomalies.
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Niraparib|DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: Abiraterone Acetate|DRUG: Prednisone
Determine Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Niraparib in Combination With 240 milligram (mg) Apalutamide or 1,000 mg Abiraterone Acetate Plus 10 mg Prednisone (5 mg Twice Daily) in Part 1, RP2D will be defined as the highest dose of study drug at which less than 33 percent (%) of participants experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT)., Up to 56 days|Number of Participants With Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (Part 2), Number of participants will be assessed to further explore safety and antitumor activity in Part 2 (dose expansion) of study., Up to 30 days after last dose
Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) will be assessed., 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 10 hours postdose Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle 28 days)|Time to Reach the Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Time to reach the maximum plasma concentration(Tmax) will be assessed., 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 10 hours postdose Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle 28 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time Zero to 24 Hours (AUC [0-24]), Area under plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to time 24 hours after dosing will be assessed., 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 10 hours postdose Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle 28 days)|Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough), Ctrough is the minimum observed (that is, predose) plasma concentration following multiple dosing will be assessed., Predose (Cycle 1 Days 15 and 22) up to Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle 28 days) then Every 3 Cycles after Cycle 3 till End of Treatment (30 days after last dose)|Metabolite to Parent Ratio for Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve From Time 0 to 24 Hours (AUC [0-24]), Metabolite to parent drug ratio for area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC \[0-24\]) will be assessed., 24 hours postdose on Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 10 hours postdose Cycle 3 Day 1 (each cycle 28 days)
