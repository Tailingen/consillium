The Prediction Biomarkers of Survival Outcome for Severe Immune-related Hepatitis
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized lung cancer (LC) treatment, demonstrating a significant improvement in overall survival. However high-grade immune-related adverse events (irAEs) may result in harmful and serious clinical outcomes, even death. Immune-related hepatitis (IRH) is a potentially serious complication of checkpoint blockade, with an incidence of 5%-10% for ICIs monotherapy, including 1%-2% with grade 3 or higher. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore new and better prognostic and predictive biomarkers for IRH.

DRUG: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
Number of Participants with Immune-Related Hepatitis, Number of participants with Grade 3-4 IRH graded by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), 2 years|Number of Participants Deaths, Number of participants with Grade 3-4 immune-related hepatitis by CTCAE 4.0 who still died after the corticosteroid (2mg/kg) and/or mycophenolate mofetil treatment., 2 years
Number of Participants with Laboratory Abnormalities in Liver Tests, Number of participants with laboratory liver tests based on Hunan Cancer hospital to determine the safety of immunotherapy. The number of participants with the following laboratory abnormalities from on-treatment evaluations will be summarized: ALT or AST \>5-20 ULN, and \> 20 x ULN;Total bilirubin \> 3-10 ULN and \> 10 x ULN, 2 years
