Clinical Study of Double-Endoscopic Combined With Minimally Invasive Treatment for Early Gastric Cancer at Clinical Stage T1b
For patients diagnosed with early gastric cancer involving submucosal invasion, super-ESD indications, or lymph node metastasis, a combination of preoperative endoscopic ultrasound and abdominal contrast-enhanced CT was utilized to ascertain the depth of tumor invasion and to identify any suspicious metastatic lymph nodes in the vicinity of the stomach. Subsequently, a local full-thickness resection, coupled with or followed by individualized precise lymph node dissection, was conducted to fulfill the following objectives: ① To investigate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of local resection for patients meeting super-ESD criteria; ② To offer a clinical foundation for the individualized and precise lymph node dissection treatment of early gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer Patients Undergoing Minimally Invasive Gastrectomy
PROCEDURE: Sixty patients with early gastric cancer in stage T1bN0-1M0 were divided into Group A-N0 and Group B-N + according to the presence or absence of lymph node metastasis. When the enrolled patients und
