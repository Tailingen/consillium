Pre-op Chemo-RT w/CDDP/5FU vs Chemo w/ Docetaxel/Irinotecan in PET Non Responder Resectable Esophagus Cancer
The purpose of this study is to improve their outcome by either changing the chemotherapy drugs or giving them radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy, hoping that this will improve their outcome.
Carcinoma of Esophagus
DRUG: irinotecan and docetaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin, fluorouracil and concurrent radiation therapy
Pathological Complete Response ( regression score 1a- see response assessment) in each treatment group, 5 yrs
Rate of conversion from PET non responder to responder with each type of salvage therapy, * Failure Free Survival for each treatment group
* Overall Survival for each treatment group
* ERCC1 as a predictor of failure of response to cisplatin based chemotherapy in neo adjuvant setting., 5 yrs
This study is aimed at improving the outcome of resectable non PET responders, esophageal carcinoma, by either changing the chemotherapy drugs or giving them radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy, hoping that this will improve their outcome.
