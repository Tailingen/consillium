GZ17-6.02 in Advanced CRPC After Progression on Anti-Androgen Therapy
The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if GZ17-6.02 delays progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.
Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Investigational Agent Administration
Radiologic progression-free survival (rPFS) for 6 months or longer, Number of participants with rPFS for 6 months or longer, 6 months and up to 5 years after end of study treatment
Measure the biochemical response rate of CRPC tumors to GZ17-6.02, Biochemical response measured by percentage of patients with any reduction in PSA, reduction in PSA by at least 30% (PSA30), and reduction in PSA by at least 50% (PSA50)., Up to 5 years following end of study treatment|Measure the duration of response of CRPC tumors to GZ17-6.02, Duration of tumor response, measured by time to increase in PSA., Up to 5 years following end of study treatment|Assess the objective response rate (ORR) in CRPC patients treated with twice daily GZ17-6.02., Best objective response (complete response, partial response, or stable disease â‰¥4 months) in patients with measurable disease by RECIST 1.1., Up to 5 years following end of study treatment|Measure the duration of radiographic response in CRPC patients treated with twice daily GZ17-6.02, Duration of radiographic response, Up to 5 years following end of study treatment|Measure overall survival (OS) in CRPC patients treated with twice daily GZ17-6.02, Overall patient survival, defined as date of diagnosis to date of death, Up to 5 years following end of study treatment|Determine the safety and tolerability of twice daily treatment with GZ17-6.02, Incidence of adverse events using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., Beginning of study treatment through the 30-day follow-up safety assessment up to 5 years
This single-arm phase Ib study will assess whether GZ17-6.02, a combination of curcumin, harmine, and isovanillin, delays radiographic progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer among men previously treated with androgen deprivation therapy and an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor. All participants in the study will receive GZ17-6.02. The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of GZ17-6.02 and explore patient-reported outcomes.
