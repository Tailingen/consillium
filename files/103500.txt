The ME&MG Digital Solution for Autonomous Assessment of Myasthenia Gravis
ME\&MG is a standalone software (digital solution) running on patients smartphones, connected to a web portal for physicians. It is intended to be used as an unsupervised digital self-assessment tool for the monitoring of disabilities in patients living with MG.

ME\&MG contains digital active tests for the assessment of ptosis, breathing, dysarthria, upper- and lower-limb (arms and legs) weakness, treatment follow-up, and validated e-questionnaires related to daily activities, pain, fatigue, sleep, and depression disorders.

The objectives of this study are to validate the accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of the unsupervised at-home self-assessment of symptoms on the patient's smartphone with ME\&MG versus the standard in-clinic testing, as well as to evaluate the safety of the solution, its usability and satisfaction.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterised by fatigable muscle weakness due to autoantibodies targeting components of the neuromuscular junction.

Deficits are measured using validated clinical scales such as the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis score (QMG) QMG, Myasthenia Gravis Composite Score (MCS), Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living score (MG-ADL), etc., Unfortunately, this type of assessment might require expensive material, time, and personnel training, which make MG assessment difficult for clinicians in routine care.

Research on the matter has highlighted the importance of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs), composite measures of disease severity and quality-of-life measurements. This has led to the development of a number of tools for the self-assessment of PROs with validated questionnaires. However, there is no tool that overcomes the constraints of standard tests such as the QMG while allowing for the collection of objective data and PROs between visits.
