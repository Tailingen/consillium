A Prospective, Randomized, Multicenter Study of Comparison of TACE Combination With and Without EBRT for Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Portal Vein Tumor Thrombi
The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rate (OS), local control rate (FFLP), disease-free progression time (PFS), and side effects were compared in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma limited to intrahepatic unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with portal venous thrombosis combined with or without external radiotherapy, providing a basis for the development of relevant guidelines.
