Well-Being and Health-Related Quality of Life in Cancer Patients and Survivors During the COVID-19 Pandemic
This study investigates the well-being and health-related quality of life in cancer patients and survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using questionnaires may help researchers gain an understanding of how experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., exposure, risk factors, testing, isolation, seropositivity, hospitalization, loss of family or friends, loss of income), may impact multiple domains of health-related quality of life (physical, emotional and social well-being), and other areas such as COVID-19-specific psychological distress (e.g., fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms), and disruptions to health care, finances, and social interactions.
