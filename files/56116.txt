Sarcoma Study of MORAb-004 Utilization: Research and Clinical Evaluation
This study is being done to see if MORAb-004 increases the effectiveness of the chemotherapies gemcitabine and docetaxel in people with metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma.
Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: MORAb-004|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Placebo
Part 2: Radiologic Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time (in weeks) from the date of randomization to the date of first observation of disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) or date of death, regardless of the cause., From date of first dose until date of first observation of disease progression, or death due to any cause (up to approximately 3 years)
Part 2: Symptomatic Progression-free Survival, PFS including symptomatic progression was defined as the time (in weeks) from the date of randomization to the date of the first observation of disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, symptomatic progression, or death due to any cause., From date of first dose until date of first observation of disease progression, symptomatic progression, or death due to any cause (up to approximately 3 years)|Part 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of death, regardless of the cause., From date of first dose until date of death from any cause (up to approximately 3.5 years)|Part 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of subjects with either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeter (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., From date of first dose until disease progression (up to approximately 3.5 years)|Part 2: Radiologic Progression-free Survival Rate (PFR), Radiologic progression-free survival rate was defined as the percentage of subjects achieving radiologic PFS at the pre-specified time points., Weeks 12, 24, 48 and 52|Part 2: Number of Participants Who Had Relationship Between MORAb-004 Exposures and Biomarker Levels, Up to approximately 3 years
