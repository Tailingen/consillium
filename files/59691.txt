Neoadjuvant Camrelizumab and Fluzoparib and Nab-paclitaxel in Early Breast Cancer With HRR Gene Mutation
This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of Camrelizumab (Immunotherapy, PD-1 inhibitor), Fluzoparib (PARP inhibitor) and Nab-paclitaxel in neoadjuvant therapy of Her-2 negative breast cancer patients with HRR gene mutation.
Her-2 Negative Breast Cancer|HRR Gene Mutation
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Fluzoparib|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), Pathologic response will be assessed in the surgically resected cancer and lymph nodes after completion of all chemotherapy by the local pathologist as part of routine care. Pathologic complete response is defined as no invasive cancer in the resected breast tissue and lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis, ypN0)., Up to 32 weeks
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as percentage of participants with Complete Response and Partial Response, Up to 32 weeks|Residual Cancer Burden (RCB), Pathologilly assessed residual cancer burden according to MD Anderson protocol., Up to 32 weeks|Event-Free Survival (EFS), EFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of events from any cause., Up to 20 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Up to 20 years|Safety of drugs, Adverse effects of the candidates according to NCI-CTCAE 5.0, Up to 32 weeks
This is a prospective, single-center, open-label phase II clinical trial investigating the activity of Camrelizumab+Fluzoparib+Nab-paclitaxel combination therapy in breast cancer patients with Her2-negative and HRR gene mutation for neoadjuvant therapy.

Anticipated 66 candidates meeting all study eligibility criteria will receive 8 cycles of Nab-paclitaxel (260mg/m2) every 3 weeks, which will add Camrelizumab (200mg, d1) and Fluzoparib (100mg BID) from the second cycle.

HRR gene mutation contains at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in germline or somatic BRCA1, BCRA2 and PALB2 genes, or in germline ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK2, RAD51C, RAD51D genes.
