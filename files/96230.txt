Study Evaluating the Ketogenic Diet in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
This study will evaluate the effects of the ketogenic diet in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer while receiving chemotherapy.
Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: Ketogenic Diet
Progression-free survival per RECIST 1.1, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause., 36 months
To compare the number of responses by RECIST 1.1, To compare the number of complete responses/partial responses as defined by CT scan using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and CA 19-9 (or CA 125, or CEA if not expressers of CA 19-9) down to normal limits (from at least \> 2X ULN)., 36 months|To compare the disease control rate using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., (Partial Response + Complete Response + Stable Disease for at least 9 weeks), 36 months|Cancer Biomarkers, Change in CA 19-9 (or CA 125, or CEA if not expressers of CA 19-9), 36 months|Cancer Biomarkers returning to normal, Rates of normalization of CA 19-9 (or CA 125, or CEA if not expressers of CA 19-9), 36 months|Change in BMI, To compare the average weight (kg), using BMI calculation (BMI = weight (kg) / height (m2)), 36 months|Compare insulin levels, To compare average insulin levels, 36 months|To compare the average HbgA1c level, To compare the average HbgA1c levels, 36 months|To compare changes in serum metabolites, To compare changes in serum metabolites, 36 months|To compare quality of life between arms via the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire QLC-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) assessment., Higher scores in the quality of life on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire QLC-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) assessment may show a better outcome., 36 months
A randomized, phase II trial designed to evaluate the progression free survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer on triplet therapy (nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine + cisplatin) while on ketogenic diet or non-ketogenic diet. This study also aims to compare the changes in serum metabolites and quality of life between the two arms.
