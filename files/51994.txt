Multi-center Application of Quantitative FIT Technology in Colorectal Cancer Screening
In order to control the incidence of colorectal cancer, improve the level of early diagnosis and early warning the occurrence of colorectal cancer, it is very necessary for us to explore the threshold value of FIT positive judgment in line with the Chinese population, and further contribute to the establishment of a colorectal cancer screening pathway suitable for Chinese healthy population
Colorectal Cancer Screening Fecal Immunochemical Test
DEVICE: Quantitative Fecal Immunochemical Test (qFIT)
Sensitivity of quantitative FIT, The sensitivity of quantitative FIT application in Chinese physical examination population, 1year|Specificity of quantitative FIT, The specificity of quantitative FIT application in Chinese physical examination population, 1year
Feces were collected for quantitative FIT test. Those with positive results were further examined by colonoscopy. By comparing with pathological results of colonoscopy, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of quantitative FIT technology for the diagnosis of colorectal tumors were confirmed.
