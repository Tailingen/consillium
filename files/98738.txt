Omitting Sentinel Node Procedure in Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Breast Conserving Therapy
STUDY AIM To decrease the number of breast cancer patients receiving over treatment of the axilla, in order to positively influence the axillary morbidity rate and quality of life.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine whether omitting the sentinel lymph node procedure is not inferior to the current axillary staging regimen in clinically node negative breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving therapy, in terms of regional recurrence rate.

HYPOTHESIS The sentinel lymph node procedure can be safely omitted in clinically node negative breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving therapy. This will lead to a decreased axillary morbidity rate, with a non-inferior regional recurrence-, distant-disease free- and overall survival rates.
Breast Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Sentinel lymph node procedure
Regional recurrence rate, Regional recurrence is defined as tumour recurrence and as residual tumour that became clinically apparent in ipsilateral axillary, infraclavicular and supraclavicular lymph nodes (pathologically proven)., Up to ten years
