A Trial With Vinflunine in Patients With Metastatic Bladder Cancer and Impaired Renal Function
This study aim to compare the efficacy, safety and quality of life of vinflunine/gemcitabine and carboplatin/gemcitabine in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer and impaired renal function.

DRUG: Vinflunine|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the duration from randomization to either confirmed progression (by RECIST) or death from any cause., From randomization through study completion, on average within 9 months
Overall response rate (ORR = CR + PR), Defined as best confirmed response according to RECIST through study completion from randomization to either confirmed progression (by RECIST) or death from any cause, From randomization through study completion, on average within 9 months|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the duration from randomization to death from any cause or last follow-up., From randomization to death from any cause, on average within 18 months|Disease control rate, DCR (=CR + PR + SD), Defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease according to RECIST through study completion from randomization to either confirmed progression (by RECIST) or death from any cause, From randomization through study completion, on average within 9 months|Number of patients with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Treatment-related adverse events will be assessed by CTCAE v4.0. The safety profile and tolerability of vinflunine + gemcitabine compared to carboplatin + gemcitabine will be determined from the number of Adverse Events reported., From the date the informed consent is signed up to 30 days after the last dose|Quality of Life (QoL) assessed by QLQ-C30, Quality of Life will be assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) Version 3.0. The QoL for patients treated with vinflunine + gemcitabine will be compared to patients treated with carboplatin + gemcitabine, From the date the informed consent is signed up to 30 days after the last dose
Rational The standard first line treatment for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma unfit for cisplatin due to renal impairment is carboplatin containing chemotherapy, with a median overall survival of approximately 8-10 month. New, more effective regimens in terms of tumor control and quality of life are urgently needed. Vinflunine has proven efficacy in urothelial carcinoma and is registered as second line treatment. The combination of gemcitabine and vinflunine has not yet been evaluated in first line treatment for patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

Objectives

* To compare the progression free survival (FPS) of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus carboplatin/gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract unfit for cisplatin based chemotherapy due to impaired renal function.
* To evaluate the tumour response (ORR), overall survival (OS) and disease control rate (DCR) of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus carboplatin/gemcitabine
* To assess the safety and toxicity of vinflunine/gemcitabine versus carboplatin/gemcitabine.
* To investigate and compare Quality of life during treatment with vinflunine/gemcitabine and carboplatin/gemcitabine respectively.
