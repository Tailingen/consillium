Efficacy and Toxicity Study of Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone in Patients Who Have Relapsed After Exposure to Lenalidomide and Bortezomib
Asian patients with relapsed myeloma after prior treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide will treatment on pomalidomde and dexamethasone.

Baseline, follow-up, survival and toxicity information will be collected.
Multiple Myeloma|Relapse After Use of Lenalidomide and Bortezomib
DRUG: Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone
To assess the progression free survival (PFS) for pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients who have relapsed and are refractory to lenalidomide and have previously been treated with bortezomib, 2 year
To assess Overall Response Rate (ORR), 2 year|To see if addition of cyclophosphamide with induce additional response in patient who do not achieve an minimal response (MR) after 3 months, 2 year|To assess Overall Survival (OS), 5 year|To assess Duration of Response (DOR), 2 year|To assess Safety and Tolerability, 2 year
Myeloma patients who relapse after prior treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide have survival of less than 1 year. Recently, a randomized study of Pomalidomide and dexamethasone conducted in compared with placebo and dexamethasone showed that pomalidomide can improve survival of this group of patients.

Pomalidomide is a new immunomodulatory drug which has been shown to be active in myeloma patients who relapse after bortezomib and lenalidomide. A recent phase III study comparing pomalidomide plus dexamethasone with placebo plus high dose dexamethasone in patients with prior exposure to bortezomib and lenalidomide, showed that the use of pomalidomide significantly improve the overall survival of these patients. However, this study did not include Asian patients. Therefore the efficacy and toxicity of pomalidomide remains to be described in Asian patients
