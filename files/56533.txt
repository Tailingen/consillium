Intrathecal Application of PD1 Antibody in Metastatic Solid Tumors With Leptomeningeal Disease (IT-PD1/ NOA 26)
To determine the safety of intrathecal (IT) PD1 antibody for Intrathecal application of PD1 antibody in metastatic solid tumors with leptomeningeal disease of solid tumors.
Leptomeningeal Disease
DRUG: Nivolumab [Opdivo]
Assessment of Adverse Events for Dose Limiting Toxicities [Safety and Tolerabillity], This trial will investigate the maximum tolerable dose and safety of intrathecal PD1 antibody administration in LMD of metastatic solid tumors with a registered indication for treatment with intravenous PD1 antibody or PD-1L antibody. The safety endpoints will be assessed by a review of adverse events and serious adverse events according to CTCAE up to 4 months days after last dose.Subjects will undergo 6 cycles each 14 days in duration and a safety visit 7 days after the 3th dosage and 7 days after the 6th dosage.The appropriate dose for the expansion phase (Part II) is based on the results in Part I (dose escalation phase) and will define the maximum tolerable fix dose in Part II., up to 4 months after last dose
Overall Survival, The secondary endpoint is overall survival defined as the time interval from the date of first study administration to the date of progression., last follow-up, up to 4 months after last dose
Leptmeningeal disease (LMD) is an aggressive subtype of metastatic disease in the central nervous system (CNS) and has a poor prognosis with a median overall survival of a few months.The IT-PD1 trial group wants to contribute to an improvement of this situation for LMD patients by using an intrathecal application route for the PD1 antibody, i.e. a drug that has shown clinical efficacy in the underlying tumor via the intravenous route.
