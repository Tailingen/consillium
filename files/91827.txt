Image-Guided (68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT) Prostate Biopsy for the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Men With Prior Negative/Inconclusive Biopsy
This early phase I trial studies how well an image-guided prostate biopsy using the imaging agent 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-11 with a positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan works in diagnosing prostate cancer in men with a prior negative or inconclusive prostate biopsy. PSMA is a protein that is found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. 68Ga-PSMA-11 is made up of a substance that binds to PSMA on tumor cells, linked with a radioactive substance that can then be seen on imaging scans such as PET/CT. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-guided biopsy may help improve the detection rate of prostate cancer. This may help reduce over-diagnosis and over-treatment in men with low-risk prostate cancer and under-treatment in men with high-risk prostate cancer.
Prostate Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Biopsy of Prostate|OTHER: Gallium Ga 68 Gozetotide|PROCEDURE: Transrectal Ultrasonography Guided Biopsy
Detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer, Defined as the percentage of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason score 7 or more) in patients with focal 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake within the prostate, Up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason score 7 or more) in patients with focal gallium Ga 68 gozetotide (68Ga-PSMA-11) uptake within the prostate.

OUTLINE:

SCREENING PROCEDURE: Patients receive 68Ga-PSMA-11 intravenously (IV) and 50-100 minutes later, undergo a PET/CT scan. Only patients with 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake within the prostate proceed to image-guided biopsy.

IMAGE-GUIDED BIOPSY: Patients undergo experimental image-guided prostate biopsy using PET/CT images obtained during screening procedure during a standard of care transrectal ultrasonography guided biopsy (TRUS).
