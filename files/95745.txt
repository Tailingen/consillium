Study of Pembrolizumab Plus Fulvestrant in Hormone Receptor Positive, HER-2 Negative Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
Pembrolizumab Plus Fulvestrant in Hormone Receptor Positive, HER-2 Negative Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Clinical Benefit Ratio (CBR), Clinical benefit ratio (CBR) is defined as the percentage of patients that achieve CR, PR, or stable disease for a minimum of four months. Patients will be evaluated for response by RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST., 36 months
Safety profile of pembrolizumab plus fulvestrant, To describe the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab plus fulvestrant in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative advanced/metastatic breast cancer. The toxicity profile will report all grade 3 and 4 toxicities as defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4, 36 months|Progression free survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time from date of treatment start until the criteria for disease progression is met or death from any cause. PFS will be assessed by RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST, 36 months|Durable response rate (DRR), Durable response rate is defined as the number of months that a stable disease, partial or complete response is observed., 36 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as defined as the time from date of treatment start until death, 36 months
This is a non-randomized, multi-site, open-label Phase II trial for subjects with metastatic, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. The study will enroll 47 patients to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of pembrolizumab with fulvestrant as measured by RECIST 1.1 tumor response and by progression free survival. We expect that if the immune response is augmented by the addition of pembrolizumab, significant change in durability of response will be noted.

Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab dosed at 200 mg intravenous infusion in combination with standard fulvestrant 500mg intramuscular injection.
