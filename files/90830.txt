Investigation of the Role of the Microbiome in the Pathogenesis of Colorectal Adenoma and Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is the investigation of new host-microbiome interactions promoting adenoma formation and adenocarcinoma progression. For that purpose, the investigators will collect saliva, stool and colon biopsy specimens from patients referred to colonoscopy or surgical resection of colorectal tumor. Besides, a questionnaire about diet, lifestyle and medical history will be collected. Sample analysis will involve simultaneous characterization of host and microbiota genomic and transcriptomic components.
Colorectal Adenoma and Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Colon biopsies
Differential host microbiome composition and abundance in healthy, adenoma and CRC patients and its correlation to CRC risk features and host genomic and transcriptomic components., Host microbiome composition and abundance data will be generated from saliva, stool and colonic biopsies with amplicon-based 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. This data will be correlated to CRC risk factors collected in a questionnaire covering lifestyle, diet and medical history as well as host genomic and transcriptomic profiling generated by targeted gene sequencing and microarray-based gene expression profiling., 2 years
