Phase II Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab in Endocrine Resistant Breast Cancer With Letrozole
This is a phase II study testing the combination of pembrolizumab with lenvatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that has activity against vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3 (VEGFR1-3), fibroblast growth factor receptors 1-4 (FGFR1-4), ret protooncogene (RET), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-alpha) and KIT (a stem cell factor receptor), and letrozole, a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, in advanced hormone receptor (HR) positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer (BC) that has progressed on/after standard endocrine therapy.
Hormone Receptor-Positive HER2-Negative Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Oral lenvatinib + Intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab + Oral letrozole
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The efficacy of Pembrolizumab, Lenvatinib and Letrozole.

ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who have best objective response (BOR) of CR or PR at the time of data cutoff., Up to 2 years.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first study dose date (at the D-14 lenvatinib + letrozole run-in phase) to the date of first documentation of confirmed disease progression or death (whichever occurs first)., Up to 3 years after End of Treatment (estimated).|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the date the criteria are met for an CR or PR (whichever is recorded first) to the date the disease progression is objectively documented. If a subject has no record of disease progression, then the subject's data will be censored at the last available tumour assessment., Up to 3 years after End of Treatment (estimated).|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of patients with CRs, PRs, and durable (â‰¥24 weeks) stable disease (SD)., Up to 3 years after End of Treatment (estimated).|Overall Survival (OS), OS is measured from the start date of the treatment period (at the D-14 lenvatinib + letrozole run-in phase) until date of death from any cause., Up to 3 years after End of Treatment (estimated).
