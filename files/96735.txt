BGB-A3055 Alone and in Combination With Tislelizumab in Participants With Solid Tumors
This study aims to evaluate how safe and well-tolerated the treatment is, how the body processes it, how it works on the tumors, and whether it shows early signs of fighting cancer in people with certain advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Key details of the study include:

* The study is expected to last about 36 months.
* Participants will receive treatment until they either no longer benefit from the treatment, experience side effects that are too severe, or choose to stop participating.
