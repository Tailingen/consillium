FOLFIRINOX vs FLOT Chemotherapy for Resectable Gastric or Esophagogastric Junction Adenocarcinoma
Patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach or the esophagogastric junction (II-III type by Siewert) without previous therapy will be treated with one of two chemotherapy combinations before and after surgery. One half of the patients gets 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel (FLOT), the others 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX). Main objective of the study is median overall survival.

538 Patients with resectable (cT4cN0 or cT1-4 and cN+, cM0) adenocarcinoma of the stomach or the esophagogastric junction without previous therapy will be included in this study. After randomization patients receive perioperatively 4 cycles FLOT or FOLFIRINOX, followed by a restaging of the tumour status and surgery. Subsequently another 4 cycles of FLOT or FOLFIRNOX are applicated.
