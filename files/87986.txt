Study to Investigate the Safety and Activity of Aldoxorubicin Plus Gemcitabine in Subjects With Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 study to investigate the safety and activity of aldoxorubicin plus gemcitabine in Subjects with solid tumors.
Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: aldoxorubicin|DRUG: aldoxorubicin|DRUG: aldoxorubicin|DRUG: gemcitabine
Safety Measures, The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary safety of administration of aldoxorubicin in combination with gemcitabine in subjects with metastatic solid tumors as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiograms (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scans, electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and weight., 14 months
Tumor Response, The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the activity of aldoxorubicin in combination with gemcitabine in this population, assessed by overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS)., 17 months
An open-label Phase 1b study to investigate the preliminary safety and activity of aldoxorubicin plus gemcitabine in subjects with metastatic solid tumors administered at doses of 170, 250 or 350 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion (IVI) on Day 1 every 21 days plus 900 mg/m2 gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days.
