A Clinical Study of BRCA and DNA Damage Repair Genes in Blood Samples of Chinese Pancreatic Cancer Patients
This study aims to know the status of BRCA and DDR genes in PDAC patients in China. Peripheral venous blood samples of the patients will be collected for next-generation sequencing of BRCA and DNA damage repair related genes. At the same time, it is necessary to record clinical information such as age, gender, tumor pathological type, tumor stage and grade, whether surgery is performed, the size of postoperative residual lesions, and treatment methods. Prognostic indicators include the association of factors such as PFS, ORR, and DCR are also recorded.
