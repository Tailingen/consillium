Head-to-head Comparison of [18F]F-PSMA-N5 With [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in PCa Diagnosis, Recurrence, and Metastasis
To prospectively evaluate the radiodrug biodistribution of a novel PET imaging agent \[18F\]F-PSMA-N5 in different organs of prostate cancer patients and its diagnostic efficacy in the diagnosis, recurrence and metastasis of prostate cancer, and to compare with \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11.

Standard uptake value(SUV), Standard uptake value(SUV) of \[18F\]F-PSMA-N5 and \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 for each target lesion of subjects., 30 days
Diagnostic efficacy, The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of \[18F\]F-PSMA-N5 and \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were calculated., 30 days|Number of lesions, The number of lesions detected by \[18F\]F-PSMA-N5 and \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT., 30 days
\[18F\]F-PSMA-N5 PET/CT was used for initial assessment of prostate cancer or detection of recurrence. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was used to evaluate tumor uptake. The sensitivity, specificity, the number and accuracy of lesions identified and the distribution of lesions in each organ were calculated and compared with those of \[68Ga\]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.
