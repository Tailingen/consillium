A Study of the Drugs Prexasertib, Irinotecan, and Temozolomide in People With Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor and Rhabdomyosarcoma
The purpose of this study is to test whether the study drug prexasertib is a safe and effective treatment for people with DSRCT or RMS when given in combination with the standard drugs irinotecan and temozolomide. The study will test different doses of prexasertib in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide to find the highest dose of prexasertib that causes few or mild side effects in participants.
Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor|Rhabdomyosarcoma
DRUG: Prexasertib|DRUG: Irinotecan
recommended phase II does of Prexasertib, The RP2D is defined as the highest dose level associated with not more than 1 DLT out of 6 patients. A total of 5 dose levels are planned, including 2 back up levels. The DLT's will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. The dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design., 1 year|response, will be evaluated in this study using the criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline, version 1.1 (Primary response criteria)54. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria., 2 years
