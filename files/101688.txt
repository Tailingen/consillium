A Study to Learn About the First and Later Lines of Medicines in Treating People With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC).
The purpose of this study is to learn about the effectiveness of the first and later lines of medicines on clinical outcomes in people with mRCC.

The study includes participants who:

* are 18 years old or above and have mRCC
* took medicines that use the bodies immunity to fight against cancer as their first choice of treatment
* took other medicines after taking the above first choice of treatment

This is a study that looks into the data collected through a particular database from selected academic clinical sites participating in this study. The data of interest include:

* the length of time between the start of a patient's treatment and the end of treatment
* the length of time between the start of treatment and death
* physician assessment of a patient's response to treatment

We will compare the experiences of people receiving different combinations of treatments and see if there are any differences in the effectiveness of these medicines.
