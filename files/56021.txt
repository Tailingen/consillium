A Study of Avutometinib and Defactinib in People With Thyroid Cancer
The researchers are doing this study to find out if the combination of avutometinib and defactinib is an effective treatment for RAF dimer-driven radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer or anaplastic thyroid cancer. The researchers will also test whether avutometinib and defactinib is a safe treatment that causes few or mild side effects.
