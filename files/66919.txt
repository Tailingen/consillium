Trial of Xeloda and Oxaliplatin (XELOX) as Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Surgery in Advanced Gastric Cancer Patients With Para-aortic Lymph Node Metastasis
Gastric cancer with para-aortic lymph node (PAN) involvement is regarded as advanced disease, and only chemotherapy is recommended from the guidelines. In unresectable cases, neoadjuvant chemotherapy could prolong survival if conversion to resectability could be achieved.
Advanced Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
The primary study end point was the response rate of preoperative XELOX followed by surgery in gastric cancer patients with PAN involvement, evaluation will be based on tumor assessment with follow-up, including chest and upper-abdominal During preoperative treatment period, CT scan will be performed every 6 -8 weeks (2 cycles after).After surgery, CT scan will be planned every 3 months, brain MRI and bone scan (ECT) will be performed if any suspected symptoms occur., 8 Months after the last subject participate in
progression-free survival (PFS), be based on tumor assessment with follow-up, including chest and upper-abdominal During preoperative treatment period, CT scan will be performed every 6 -8 weeks (2 cycles after).After surgery, CT scan will be planned every 3 months, brain MRI and bone scan (ECT) will be performed if any suspected symptoms occur., 40 Months after the last subject participate in|overall survival, out-patient clinic and telephone visit will be done every 3 months for the first two years, and every 6 months after two years, 3 years after the last subject participate in|Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety, Adverse Events will measure in the whole study according to CTC-AE 4.0, 1 year after the last subject finish the treatment
