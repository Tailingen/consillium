Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sintilimab
Pathological complete response, Total tumor regression rate under pathologyPrimary tumor or lymph node surgery specimen pathological examination without residual tumor cell, 4 weeks after surgery
Major pathological response, Total/moderate tumor regression rate under pathologyPrimary tumor or lymph node surgery specimen pathological examination without residual tumor cell, 4 weeks after surgery|Disease-free survival period, After surgery, there is no time for the disease to recur., 3-year|Incidence rate of adverse events, The ratio of the number of cases with adverse events to the total number of cases available for evaluation., 3-year
This study was designed as a single arm, phase II trial. Subjects will receive 3 cycles of Sintilimab combined with DCF as neoadjuvant therapy. The primary endpoint is pathologic complete response(pCR).
