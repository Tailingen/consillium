Safety and Tolerability of LDRT Plus Concurrent Partial SBRT and Tislelizumab in Patients with Bulky Tumors
This is a 3+3 dose escalation phase I study which aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) plus concurrent partial Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SBRT) and Tislelizumab in Patients with bulky tumors who have failed standard therapy. At least 9 participants will be enrolled in this study.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Tislelizumab|RADIATION: Low Dose Radiotherapy|RADIATION: Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy
Dose Limiting Toxicities, 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants who achieved a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1., up to 24 months after the enrollment|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Investigator assessed PFS according to RECIST v1.1. Progression free survival is defined as time of enrollment to first evidence of progressive disease., up to 24 months after the enrollment|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the difference (in months) between the date of study enrollment to the date death due to any cause, up to 24 months after the enrollment
This is 3+3 escalation phase I study which will be conducted in West China Hospital.

3 patients per cohort (a total of 9 patients) will be enrolled to observe the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended dose for expansion (RDE) for lung LDRT and partial SBRT.

All eligible patients will receive LDRT + partial SBRT and Tislelizumab at different dose levels (decried as below). Tislelizumab will be given at 200mg as recommended in the instruction manual every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, the patient withdraws informed consent, or Tislelizumab reaches a maximum of up to 24 months. Patients in the dose escalation will receive LDRT + partial SBRT at 3 cohorts with increasing dose levels: 6 Gy (2 Gy/f) + 24 Gy (8 Gy/f); 6 Gy (2 Gy/f) + 30 Gy (10 Gy/f); 6 Gy (2 Gy/f) + 45 Gy (15 Gy/f).
