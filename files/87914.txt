Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Pembrolizumab in Neoadjuvant Treatment of Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
Single arm multicenter phase II trial evaluating the role of Pembrolizumab in combination to Carboplatin-Paclitaxel chemotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer patients.
Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Taxol
2-years Progression-free survival, The combination of Pembrolizumab-chemotherapy is expected to increase 2-years progression free survival with respect to historical controls., 42 months
Overall survival, The combination of pembrolizumab- chemotherapy is expected to increase overall survival with respect to historical controls, 42 months|Clinical Response rate, The combination of pembrolizumab-chemotherapy is expected to increase clinical response rate with respect to historical controls, 42 months|Pathologic optimal response, The combination of pembrolizumab-chemotherapy is expected to increase pathologic response rate with respect to historical controls, 42 months|Adverse events, The combination of pembrolizumab-chemotherapy is expected to have an acceptable toxicity profile, 42 months|Quality of life, At baseline, every 3 cycles during the chemotherapy treatment phase, at chemotherapy completion, 6 months after chemotherapy completion, 1 and 2 years after chemotherapy completion and at progression, will be assessed the quality of life of patients according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and CX24. The questionnaires record in a scale from 1 (better outcome) to 4 (worse outcome) the physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social function of patients., 42 months|Immune-related gene signatures associated with response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, 1)Messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript profiling will be performed., 42 months|Immune-related gene signatures associated with response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, blood sample will be collected before cycle 1, before cycle 6 and at progression. CD3 cells will be isolated and CD4/CD8 ratio will be evaluated by FACS analyses., 42 months|Immune-related gene signatures associated with response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, serum levels of IL -2, IL-10; TGF- Beta and IL-6 will be assessed., 42 months|Immune-related gene signatures associated with response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, tumor biopsies at progression will be collected in order to determine the PD-1R infiltrating lymphocyte population before and after treatment., 42 months|Immune-related gene signatures associated with response or resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, single and dual staining IHC analysis of: OX40-OX40L; ICOS; PD1, PD-L1, PD2, PDL2 and CTLA-4; FOXP3 and CD4; CD95 and CD95L, 42 months
Patients with stage IB2-IIB cervical cancer will be treated with 3 cycles of neoadjuvant Carboplatin-Paclitaxel chemotherapy (Carboplatin AUC 5 d1 q 21+ Paclitaxel 175 mg/mq d1 q 21)+ Pembrolizumab (200 mg flat dose every 3 weeks).

After 3 cycles of neo-adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy patients non progressing will undergo radical surgery.

After surgery, patients presenting with high risk factors (positive lymphnodes, positive parametria, positive surgical margins or at least 2 of the following risk factor between tumor diameter \>3 cm, LVSI, stromal infiltration \>1/3) will receive 3 cycles of adjuvant Carboplatin-Paclitaxel chemotherapy + Pembrolizumab in combination and maintenance with Pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks until progression or unacceptable toxicity or patient consent withdrawal for up to 35 cycles.
