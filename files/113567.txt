INNATE: Immunotherapy During Neoadjuvant Therapy for Rectal Cancer
Determine the complete pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma.
Locally Advanced Rectal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: APX005M, mFOLFOX, and Radiation Therapy 5Gy x 5 days|DRUG: mFOLFOX and Radiation Therapy 5Gy x 5 days
Pathological Complete Response Rate, The primary objective of this study is to determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of the combined treatment modality., At time of surgery
Overall Survival, To evaluate overall survival (OS), defined as the time between date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause., 3 years|Toxicity analysis, To evaluate toxicity analysis comparing the experimental from the standard arm measured according to CTCAE v5.0., 3 years|Disease free survival, To evaluate the disease free survival (DFS) and patterns of failure at three years. DFS is defined as the time between the date of definitive surgery and the first date of documented disease progression or death., 3 years
Exploratory Immunological Response, To evaluate the immunologic response surrogates for patients tissue is obtained., 3 years
A phase II randomized trial 3:2 with short course radiotherapy followed by mFOLFOX chemotherapy prior to trans abdominal resection with or without an antiCD40 agonist antibody (APX005M). There will be continuous safety assessment for at least 6 patients. Planned accrual of 58 patients. An interim analysis after 30 patients have completed treatment and there will be early stopping criteria for futility or efficacy. Short course radiotherapy will consist of 5Gy x 5 to the pelvis and patients on APX005M arm will receive one infusion during radiotherapy course, have a two week break, then start FOLFOX with APX005M in conjunction with five out of six cycles of chemotherapy. Patients will be restaged and then undergo definitive surgery.
