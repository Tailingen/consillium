Study of SM-88 in Advanced Cancers
The purpose of this study is to collect response and pharmacokinetic data on the oral administration of a cocktail combination of 4 drugs being developed for the indication of metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: SM-88
Response Rate, Response data will be collected on SM88 in breast cancer. SM88 has previously been reported to have clinical benefit in a variety of cancers (J Clin Oncol 31, 2013. suppl; abstr e22095), 6-12 months|PFS, PFS data will be collected on SM88 in breast cancer. SM88 has previously been reported to have clinical benefit in a variety of cancers (J Clin Oncol 31, 2013. suppl; abstr e22095), 6-12 months
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], The safety of orally administered SM-88 will be assessed by collected adverse events data as determined by physical exam, laboratory parameters and subject questionnaire., 30 days|Blood concentration of SM-88, Blood sampling will be performed to establish the pharmacokinetic profile of SM-88. Time sampling will be at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5, 6, 8, 12, 48, and 168 hours post dose., 168 hours
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to assess the response rate and PFS in previously treated breast cancer patients. Additional objectives include the pharmacokinetics of multiple ascending doses of SM-88, a cocktail combination of 4 drugs being developed for the indication of metastatic breast cancer. Secondary objectives of this study include an assessment of safety and tolerability of ascending doses of orally administered SM-88. Additional response data will also be collected.
