Anti-angiogenetic Therapy With Radiotherapy for Pediatric Neuroblastoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Radiotherapy plus Endostar(Recombinant Human Endostatin) in patients with Pediatric Neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Endostar|RADIATION: 21.6Gy/12Fx to the tumor bed and 36Gy/20Fx to the tumor
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, first analysis will occur 1 month after accrual of all patients
Progression free survival(PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Overall survival (OS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Objective response rate (ORR), first analysis will occur 1 month after accrual of all patients
Clinical data proved that Endostar was a wild spectrum and safe antiangiogenesis factor which could suppress almost 65 kinds of tumor mass in animal models and affect about 12 percent human genome. So investigators design Radiotherapy plus Endostar to treat Pediatric Neuroblastoma to research the RR and safety. Investigators believe this treatment regimen may be a new approach to the pediatric neuroblastoma patients.
