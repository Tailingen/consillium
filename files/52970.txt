Transbronchial Needle Forceps for Endobronchial Ultrasound
Prove the feasibility of a needle forceps in patients with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes
Lung Cancer|Lymph Nodes
PROCEDURE: EBUS TBNF
Number of Participants with a positive biopsy result, 2 days after intervention
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, 3 weeks after
Patients with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes must be staged. The EBUS TBNA technique is an established technique. Unfortunately the size of the needle is limited to 21 gauge. With tne new designed needle forceps it should be possible to obtain more material and establish the diagnosis more often
