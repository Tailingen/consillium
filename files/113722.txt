Neoadjuvant Vemurafenib + Cobimetinib + Atezolizumab in Melanoma: NEO-VC
Evaluation of the efficacy, safety and biologic effects of neo-adjuvant treatment with vemurafenib + cobimetinib + atezolizumab in patients with limited metastasis of melanoma in stage IIIC/IV melanoma.
Malignant Melanoma
DRUG: Vemurafenib|DRUG: Cobimetinib|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Percent of patients who actually become resectable and are resected, Percentage of patients becoming operable after the combined treatment within 18 weeks. The primary research question is the difference of this observed proportion with verum-treatment in the study which is compared to an assumed/known proportion without treatment based on an estimation of the scientific community, Following 18 weeks of combined treatment
Progression free survival time after resection, Progression free survival time after resection, in the group who actually underwent complete resection, Following 18 weeks of combined treatment|Progression free survival, Progression free survival rates at 6 and 12 months after start of treatment, Following 6 and 12 months of combined treatment|Objective response, Rate of objective responses, Up to 29 months|Tolerability (Number of patients with adverse events and number of patients who prematurely discontinued treatment due to adverse events), Number of patients with adverse events and number of patients who prematurely discontinued treatment due to adverse events, Up to 29 months|Overall survival, Overall survival in the total study population, Up to 29 months|Progression free survival time, Progression free survival time in the total study population, Up to 29 months

* Changes in oncogenic mutation profiles by whole exome sequencing (WES)
* Changes in transcriptome profiles by RNAseq, Screening (pre-treatment) and following 18 weeks of combined treatment|Detection of differences in gene expression in blood samples, Differences in gene expression, oncogenic mutation/copy number alteration profiles, and oncogenic signaling pathway status by analysis of baseline blood samples:

Patients with hardly resectable/unresectable limited metastasis in malignant melanoma stages IIIC/IV (AJCC 2010) carrying the BRAF V600 mutation, in order to achieve operability are enrolled in the NEO-VC-study. The main aim of this study is to achieve operability in a higher percentage of patients by neoadjuvant treatment through shrinkage of the tumors. Patients with operable stage IV disease show an impressive survival benefit with long term (5 y.) survival rates around 30 %. Only a percentage of up to 20 % can presently be treated by complete metastasectomy. This percentage may be enlarged by pre-treatment with an efficacious antitumor drug.
