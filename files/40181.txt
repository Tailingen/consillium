XELOX Combined With Cadonilimab Versus XELOX as Neoadjuvant Treatment for Locally Advanced, pMMR Rectal Cancer
This is a two-arm, open label, randomized phase II clinical study. The aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cadonilimab (a PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody) combined with XELOX regimen in pMMR locally advanced rectal cancer during the perioperative period. Eligible patients will receive either Cadonilimab plus XELOX or XELOX alone for 4 cycles before and 4 cycles after surgery. The primary endpoint is the pathological complete response rate.
