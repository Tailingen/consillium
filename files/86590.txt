Adipose Tissue and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)(EIFFEL)
The purpose of this study is to collect data to help understand why some women develop Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) associated with decreased lower-body fat.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|Metabolic Diseases|Overweight
Difference of angiogenesis capacity in abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue, The angiogenesis capacity of each adipose tissue depot will be determine by an in vitro angiogenesis test., Day 7
Presence of biomarkers in abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue in obese and PCOS women, Measurement will be obtained with Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).

Identify different and similar biomarkers in obese and PCOS women, from abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue samples. Total RNA, micro RNA and DNA will be extracted from each type of cells using FACS-cell sorting analysis., Day 7|Difference in oxygen content of abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue, Adipose tissue oxygen content will be measured using the Licox CMP microprocessor., Day 6
The rates of carbohydrate oxidation, Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) will measure the resting metabolic rate/respiratory quotient (RMR/RQ) and substrate utilization.

Energy expenditure and respiratory quotient standardized for temperature, pressure, and moisture will be calculated at one-minute intervals, over 30 minutes., Day -7|The rates of lipid oxidation, Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) will measure the resting metabolic rate/respiratory quotient (RMR/RQ) and substrate utilization.

Energy expenditure and respiratory quotient standardized for temperature, pressure, and moisture will be calculated at one-minute intervals, over 30 minutes., Day -7
Epigenetics may represent a new regulator mechanism explaining gluteal vs. abdominal fat differences.
