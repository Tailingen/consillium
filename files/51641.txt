Personalizing Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy
This prospective, observational study will evaluate whether vitro testing of tumor tissue and white blood cells from patients with lung cancer who are being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other standard of care approaches, predicts clinical response to these agents.
Lung Cancer Stage IV
OTHER: Blood and tumor tissue analysis, Clinical response.
Anti-tumor immune response, Tumor antigen presentation and anti-tumor T-cell response, 12 months
Clinical response, Clinical response is defined as 50% or greater decrease of the sum of the products of two-dimensional measurements of lesions on imaging within the first year., 12 months for each subject|Tumor microenvironment, Tumor mutation burden from tumor genome landscape using DNA sequencing, tumor transcriptome with RNA sequencing, tumor infiltrating immune cells with flow cytometry, 24 months total study duration
Overall Goal: The long-term goal of this study is to predict whether checkpoint inhibitors will be effective in individual patients with solid tumors.

Objectives: In this pilot study to be conducted in ten subjects with lung cancer who are to receive checkpoint inhibitors, we will use cellular and molecular techniques to characterize

* tumor immunogenicity
* anti-tumor T-cell response
* effect of checkpoint inhibitors on antigen presentation and T-cell response, and
* the tumor microenvironment

Planned enrollment:

â€¢ Ten subjects with lung cancer

Methods for Informed Consent:

Investigators will approach subjects for informed consent
