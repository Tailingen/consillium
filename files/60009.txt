TAC Versus TC for Adjuvant Breast Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects (good and bad) TC or TAC has on early stage HER2- breast cancer.

3-year Invasive Disease-free Survival (IDFS) Among Analyzed ITT Patients, The primary objective of the study is to compare the 3-year invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) of adjuvant TC versus TAC as treatment for early stage HER2-negative breast cancer among analyzed ITT patients. ITT patients are all patients who were randomized, whether or not they followed protocol. IDFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to local recurrence following mastectomy, invasive local recurrence in the ipsilateral breast following lumpectomy, regional recurrence, distant recurrence, invasive contralateral breast cancer, second primary cancer (other than squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, melanoma in situ, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, colorectal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast), or death from any cause prior to recurrence or second primary cancer. Patients who have not had any such event at the time of data analysis will be censored at the last date they were known to be event-free., 3 years from randomization into study|3-year Invasive Disease-free Survival (IDFS) Among Per-protocol Patients, The primary objective of the study is to compare the 3-year invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) of adjuvant TC versus TAC as treatment for early stage HER2-negative breast cancer among per-protocol patients. Per-protocol only includes those patients who were randomized and received treatment as outlined in the protocol., 3 years from randomization into study
3-year DFS-DCIS, OS and RFI Among Analyzed ITT Patients, To compare disease-free survival-ductal carcinoma in situ (DFS-DCIS),overall survival (OS) and recurrence free interval (RFI) of TC with TAC. DFS-DCIS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to local recurrence following mastectomy, local recurrence in the ipsilateral breast following lumpectomy (invasive or non-invasive), regional recurrence, distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer (invasive or non-invasive), second primary cancer (other than squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, melanoma in situ, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, colorectal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast), or death from any cause prior to recurrence or second primary cancer. Patients who have not had any such event at the time of data analysis will be censored at the last date they were known to be event-free., 3 years from randomization into study|3-year DFS-DCIS, OS and RFI Among Per-protocol Patients., To compare disease-free survival-ductal carcinoma in situ (DFS-DCIS),overall survival (OS) and recurrence free interval (RFI) of TC with TAC among per protocol patients., 3 years from randomization into study|Number and Frequency of Participants by TOP2A Status by Study Treatment, To evaluate the effectiveness of TC and TAC in TOP2A altered (amplified, deleted, or overexpressed at the protein level) early stage HER2-negative breast cancer, 10 years (from baseline to end of study participation)|3-year DFS Stratified by TOP2A Among TC Arm, To evaluate DFS among TC in TOP2A altered (amplified, deleted, or overexpressed at the protein level) early stage HER2-negative breast cancer., 3 years from randomization into study|3-year DFS Stratified by TOP2A Among TAC Arm, To evaluate DFS among TAC in TOP2A altered (amplified, deleted, or overexpressed at the protein level) early stage HER2-negative breast cancer., 3 years from randomization into study
Both TAC (docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) and TC (docetaxel and cyclophosphamide) are established adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for early stage breast cancer. TAC, however, due to the inclusion of the anthracycline doxorubicin, carries a high risk of hematologic and cardiotoxic adverse effects. Substantial evidence supports the concept that early stage HER2-negative breast cancers will benefit similarly from anthracycline-based adjuvant and non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

Further, approximately 0 to 9% of HER2-negative breast cancers have alterations in the TOP2A gene, which may predict for benefit from anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

We hypothesize that 6 cycles of TC versus 6 cycles of TAC will have similar efficacy in the treatment of early stage HER2-negative breast cancer and that TC will have less toxicity. If this hypothesis were upheld and the anthracycline doxorubicin could be eliminated from the regimen while obtaining similar efficacy in this population of patients, it would not only be an important advance in the understanding of the biology of cancer, but it would also be of significant clinical benefit to women with breast cancer.
