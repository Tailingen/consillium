Cost-Effectiveness Study of PEG-rhG-CSF in Prophylactic Treatment of Neutropenia After Chemotherapy in Lymphoma
This is a pharmacoeconomic research to explore the cost-effectiveness of PEG-rhG-CSF and rhG-CSF in prophylactic treatment of neutropenia in lymphoma patients. It should provide more scientific basis for clinical decision-making.

Incremental Cost-Effectiveness ratio, A comparison of the different strategies based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is defined by the difference in costs between interventions, divided by the difference in their measured impact, 1 year
