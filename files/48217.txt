Differential Expression and Potential Value of c-MYC in Non-Invasive and Invasive Mammary Carcinoma
Retrospective observational study to evaluate c-MYC expression in non invasive and invasive mammry carcinoma
Invasive Breast Cancer
OTHER: no intervention
role of c-MYC in breast cancer, difference between expression of c-MYC in non invasive and invasive mammary carcinoma, 1 year
To correlate different levels of c-MYC expressions with variable clinical and pathological parameters of mammary carcinoma (such as patients' ages, tumor grading, staging, laterality, focality and nodal metastasis, co-existing in-situ components). This study will be carried out on archived formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissue blocks that were belonged to 70 women with breast lumps.
