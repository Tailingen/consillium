Study Impact on Outcome of Eltrombopag in Elderly Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction Chemotherapy
Phase II randomized placebo-controlled study to assess the impact on outcome of Eltrombopag administered to elderly patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) receiving induction chemotherapy. A phase II multicenter and randomized placebo-controlled study
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Eltrombopag|DRUG: Placebo
Overal survival rate, overall survival rate at month 12 (year 1) between the two arms, with or without 200 mg of Eltrombopag daily after induction chemotherapy., 12 months after beginning treatment
Response rate (CR and CRi) at day 45, At day 45|Leukemia Free Survival at month 12 (one year), relapse measurement before month 12, 12 months after beginning treatment|Long-term survival, Overall survival at 2, 3 and 5 years, 2, 3 and 5 years after first treatment administration|Percentage of patients with platelets count > 100 Giga/L at day 45, platelets count \>100 Giga/L, At day 45|Time to platelet transfusion independence, More than 3 days with platelets count ≥ 10 Giga/L, platelets count daily from baseline to the end of induction (day 45) and then at day 60, day 90, monthly until year 1 and finally at year 2, year 3 and year 5
Number of accident haemorrhage events ≥ grade 3, All accident haemorrhage event ≥ grade 3, Until day 45|Number of days with platelets count <10 Giga/L, Daily measurement of platelets count, from baseline to the end of induction (day 45) and then at day 60, day 90, monthly until year 1 and finally at year 2, year 3 and year 5|Number of platelets transfusion, from baseline to the end of induction (day 45)|Time to platelets count > 100 Giga/L, Daily measurement of platelets count, from baseline to the end of induction (day 45) and then at day 60, day 90, monthly until year 1 and finally at year 2, year 3 and year 5|Time to peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) counts > 0.5 G/L, Daily measurement of peripheral blood PMN count, from baseline to the end of induction (day 45) and then at day 60, day 90, monthly until year 1 and finally at year 2, year 3 and year 5|Time to haemoglobin counts > 8 g/dl, Daily measurement of haemoglobin count, from baseline to the end of induction (day 45) and then at day 60, day 90, monthly until year 1 and finally at year 2, year 3 and year 5|Time to red blood cells transfusion independence, Daily measurement of Red blood cells count and transfusion monitoring, from baseline to the end of induction (day 45) and then at day 60, day 90, monthly until year 1 and finally at year 2, year 3 and year 5|Eltrombopag-Emergent Adverse Events, Incidence and severity of Eltrombopag-Emergent Adverse Events utilizing National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTC) criteria v4.03, Until day 90|Evaluation of quality of life, EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30). The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.

Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., At baseline and at the end of induction (maximum up to day 45)
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive Eltrombopag or matching placebo, in double blinded.

To compare overall survival rate at 12 months between the two arms, with or without 200 mg of Eltrombopag daily after induction chemotherapy

Arm A : Eltrombopag 200 mg (100 mg/day for east Asian heritage) once daily from day 11 of induction chemotherapy to AML response evaluation or platelets count \> 100 x 10 Giga/L (maximum day 45)

Arm B : Placebo once daily from day 11 of induction chemotherapy to AML response evaluation or platelets count \> 100 x 10 Giga/L. (maximum day 45)
