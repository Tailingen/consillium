Iressa as a First-Line Treatment in Chemonaive Patients With Inoperable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess the overall response rate to Iressa as a first-line treatment in chemonaive patients with inoperable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Iressa
The primary objective of this study is to assess the overall response rate to Iressa as a first-line treatment in chemonaive patients with inoperable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, 2005~2007
To evaluate 1) Individual response rate 2) Time to progression 3) Overall survival (OS) at year1 4) Progression free survival (PFS) at year1 5) Toxicity, 2005~2007
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising target for anticancer therapy because it is expressed or highly expressed in a variety of tumors, including NSCLC.Furthermore, high levels of EGFR expression have been associated with a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients in several studies. EGFR-targeted cancer therapies are currently being developed; strategies include inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor by small molecules such as gefitinib (Iressa \[ZD1839\]; AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE). Iressa is an orally active, selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction pathways implicated in the proliferation and survival of cancer cells.
