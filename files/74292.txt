Safety and Efficacy of Daratumumab in Combination With Ixazomib and Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This study will assess the efficacy of daratumumab in combination with ixazomib and dexamethasone as second line treatment for relapsed Multiple Myeloma patients.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Daratumumab, Ixazomib, Dexamethasone
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a best response of PR or better, using modified IMWG criteria., From first day of treatment until end of study, documented progressive disease (PD), or death (approximately up to 36 months)
Evaluation of the hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity profile of the combination., Toxicities related to the administration of Daratumumab or Ixazomib will be assessed (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, peripheral neuropathy, rash, etc.)., From first day of treatment until end of study, PD, or death (approximately up to 36 months)|Duration of response (DOR), For patients who have not progressed, data will be censored at the last disease evaluation before the start of any subsequent anti-myeloma therapy., From the date of initial documentation of a response (CR, VGPR or PR) to the date of first documented evidence of PD, as defined in the IMWG criteria (approximately up to 36 months)|Time to disease progression (TTP), Time in months from first dose of treatment until PD., From C1D1 to the date of first documented evidence of PD, as defined in the IMWG criteria (approximately up to 36 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS), For patients who have not progressed and are alive, data will be censored at the last disease evaluation before the start of any subsequent anti-myeloma therapy. Relapse from CR by positive immunofixation or trace amount of M-protein is not considered to be PD and is not included in the PFS calculation., From C1D1 to either PD, according to the IMWG criteria, or death, whichever occurs first (approximately up to 36 months)|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is measured from C1D1 to the date of the patient's death. If the patient is alive or the vital status is unknown at the time of the analysis, then the patient's data will be censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive., From C1D1 to the date of death from any cause (approximately up to 36 months)|Time to next therapy (TNT), For patients who neither start a new anti-neoplastic therapy nor die, survival time will be censored at the date of their last available follow-up date. For a patient who does not have any post-baseline follow-up assessments and who has not died, survival time will be censored at C1D1., From C1D1 to the date of the next anti-neoplastic therapy or death from any cause, whichever comes first (approximately up to 36 months)|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity using Next-Generation Flow Cytometry (NGFC), MRD negativity rate is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a negative result of MRD. Patients without MRD assessment will be considered as having MRD-positive results., Assessed every 3 months post CR/sCR until PD (approximately up to 36 months)|Serum bone markers, NTX, CTX, bALP, RANKL, OPG, Dkk-1, SOST and serum angiogenic cytokines levels angiogenin, VEGF, angiopoietin-1 and -2., The evaluation will be performed on C1D1 and then every 3 months until PD (approximately up to 36 months)
This is a Phase 2, single-arm study of daratumumab in combination with ixazomib and dexamethasone as second line treatment for relapsed Multiple Myeloma patients initially treated with lenalidomide-based regimens. Daratumumab is a human IgG1Ä¸ monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to a unique epitope on CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein. It is a targeted immunotherapy that attacks tumor cells that overexpress CD38, in a variety of hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma. Ixazomib is an orally administered proteasome inhibitor with anti-myeloma activity.
