A Study of NWY001 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation study in patients with advanced solid tumors including 2 parts:

Part 1: Dose-Escalation Part Part 2: Dose-Expansion Part
Advanced Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: NWY001|BIOLOGICAL: NWY001
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Number of patients experienced any dose limited toxicity, Up to 21 days|Incidence of adverse events (AEs), Number of patients experienced AEs, Until 30 days after the last dose of the study drug
Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of patients who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined by the Investigator at local site per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, Until 30 days after the last dose of the study drug|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of patients who have a CR or PR or stable disease (SD), as determined by the Investigator at local site per RECIST 1.1, Until 30 days after the last dose of the study drug|Progression free survival (PFS), Time to progression as assessed by the Investigator at local site per RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause, Until 30 days after the last dose of the study drug|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetic profile of NWY001, From pre-dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug|Time to Cmax (Tmax), Pharmacokinetic profile of NWY001, From pre-dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC 0-inf), Pharmacokinetic profile of NWY001, From pre-dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug|Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Pharmacodynamic profile of NWY001, From pre-dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug|Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Pharmacodynamic profile of NWY001, From pre-dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug|Incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA), Immunogenicity of NWY001, From pre-dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug|Incidence of neutralizing antibody (NAb), Immunogenicity of NWY001, From pre-dose to 30 days after the last dose of the study drug
Part 1: Patients with advanced solid tumors that has relapsed from or is refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists will be enrolled in different cohorts.

Part 2: Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of NWY001 will be given to all patients enrolled in this part.
