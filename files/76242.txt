Efficacy and Safety Study of Olaparib in Combination With Paclitaxel to Treat Advanced Gastric Cancer.
This study is a phase III, multi-centre study of olaparib in combination with paclitaxel, compared with placebo in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer who have progressed following first-line therapy. Patients will be from China, Japan , Korea and Taiwan.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival, Time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause, Survival contact from the date of randomization and then every 8 weeks following objective disease progression and in the 7 days following OS Data Cut off (DCO); Time point(s) at which outcome measure is assessed up to 4 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Time from randomization until the date of objective radiological disease progression according to RECIST (v1.1) or death by any cause in the absence of progression. Objective progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the target lesions (compared to previous minimum sum) or an overall non-target lesion assessment of progression or a new lesion., Scans taken at baseline and then follow up assessments taken every 8 weeks up to Week 40 and then every 16 weeks until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 3 years|Number of Patients With Objective Response., Number of patients with objective response. Per RECIST 1.1, complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions since baseline; partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. Overall Response = CR + PR., Scans taken at baseline and then follow up assessments taken every 8 weeks up to Week 40 and then every 16 weeks until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 3 years|Number of Patients Objective Response, Number of patients with objective response. Per RECIST 1.1, complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions since baseline; partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. Overall Response = CR + PR., Scans taken at baseline and then follow up assessments taken every 8 weeks up to Week 40 and then every 16 weeks until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 3 years|Number of Patients With Deterioration of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Questionnaire Core 30 Item Module (QLQ-C30) Global HRQoL Scale, Number of patients with a clinically important deterioration in the global HRQoL score or death by any cause in the absence of a clincially meaningful symptom deterioration, Pre-treatment , Day 29 and then every 4 weeks until discontinuation, assessed up to 3 years|Time to Response, Time from randomization to the first onset of a confirmed objective tumour response, Scans taken at baseline and then follow up assessments taken every 8 weeks up to Week 40 and then every 16 weeks until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 3 years|Duration of Response, Time from the first documentation of CR/PR until the date of progression, or the last evaluable RECIST assessment for patients taht do not progress or progress after two or more missed visits, Scans taken at baseline and then follow up assessments taken every 8 weeks up to Week 40 and then every 16 weeks until objective disease progression as defined by RECIST 1.1, assessed up to 3 years
