BioPearl™ Microspheres Loaded With Doxorubicin for the Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
The primary objective of the study is to confirm safety and technical success of BioPearl™ microspheres loaded with Doxorubicin in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The secondary objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of BioPearl™ microspheres loaded with Doxorubicin in the treatment of subjects with unresectable HCC.

This is a prospective, single arm, multi-centre, post-market clinical follow-up study to further assess safety and efficacy in 50 subjects with unresectable HCC treated with BioPearl™ microspheres loaded with Doxorubicin. All subjects will undergo clinical follow-up until disease progression and/or next treatment option, after which subjects will be followed for survival. Subjects will be followed up to a maximum of 18 months. An intermediate analysis will take place during enrollment period on safety and technical success to support regulatory requirements.
