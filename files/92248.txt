SELF-CERV Pivotal Study: SELF-Collection for CERVical Cancer Screening
The goal of this method comparison study is to compare the detection of hrHPV collected using the Teal Wand Self-Collection device to hrHPV detected from HCP (health care provider) cervical collection using primary HPV testing assays.

Participants will be asked to use the Teal Wand to provide a self-collected sample prior to a healthcare provider collected sample to be tested for hrHPV. Secondary measure will include usability and preferences.
Hpv|HPV 16 Infection|HPV Infection|High Risk HPV
DEVICE: Teal Wand Self-Collection Device Group
Efficacy: Detection of hrHPV in self-collect and clinician collect samples, PPA/NPA (Positive Percent Agreement)/(Negative Percent Agreement) of hrHPV detection of self-collected and clinician collected samples, Samples tested within 7 days of collection|Safety: SAE rate, SAE rate is equivalent for both self-collect and clinician collect interventions, 6-14 days following collections
To demonstrate that participants who are representative of the intended use population can understand the Instructions for Use (IFU) and appropriately use the Teal self-collection device to collect adequate vaginal cells/material for use in primary hrHPV screening (primary outcome).

To produce sufficient primary hrHPV test results following self-collection, as compared to the current SoC method of HCP specimen collection, when paired samples are tested using FDA approved primary hrHPV assays (Roche cobas and/or BD OnClarity).

Primary Effectiveness Objective

â€¢ To evaluate the performance of a self-collect device for hrHPV detection as compared to standard of care (SoC) by:

* Agreement of hrHPV self-collected sample(s) as compared to HCP-collected sample results.
* Calculating the invalid rate of tested samples.
