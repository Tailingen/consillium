Comparison of Topical 5%Potassium Hydroxide vs Liquid Nitrogen in the Treatment of Plane Warts
ABSTRACT Objective: To study the efficacy while comparing Potassium hydroxide 5% with liquid nitrogen in treatment of plane warts.

Study design: Randomized-controlled trial (RCT), (Double-blind). Study setting and duration: Dept dermatology, CMH-Abbottabad, Nov-2022 / April-2023.

Methodology: The sample size of 60 patients (children and adults aged 4 to 30 years) was calculated using Openepi app sample size RCT calculator, after informed consent by using non-probability consecutive sampling technique. Patients randomly assigned into two groups i.e. In group-A 30 patients were given topical 5%-potassium hydroxide solution on affected area once at night upto 4 weeks and in group-B 30 patients treated with cotton bud method of cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen once every two weeks. Patients were reassessed at every two weeks and final assessment was done at 12th week whereas followed up for 3 months to monitor recurrence. Demographic information and frequency percentages were calculated for qualitative variables by using SPSS26. To determine statistical significance taking p-value \<0.05 as significant, and χ2-square test was used.
