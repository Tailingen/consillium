MAGE-A3 Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic in Patients With Progressive Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma
This study is being done to evaluate the safety and the clinical activity of MAGE-A3 Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic in patients with unresectable and progressive metastatic cutaneous melanoma.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: GSK Biologicals' Recombinant MAGE-A3 Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (ASCI) GSK1203486A
Number of Subjects With Any Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (ASCI) Related Grade 3/4 Adverse Events (AE), The assessment was made as per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, where Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE version 3.0 displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE, as follows: Grade 1 = Mild AE; Grade 2 = Moderate AE; Grade 3 = Severe AE; Grade 4 = Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5 = Death related to AE., During the entire study, up to 2.5 years per patient|Number of Subjects With Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)., SAEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity., During the entire study, up to 2.5 years per patient|The Rate of Objective Clinical Response., At the time of analysis.
The Rate of Stable Disease., At the time of analysis.|The Rate of Mixed Response., At the time of analysis.|Time to Study Treatment Failure., At the time of analysis.|Progression-free Survival., At the time of analysis.|Progression-free Survival After Initial SPD., At the time of analysis.|Documentation of Any Toxicity., During the entire study, up to 2.5 years per patient|Immunogenicity at Defined Time Points., At 13 defined time points.
