A Safety Trial of Nivolumab in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Progressed During or After Receiving At Least One Prior Chemotherapy Regimen
The purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence and characterize the outcome of high grade, select adverse events in subjects with advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with Nivolumab.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DRUG: Nivolumab
The Number of Participants With Treatment Related Select Adverse Events (Grade 3-4 and Grade 5), A treatment related adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that has a causal relationship with this treatment. The select AEs categories are those that are expected to be most commonly used to describe pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, rash, and endocrinopathies and hypersensitivity/infusion reactions. AEs are graded according to NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0) guidelines where Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening, Grade 5 = Death., From first dose and 100 days after last dose (last dose up to randomization for cohort B) (up to approximately 88 months)
Median Time to Onset of Select Adverse Events (Grade 3-5), The time from first dose to the first occurrence of any select adverse event of interest. An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The select AEs categories are those that are expected to be most commonly used to describe pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, diarrhea/colitis, hepatitis, rash, and endocrinopathies and hypersensitivity/infusion reactions.

An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.

AEs are graded according to NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0) guidelines where Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4 = Life-threatening, Grade 5 = Death., From first dose and 100 days after last dose (last dose up to randomization for cohort B) (up to approximately 88 months)|The Number of Participants Who Received â‰¥ 40 mg Prednisone Equivalents for Any Grade Select Adverse Events, The number of participants receiving \> 40mg prednisone equivalents for any select adverse event of interest. An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.

An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
