Trial to Evaluate the Safety of Talimogene Laherparepvec Injected Into Tumors Alone and in Combination With Systemic Pembrolizumab MK-3475-611/Keynote-611
This is a phase 1b/2, multicenter, open-label, basket trial to evaluate the safety of talimogene laherparepvec injected intrahepatically into liver tumors alone and in combination with systemic intravenous (IV) administration of pembrolizumab, in subjects with non-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) liver metastases from breast adenocarcinoma (BC), colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC), gastroesophageal cancer (GEC), melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in Part 1 Group A, and subjects with HCC with and without viral hepatitis in Part 1 Group B (viral hepatitis is only applicable in combination setting), and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intratumoral talimogene laherparepvec in combination with systemic pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), hormone receptor positive breast cancer, CRC, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in Part 2 Group A and subjects with HCC with and without viral hepatitis in Part 2 Group B. The objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the safety of intrahepatic injection of talimogene laherparepvec into liver tumors alone and in combination with systemically administered pembrolizumab for the non-HCC (Group A) and HCC (Group B) cohorts separately. Part 2 consists of 2-stage design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of talimogene laherparepvec in combination with systemic pembrolizumab. Efficacy and safety will be evaluated in each of the five non-HCC tumor types from Group A separately. Similarly, the efficacy and safety of the combination treatment will be determined for Group B HCC subjects. As of Protocol Amendment 6 (dated 26 October 2021), intrahepatic injections of talimogene laherparepvec and liver biopsies are no longer performed in this study. Enrollment for this study has stopped.
