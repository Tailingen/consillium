Study of miRNA-155 in Acute Leukemia
The leukaemias are a heterogeneous group of blood cancers, Acute leukaemia (AL) is caused by malignant proliferation of blood cells arrested at an immature stage of development, They are very aggressive diseases that run a rapidly fatal course if not promptly diagnosed and appropriately treated. Misdiagnosis is very common with delay in diagnosis and prompt treatment being the causes of high morbidity and mortality in acute leukaemias.

Although with the continuous improvement of clinical and laboratory diagnosis and treatment methods, the prognosis of AML has been significantly improved, but there are still about 70% of patients who cannot survive more than 5 years after diagnosis The activity of miRNAs in tumors is regulated by the same alterations affecting protein-coding genes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, genomic amplifications or deletions or mutations, abnormal transcriptional control, dysregulation of epigenetic changes and defects in the biogenesis machinery A typical chromosomal rearrangement is a chromosomal translocation, especially in hematological malignancies, in which it promotes tumor development and progression by the promoter exchange or by the creation of chimeric genes translated as fusion proteins. In Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients with myeloid/lymphoid leukemia gene (or mixed-lineage leukemia, MLL) rearrangement, by large-scale genome-wide microarray analysis, it was demonstrated that among 48 selected miRNAs, 47 of them are increased
