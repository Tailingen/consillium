A Study of Bone Marrow Transplantation Using Fully-Matched Relatives as Donors for Patients With Hematological Malignancies
This research study uses a drug called cyclophosphamide to decrease the incidence of GVHD in matched sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant. In doing so, the goal of the study is to increase overall survival.

DEVICE: Matched Sibling Allogeneic Transplantation
Number of Patients With Overall Survival, The primary objective of this prospective, phase II trial was to obtain an OS rate of \>60% at 1 year in patients undergoing a 2 step HSCT from an HLA compatible family donor. The \>60% threshold was selected as a composite efficacy measure as patients with any hematologic diagnosis, stage of disease, or age as old as 65 years were eligible for this treatment protocol., 1 Year after transplant
Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), 1 Year after transplant
This research protocol has been developed for patients undergoing matched-sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The patients who are treated according to this 2 step allogeneic HSCT protocol will receive cyclophosphamide to induce in-vivo tolerization of both autologous and allogeneic lymphocytes, followed by an allogeneic CD34-selected HSCT. The primary research questions relate to immune reconstitution, incidence of GVHD, and relapse in patients who receive lymphocyte treatment of this type in allogeneic HSCT and how it impacts overall survival.
