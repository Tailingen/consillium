A Study of Neoadjuvant Sutent for Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma
Study Hypothesis: Patients with local renal cell carcinoma who are treated neoadjuvantly with Sutent may show a radiologic response to the study drug (Sutent).

The study is looking at the neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) administration of Sutent in patients with localized kidney cancer. The purpose of this research is also to evaluate both the safety and effectiveness of Sutent in this patient population.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sunitinib Malate (Sutent)
To assess the radiologic response rate associated with 1 cycle of Sutent for neoadjuvant treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, 5 weeks
To assess the change in tumour vascularity in response to 1 cycle of neoadjuvant treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, 5 weeks|To assess the change in expression of the following tissue markers; PDGF-alpha, PDGF-Beta, Flt-3, VEGFR and c-KIT, as compared to pre-treatment biopsy tissue as well as to stage, gender and age-matched controls, 5 weeks|To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Sutent given preoperatively, 5 weeks|To assess late toxicities, time to progression, progression free survival, and survival, 5 weeks - 3 years|A DNA microarray will be used for gene expression profiling of the tissue harvested at biopsy and surgery to investigate differential expression profiles and their association with Sutent sensitivity or resistance, 5 weeks
Sutent will be given at 50 mg once daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 1 week rest period. The dosage may change during the cycle due to possible drug toxicities. The nephrectomy will then take place following a one-week washout period. After surgery, patients will have follow-up visits at 6 weeks and 3 months. Patients will be followed for 3 years after completions to assess late toxicities, time to progression and progression-free survival.
