Study of E7070 Combined With Capecitabine to Determine Efficacy and Recommended Dose of Combination in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Part 1: The primary purpose is to determine the recommended dose of E7070 in combination with capecitabine by dose adjustment. Part 2: The primary purpose is to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with metastatic CRC resistant to 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan.
Colorectal Cancer (CRC)
DRUG: E7070
To determine the recommended dose of E7070 in combination with capecitabine by dose adjustment;|to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy (in terms of response rate and progression-free survival) of the combination in patients with metastatic CRC.
Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of capecitabine and E7070 when administered in combination;|measure duration of response and stable disease; to measure median and one year survival.
Part 1: The primary purpose is to determine the recommended dose of E7070 in combination with capecitabine by dose adjustment. Part 2: The primary purpose is to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with metastatic CRC resistant to 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan.
