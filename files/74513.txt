A Phase 1b Study of Atezolizumab in Combination With Vemurafenib or Vemurafenib Plus Cobimetinib in Participants With BRAFV600-Mutation Positive Metastatic Melanoma
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib, dose-escalation and cohort-expansion study of atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \[PD-L1\] antibody) in combination with vemurafenib or vemurafenib plus cobimetinib in participants with BRAFV600-mutation positive metastatic melanoma. Enrolled participants may continue treatment until they are no longer experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator and in alignment with the protocol.
