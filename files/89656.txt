A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Immunogenicity of SCT1000 in Healthy Women Aged 18-45 Years
A total of 18000 healthy women aged 18-45 years old were divided into three age groups: 18-26 years old, 27-35 years old, and 36-45 years old. The experimental group and the placebo group were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1. All subjects enrolled in the upper arm deltoid muscle were injected with 3 doses of test vaccine or placebo according to the 0, 2, and 6 months immunization program.
