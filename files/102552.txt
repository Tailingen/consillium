A Clinica Study of Pyrotinib in Patients of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With HER2 Mutation
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pyrotinib in patients of advanced pre-treated Non-small cell lung cancer With HER2 Mutation.

To observe objective response rate (ORR) of pyrotinib in NSCLC With HER2 Mutation. To observe Progression free survival (PFS). To assess the overall survival (OS).

A secondary aim is to obtain safety information.

To explore the relationship between biomarkers and the toxicity/efficacy of Pyrotinib.
