Risk Reducing Salpingectomy With Delayed Oophorectomy as an Alternative to Risk- Reducing Salpingo-oophorectomy in High Risk-Women to Assess the Safety of Prevention - US Cohort Study
This is a prospective preference study that will evaluate non-inferiority of the innovative treatment (RRS with delayed RRO) as compared to the standard treatment (RRSO) with respect to high grade serous (ovarian) cancer incidence

To evaluate the non-inferiority of the innovative treatment (RRS with delayed RRO) as compared to the standard treatment (RRSO) with respect to high grade serous (ovarian) cancer incidence in BRCA1/2 gene germline mutation carriers., through study completion, an average of 1 year
The aim of the project is to evaluate RRS with delayed RRO as an alternative for RRSO in BRCA1/2 gene germline mutation carriers with respect to ovarian cancer incidence. We hypothesize that postponement of oophorectomy and consequent menopause to the age of 40-45 (BRCA1) or 45-50 (BRCA2) compared to current standard RRSO at age 35-40 (BRCA1) or 40-45 (BRCA2) will not lead to a significant increase in ovarian cancer risk.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate non-inferiority of the innovative treatment (RRS with delayed RRO) as compared to the standard treatment (RRSO) with respect to high grade serous (ovarian) cancer incidence in BRCA1/2 gene germline mutation carriers.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

Incidence of (pre)malignant findings in tubes/ovaries, perioperative morbidity and mortality, incidence of non-ovarian pelvic cancer, breast cancer, prophylactic breast surgery and uptake of risk reducing oophorectomy.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

Estimate high grade serous (ovarian) cancer incidence for innovative and standard treatments in BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D gene germline mutation carriers
