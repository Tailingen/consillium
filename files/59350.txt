Metabolic and Immunological Phenotyping in Patients With Cancer
An observational study to investigate cachexia in participants with non-haematological cancer.
Cancer|Non-Hematologic Malignancy
OTHER: Observational assessments
Serum cortisol level, Blood serum cortisol levels in weight losing and weight stable patients at baseline and Day 2, Change from baseline serum cortisol level at Day 2
A single-centre, non-randomised, observational study. This study will investigate the systemic metabolic and immunological changes that occur in cachexia. The aim is to better understand the mechanism(s) underlying weight loss in people with non-haematological cancer. This will help to facilitate future research to generate treatments to reverse weight loss and improve outcomes.
