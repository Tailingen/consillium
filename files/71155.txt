Study of ASP1948, Targeting an Immune Modulatory Receptor, in Japanese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety and pharmacokinetic profile of ASP1948 in Japanese patients with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors.

This study will also evaluate the antitumor effect of ASP1948.

Percent change in tumor size from baseline, Tumor size is defined as the sum of the diameters of all target lesions per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. The percent change from baseline in tumor size will be calculated for subjects with target lesions at baseline. The best percent change in tumor size is the maximum percent reduction from baseline, or if the subject has no reduction in size, the minimum percent increase from baseline., Up to end of treatment period (a maximum of 104 weeks)|Number of participants with best overall response (BOR)per RECIST 1.1 and 'immune' Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST), BOR is defined as the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment., Up to end of treatment period (a maximum of 104 weeks)
This study consists of 3 dose levels (1200 milligrams \[mg\], 2000 mg and 3000 mg) and enrollment of subjects into dose level 1200 mg will take place first. Dose level 2000 mg would only be opened if dose level 1200 mg is deemed tolerable. Dose level 3000 mg would only be opened if dose level 2000 mg is deemed tolerable.
