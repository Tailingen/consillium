Motiva Flora Tissue Expander PMCF
The Motiva Flora® Tissue Expander clinical study (hereafter Motiva Flora® TE study) is a 6-month, open-label, prospective, multicentre post-marketing follow-up study designed to confirm the Safety and Effectiveness/Performance of Motiva Flora® TE in breast reconstruction surgery.

The study will include 136 women, planned for staged breast reconstruction, in 6 countries (Spain, Belgium, France, Costa Rica, Chile and Panama). Breast tissue expansion and the final breast implant will be performed using devices from the Motiva Flora® TE catalogue.
