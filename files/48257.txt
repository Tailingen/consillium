Safety Study of a Recombinant Protein Vaccine to Treat Esophageal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the biological recommended dose of IMF-001.
Esophageal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: IMF-001
To evaluate the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities, type/frequency/degree of adverse events and NY-ESO-1 antigen-specific immune response of IMF-001 alone in patients with esophageal cancer., First 12 weeks (during the first 6 injections)
To evaluate clinical activity (tumor response and time to progression)., Up to 2 years, or until progression of PS or no positive immune response from IMF-001.
The prognosis of esophageal cancer is improved with the improvement of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, there are no standard therapies established for recurrent esophageal cancer. NY-ESO-1 antigen is expressed in 33% of patients. NY-ESO-1 protein is applicable without limitation by HLA types, and injected as a complex with cholesteryl pullulan (CHP), forming nano-particles (IMF-001), it can activate both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In this phase 1 study, the safety and the biological recommended dose will be determined.
