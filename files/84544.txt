"Embolization Before Ablation of Renal Cell Carcinoma (EMBARC)"
Multi-center, single arm, prospective trial to estimate safety, feasibility, technical outcomes, and clinical outcomes of percutaneous cryoablation with neo-adjuvant trans-arterial embolization of the tumor in patients with T1b renal cell carcinoma. Continuous safety monitoring will be performed with stopping rules for patient accrual or study continuation.
