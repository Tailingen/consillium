An Open Phase I Clinical Trial of SHR-1826 for Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open, multi-center, dose-escalation/dose-expansion/efficacy expansion phase I clinical study to evaluate the tolerability, safety, PK, and immunogenicity of SHR-1826 in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors, and to preliminatively observe its antitumor efficacy. The whole study was divided into three stages: dose increment, dose extension and therapeutic effect extension.
