Survival rate is defined as the time from the initiation of the first treatment to death from any cause., The time corresponding to a cumulative overall survival rate of 50%|Safety, Assessment of treatment-related adverse events using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 5.0) is conducted from the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy through 30 days post-completion of all treatments. Adverse reactions are defined as adverse events related to the investigational drug with a relationship deemed "definitely related/possibly related/unable to determine., From the commencement of neoadjuvant therapy until 30 days post-completion|Assessment of Quality of Life, The Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed at baseline and during follow-up using the European Organization for the Head and Neck Cancer Module (QLQ-H\&amp;amp;N35) version 1.0, which represent functions, symptoms, or health conditions. The European Organization for Cancer Research and Treatment QLQ-C30 （EORTC QLQ-C30）: a quality of life instrument for use in international clinical trials in oncology. The evaluation was performed before treatment, 15 minutes after each cycle of chemotherapy, and 3 and 6 months after the end of treatment. A total of 30 items are included. Each item is graded from 1 to 4, except for items 29 and 30, indicating not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much, with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life., Before treatment, prior to surgery, and within one week after all treatments are completed.
