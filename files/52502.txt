Study to Assess the Effect of AZD9291 on the Blood Levels of Simvastatin in Patients With EGFRm+ NSCLC
This is a Phase I, open-label, 2-part study in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (EGFRm+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) agent.

Part A will assess the effect of AZD9291 on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of simvastatin and simvastatin acid, following multiple oral dosing of AZD9291 in a fasted state.

Part B will allow patients further access to AZD9291 after the PK phase (Part A) and will provide for additional safety data collection. All patients from Part A who completed treatment may continue to receive AZD9291 80 mg once daily until: disease progression; they are no longer deriving clinical benefit; or any other reason.
