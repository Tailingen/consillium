SB-715992 in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Malignant Melanoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SB-715992, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well SB-715992 works in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma.
Melanoma (Skin)
DRUG: ispinesib
Response, 2 years
Toxicity, 2 years|Pharmacokinetics at day 1 of course 1 (day 1 of course 2 if dose is changed), 2 years|Molecular correlates on archival tissue, fresh tumor tissue, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PVMCs), 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of SB-715992, in terms of response rate, in patients with previously untreated metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma.
* Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the early progression rate and response duration in patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.
* Correlate pharmacokinetics with safety and efficacy endpoints of this drug in these patients.
* Correlate Î²-tubulin and kinesin spindle protein expression in tumor tissue with clinical outcomes in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

All patients are followed at 4 weeks after completion of protocol therapy. Patients with ongoing complete response, partial response, or stable disease are followed every 3 months thereafter until relapse.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-14 months.
