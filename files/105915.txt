Study of Navtemadlin as Maintenance Therapy in TP53WT Advanced or Recurrent Endometrial Cancer
This study evaluates navtemadlin as maintenance treatment for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC) who have achieved complete response or partial response on chemotherapy.

The study will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will evaluate safety and efficacy of two different doses of navtemadlin alongside an observational control arm to determine the Phase 3 navtemadlin dose. Part 2 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of navtemadlin Phase 3 dose compared to placebo.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Navtemadlin|DRUG: Navtemadlin Placebo
Part 1: To determine the navtemadlin Phase 3 dose, Safety review committee (SRC) will determine the navtemadlin Phase 3 dose for Part 2 based on safety data from Part 1, 12 months|Part 2: To compare progression-free (PFS) survival by independent review committee (IRC) between navtemadlin and placebo, PFS defined as the time from randomization to disease progression by IRC or death, whichever occurs first, 50 months
Part 1: To evaluate the treatment effect of navtemadlin on PFS by IRC and investigator assessment, PFS defined as the time from randomization to disease progression by IRC/investigator assessment or death, whichever occurs first, 50 months|Part 2: To evaluate the treatment effect of navtemadlin on the time to first subsequent treatment (TFST), TFST defined as the time from randomization to initiation of first subsequent anticancer therapy or death, whichever occurs first, 50 months|Parts 1 and 2: To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of navtemadlin, Will determine the Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), 1 day|Parts 1 and 2: To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of navtemadlin, Will determine the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), 1 day|Parts 1 and 2: To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of navtemadlin, Will determine the time of maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), 1 day|Parts 1 and 2: To evaluate the treatment effect of navtemadlin on the disease control rate (DCR), Best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) by IRC/investigator assessment among subjects with PR as best response from prior chemotherapy, 50 months
