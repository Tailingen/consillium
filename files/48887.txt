Study of Pembrolizumab/Vibostolimab (MK-7684A) in Combination With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Pembrolizumab/Vibostolimab Versus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Durvalumab in Participants With Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (MK-7684A-006)
Researchers are looking for new ways to treat people with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The goal of this study is to learn if people who receive the combination of vibostolimab and pembrolizumab (MK-7684A) live longer without the cancer getting worse and live longer overall than people who receive durvalumab.

Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 48 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 48 months
As of protocol amendment 4, participants receiving combination vibostolimab and pembrolizumab (MK-7684A) discontinued treatment due to lack of efficacy observed in other MK-7684A studies, and are given the option to transition to durvalumab therapy.
