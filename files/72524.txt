Fluorine F 18 Fluorodopa-Labeled PET Scan in Planning Surgery and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed High- or Low-Grade Malignant Glioma
RATIONALE: New imaging procedures, such as fluorine F 18 fluorodopa-labeled PET scan, may help in guiding surgery and radiation therapy and allow doctors to plan better treatment.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies fluorine F 18 fluorodopa-labeled PET scan in planning surgery and radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed high- or low-grade malignant glioma

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine correlation between 18F-FDOPA PET activity, MRI contrast enhancement, and high- or low-grade glioma biopsies.

II. To compare radiotherapy target volume delineation with and without 18F- FDOPA-PET metabolic imaging information to determine role of metabolic imaging in radiotherapy treatment planning.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine correlation between concordance of 18F-FDOPA PET activity, MRI contrast enhancement, and high- or low-grade glioma biopsies and patient outcomes including overall survival and progression free survival.

OUTLINE:

Beginning at no more than 1 week before biopsy and resection, patients undergo fluorine F 18 fluorodopa-labeled PET/CT scan and pre-operative MRI. Patients then undergo stereotactic craniotomy. Some patients may also undergo radiation therapy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every year for 5 years.
