A Clinical Study of the Safety and Effectiveness of an Investigational Cell Therapy Given With and Without an Investigational RNA-based Vaccine in Patients With Organ Tumors
This is a Phase I, FIH, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation trial with expansion cohorts to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of claudin 6 (CLDN6) chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) with or without CLDN6 ribonucleic acid lipoplexes (RNA-LPX) in patients with CLDN6-positive relapsed or refractory advanced solid tumors.

CLDN6 CAR-T is used as a general term to refer to CLDN6 CAR-T cells from the manual and automated manufacturing processes.

The trial consists of two parts.

The trial began using a manual CLDN6 CAR-T production process.

Part 1 is a CLDN6 CAR-T dose escalation in lymphodepleted patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CLDN6 CAR-T are defined.

Dose escalation with CLDN6 CAR-T cells from the automated manufacturing process follows an accelerated titration design, as opposed to the classical 3+3 trial design used for the dose escalation with CLDN6 CAR-T manufactured with the manual process.

In addition, an optional de-escalation dose level may be explored to further evaluate clinical safety and efficacy of CLDN6 CAR-T manufactured with the automated process.

Part 2 is a vaccine-modulated dose escalation using a bifurcated design until the MTD and/or RP2D of CLDN6 CAR-T + CLDN6 RNA-LPX are defined.

The trial started with a CLDN6 encoding uridine containing RNA formulated in lipoplexes (CLDN6 uRNA-LPX). In order to optimize CAR-T cell persistence in patients, an alternative RNA-LPX, CLDN6 modRNA-LPX, will be tested once the RP2D dose for CLDN6 CAR-T ± CLDN6 RNA-LPX is identified.
