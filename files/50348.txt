Effects of Exercise in Combination With Epoetin Alfa
The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of Epoetin alfa therapy (short term versus long term) with and without a home-based individualized exercise program that incorporated aerobic and strength resistance training for patients being treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral bloodstem cell transplantation (PBSC T) for multiple myeloma. The endpoints for the study included the number of attempts at and total number of days of stem cell collection, number of RBC and platelet transfusions during the transplantation period, time-to-recovery after transplantation, and response to intensive therapy for multiple myeloma.

Number of Red Blood Cell Transfusions Needed to Maintain Hemoglobin Levels (Short Term), The targeted hemoglobin level for each participant was 10-12 g/dl. This is the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions administered to participants, as part of the investigational therapy algorithm, in an attempt to alleviate the anemia caused by multiple myeloma and high-dose chemotherapy. The numbers of RBC and platelet transfusions were obtained from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences blood bank., up to 15 weeks|Number of Red Blood Cell Transfusions Needed to Maintain Hemoglobin Levels (Long Term), The targeted hemoglobin level for each participant was 10-12 g/dl.
