Prospective Study for Endometrial Carcinoma and Hyperplasia in Childbearing-age Women
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the effect and adverse side effects of membrane-inhibiting formula plus oral progestins as fertility-preserving treatment in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer and endometrial hyperplasia research questions：When taken with oral progestins, does the drug membrane-inhibiting formula shorten the time required for complete endometrial remission? What medical problems do participants have when taking drug membrane-inhibiting formula plus oral progestins? Efficacy, side effects, recurrence, pregnancy, and time to obtain pregnancy in different molecular classifications of POLE-mutated, mismatch repair-deficient(MMRd), p53 wild type(p53wt), and p53-abnormal(p53abn).

Participants will: Take drug membrane-inhibiting formula plus oral progestins every day Visit the clinic once every 3 months for checkups, tests, and hysteroscopy Keep a diary of examination results and pathology
