A Study of Bempegaldesleukin (BEMPEG: NKTR-214) in Combination With Nivolumab in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults With Recurrent or Treatment-resistant Cancer
The purpose of this study is to first, in Part A, assess the safety, tolerability and drug levels of Bempegaldesleukin (BEMPEG) in combination with nivolumab and then, in Part B, to estimate the preliminary efficacy in children, adolescents and young adults with recurrent or treatment-resistant cancer.

Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) - Part A, Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). DLTs were collected and evaluated for Part A within the DLT evaluation period, which started on Cycle 1 Day 1 (first dose) and ended at Day 42 (42 days after first dose of the study therapy)., From first dose to 42 days after first dose|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) - Part A, Number of participants with adverse events (AEs). An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 6 months)|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - Part A, Number of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs). SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event., From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 6 months)|Number of Participants With Drug-Related Adverse Events - Part A, Number of participants with drug-related adverse events. An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 6 months)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation - Part A, Number of participants with adverse events leading to discontinuation. An AE is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment., From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 6 months)|Number of Participants Who Died - Part A, Number of participants who died., From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 6 months)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) - Part A, Pharmacokinetics (PK) of bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab derived from serum concentration versus time data., From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 6 months)|Trough Observed Concentration (Ctrough) - Part A, Pharmacokinetics (PK) of bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab derived from serum concentration versus time data., From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 6 months)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration (AUC) - Part A, Pharmacokinetics (PK) of bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab derived from serum concentration versus time data., From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 6 months)
