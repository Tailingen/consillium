A Study Evaluating the Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of Venetoclax in Combination With Polatuzumab Vedotin Plus Rituximab (R) and Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Prednisone (CHP) in Participants With Untreated BCL-2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC)-Positive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
This Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter study evaluates the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of venetoclax in combination with Pola + R-CHP in previously untreated participants with BCL-2 IHC-positive DLBCL. Approximately 50 participants will be enrolled in this study in five consecutive cohorts each consisting of approximately 10 participants.
