Primary Breast Oligoprogressive Sites Treated With Radiotherapy to Obviate the Need to Change Systemic Therapy
This study assesses if metastasis-directed radiation therapy (Stereotactic body radiation therapy - SBRT) can delay a change in systemic therapy, and if circulating tumor cells in the bloodstream can help guide treatment options in metastatic breast cancer patients with progressive disease

Freedom from a change in systemic therapy, Freedom from a change in systemic therapy defined as no change in systemic therapy at 6 months after radiotherapy and patient survival at 6 months after radiotherapy. Treatment failure would indicate that there is no longer stability of systemic therapy (and thereby requires a change in systemic therapy to a different agent)., 6 months
