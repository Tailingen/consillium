Evaluation of the Safety and the Efficacy of Carfilzomib Combined With Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone (CCyd) or Lenalidomide and Dex (CRd) Followed by ASCT or 12 Cycles of Carf Combined With Dex and Len for Patients Eligible for ASCT With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma.
This study will evaluate the safety and the efficacy of carfilzomib combined with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (CCyd) or lenalidomide and dexamethasone (CRd) followed by autologous transplantation ASCT or 12 cycles of carfilzomib combined with dexamethasone and lenalidomide for patients eligible for ASCT with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. As a secondary endpoint this study will evaluate the best maintenance treatment between lenalidomide and lenalidomide combined with carfilzomib.

Four hundred seventy-seven patients, males and females aged \> 18 years, enrolled in several sites, will take part in this study.

The duration of the study is approximately 5 years.
