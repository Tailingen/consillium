A Trial of TH-302 in Combination With Doxorubicin Versus Doxorubicin Alone to Treat Patients With Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The purpose of this study is to determine whether TH-302 in combination with Doxorubicin is safe and effective in the treatment of Locally Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: TH-302 in Combination with Doxorubicin|DRUG: Doxorubicin
Efficacy of TH-302 in combination with doxorubicin, Efficacy will be determined by overall survival in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma previously untreated with chemotherapy compared with doxorubicin alone, 2 years
Safety of TH-302 in combination with doxorubicin in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma compared with doxorubicin alone, To investigate the pharmacokinetics of TH-302, Br-IPM, doxorubicin, and doxorubicinol in plasma, 2 years
TH-302 is designed to target the hypoxic regions of tumors which are generally located distant from tumor vessels. Doxorubicin has poor tissue penetration and targets the regions of tumors that are located in proximity to the tumor vessels. The presence of hypoxia in solid tumors is associated with a more malignant phenotype and resistance to chemotherapy. The hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, is designed to selectively target the hypoxic microenvironment. Soft tissue sarcomas have evidence supporting the presence of hypoxia based on pO2 histography, F-MISO and gene expression profiling. There is an absence of therapeutic options for subjects with soft tissue sarcoma. Combining doxorubicin with TH-302 may enable the targeting of both the normoxic and hypoxic regions of soft tissue sarcoma.
