A Phase I, 2-part (Part 1 Being a Single Dose Escalation and Part 2, a Parallel Group) Study of Toll-like Receptor (TLR4) Agonist (GSK1795091) in Healthy Subjects
This study is an ascending dose first-time-in-human study to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic (PD), and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of GSK1795091 in healthy subjects. The results will support the design of future clinical trials of GSK1795091 administered to subjects with advanced malignancies in combination with immune system modulators.

Part 1 will be a randomized, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), placebo-controlled, single center, single dose escalation, sequential group evaluation of intravenously administered GSK1795091 to evaluate the safety and tolerability in healthy subjects. Part 2 will be an open-label, parallel group evaluation of 2 doses of GSK1795091 administered, either 1 week apart (Part 2, Cohort 1) or 2 weeks apart (Part 2, Cohort 2). In Part 2, on Day 1, subjects will receive intravenous GSK1795091 at a dose determined by results from Part 1. The total duration of this study is approximately 10 weeks from screening to the last study visit.

The results will support the design of future clinical trials of GSK1795091 administered to subjects with advanced malignancies in combination with immune system modulators.

Part 1 will be a randomized, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), placebo-controlled, single center, single dose escalation, sequential group evaluation of intravenously administered GSK1795091 to evaluate the safety and tolerability in healthy subjects. Part 2 will be an open-label, parallel group evaluation of 2 doses of GSK1795091 administered, either 1 week apart (Part 2, Cohort 1) or 2 weeks apart (Part 2, Cohort 2). In Part 2, on Day 1, subjects will receive intravenous GSK1795091 at a dose determined by results from Part 1.
