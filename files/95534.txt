4D Image-guided Adaptive Radiotherapy for Lung Cancer: Patient Image Acquisition
This clinical trial studies 4-dimensional (4-D) image-guided radiation therapy treatment planning in patients with stage I-IV non-small cell lung cancer. Computed tomography (CT) scans and treatment-planning systems may help in planning radiation therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. This is not a therapy study. Therefore no direct benefit from participating is expected. However, at the discretion of the treating physician, the information gained from the additional imaging will be used to improve treatment accuracy. No patient outcome data are gathered or analyzed by this study. This study is not a:Phase I, II, or III trial, trial with "blinded" treatment arm, gene or a vaccine trial, or a multi-institutional trial.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: 4-dimensional computed tomography
At least 1 mm reduction in overall systematic error corresponding with ≥ 2 mm CTV-PTV margin reduction, Up to 7 years|At least 5 Gy reduction in mean lung dose, up to 7 years|At least 5% reduction in absolute pneumonitis risk (≥ grade 2), up to 7 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Quantify the magnitude and distribution of inter- and intrafraction anatomic variations, including the temporal stability of the tumor/respiration signal correlation.
* Improve the acquisition and reconstruction of 4D CT scan images by advancing the 4D CT scan data collection process and evaluating 4D CT scan image reconstruction using different respiratory inputs.
* Quantify the uncertainty of deformable image-registration algorithms.
* Develop and investigate the efficacy of inter- and intrafraction probabilistic planning-based 4D image-guided adaptive radiotherapy (IGART) strategies for clinical application.
* Determine the expected geometric, dosimetric, and radiobiological improvements from the 4D IGART system.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo insertion of ≥ 1 small radio-opaque marker into (or in the vicinity of) the primary lesion or suspect lymph nodes via bronchoscopy. X-rays are performed to document the position of the markers.

Patients undergo 4D CT scan before each radiotherapy session and once a week after a radiotherapy session. Patients also undergo x-ray imaging before and during radiotherapy, optical and internal marker motion recording before and after radiotherapy, and audiovisual feedback during radiotherapy.

Patients undergo image-guided adapted radiotherapy based on these data.
