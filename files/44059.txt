Phase Ⅲ Trial of WBRT Versus Erlotinib Concurrent Whole-brain Radiation Therapy as ﬁrst-line Treatment for Patients With Multiple Brain Metastases From Non-small-cell Lung Cancer(ENTER): a Multicentre, Open-label, Randomised Study
1. Verify the effect of Erlotinib concurrent whole-brain radiation therapy as ﬁrst-line treatment for patients with multiple brain metastases from non-small-cell lung cancer to compare with WBRT alone.
2. Verify pre-built EGFR mutation prediction model for NSCLC brain metastases
Multiple Brain Metastases|Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Erlotinib|DRUG: WBRT
Time to neurologic progression, A) assess the local control of brain metastases status (including: the proportion of salvage therapy, the proportion of radiation necrosis lesions)

B) evaluation of intracranial metastasis status (at the site of the primary tumor than the emergence of new brain metastases), 13 months
Overall Survival, 3 years|Complete response, Partial response, Stable disease, Progressive disease, 19 months|Quality of Life, 3 years
The purpose of exploring, 1. Focal EGFR 1 certification pre built NSCLC mutation prediction model of brain metastasis.
2. Blood sample was collected for patients with Erotinib biomarker research., 3 years
All patients will be randomized to receive WBRT or Erlotinib concurrent WBRT. Erlotinib concurrent WBRT, patients were given a loading dose of erlotinib 150mg per day for 6 days, after which all patients received erlotinib 150mg per day concurrently with WBRT. Dose reduction was allowed for intolerable adverse effects (grade ≥3) such as rash or diarrhea in 50 mg increments down from 150mg to 100 mg and then to 50 mg if needed. Radiation therapy was delivered in 2.0 Gy fractions once per day 5 days per week to a total dose of 40Gy (20 fractions). Radiation was delivered as opposed lateral 8-MV beams with a Sweden precise linear accelerator.
