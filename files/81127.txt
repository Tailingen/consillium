Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility Reykjavik Study
5764 men and women in Iceland, aged 66 to 96 years entered the Ages Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) - Reykjavik Study. Serum 25(OH)D was measured in 5,519 of all 5,764 (96%) participants at study entry in year 2002 through 2006. The main emphasis was on exploring whether pre-diagnostic serum levels of 25(OH)D were associated with survival after cancer diagnosis.

Overall survival, The association between pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D levels in cancer patients and overall survival, From date of diagnosis until death or censored at end of the follow-up (December 31, 2014)|Cancer survival, The association between pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D levels in cancer patients and cancer survival, From date of diagnosis until cancer death or censored at the end of the follow-up (December 31, 2014)
Cancer diagnosis, The association between pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D levels and cancer risk, From date of blood draw (study entry) until cancer diagnosis, death or end of the observation period (December 31, 2014) whichever occurred first
