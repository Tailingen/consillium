A Long-term Extension Study of PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib)
The purpose of this study is to collect long-term safety and efficacy data for participants treated with ibrutinib and to provide ongoing access to ibrutinib for participants who are currently enrolled in ibrutinib studies that have been completed according to the parent protocol, are actively receiving treatment with ibrutinib, and who continue to benefit from ibrutinib treatment.

DRUG: Ibrutinib
Number of participants affected by an adverse event, Up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or until the start of a subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy, if earlier
Number of participants with change in disease status, Up to the end-of-treatment visit (up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication), or until the start of a subsequent anti-caner therapy, if earlier
This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study designed to collect long-term safety and efficacy data and provide ibrutinib access to participants in completed ibrutinib studies. PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) is a first-in-class, potent, orally-administered, covalently-binding small molecule inhibitor of bruton's tyrosine kinase. "PCI-32765" and "ibrutinib" refer to the same molecule; hereafter, "ibrutinib" will be used. Participants will continue with the current ibrutinib dosing regimen established in the parent ibrutinib study until the investigator determines that the participant is no longer benefitting from treatment (ie, disease progression or unacceptable toxicity has occurred), the participant withdraws consent, alternative access to ibrutinib is available and feasible (example, participant assistance program or commercial source of ibrutinib), or for other reasons as defined in the protocol, or until the end of the study, whichever occurs earlier. Safety will be monitored throughout the study and summarized. Efficacy may be analyzed in combination with the data collected in the parent protocol. There is no formal hypothesis testing planned for this long-term extension study. Participants for whom alternative access to ibrutinib is not available and feasible can receive treatment with single-agent ibrutinib until end of study, which is defined as the time when all participants still receiving study treatment have transitioned to commercial or alternative access to ibrutinib, have stopped receiving ibrutinib treatment, or upon a decision by the sponsor to terminate the study, whichever occurs earlier.
