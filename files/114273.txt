Atezolizumab in Combination With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) and Surgery for Relapsed Osteosarcoma
This study aims to determine the safety and tolerability of combined Atezolizumab, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), and surgical resection of pulmonary metastases in patients with pulmonary recurrence of osteosarcoma

PROCEDURE: Surgical Resection|RADIATION: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Number of participants with Dose limiting toxicity at Dose Level 1, If 6 participants have been enrolled and evaluated, and only 0 or 1 have experienced a DLT, the next participant will be enrolled at Dose Level 2, Baseline, end of 1 year|Number of participants with Dose limiting toxicity at Dose Level 2, If 6 participants have been enrolled and evaluated, and only 0 or 1 have experienced a DLT, enrollment will be terminated, and accrual determined complete., Baseline, end of 1 year
Disease Control Rate, The DC rate is defined as the number of patients without disease progression during the first 12 months after enrollment., Baseline, at 12 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first dose of Atezolizumab to disease relapse, disease progression, or death from any cause, Baseline, through study completion (an average of 1 year)|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from first dose of Atezolizumab to death from any cause. Subjects who are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up, Baseline, through study completion (an average of 1 year)
The overall survival at 5 years after recurrence of OS ranges from 16% to 23% in most studies, highlighting the need for novel treatment approaches. Aggressive surgical resection is the standard of care for resectable osteosarcoma recurrences limited to the lung. While previous studies testing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in osteosarcoma have shown limited efficacy, preclinical osteosarcoma studies demonstrate improved outcomes when ICIs are combined with radiation and administered with minimal residual disease. The proposed research will be a single-arm, safety pilot evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of Atezolizumab in combination with SBRT and surgery in patients with resectable, lung-only recurrence of osteosarcoma.
