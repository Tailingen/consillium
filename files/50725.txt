Objective response rate (ORR), the proportion of patients with tumor shrinkage with CR and PR over 4 weeks., every 8 weeks during treatment
Disease control rate（DCR）, The proportion of patients with CR, PR and SD., every 8 weeks during during treatment|Progression-free survival （PFS）, PFS was defined as the time from random assignment to progression or death. Patients alive who had not experienced progression as of the analysis cutoff date were censored at the last disease assessment., every 8 weeks during treatment|Overall survival（OS）, OS was defined as the time from random assignment to death. For patients alive at the data cutoff date, OS was censored at the last follow-up date., every 8 weeks during treatment
