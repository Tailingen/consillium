Phase I/II Feasibility Study Combining Brentuximab Vedotin With Second Line Salvage Chemotherapy (DHAP) in Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients
To combine Brentuximab Vedotin with Dexamethasone, AraC and Cisplatin (DHAP) chemotherapy in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) refractory to first line chemotherapy or in first relapse is expected to induce a significantly higher (metabolic) complete remission (CR) rate prior to consolidation with BEAM, as judged by FDG (18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose)-PET negativity. This will be compared with published data on DHAP salvage only. Increasing the metabolic CR rate prior to consolidation with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is expected to improve progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
