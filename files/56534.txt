Web-Mediated Risk Assessment for Endoscopic Screening of Gastric Cancer
Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China. Early detection is critical for gastric cancer management. However, the diagnosis rate of patients with early gastric cancer is still low. Therefore, the investigator design this study to access whether pre-endoscopic screening risk assessment of genetic and environmental risk factors could improve early gastric cancer diagnosis rate.
