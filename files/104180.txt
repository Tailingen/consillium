Study of Atezolizumab in Combination With Cobimetinib in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of coadministration of intravenous (IV) dosing of atezolizumab (an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \[anti-PD-L1\] antibody) and oral dosing of cobimetinib in participants with metastatic or locally advanced cancer for which no standard therapy exists.
