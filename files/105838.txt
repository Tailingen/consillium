Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Prophylactic LMWH by Thromboelastography
This study aims to evaluate the necessity and effectiveness of using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for prophylaxis in the postoperative period in patients who underwent lobectomy due to malignancy, using thromboelastography.Blood samples taken from the patients before low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis (preoperative), before prophylaxis in the postoperative period (postoperative day 1) and after the start of postoperative prophylaxis (postoperative day 3) will be examined by thromboelastography.
