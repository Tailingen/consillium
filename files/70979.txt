A Study to Evaluate Glofitamab Monotherapy and Glofitamab + Chemoimmunotherapy in Pediatric and Young Adult Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Mature B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of glofitamab, as monotherapy and in combination with a standard chemoimmunotherapy regimen: rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (R-ICE) in pediatric and young adult participants with relapsed and refractory (R/R) mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).
