Efficacy and Safety of a Solution for Endoscopic Mucosal Resection of Colonic Lesions
The objetive of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a solution for endoscopic mucosal resection of colonic lesions in patients undergoing endoscopic resection procedures.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does the investigational solution improve the efficacy of endoscopic mucosal resection compared to standard practice? Is the investigational solution safe for use in colonic lesion resection procedures?

Researchers will compare the investigational solution (Demirex) to a standard or placebo solution to see if it improves procedural outcomes and safety profiles.

Participants will undergo endoscopic mucosal resection using either the investigational solution or the comparator, and will be monitored for procedural success, safety, and any adverse events.
