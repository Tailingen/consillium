Bronchoscopic ICG Injection and Percutaneous Hook-wire Techniques for Preoperative Lung Nodule Localization in VATS
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transbronchial ICG and percutaneous hook-wire assisted Video-assisted thoracoscopic sublobar resection. In the control group, CT-guided percutaneous hook-wire preoperative localization will be used for surgical resection; In the experimental group, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy guided transbronchial ICG injection will be performed for localization before VATS.

DEVICE: Indocyanine green (ICG)|DEVICE: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy|DEVICE: Hook wire
Success rate of the localization procedure, Calculated as follows: (number of successful targeting procedures/number of all localization procedures)\*100, On the 1 day of localization operation|Success rate of the effective localization, Calculated as follows: \[(number of successful targeting procedures-number of dislodgements or unrecognized in the operative field)/number of all localization procedures\]\*100, On the 1 day of VATS operation|Success rate of VATS sublobar resection, Calculated as follows: (number of successful VATS procedures/number of all localization procedures)\*100, On the 1 day of VATS completion
Safety endpoint, Complication rate of two localization methods, including pneumothorax, hemorrhage, etc., On the 1 day of VATS operation|Localization time, The localization time of the control group was defined as the time from the first CT scan which set the path for percutaneous puncture, to the last CT scan which confirmed the hook wire located at the expected site.

The localization time of the experimental group was defined as the time from the insertion of bronchoscope to the glottis, to the withdrawal of bronchoscope from the glottis after ICG injection., On the 1 day of localization operation|Operation time of VATS sublobar resection, The operation time is defined as the time from the start of the skin incision to the completion of the suture of the skin., On the 1 day of VATS completion
This is a single-center, prospective, randomized trial initiated by the investigator. Subjects with pulmonary nodules who will undergo Video-assisted thoracoscopic sublobar resection will be randomly divided into two groups. In the experimental group, before the VATS operation, transbronchial ICG injection will be guided by electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy to locate the nodule. In the control group, the subject will undergo CT guided hook-wire placement for nodule localization before VATS. The study is expected to enroll 188 patients. Finally, the effectiveness and safety of the two methods will be compared.
