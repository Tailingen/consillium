A Clinical Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of HLX10 Combined With Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Cervical Cancer Who Have Progressive Disease or Intolerable Toxicity After First-Line Standard Chemotherapy
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicentre, phase II clinical study.Subjects can only enter this study after they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.All enrolled patients will receive the treatment with HLX10 combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel, every 3 weeks, until progressive disease, initiation of new anti-tumour therapy, death, intolerable toxicity. Albumin-bound paclitaxel may be used for up to 6 cycles and HLX10 for up to 2 years.
