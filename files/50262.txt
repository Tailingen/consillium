A Study to Compare Iberdomide Maintenance Versus Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy Following Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Participants With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of iberdomide maintenance to lenalidomide maintenance therapy after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM).
