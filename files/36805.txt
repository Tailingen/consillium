Study of BCMA CAR-T in Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to infusion BCMA CAR-T cells to the patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma(MM), to assess the safety and feasibility of this strategy. The CAR enables the T cell to recognize and kill the MM cells through the recognition of BCMA, a protein expressed of the surface of the malignant plasma cells in MM patients.
