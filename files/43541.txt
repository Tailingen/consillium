Trabectedin for Recurrent Grade II/III Meningioma
The aim of this study is to collect data on activity, toxicity and quality of life of trabectedin therapy in patients with recurrent high-grade meningioma.
Recurrent High Grade Meningioma
DRUG: Trabectedin|OTHER: Local standard of care
Progression Free Survival (PFS), From the date of randomization until the date of first objective progression or the date of patient's death whichever occurs first
Progression Free Survival at 6 months (PFS-6), median PFS (mPFS), From the date of randomization until the date of first objective progression or the date of patient's death whichever occurs first|Best overall response (BOR). Objective response (CR/PR), rate and median duration. Complete response (CR), rate and median duration., From the date of randomization until disease progression|Overall survival (OS), OS probability at 6 (OS6) and 12 months (OS12), median OS (mOS), From the date of randomization up to the date of death, up to 12 months|Safety (CTCAE v.4.0), From randomization up to 30 days after administration of the last dose of protocol treatment or until the start of a new antitumor therapy, whichever occurs first.|Health-related Quality of life (HRQol), Untill six months after randomization
This is a randomized open label multicenter comparative phase II trial. The objective of the study is to investigate whether trabectedin demonstrates sufficient antitumor activity against recurrent grade II or III to justify further investigation in phase III or as adjuvant therapy for newly diagnosed disease after resection and radiotherapy.
