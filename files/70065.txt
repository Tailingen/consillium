This is a randomized, observer blinded, active controlled, multicenter clinical study.

A total of approximately 1,260 healthy female participants aged 18 to 45 years old who meet eligibility will be enrolled, and be randomly assigned into 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio.

Immunogenicity: Blood samples (5.0 mL each time) will be collected for all participants prior to the 1st dose of vaccination and on 1, 6, 12, 18 months after full vaccination for anti-HPV type 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 neutralizing antibodies and Immunoglobulin G antibodies testing.

Safety evaluation (for all participants):To assess solicited (local and systemic) Adverse Event (AEs) within 7 days after each dose of vaccination, unsolicited Adverse Event (AEs) within 30 days after each dose of vaccination, and Serious Adverse Event (SAEs) from 1st dose to 18 months after full vaccination.

Collection of pregnancy events:To assess the occurrence of pregnancy events in all participants from 1st dose to 18 months after full vaccination. The subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy.

At the end of the pregnancy, be it a full-term or premature birth, information on the status of the newborn(s) will be followed up during the first 12 months of life.
