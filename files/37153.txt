Stellate Ganglion Block for Hot Flushes in Men Treated With ADT
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is widely used as standard therapy in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. Hot flushes and night sweats are one of the main side-effects of ADT. There are no successful and well-tolerable treatment options available. A possible treatment for hot flushes is stellate-ganglion block (SGB), used as a means of interrupting parts of the sympathetic nervous system involved in temperature regulation.

Objective of this study:

To assess the short-term efficacy of stellate ganglion block on hot flush reduction versus sham procedure
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Stellate ganglion block|PROCEDURE: Sham procedure
Hot flush score, 4 weeks
