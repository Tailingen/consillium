A Phase 3 Study of Rusfertide in Patients With Polycythemia Vera
The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rusfertide in subjects with polycythemia vera (PV) in maintaining hematocrit control and in improving symptoms of PV.
Polycythemia Vera
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Rusfertide
Proportion of subjects achieving a response who receive rusfertide compared to placebo., Response is defined as absence of phlebotomy eligibility., Week 20 through Week 32
Comparison of mean number of phlebotomies between rusfertide and placebo., Week 0 to Week 32|Proportion of subjects with HCT values <45% for rusfertide and placebo., Week 0 to Week 32|Comparison mean change from baseline in total fatigue score based on PROMIS Short Form between rusfertide and placebo., Week 32|Comparison of mean change from baseline in total MFSAF total score., Week 32
Phase 3 study in approximately 250 subjects previously diagnosed with polycythemia vera (PV) who require phlebotomy on a routine basis. There is a 32-week period during which rusfertide or placebo will be added-on to each subject's ongoing therapy for polycythemia vera which may include phlebotomy only or phlebotomy plus stable doses of either of hydroxyurea, interferon and/or ruxolitinib. All subjects who successfully complete the double blind 32-week portion of the study will receive rusfertide for 124 weeks. Approximately 6 and 12 months after their last dose of rusfertide, subjects will have a post-study contact (e.g. by phone) for safety.
