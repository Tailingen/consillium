TAME: A Pilot Study of Weekly Paclitaxel, Bevacizumab, and Tumor Associated Macrophage Targeted Therapy (Zoledronic Acid) in Women With Recurrent, Platinum-resistant, Epithelial Ovarian, Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancer
This is a randomized pilot trial of weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab with or without zoledronic acid in women with platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer with 1-2 prior regimens for recurrence.
Epithelial Ovarian|Fallopian Tube|Primary Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel/Bev (control)|DRUG: Paclitaxel/Bev + ZA (experimental)
To assess macrophage counts by image cytometry in women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab and ZA relative to weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

-To assess macrophage counts by image cytometry in women with platinum resistant ovarian cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab and ZA relative to weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab. The primary endpoint is the percentage changes in macrophage count from baseline to after 2 cycles of therapy.

Secondary Objective:

* To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) of combination weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab and ZA relative to weekly paclitaxel/bevacizumab in women with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer
* To evaluate toxicity of the two arms
* To assess objective response and duration of response by RECIST 1.1
* To estimate overall survival

Exploratory Objective

To assess differential effects from baseline, within and between patient treatment cohorts, on macrophage and hypoxia markers, CSF1/R and MHCII, plasma biomarker (VEGF, VEGFR, IL6, IL8, FGF, PDGFAA), tumor and macrophage-derived exosomes, and single-cell level changes.
