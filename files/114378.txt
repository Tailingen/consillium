Dose Escalation Study of LGH447 in Japanese Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Hematologic Malignancies
This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation, Phase 1 study of oral LGH447 in Japanese patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma for which no standard effective treatment options exist.

The study consists of a dose escalation part to estimate the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended dose for expansion and a dose expansion part to further assess safety and preliminary anti-cancer activity of LGH447 at the maximum tolerated dose and/or the recommended dose for expansion.
