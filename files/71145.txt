Establishment of Radiomics Database by Clinical Application of Multiparametric MRI Based on Incoherent Undersampling
This study aims to establish radiomics database for pancreas cancer from multiparametric MRI including DCE-MRI obtained by using incoherent undersampling and radial acquisition for clinical staging as well as quantitative analysis.
