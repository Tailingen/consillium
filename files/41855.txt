Microsurgical Treatment of Breast Cancer-related Lymphedema by Lymphaticovenous Anastomosis
Research question: Is lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) for the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema of the arm (BCRL) more effective and cost-effective compared to standard conservative treatment? Hypothesis: LVA improves the health-related quality of life of patients who developed BCRL after breast cancer treatment and is cost-effective compared to conservative treatment. Study design: A multicenter randomised controlled trial (RCT) consisting of two treatment groups: conservative treatment (group A) and LVA (group B). The study is conducted in Maastricht University Medical Center, Radboud University Medical Center, Zuyderland Medical Center and Canisius-Wilhelmina Hospital. Study population: Women over 18 years old who underwent (axillary) treatment for breast cancer presenting with early stage lymphedema of the arm for which they received at least three months conservative treatment Intervention: LVA involves anastomosing lymphatic vessels to small veins to bypass obstructions in the lymphatic system.

Usual care: Complex decongestive therapy (CDT) which includes skin care, manual lymphatic drainage, and compression therapy. Outcome measures: The primary outcome is health-related quality of life after 12 months follow-up measured with the Lymph-ICF questionnaire. Secondary outcomes are (in)direct costs, QALYs, cost-effectiveness ratio, the discontinuation rate of conservative treatment, and excess limb volume. Sample size: A total of 120 patients will be included and randomised in two groups of 60 patients each.

Cost-effectiveness analysis: A trial-based economic evaluation is performed from the societal perspective to determine the cost-effectiveness, expressed in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (i.e. cost per QALY gained), of LVA compared to CDT. Direct and indirect cost data is collected on the patient-level. The difference in QALYs is assessed with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. A Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) will be performed to analyse the financial consequences related to implementing LVA. Time schedule: Patient inclusion will take maximally 21 months. With a follow-up of 24 months, the total study period will be 48 months. The last three months are used for data analysis. Outcome assessment is at inclusion (before randomisation) and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months later.
Lymphedema
PROCEDURE: Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA)
Health-related quality of life: Lymph-ICF questionnaire, To assess the efficacy of the treatment on disease-related symptoms we will use the "Lymphedema Functioning, Disability and Health" (Lymph-ICF)" questionnaire. This disease-specific questionnaire assesses the impairments in function, activity limitations, and participation restrictions of patients with arm lymphedema. This is a validated questionnaire, based on 5 domains with 29 questions. Each of the 29 questions corresponds to a score between 0-100. The total score on the Lymph-ICF is equal to the sum of the scores on the questions divided by the total number of answered questions. A higher score on the Lymph-ICF indicates more problems with functioning related to arm lymphedema., 12 months
Cost-effectiveness of LVA compared to complex decongestive therapy, A trial-based economic evaluation is performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of LVA compared to complex decongestive therapy from the societal perspective. Cost data is collected on the patient-level and includes health care related costs, costs to patient and family, and costs due to lost productivity. The primary outcome measure for the effects is the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Cost-effectiveness is expressed in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (i.e. cost per QALY gained). In addition, a Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) will be performed from a budget holder perspective., 24 months|Excess limb volume, The relative arm volume is measured using the water displacement method (Bravometer), 3D volumetry, and circumference measurement. The volume of the affected arm is compared to the volume of the unaffected arm., 24 months|Discontinuation rate conservative therapy, The number of patients who are able to discontinue conservative therapy, i.e. no longer have to wear compression stockings or no more visits to the therapist, will be registered., 24 months
