Checkpoint Inhibitors in Patients With Cancer and Underlying Autoimmune Disease
Patients with cancer and concurrent autoimmune diseases (AID) have been universally excluded from clinical trials evaluating immunotherapy. Data on the safety and efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in patients with underlying AID is limited. The investigators performed a retrospective multicenter review of medical records of patients with diverse tumor types and underlying AID who received checkpoint inhibitors at Departments of Oncology, affiliated with the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS).
