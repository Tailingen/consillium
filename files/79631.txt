Pembrolizumab and Photodynamic Therapy in Previously Treated Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a phase 2 trial investigating the effect and safety of pembrolizumab and photodynamic therapy (PDT) in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma failed at least one line of systemic treatment.

The primary efficacy hypotheses are that the objective response rate (ORR) of combination of PDT and pembrolizumab could be improved compared with pembrolizumab for both primary and metastatic lesions.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Sinoporphyrin Sodium|PROCEDURE: Photodynamic therapy
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 in all participants, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1. For this analysis, ORR will be assessed in all participants who receive at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab., Up to 2 years
Progression-free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 in all participants, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For this analysis, PFS will be assessed in all participants who receive at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS) in all participants, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. For this analysis, OS will be assessed in all participants who receive at least 1 dose of pembrolizumab., Up to 2 years|Incidence of Treatment-Related Adverse Events, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study treatment and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The number of participants who experienced ≥1 AE will be presented., Until 30 days after the last treatment|Change from baseline in the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed to assess the quality of life of patients with cancer. It contains 30 questions (items), 24 of which aggregate into nine multi-item scales representing various aspects, or dimensions, of quality of life (QOL): one global scale, five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, pain), and six additional single-symptom items assessing additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhoea) and perceived financial impact of the disease. Individual items are scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Raw scores for each scale are standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation; a higher score on the global and functional scales represents a higher ("better") level of functioning, and a higher score on the symptom scale represents a higher ("worse") level of symptoms., Baseline, and 6 months|Change from baseline in the EORTC Quality Of Life Questionnaire Oesophageal Module (QLQ-OES18) Score, The EORTC QLQ-OES18 is a disease-specific questionnaire developed and validated to address measurements specific to esophageal cancer. It contains 18 items and is based on four subscales-dysphagia (three items), eating (four items), reflux (two items) and pain (three items), as well as six single-item subscales-saliva swallowing, choking, dry mouth, taste, cough and speech. All items are scored using a four-point Likert scale that offers these response choices: 1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much. Raw scores are standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation; higher symptom scores represent a higher ("worse") level of symptoms., Baseline, and 6 months
