Comparison of Preoperative ABUS and MRI in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients
Comparison of Preoperative Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: ABUS
Measure rate of detection of occult breast cancer by ABUS that was not detected by standard imaging, Rate of detection of occult breast cancer by ABUS, otherwise missed by standard imaging (MRI or mammogram with hand-held breast ultrasound as clinically indicated)., 1 day
This is a prospective pilot study investigating the use of Automated Breast Ultrasound in the preoperative evaluation of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. The Investigator intends to demonstrate that preoperative automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) will provide a relatively inexpensive and well-tolerated alternative to MRI for detection of occult breast cancer missed by mammography and hand-held ultrasound in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. The research will take place at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). The research study will be open to newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who present to KUMC with a recommendation for preoperative MRI and who fit all inclusion criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria.
