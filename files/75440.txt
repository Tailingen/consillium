Pathway M-1: Sphenopalatine Ganglion Stimulation for the AcuteTreatment of High Disability Migraine Headache
The purpose of the clinical study is to evaluate the use of an implanted sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) neurostimulator for the treatment of migraine headache pain, migraine headache symptoms and migraine frequency in high disability migraineurs.
High Frequency, High Disability Migraine
DEVICE: ATI Neurostimulation System
Major Device- and Surgical-Related Complications, Occurrence rate of death, any surgery or hospitalization due to deterioration in subject health, or other Major Device-related Adverse Events, Implantation through completion of Experimental Period (18 weeks following the implantation procedure)|Effective Therapy, Number of Migraine Pain Days during the Experimental Period, compared between the Treatment and Control arms.

Migraine Pain Day is any calendar day that:

1. Has less than 4 hours of moderate or severe pain meeting criteria C and D for migraine ICHD-II 1.1 AND
2. No Acute Headache or Migraine Pain Medication (pharmacologic medications, not including SPG stimulation, used to treat acute headache pain).

   AND
3. No SPG stimulation is applied for headache pain of any intensity, During Experimental Period (12 to 18 weeks following implantation)
Number of Migraine Free Days during the Experimental Period, compared between the Treatment and Control arms., Migraine Free Day is any calendar day that:

1. Has less than 4 hours of moderate or severe pain meeting criteria C and D for migraine ICHD-II 1.1 AND
