Copanlisib, Letrozole, and Palbociclib in Treating Patients With Hormone Receptor Positive HER2 Negative Stage I-IV Breast Cancer
This phase I/II trial studies side effects and best dose of copanlisib when given together with letrozole and palbociclib and to see how well they work in treating hormone receptor positive HER2 negative stage I-IV breast cancer. Copanlisib and palbociclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs, such as letrozole, may lessen the amount of estrogen made by the body. Giving copanlisib, letrozole, and palbociclib may work better in treating patients with breast cancer.

Change in Ki-67 expression defined as the percent of cells staining positive by validated central assay (Phase II), Will be evaluated on the log Ki-67 ratio scale. Primary analysis of this variable will utilize a linear model with treatment, PR status as fixed effects. The comparison of treatment arms will be based on the least squares mean (LSM) estimates and standard errors derived from this model. For descriptive purposes, LSM estimates and associated confidence intervals (CIs) will be back transformed to the geometric mean percent change scale.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of copanlisib.

PHASE Ib: Patients with metastatic breast cancer receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and letrozole PO continuously on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PHASE II: After determination of MTD, subsequent non-metastatic breast cancer patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms:

ARM A: Patients receive copanlisib (MTD) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and letrozole PO continuously on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM B: Patients receive copanlisib (MTD) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, palbociclib PO QD on days 1-21, and letrozole PO continuously on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM C: Patients receive palbociclib PO QD for days 1-14 of course 1 and letrozole PO continuously on days 1-14. Patients then undergo biopsy. Patients then receive copanlisib (MTD) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and letrozole PO continuously on days 1-28. Treatment with copanlisib and letrozole repeats every 28 days for up to 3.5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
