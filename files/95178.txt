Phase 2 Study of Temozolomide to Treat Poor Risk / Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Open-label, non-randomized, parallel assignment, phase 2 trial assessing the safety and efficacy of distinct temozolomide treatment regimens for patients with AML and poor prognosis
Leukemia, Myeloid
DRUG: Temozolomide
Response Rate (CR + CRi + LFS), Response determined per European LeukemiaNet response criteria:

CR = bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \> 1.0 x 10e9/L; platelet count \> 100 x 10e9/L; and independence of red cell transfusions.

CRi = all CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\< 1.0 x 10e9/L) or thrombocytopenia (\< 100 x 10e9/L)\].

Morphologic leukemia-free state (LFS) = bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; with no hematologic recovery required.

Relapse = bone marrow blasts \>5%; reappearance of blasts in the blood; or development of extramedullary disease., up to 2 months
Toxicity Profile: Total Number of Drug-related Serious Adverse Events, 12 months|Toxicity Profile: Individual Subjects With Drug-related SAEs, 12 months
This is a single institution phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tailored temozolomide therapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and poor risk features.

Patients will be assigned to 1 of 2 parallel treatment groups based on their AGAT promoter region methylation status, as determined by PCR.

Patients achieving a complete remission after 1 to 2 cycles of chemotherapy will be eligible to receive up to an additional 5 cycles of temozolomide of 5 or 19 days, depending on the methylation status of the AGAT promoter (consolidation phase).
