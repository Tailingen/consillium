Carfilzomib + Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for BTK Inhibitors Relapsed-refractory or Intolerant MCL
This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial designed to evaluate activity and the safety of the combination of Carfilzomib (K), Lenalidomide (R) and Dexamethasone (D) in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) relapsed/refractory (R/R) or intolerant to BTK inhibitor (BTKi) monotherapy or BTKi containing regimens with active disease necessitating treatment.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Primary Efficacy Endpoint - 12-months overall survival, 12-month overall survival : probability of surviving from the date of beginning of therapy up to month 12 based on Kaplan-Meier estimator, The primary endpoint will be assessed 12 months after the start of treatment of the last patient.
Secondary Endpoints 1 - ORR, overall response rate will be defined according to Lugano criteria. The best overall

response will be defined as the best response between the date of beginning of therapy and the last restaging. Patients without response assessment (due to whatever reason) will be considered as non-responders., The endpoint will be assessed from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression, evaluated up to 12 months.|Secondary Endpoints 1 - CR, complete response rate between the date of beginning of therapy and the last restaging. Patients without response assessment (due to whatever reason) will be considered as non-responders., The endpoint will be assessed from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression, evaluated up to 12 months.|Secondary Endpoints 1 - PR, partial response rate between the date of beginning of therapy and the last restaging. Patients without response assessment (due to whatever reason) will be considered as non-responders., The endpoint will be assessed from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression, evaluated up to 12 months.|Secondary Endpoints 1 - SD, rate between the date of beginning of therapy and the last restaging. Patients without response assessment (due to whatever reason) will be considered as non-responders., The endpoint will be assessed from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression, evaluated up to 12 months.|Secondary Endpoints 2 - PFS, progression-free survival will be defined as the time from beginning of therapy until lymphoma relapse or progression or death as a result of any cause; responding patients and patients who are lost to follow up will be censored at their last assessment date;, The endpoint will be assessed from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression, evaluated up to 12 months.|Secondary Endpoints 3 - OS, overall survival will be defined as the time from beginning of therapy until death as a result of any cause; patients who are lost to follow up will be censored at their last assessment date;, through the completion of the study, an average of 1 year|Secondary Endpoints 4 - TTR, time to response will be defined for all patients who achieved a response (Complete Response or Partial Response) and is measured from the date of beginning of therapy until the date of response. Patients in relapse or progression will be censored at their last assessment date. Patients death due to any cause will be consider censored or competing event according to different analysis plan, through the completion of the study, an average of 1 year|Secondary Endpoints 5 - DoT, the duration of the treatment will be defined as the time from beginning of therapy until discontinuation due to any reason., through the completion of the study, an average of 1 year
This is a prospective, multicenter, single arm, phase II trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of Carfilzomib (K), Lenalidomide (R) and Dexamethasone (D) in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) relapsed/refractory (R/R) or intolerant to BTK inhibitor (BTKi) monotherapy or BTKi containing regimens.

The primary endpoint will be assessed 12 months after the start of treatment of the last patient. However, responsive patients (CR, PR, SD) may continue to receive K up to a maximum of 24 cycles and RD up to a maximum of 24 cycles. Patients who will interrupt therapy (for any reason) will be followed up to 12 months after the end of the treatment.
