First-Line and Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy for Gastric Cancer
This prospective observational study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors as first-line and neoadjuvant therapy for advanced gastric cancer, while also investigating relevant biomarkers to better understand their role in immunotherapy outcomes
