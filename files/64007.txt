Feasibility of ReSpace™ Hydrogel to Establish a Stable Cervical-rectal Space
In this study, 5 subjects will be enrolled and the cumulative D2cc dose for rectum during brachytherapy will be recorded as the primary outcome measures.
Uterine Cervical Neoplasms
DEVICE: ReSpace™
The cumulative D2cc dose for rectum during brachytherapy, The mean of the cumulative rectum D2cc dose during brachytherapy will be calculated for subjects. which will be used to validate the parameter selection for phase II sample size estimation., 21 days post index procedure
Implantation success rate of hydrogel spacer, The success rate of hydrogel spacer implantation will be evaluated by the investigator for subjects., during procedure|Evaluation of device performance of hydrogel spacer, The ease of use of the test device will be evaluated by the investigator on the day of Operation. The evaluation items are as follows：

1. Whether the device is easy to assemble.
2. Whether the process of positioning the needle is smooth and whether it is easy to position the needle.
3. Whether the device is easy to inject and whether the injection process is smooth., during procedure|Injection volume of hydrogel spacer, Recording the amount of hydrogel spacer injected in the subjects,which will be used to evaluate the reasonableness of the injected dose of ReSpace™ when hydrogel is injected between the rectum and cervix in women undergoing radiation therapy., during procedure
This is a phase I prospective study of 5 patients to determine if PEG hydrogel (ReSpace™) reduces the radiation dose delivered to the rectum during radiation therapy for cervical cancer by increasing the space between the cervix and the anterior rectal wall. In the other word, the purpose of this study is to assess whether the use of ReSpace™ hydrogel results in a reduction of radiation exposure to the anterior rectum.
