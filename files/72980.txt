Exploring the Efficacy and Feasibility of the LymphaTech Scanner for Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema Screening
This research will compare the absolute volumes of the upper extremity using both the LymphaTech Scanner and Perometer in a cohort of patients with a history of invasive or in-situ carcinoma of the breast.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema Measurements
Precision and reliability, To determine whether the LymphaTech scanner is a precise and reliable tool for measuring upper extremity volume changes in patients treated for breast, 3 years
Measurement Time, To evaluate amount of time it takes to conduct bilateral arm measurements with both the LymphaTech Scanner and Perometer., 3 years
Our trial seeks to assess the efficacy of the LymphaTech Scanner as compared to the Perometer, which is currently used to screen for breast cancer-related lymphedema. The focus of the study is to compare the absolute volumes of the upper-extremity as measured by each device and to compare the time it takes to measure both arms of a patient using each device to assess clinical feasibility.
