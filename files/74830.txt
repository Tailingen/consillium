Skin Changes in Head and Neck Cancer During Immuno-(Chemo-) And Radiotherapy With Erbitux® (HICARE)
This is a national multicenter phase IV study to assess acute radiation dermatitis of combined radioimmuno(chemo)therapy with Cetuximab in patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LASCCHN).

With the aim of optimizing combined treatment strategies in terms of efficacy as well as manageable side effects, the implementation of Cetuximab an EGFR targeting antibody demonstrated successfully a significant increase in survival times, although exhibiting an expected increase in skin toxicities (1,2). This Phase IV trial will explore this prominent side effect, which is due to a synergistic effect of radiodermatitis and acneiform rash, in great detail. In addition, feasibility aspects of the complex treatment schedule in common routine and with patients presenting an increased comorbidity rate compared to the study population studied in the pivotal Phase III trial will be observed.

Further, peripheral blood samples of patients that consent to participate in the molecular monitoring will be collected and their genetic, epigenetic- and transcriptional profiles correlated with clinical outcome parameters. The goal of this translational program is to identify and confirm novel peripheral blood based molecular predictors and surrogates of therapy response. Tissue samples and available medical evidence of patients that consent to participate in the assessment of the HPV status will be collected. The goal of this program is to correlate HPV status with clinical outcome parameters.

In addition, all patients will answer Quality of Life questionnaires including the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, the Head and Neck cancer specific module (3) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).

This prospective, open, multicenter phase IV study is designed to assess the rate of radiodermatitis in patients with LASCCHN treated with a combination of radiotherapy and the EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibody Cetuximab.
