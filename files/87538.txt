VATS Major Lung Resection for Chinese Early-stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Surgery may be the best treatment choice for early stage non-small cell lung cancer. And VATS major lung resection have been preferred as a standard radical procedure for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).This study aim to investigate the outcome of VATS major lung resection for lung cancer as a real-world study in china.
