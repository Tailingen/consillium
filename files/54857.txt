Investigation of Genetic Determinants of Capecitabine Toxicity
The purpose of this study is to identify possible genetic polymorphisms that contribute to specific toxicities associated with capecitabine (hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, and neutropenia).

Additionally, this study will look at gene polymorphisms in patients experiencing the toxicities of interest, the frequency of polymorphisms and differences in drug metabolism.
