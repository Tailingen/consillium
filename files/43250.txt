A Sequential Two-Stage Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ruxolitinib
The purpose of this study is to find out if treating Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) with a study drug \[ruxolitinib\] can improve outcomes of patients with CMML. The first step of the study is to learn the dose of ruxolitinib that is tolerable (bearable). It has already been studied in a number of patients with different bone marrow diseases and is approved for the treatment of a disease called Myelofibrosis; however, it is not approved for treatment of CMML. It is given orally (by mouth). Most people tolerate it well but the tolerability has not been determined in patients with CMML. We will be testing different doses to determine how much of the medication people can tolerate (bear) before they develop side effects.
Myelomonocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Ruxolitinib
The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Ruxolitinib for the Treatment of Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML), Phase I - The MTD is defined as the highest dose where less than 33% of participants experience a drug related predefined dose limited toxicity (DLT). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any grade 4 hematologic toxicity and any grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity except nausea that is controlled by antiemetic therapy based on the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Grade 3 metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities that are not clinically significant, and are adequately controlled within 72 hours are not to be considered a DLT., 17 weeks|Occurrence of Clinical Response, Phase II - Proportion of participants achieving clinical benefit defined as hematologic improvement, complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), marrow complete remission (Marrow CR) or stable disease (SD) by the International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria. Erythroid Response for pretreatment hemoglobin \< 11 g/dl; Platelet response for subjects with a pre-treatment platelet count \< 50 x 10\^9/L; Neutrophil response with pretreatment absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \< 1 x 10\^9/L., Up to 2 years
Percentage of Participants With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Transformation, Phase II - To determine the time to AML transformation of participants on Ruxolitinib. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. CMML-1: peripheral blood \<5% blasts, bone marrow \<10% myeloblast. CMML-2: peripheral blood \<19 percent blasts persistent monocytosis \>1000/ul +/- cytopenias Leukocytosis frequent, bone marrow \<19 percent blasts \>10% dysplasia in affected lineage, Auer Rods., Up to 2 years|Median Overall Survival (OS), Phase II - To determine the median overall survival., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response in Days, Phase II - To determine the duration of response achieved as in secondary endpoint one. The duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for major or complete platelet response (which ever is first recorded) until the first date that disease progression defined by the bone marrow response outlined above, progression/relapse following a CR, marrow CR or PR, or progressions/relapse following hematological improvement (HI) as outlined above., 3.5 years
This is a phase 1/2, two-stage, sequential cohort dose escalation study. If dose escalation is completed as planned, no more than 53 subjects are expected to enroll onto this study at a rate of approximately 3 subjects every month. For the Phase 2 study the Simon's optimal two-stage design will be employed to test the null hypothesis that response rate (RR) equals to 10% versus the alternative that RR equals to 30%.

Demographic and clinical variables for the study patients will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, inter-quartile range, range, and frequency counts and percentages). Safety and efficacy data will be analyzed overall as well as separately for each dose cohort when appropriate.
