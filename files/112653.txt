Tagraxofusp (SL-401) in Participants With Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) and Myelofibrosis (MF)
This multicenter, multi-arm trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of tagraxofusp, a cell division cycle protein 123 homolog-targeted therapy, in participants with either CMML or MF. There were 2 CMML cohorts, 1 enrolled participant with CMML (CMML-1 or CMML-2) who were refractory/resistant or intolerant to hypomethylating agents (HMA), hydroxyurea (HU), or intensive chemotherapy and 1 enrolled treatment-naive participants with CMML (CMML-1 or CMML-2) with molecular features associated with poor prognosis. The MF cohort enrolled participants who were resistant/refractory or intolerant to approved Janus kinase (JAK) therapy (JAK1/JAK2 or JAK2).

DRUG: Tagraxofusp Injection
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), During Stage 1, DLT was defined as any of the following occurring during the first cycle of therapy: any treatment-emergent Grade 4 transaminase or creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation (confirmed within 24 hours of initial identification), regardless of duration or relationship to SL-401; any Grade ≥3 non-hematologic toxicity (unrelated to underlying MPN), with the exception of Grade 3 laboratory toxicities that resolve to Grade ≤1 or baseline ≤28 days after the last infusion of SL-401, or the following Grade 3 toxicities if they resolve to Grade ≤1 or baseline ≤21 days after the last infusion of SL-401, arthralgia, myalgia, fever responding to treatment, nausea and/or vomiting (excluding cases that require tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition, or hospitalization) or diarrhea associated with suboptimal prophylaxis or treatment; Grade 4 neutropenia or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia with a duration (at Grade 4) of ≥28 days., 21 days of Cycle 1 (21 days/cycle)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants (responders) who achieved disease-specific complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after treatment. For response assessment of myelofibrosis during both Stage 1 and Stage 2, the International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment and European LeukemiaNet (IWG-MRT/ELN 2013) criteria were used. For chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, during both Stage 1 and Stage 2, the International Working Group 2006 response criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes (IWG MDS 2006) were used for response assessment while the Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MDS/MPN) 2015 criteria were used for response assessment during Stage 3A., 1145 days
This was a non-randomized, open-label, multicenter study, divided into 3 stages.

Stage 1: Stage 1 of the study was to enroll participants with CMML, MF, advanced systemic mastocytosis, or advanced symptomatic primary eosinophilic disorder.

Stage 2: Stage 2 was to enroll MF and CMML participants.

Stage 3A: Stage 3A was to enroll 2 populations of participants with CMML, those with CMML-1 or CMML-2 who were refractory/resistant/intolerant to HMAs, HU, or intensive chemotherapy (relapsed/refractory participants); and participants with treatment-naïve CMML-1 or CMML-2 (previously untreated participants) with molecular features associated with a poor prognosis.
