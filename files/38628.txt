ARCHERY - Artificial Intelligence Based Radiotherapy Treatment Planning for Cervical, Head and Neck and Prostate Cancer
The aim of this study is to look at whether an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based computer program can automate two components of the radiotherapy treatment pathway to a sufficient quality standard to enable its routine clinical use. The two components include the delineation (outlining) of anatomical areas that are at risk of tumour spread and at risk of radiation damage, and the definition of the position, size and shape of the radiation beams.

The AI-based computer programs have been developed to perform tasks that would normally require direct human involvement by oncologists and medical physicists. Proposed advantages include improved treatment accuracy, as well as a reduction in the time (from weeks to minutes) and human resources needed to deliver radiotherapy, which this study will test.
