Mechanistic Study of EBV mRNA Vaccine (WGc-043) in EBV-Positive Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoma
This exploratory study, based on a pharmaceutical company-initiated clinical trial, aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of the EBV mRNA vaccine (WGc-043 injection) in treating EBV-positive relapsed or refractory lymphoma. The study explores the mechanism of the EBV mRNA vaccine (WGc-043 injection) within the tumor microenvironment in EBV-positive lymphoma, elucidating the vaccine's inhibitory effects on EBV. This research will provide a theoretical foundation for the application of mRNA vaccines, either alone or in combination with other immunotherapies, in the treatment of EBV-positive lymphoma.
Epstein-Barr Virus Associated Lymphoma
DRUG: EBV mRNA vaccine (WGc-043)
ScRNA-seq profiles of tumor tissues before and after injection, Analysis of changes in the TME during treatment by comparing scRNA-seq profiles of tumor tissues before and after injection., If the patient receives personalized treatment, safety follow-up will be conducted 28 days after the last infusion; if not, safety follow-up will be conducted 28 days after the 5th dose.|Clinical data from patients with disease remission (CR/PR) and those without remission (SD/PD), Identification of key molecular mechanisms and immune cell components associated with treatment efficacy by comparing data from patients with disease remission (CR/PR) and those without remission (SD/PD)., If the patient receives personalized treatment, safety follow-up will be conducted 28 days after the last infusion; if not, safety follow-up will be conducted 28 days after the 5th dose.
Proportions of different immune cell types in tumor tissues from subjects with varying disease remission statuses., (1) Identification of immune cells associated with the formation of immune memory by comparing the proportions of different immune cell types in tumor tissues from subjects with varying disease remission statuses. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process will be explored through gene expression profiling, focusing on key immune cell components and molecular pathways related to T cell memory formation., If the patient receives personalized treatment, safety follow-up will be conducted 28 days after the last infusion; if not, safety follow-up will be conducted 28 days after the 5th dose.|Gene expression profiling in tumor tissues from subjects with varying disease, The molecular mechanisms underlying this process will be explored through gene expression profiling, focusing on key immune cell components and molecular pathways related to T cell memory formation. Identification of endogenous tumor factors associated with immune chemotaxis, T cell activation, and immune escape through correlation analysis with tumor cell characteristics, molecular genetic alterations, and oncogenic pathways., If the patient receives personalized treatment, safety follow-up will be conducted 28 days after the last infusion; if not, safety follow-up will be conducted 28 days after the 5th dose.|Molecular biological changes in EBV in peripheral blood samples before and after EBV mRNA vaccine injection, Analysis of molecular biological changes in EBV in peripheral blood samples before and after EBV mRNA vaccine injection, focusing on changes in genes, proteins, and other molecular markers., Time Frame: If the patient receives personalized treatment, safety follow-up will be conducted 28 days after the last infusion; if not, safety follow-up will be conducted 28 days after the 5th dose.
