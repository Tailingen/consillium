Assessment of Early Detection and Prognosis Based on cfDNA Methylation in Multiple Myeloma
It is an observational, case-control study aimed at early-detection of multiple myeloma and constructing a prognostic model of multiple myeloma. The study will enroll approximately 398 participants including patients with multiple myeloma, patients with benign hematologic disorders and healthy participants.
