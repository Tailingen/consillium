Perioperative Analgesic Modalities for Breast Cancer Surgeries
The incidence of breast cancer is among women world wide, detection increased with introduction of mammography as a screening tool. surgical resection of breast cancer contributes to the generation of acute and chronic post mastectomy pain. This study aims at comparing the effect of erector spinae block versus serratus block versus intravenous morphine in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer surgeries regarding pain control and possible side effects

One of the most common types of cancer affecting women is breast cancer. Surgical resection is one of the main approaches applied for solid tumors. surgical approach for breast cancer involve the breast region. Various analgesic modalities are used for proper perioperative pain control. Morphine has always been considered as the gold standard analgesic, however opioids have multiple side effects. Several loco-regional techniques have been introduced for breast surgery pain management including serratus plane block (SPB) and erector spinae plane (ESP) block. In this study the investigators are comparing the effect of erector spinae block versus serratus block versus intravenous morphine in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer surgeries regarding intraoperative and postoperative analgesia, time to first analgesic, any possible side effects
