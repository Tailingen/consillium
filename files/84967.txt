CABozantinib in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients With MET Deregulation
This is a multicenter, single arm, phase II study evaluating efficacy in terms of RR in a cohort of NSCLC with MET amplification or MET exon 14 skipping mutation pre-treated or not with MET inhibitors.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Cabozantinib
Response Rate (RR) (complete + partial responses), RR will be evaluated by investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Partial and complete responses will be confirmed following RECIST criteria 1.1. Disease evaluation will be performed every two months (8 weeks)., Up to 36 months
Progression free survival (PFS), Disease evaluation will be performed every 8 weeks, Up to 36 months|Overall survival (OS), Disease evaluation will be performed every 8 weeks, Up to 36 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR: stable disease + partial response + complete response), Disease evaluation will be performed every 8 weeks, Up to 36 months|Exploratory biomarkers, At baseline, at the first disease evaluation and at progression of disease a blood sample will be collected for biomarkers analyses, Up to 36 months
The study population will include NSCLC patients with MET amplification or MET exon 14 skipping mutation pre-treated or not with MET inhibitors. Elegible NSCLC patients with MET exon 14 skipping mutations or MET amplification will be treated with open label orally cabozantinib 60 mg/daily, cycles each 28 days. Disease evaluation will be performed every two months (8 weeks). Patients will be treated with cabozantinib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.Treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal. Treatment beyond disease progression is allowed if considered appropriate by the investigator.
