Non-Hormonal Vaginal Moisturizer in Hormone-Receptor Positive Postmenopausal Cancer Survivors Experiencing Estrogen Deprivation Symptoms on Vulvovaginal Health
The purpose of this study is to see whether it is feasible to conduct a study to determine if the use of hyaluronic acid (HLA) vaginal gel (HyaloGYN®) improves vulvovaginal health.

This study aims to look at whether or not HyaloGYN® is effective in women with a history of hormone receptor positive cancer and experiencing vaginal and/or vulvar symptoms of estrogen deprivation following their breast and endometrial cancer treatment.
