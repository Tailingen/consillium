Quadruple Immunotherapy for Neuroblastoma
This is a single-arm clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quadruple immunotherapy with natural killer (NK) cells, anti-GD2 antibody, cytokines (interleukin-2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)) and retinoid X receptor gamma (RXRg) agonist spironolactone for paediatric patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma Recurrent
BIOLOGICAL: Natural killer cell|DRUG: Dinutuximab beta|DRUG: Interleukin-2|DRUG: Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor|DRUG: Spironolactone|DRUG: Naxitamab
Proportion of patients who have objective response in the tumor, Objective response = complete response + partial response + minor response + stable disease, 1-2 months
Overall survival at 1 year, From the date of treatment start until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 1 year, up to 1 year|Progression-free survival, From date of treatment start until the date of first documented progression or the date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 1 year, up to 1 year|Proportion of patients who have tumor relapse, relapse = reappearance of tumor after complete response, up to 1 year|Number of patients who experience adverse events, Adverse events are graded according to Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAEv5), up to 1 month|Percentage of donor NK cells, Percentage of donor natural killer cells in the recipient's blood will be evaluated weekly from the date of NK cell infusion for 4 weeks, then every 2 weeks till donor NK cells are undetectable, up to 1 year
Included patients will receive intravenous infusion of donor NK cells on day 0, and anti-GD2 antibody (dinutuximab) on day -6 to day -2. IL-2 will be given subcutaneously on day -1, day +1, day +3, day +5, day +7, and day +9. Subcutaneous injection of GM-CSF will be started on day 0, given daily till neutrophil count \>1000/mm3. Spironolactone will be started orally on day -1, given three times daily till cessation of GM-CSF.

Alternative anti-GD2 antibody (Naxitamab) can be used instead of dinutuximab, to be given on day -5, day -3, day +1 and day +3.
