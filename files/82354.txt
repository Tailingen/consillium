Safety and QoL of Trastuzumab With Lapatinib or Chemiotherapy in MBC and HER2+ Patients Refractory to Anti HER2 Therapies
Recent clinical studies have shown that the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab has superior antitumor activity compared to either single drug in both neoadjuvant and metastatic setting and is well tolerated. According to this evidence, the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab today offers a valid chemotherapy-free option, primarily for patients with pre-treated HER2-positive MBC
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Lapatinib|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Clinical Benefit Rate, To evaluate clinical benefit rate (CBR) for patients treated with lapatinib and trastuzumab and for patients treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. CBR is defined as: confirmed complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR) at any time, plus stable disease (SD) for 24 weeks, Clinical Benefit Rate is defined as confirmed complete response plus partial response at any time, plus stable disease up to 24 weeks
Progression free survival, Second-line progression-free survival, defined as the time from first dosing to the first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 36 months|Overall Survival, OS is defined as the time from first dosing in second line to death from any cause., Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 36 months|Safety and tolerability, Safety of second line treatment will be evaluated by the frequency of AEs and SAEs, cardiac events, clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECOG PS. All patients who received at least one dose of study treatment will be included in the safety analysis., Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 36 months|Quality of life, QoL and symptom control will be assessed using the FACT-B questionnaire., Patients enrolled will receive study medication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 36 months
The present study is designed to determine the efficacy and safety profile of the combination of lapatinib and trastuzumab (plus endocrinetherapy in ER-positive breast cancer) versus trastuzumab and chemotherapy in heavily pretreated patient population with HER2-positive MBC and to investigate the predictive role of cfDNA for detection of HER2 gene amplification on patients' outcome. The presence of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) for detection of HER2 gene amplification was associated with worse prognosis and seems to allow early response evaluation. However, many aspects of the role of cfDNA detection in patients undergoing molecular target agents such as trastuzumab or lapatinib are not well described. With the availability of improved and standardized techniques for cfDNA detection, it should now be possible to examine several of these important questions within a prospective multicenter study and a striking potential of cfDNA for detection of HER2 gene amplification might enable a more individual and optimized antimetastatic therapy inpatients with cancer.
