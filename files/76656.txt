Insomnia Symptoms, Data will be collected on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) total score pre- and post-intervention as our primary outcome. The ISI is a seven-item questionnaire with response categories from 0-4 (total score 0-28) asking about sleep patterns and specifically characterizing insomnia over the two weeks prior. The ISI defines 'no clinically significant' insomnia as a score of 0-7, 'sub-threshold' insomnia as a score of 8-14, 'moderate severity clinical' insomnia' a scores of 15-21, and 'severe clinical' insomnia as a score of 22-28. Clinically relevant target for success is to achieve sub-threshold or better scores (â‰¤14) among \>80% of the intervention participants, 6 weeks

This study is a Phase II SBIR to further test efficacy of a voice-activated technology to deliver components of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to breast cancer survivors (BCS) compared to a web-based control. Participants will be randomly assigned to the voice-activated or web-based treatment arms and will complete a 6-week intervention.
