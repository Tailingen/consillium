Comparison of Short-term Outcomes of Robotic and Laparoscopic Surgery in Patients With Different Body Mass Index for Mid and Low Rectal Cancer
Numerous comparison studies on the outcomes of robotic and laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of rectal cancer have been undertaken and reported. But there aren't many studies that compare the safety and effectiveness of the two surgery procedures used to treat people with mid and low rectal cancer who have different body mass indexes (BMIs). This study was done to organize the clinical data we had at our hospital so we could compare the perioperative effectiveness of two minimally invasive approaches for people with different BMIs.
