Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The aim of the current study is to study the safety and effectiveness of TACE using a high dose of cisplatin for treatment of HCC. It is hypothesized that the formulation is safe and it improves the therapeutic effect of conventional TACE.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: TACE|DRUG: Cisplatin
Tumor response, CT scan abdomen will be performed 3 months after the first treatment. Tumor response by CT was classified into complete response (CR), partial response (PR), static disease (SD, and progressive disease (PD) according to European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) necrosis guidelines,, 3 months after treatment
overall survival, No further treatment was given when there was deterioration in liver function or performance status meeting the exclusion criteria, 30 days after treatment
Most patients with HCC are diagnosed at an intermediate and advanced stage when the tumors become unresectable, transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) has been widely accepted as a standard treatment for them in most international management protocols. The therapeutic effect of TACE in terms of objective tumor response is variable and modest (27%-40%), indicating that there is actually much room for improvement in the treatment. Internationally, high doses and combination of chemotherapeutic agents are being routinely and widely used for TACE in major medical centers. Locally, a low dose of cisplatin (10mg) has been used as the chemotherapeutic agent for TACE in Hong Kong. There is evidence showing that the component of chemotherapeutic agent in TACE does play a significant role in the treatment effect of TACE. In an attempt to improve the treatment effect of TACE, the investigators propose a formulation of TACE using a high dose of cisplatin as chemotherapeutic agent.
