Dissecting the Mechanism of DNA Methylation on the Invasiveness of Pituitary Tumors.
DNA methylation is one of the important ways of protein post-translational modification.Pituitary adenoma (PA) is a benign neuroendocrine tumor that originates from adenohypophysial 45 cells, and accounts for 10%-20% of all primary intracranial tumors. However some PAs can present with high invasiveness and irregular growth, which tend to compresses the optic chiasm and third ventricle, encase the internal carotid artery, and affect hormone secretion from the pituitary gland and hypothalamus. In this study we focus on the mechanism of DNA methylation on the invasiveness of pituitary tumors.

OTHER: no interventions between two groups
Residual tumor size, Tumor size was evaluated by postoperative MRI, 1 week after surgery|tumor recurrence, During the follow-up, the tumor recurrence was observed closely, three years
