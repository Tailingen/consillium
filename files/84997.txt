Dose-Ranging Efficacy and Safety Study of Topical Rapamycin Cream for Facial Angiofibroma Associated With Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
The study aims to compare the safety and efficacy of two different strengths of Rapamycin cream, topical and placebo over 26 weeks in the treatment of facial angiofibroma (FA) associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC).
Facial Angiofibroma|Tuberous Sclerosis
DRUG: rapamycin|DRUG: placebo
Percentage of Participants Obtaining Successful Treatment, Success on the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale is defined as clear or almost clear with an improvement of at least two grades from baseline. IGA scores range from 0-4:

0=Clear

1. Almost Clear
2. Mild
3. Moderate
4. Severe, After 26 weeks treatment
Time to Treatment Success, The time elapsed from the first dose to the time of treatment success, according to the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale. The total time of treatment was 26 weeks, although Covid-19 visit delays led to an extension of up to 2 weeks (28 weeks total) for some patients. Success on the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale is defined as clear or almost clear with an improvement of at least two grades from baseline. IGA scores range from 0-4:

0=Clear

1. Almost Clear
2. Mild
3. Moderate
4. Severe, From first dose to 26 weeks (Â± 2 weeks)|Change From Baseline in Investigator's Global Assessment, The change in grading on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale from baseline.

IGA scores range from 0-4:

0=Clear

1. Almost Clear
2. Mild
3. Moderate
4. Severe, At baseline and after 26 weeks treatment|Change From Baseline in Facial Angiofibroma Severity Index (FASI), The change in grading on the Facial Angiofibroma Severity Index (FASI) from baseline. FASI grades lesions according to their erythema, size and extent by summing the scores of each category. The final FASI scores range from (mild) 2-9 (severe).

Erythema Skin color 0 Light Red 1 Red 2 Dark Red/purple 3 Size None 0 Small (\< 5mm) 1 Large (\> 5mm) 2 Confluent 3 Extension \<50 % cheek surface 2 \>50% cheek surface 3, At baseline and after 26 weeks treatment|Subjective (Participant or Parent/Caregiver) Percentage Change Rating Scale, Percentage change in facial angiofibroma since beginning treatment, as assessed by the participant or parent/caregiver. A large value indicates most improvement to facial angiofibroma (minimum=0, maximum=100). This was a single assessment time-point, where the participant or parent/caregiver estimated the percentage change in the facial angiofibroma lesion appearance from their perspective since baseline., After 26 weeks treatment|Objective (Clinician) Percentage Change Rating Scale, Percentage improvement in facial angiofibroma since beginning treatment, as assessed by the clinician. A large value indicates most improvement to facial angiofibroma (minimum=0, maximum=100). This was a single assessment time-point, where clinicians estimated the percentage change in the facial angiofibroma lesion appearance from their perspective since baseline., After 26 weeks treatment|Categorical Change in Facial Angiofibroma, Change in facial angiofibroma since beginning treatment on a 5-point scale, as assessed by the participant or parent/caregiver. This was a single assessment time-point, where the participant or parent/caregiver evaluated the change in the facial angiofibroma lesion appearance from their perspective since baseline., After 26 weeks treatment
Topical rapamycin has previously been used to treat FA associated with TSC, reducing erythema, papule size, while flattening lesions and improving skin texture. Topical rapamycin has been reported to be well tolerated.

The efficacy and safety of a topical rapamycin cream at two strengths (0.5% and 1.0%) will be assessed during a 26 week double-blind treatment phase with assessments made at clinical visits at baseline, 2, 8, 14, 20 and 26 weeks, and at follow-up (4 weeks after the last dose of study drug).
