Sunitinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Persistent Leiomyosarcoma of the Uterus
This phase II trial is studying how well sunitinib works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus. Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
Recurrent Uterine Sarcoma|Uterine Leiomyosarcoma
DRUG: sunitinib malate
Progression-free survival, From study entry until disease progression, death or date of last contact., assessed up to 6 months|Objective tumor response according to GOG RECIST criteria, Up to 5 years|Frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v 3.0, The frequency and severity of all toxicities will be tabulated., Up to 5 years
Duration of progression-free survival, Characterized graphically and using descriptive statistics such as median survival., Up to 5 years|Duration of overall survival, Characterized graphically and using descriptive statistics such as median survival., From entry into the study to death or the date of last contact, assessed up to 5 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Assess the activity of sunitinib malate, in terms of rate of progression-free survival for â‰¥ 6 months and objective tumor response, in patients with recurrent or persistent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus who have received 1 or 2 prior cytotoxic therapies.

II. Determine the frequency and severity of adverse events.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
