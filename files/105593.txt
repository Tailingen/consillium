A RAndomizeD Intervention for Cardiovascular and Lifestyle Risk Factors in Prostate Cancer Patients
RADICAL PC1 is a prospective cohort study of men with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer. RADICAL PC2 is a randomized, controlled trial of a systematic approach to modifying cardiovascular and lifestyle risk factors in men with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer.

RADICAL PC describes two prospective studies, one of which is embedded in the other. RADICAL PC1 is a prospective cohort study of men within one year of their first diagnosis of prostate cancer, or treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy for the first time within 6 months prior to enrollment visit, or to be treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy for the first time within one month after the enrollment visit. Its goal will be to identify factors associated with the development of cardiovascular disease among men with prostate cancer, with a particular focus on Androgen Deprivation Therapy. RADICAL PC2 is a randomized, controlled trial embedded in RADICAL PC1. RADICAL PC2 will test a systematic approach to modifying cardiovascular and lifestyle risk factors in men within one year of their first diagnosis of prostate cancer, or treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy for the first time within 6 months prior to enrollment visit, or to be treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy for the first time within one month after the enrollment visit.
