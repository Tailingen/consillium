NIMRAD (A Randomised Placebo-controlled Trial of Synchronous NIMorazole Versus RADiotherapy Alone in Patients With Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Not Suitable for Synchronous Chemotherapy or Cetuximab)
The purpose of this study is to see whether adding Nimorazole to standard radiotherapy benefits patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Nimorazole|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Locoregional Control in patients with more hypoxic tumours (the enriched population), To examine whether patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma unsuitable for either cisplatin chemotherapy or monoclonal antibody therapy benefit from the addition of nimorazole to standard definitive radiotherapy in terms of increased locoregional control without additional serious toxicity., 12 weeks post treatment
Overall survival (enriched sub-group), Date of death for patient, month 60.|Cancer-specific survival (enriched sub-group), follow up month 60|Disease-free survival (enriched sub-group), follow up month 60|Cumulative incidence of loco-regional failure, follow up month 60|Acute toxicity (all patients), baseline, week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, follow up month 1.5 and 3|Hypoxia signature prediction of nimorazole benefit (all patients), screening|Quality of life (enriched sub-group), baseline, week 6, month 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 of follow up|Late toxicity (all patients), baseline, follow up month 6, 12, 18, 24, 36
