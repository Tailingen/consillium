The Effects of Perioperative PECS Block During Robotic Breast Surgery and Breast Reconstruction
Pectoral nerve blocks (PECS blok) are used in postoperative analgesia after breast surgery in nowadays. Many studies shows that pectoral nerve blocks is effective for reducing pain and postoperative opioid consumption undergoing mastectomy. This study was planned to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative PECS block for postoperative analgesia after robot breast surgery and immediate breast reconstruction.
Breast Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: pectoral nerve block
Total dose of fentanyl consumption during the postoperative 24h, To evaluate the effect of PECS block undergoing robot-assisted nipple-sparing mastectomy (RANSM) with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR), total cumulative dose of fentanyl was measured for the first postoperative 24h, after 24 hours postoperative period

Sixty patients were randomly allocated into two groups by computerised process, each including 30 patients. PECS group (P) received general anesthesia and pectoral nerve block(PECS block) with 025% ropivacaine after surgical resection of breast by operator. Control group(C) only received general anesthesia.

A Patient -controlled analgesia(PCA) device provides fentanyl for postoperative pain control.

The Primary outcome measures total dose of fentanyl consumption during the postoperative 24 hours, and secondary outcome measures pain scores at rest and movement.
