Equivalence of Intramuscular (IM) Versus Subcutaneous (SC) Applications of Long Acting Pamorelin 11.25 mg
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the pharmacodynamic equivalence of triptorelin pamoate (Pamorelin® LA 11.25 mg), applied either IM or SC, in terms of the area under the curve \[AUC1-85day\] for serum testosterone in patients with advanced prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Triptorelin Pamoate (Pamorelin® LA 11.25 mg)
Area Under the Curve of Testosterone Serum Concentration Between D1 and D85 (AUC1-85d)., Area under the curve (AUC) calculated from serum testosterone concentration taken at intervals between the first administration (Day 1) of the study drug and Day 85 after dosing. From the curve describing serum testosterone concentration levels (ng/mL) over time, the AUC was calculated using numerical integration methods. This value was log-transformed to more closely meet the assumption of the statistical method., 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, 85 days post-dose
Area Under the Curve of Testosterone Serum Concentration Between D1 and D169 (AUC1-169d), Area under the curve calculated from serum testosterone concentration taken at intervals between the first administration (Day 1) of the study drug and Day 169 after dosing. From the curve describing serum testosterone concentration levels (ng/mL) over time, the AUC was calculated using numerical integration methods. This value was log-transformed to more closely meet the assumption of the statistical method., 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, 85, 87, 113, 141 and 169 days post-dose|Area Under the Curve of Testosterone Serum Concentration Between D85 and D169 (AUC85-169d), Area under the curve calculated from serum testosterone concentration taken at intervals between Day 85 and Day 169 after dosing.

This value was log-transformed to more closely meet the assumption of the statistical method., 85, 87, 113, 141 and 169 days post-dose|Maximum Concentration of Serum Testosterone [Cmax] - Raw Data, Cmax was assessed as the maximum testosterone serum concentration between the first administration of the study drug and Day 169., 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, 85, 87, 113, 141 and 169 days post-dose|Maximum Concentration of Serum Testosterone [Cmax] - Log-transformed Data, Cmax was assessed as the maximum testosterone serum concentration between the first administration of the study drug and Day 169., 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, 85, 87, 113, 141 and 169 days post-dose|Time to Castration [Tcast] - Testosterone Level Less Than or Equal to 0.5 ng/mL, tcast is the number of days between day of first administration of the study drug and the day the testosterone level reaches the limit of castration defined as testosterone level less than or equal to 0.5 ng/mL for the first time. Analysis of tcast was based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator., 12 weeks|Time to Castration [Tcast] - Testosterone Level Less Than 0.5 ng/mL, tcast is the number of days between day of first administration of the study drug and the day the testosterone level reaches the limit of castration defined as testosterone level less than 0.5 ng/mL for the first time.
