Protocol to Examine Methylation of Tumor Suppression Genes in Women at High Risk of Developing Breast Cancer
A study to examine the correlations between methylation of various genes associated with breast cancer and proliferation and cytomorphology in breast epithelial cells acquired by random periareolar fine needle aspiration of women at high risk for development of breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
A study to examine the correlation between gene promotor methylation and benign breast tissue proliferation and cytomorphology collected via random periareolar fine needle aspiration in postmenopausal women at increased risk for breast cancer.
