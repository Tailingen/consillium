Detection of Muscle Invasion in Bladder Cancer, To evaluate the preoperative staging of bladder cancerï¼Œwhether it is non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) or muscle invasive bladder cancers (MIBC), within 3 minutes
Bladder cancer can be grouped into non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and muscle invasive bladder cancers (MIBC), the latter displaying high aggressiveness, a high degree of malignancy, complicated treatment, high propensity to metastasis, and poor prognosis. Currently, the clinical feasibility and accuracy of preoperative detection of muscle invasion in bladder cancer with contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) are unclear.
