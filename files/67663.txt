OTHER: Mobile health application and Fitbit + standard of care|OTHER: Standard of care
Readmission rate, Investigators will track readmission rates after surgery for those on the trial, 30 days
Healthcare utilization rates, Investigators will track patients' healthcare resource utilization and the cost of this utilization by assessing how often the patients contact their providers via phone or the app, access the emergency room, and through readmission data., 30 days|Patient Satisfaction with Device, Investigators will assess patients' satisfaction with their care experience and device. This will be done with an internal questionnaire asking if patients were satisfied and if they found it easy to use., 30 days|Quality of life: Return to Baseline Function-Walking, Investigators will monitor patients' return to baseline health after surgery by tracking progress via step counts, as monitored by a FitBit tracker., 30 days|Quality of life: Return to Baseline Function-Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), Investigators will monitor patients' return to baseline health after surgery by tracking progress using a questionnaire, modified from the Katz Activities of Daily Living scale. For this scale, a score of 6 is high, indicating that the patient is independent and a score of 0 is low, indicating that the patient very dependent in performing their ADLs., 30 days
Patients will be randomized to 1) standard of care or 2) to use our mobile app with standard care. The mobile app will collect information on patients' daily physical activity patterns and health status data for clinicians using smartphone mobile technology applications. The investigators believe that by tracking information on patients, the investigators may be able to intervene sooner and prevent a delay in care.
