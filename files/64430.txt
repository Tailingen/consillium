A Phase 3 Randomized, Masked, Controlled Trial to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Belzupacap Sarotalocan (AU-011) Treatment Compared to Sham Control in Subjects With Primary Indeterminate Lesions or Small Choroidal Melanoma
The primary objective is to determine the safety and efficacy of belzupacap sarotalocan (bel-sar) compared to sham control in patients with primary indeterminate lesions (IL) or small choroidal melanoma (CM).
Choroidal Melanoma|Indeterminate Lesions|Uveal Melanoma|Ocular Melanoma
DRUG: Bel-sar|DEVICE: Suprachoroidal Microinjector|DEVICE: Infrared Laser|DEVICE: Sham Infrared Laser|DEVICE: Sham Microinjector
Time to reach tumor progression, Tumor Progression, 65 weeks
Time to composite endpoint, Tumor progression or visual acuity failure, 65 weeks
This is a randomized, sham-controlled, subject-, assessor-, and Sponsor- masked trial to establish the safety and efficacy of bel-sar treatment via suprachoroidal (SC) administration in subjects with primary IL/CM. Bel-sar treatment incorporates administration of bel-sar drug product using a suprachoroidal space (SCS) microinjector and activation of bel-sar by a laser photoactivation device.
