An Open-Label Study to Assess the Effect of CYP3A4 Induction on the Pharmacokinetics of VELCADE (Bortezomib)
The primary purpose of this Phase I study is to evaluate the effect of the co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers on the pharmacokinetics profile of VELCADE (bortezomib). Rifampicin will be used to assess the effect of a strong CYP3A4 inducer and dexamethasone to assess the effect of a relatively weak inducer. This study is also to evaluate the impact of CYP3A4 inducers on the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VELCADE and the safety profile of VELCADE.
