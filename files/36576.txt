Exercise for Fighting Oncology Repercussions After Treatment
Cancer survival rates are currently on the verge of 70% at 5 years since diagnosis. Recent improvements in main cancer therapies including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and immunotherapy as well as developments of new biological therapies have significantly improved survival rates but unfortunately, cancer-related side effects continue to affect many patients even years after completion of main treatments. Exercise has been shown to not only ameliorate cancer-related effects before, during and after treatment but also improve disease-free and overall survival rates by decreasing risk factors associated with cancer risk and improving resilience to treatment. In this non-randomised, three-arm study, we aim to assess the effects of three forms of exercise (i.e: Nordic Walking, Aquatic Exercise and Functional Exercise) on physical performance, cancer-related fatigue, health-related quality of life and cancer-specific symptoms in a wide range of cancer survivors.
Neoplasms
