Lu177-EB-PSMA617 Radionuclide Treatment in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
In prior studies, the investigators synthesized 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 by conjugating a truncated Evans Blue (EB) molecule and DOTA chelator onto PSMA-617 and labeled it with 177Lu to increase the tumor accumulation and retention for radioligand therapyï¼Œand then the investigators evaluated the dosimetry of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 and response to single low-dose treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer(mCRPC). This study was performed to evaluate the safety and therapy response to 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients with mCRPC.

This is an open-label, randomized study. Different groups with doses of 1.11GBq (30 mCi), 2.00 GBq (54 mCi) and 3.7GBq (100 mCi)of 177Lu-EB -PSMA617 will be injected intravenously. All patients will undergo 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scans before and after the treatment.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: 1.11GBq of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617|DRUG: 2.00 GBq of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617|DRUG: 3.70GBq of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617
Change of the PSA and standardized uptake value of 68Ga-PSMA before and after the treatment in mCRPC, The semiquantitative analysis will be performed by the same person for all the cases, and the standardized uptake in lesions will be measured., 1 year
Adverse events collection, Adverse events after the treatment of patients will be followed and assessed, patients will be monitored throughout the whole treatment period. Patients will be followed up every 3 month until 1 year for a long-term follow-up period.
Prostate cancer (PC) is the second most common cancer worldwide in men, with persistently high numbers dying from this disease. Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility of 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy as a viable treatment option in mCRPC. To increase tumor accumulation and retention for radioligand therapy, and reduce dosage of 177Lu, the investigators conjugated a truncated Evans blue (EB) molecule and DOTA chelator onto PSMA-617 (EB-PSMA-617) and label it with 177Lu.

The study is open-label and patients will be divided into three groups and monitored throughout the 6 to 10-month treatment period for survival, disease progression, and adverse events to evaluate the safety and therapy response to the 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617.
