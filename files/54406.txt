Utidelone Plus Bevacizumab for Advanced Breast Cancer With Brain Metastases
This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of utidelone in combination with bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced breast cancer with brain metastases, and thus provides a new systemic treatment strategy for those patients.

This is a multicenter,open label, phase 2 trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of utidelone in combination with bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced breast cancer with brain metastases. Patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who have received at least one prior anthracycline and one prior taxane or HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who have failed trastuzumab and pyrotinib, and with at least one measurable CNS lesion are eligible for the study.

This study includes 2 cohorts, and the Simon two-stage design are applied, respectively. A total of 48 patients with HER2-negative advanced breast cancer are included in cohort 1, and 52 patients with HER-2 positive patients are enrolled in cohort 2. Patients in both cohorts receive bevacizumab, 15mg/kg, day 1, and utidelone, 30mg/m2 (±10%), day 1-5 every 3-week cycle until disease progression or unmanageable toxicity. The primary endpoint is CNS-ORR according to the RECIST 1.1. The secondary endpoints include CNS-ORR according to RANO criteria, CNS-PFS assessed by investigator, extracranial ORR, extracranial PFS, OS, time to WBRT, quality of life and safety profile according to NCI-CTCAE 5.0.
