A Phase I Study of Fluzoparib in Patient With Advanced Solid Malignancies
Fluzoparib is an oral potent, selective PARP-1 and PARP-2 inhibitor. The objective of this study will be to investigate the safety and tolerability of Fluzoparib Capsule when given orally to Chinese patients with advanced solid malignancies. In addition, the pharmacokinetic profile, MTD (if possible) and efficacy of Fluzoparib will be investigated.
