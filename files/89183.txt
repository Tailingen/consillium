Chemoradiotherapy With or Without Metformin in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
This is a prospective, single-center, phase II, randomized, window-of-opportunity trial initiated by researchers. The research hypothesis is that metformin can improve the level of hypoxia in locally advanced cervical cancer and further improve progression-free survival. The study aims to compare the improvement of tumor hypoxia with synchronous chemoradiotherapy with or without metformin, using CA-IX PET/CT and radiation positioning spectral CT to evaluate tumor hypoxia, screening hypoxic patients for inclusion in the study, and comparing the effects of synchronous chemoradiotherapy with or without metformin on the degree of hypoxia and progression-free survival in the two groups of patients.
Cervical Cancer|Radiotherapy|Metformin|Hypoxia|PET/CT
DRUG: Metformin|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: Chemotherapy|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET/CT
The degree to which metformin improves the hypoxic index measured by CAIX PET, Using the uptake value parameter of CA-IX in PET/CT, comparing the changes in uptake values between the two scans as an indicator of improvement in hypoxia level, 1week after randomization
Progression-free survival（PFS）, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause,whichever is first., 2-year|Changes in tumor volume during treatment, Tumor volume will be measured via pelvic MRI., Baseline，1month and 2 months.|Hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Treatment-related toxicity reactions in both groups of patients will be evaluated during the treatment period, at the end of treatment, and three months after treatment completion, Up to 3 months after treatment.|Quality of life assessed by QLQ-C30, Assessment of quality of life in both groups of patients, Up to 3 months after treatment
