Somatostatin Analogues in the Treatment of Relapsing GH Pituitary Adenomas After Surgery
At present there are no recommendations regarding the possibility of discontinuing treatment in cases of recurrent acromegaly with good hormonal control. Discontinuation of treatment is therefore most often decided by the practitioner, on the basis of his experience and knowledge of the patient, the long-term course with somatostatin analogues being very little described.

Thus, although hormonal control is achieved in a majority of cases under medical treatment, we do not know if it is possible to stop treatment and in this case how the pathology evolves. It would appear that approximately 40% of patients defined as very good responders to somatostatin analogues may gradually space their injections.
