A Study Evaluating FMC-376 in Participants With KRAS G12C Mutated Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate FMC-376 in participants with advanced solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutations. This clinical trial will be conducted in 3 parts: Phase 1A (Dose Escalation), Phase 1B (Dose Expansion), and Phase 2 (Cohort Expansion). Multiple dose levels in participants with advanced solid tumors will be evaluated.
