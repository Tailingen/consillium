Afatinib After Chemoradiation and Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck at High-Risk of Recurrence
This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving afatinib after chemoradiation and surgery works in treating patients with stage III-IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck at high-risk of recurrence. Afatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: afatinib|OTHER: placebo
Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from randomization to the earlier of disease recurrence, second primary cancer, or death without recurrence., Assessed every 3 months for patients < 2 years from registration and every 6 months if patient is 2-3 years from registration and every 12 months if patient is 4-5 years from registration
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Examine disease-free survival (DFS) given afatinib/placebo adjuvant therapy in patients with viable tumors in lymph nodes after neck dissection for suspected residual disease after concurrent chemoradiation.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Evaluate the recurrence rate, recurrence patterns, development of second primary malignancies, overall survival (OS) and toxicity of afatinib/placebo.

II. Evaluate on-target inhibition by afatinib, and determine circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as a biomarker of afatinib resistance.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM A: Patients receive afatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

ARM B: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28.

In both Arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year and then every 12 months for 2 years.
