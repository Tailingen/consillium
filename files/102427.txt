Fluzoparib (SHR-3162) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate \[ADP\] ribose polymerase (PARP) 1/2 being developed for treatment of BRCA1/2-mutant solid tumor. The tolerability, safety and PK of fluzoparib has been evaluated in Phase 1 study. An oral formulation is the focus of current development efforts.
