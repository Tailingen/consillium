Functional Imaging of Tumor and Normal Tissue
Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted (DW)-MRI, and fludeoxyglucose - positron emission tomography - computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) are three modalities that generate non-invasive, functional images of tumors and normal tissues based on physiologic properties including perfusion, vascular permeability and glucose metabolism. Demonstrating that these parameters are associated with clinical outcome, either efficacy or toxicity, could enhance the ability to select patients for different treatment strategies and improve the therapeutic ratio.
Head and Neck Cancer
PROCEDURE: MRI and PET imaging
Permeability, perfusion, diffusion and glucose metabolism, At end of 1 week of radiation therapy
Relationships between baseline and treatment induced changes in vascular permeability, perfusion, interstitial space, glucose metabolism, and saliva production to identify prognostic and predictive parameter(s) for treatment, 1 year of completing radiation therapy
Patients will undergo functional imaging studies, DCE-MRI pre-treatment (twice) and after 1 week of Radiation Therapy (RT) and PET scans - pre-treatment and after 1 week of RT. Parotid gland saliva production will also be measured at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up.
