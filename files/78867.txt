This is a single arm, open-label, single-center study. This study is indicated for relapsed or refractory CD19+ B-line hematological malignancy: B-ALL and B-NHL. the selection of dose levels and the number of subjects are based on clinical tiral of similar foreign products. 2 groups of patients will be enrolled, 36 in each group. Primary objective is to explore the safety, main consideration is dose-related safety.
