Studying Biomarkers in Cell Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in cell samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

Significance of regulation of microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 by C/EBPα during granulopoiesis|Relationship between overexpression of microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 in myeloid progenitors with C/EBPα mutations and granulocytic differentiation|Downregulation of E2F3 by microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 during granulopoiesis|Role of microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 in myeloid cell proliferation
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the significance of regulation of microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 by C/EBPα during granulopoiesis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia with CEBPA mutations.
* To determine whether overexpression of micro RNA-34a and microRNA-194 in myeloid progenitors with C/EBPα mutations leads to granulocytic differentiation.
* To examine how microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 downregulate E2F3 during granulopoiesis.
* To determine the role of microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 in myeloid cell proliferation.

OUTLINE: Cryopreserved cell samples are collected for laboratory analysis, including mutation analysis, gene expression analysis, RNA analysis, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.
