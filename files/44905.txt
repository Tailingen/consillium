A Phase 1 Study of Oprozomib to Assess Food Effect, Drug-Drug Interaction With Midazolam, and Safety and Tolerability in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
The purpose of this Phase 1 of the study is to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oprozomib, the drug-drug interaction of oprozomib with midazolam, and the safety and tolerability of oprozomib in patients with advanced malignancies
Advanced Non-Central Nervous System (CNS) Malignancies
DRUG: Oprozomib|DRUG: Midazolam
Food Effect/QTc - Cmax, Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter Cmax (maximum plasma concentration of oprozomib) between each diet (oprozomib under fasting versus low-fat, and fasting versus high-fat conditions)., Approximately 5 days or up to 2 weeks|Food Effect/QTc - AUC, Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter AUC (area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable time point \[AUC0-t\], area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity \[AUC0-inf\]) of oprozomib between each diet (oprozomib under fasting versus low-fat, and fasting versus high-fat conditions)., Approximately 5 days or up to 2 weeks|Food Effect - tmax and t1/2, Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters tmax (time to reach maximum plasma concentration) and t1/2 (terminal half-life) between each diet (oprozomib under fasting versus low-fat, and fasting versus high-fat conditions)., Approximately 5 days or up to 2 weeks|Food Effect - QT/QTc interval, QT/QTc interval will be extracted from continuous ECGs performed during each period in the Food Effect/QTc part of the study:

* Twelve (12)-lead ECGs will be serially recorded digitally and read centrally
* The RR, PR and QT intervals and QRS duration will be analyzed
* QTc will be calculated using Bazett's and Fridericia's formulas, Approximately 5 days or up to 2 weeks|Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) - Cmax, Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) of midazolam, in the presence and absence of oprozomib., Approximately 1 month|Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) - AUC, Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameter AUC (area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable time point \[AUC0-t\], area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity \[AUC0-inf\]) of midazolam, in the presence and absence of oprozomib., Approximately 1 month
Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of patients that experience Adverse Events (AEs). Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) graded according to the NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.03)., Approximately 18 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) according to disease-specific response criteria, Approximately 18 months|Time To Progression (TTP), Time to progression (TTP) according to disease-specific evaluation criteria, Approximately 18 months
The purpose of this Phase 1 of the study is to evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of oprozomib, the drug-drug interaction of oprozomib with midazolam, and the safety and tolerability of oprozomib in patients with advanced malignancies
