Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Combination With Anlotinib and Benmelstobart for HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer (NEOTORCH-BREAST03)
Our center plans to conduct a prospective, single-arm exploratory clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with Anlotinib and Benmelstobart in the treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancer. The aim is to further explore the treatment strategy of chemotherapy de-escalation for patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer, provide more treatment options for breast cancer patients, and offer a potential theoretical basis for the precision treatment of breast cancer.The primary study objective is to evaluate the pathologic complete response（PCR）and RCB0-1 ratio of neodjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancer.

pathologic complete response（PCR）, The primary study objective is to evaluate the pathologic complete response（PCR） of neoadjuvant treatment of HR+/HER2- breast cancer with Anlotinib and Benmelstobart, 2 years|RCB 0-1 Ratio, In clinical trials comparing different neoadjuvant treatment regimens, the RCB 0 - 1 Ratio is a crucial evaluation indicator. For example, in a study comparing a traditional chemotherapy regimen with a novel targeted combination chemotherapy regimen, by observing the differences in the RCB 0 - 1 Ratio between the two groups of patients, it can be determined which regimen enables more patients to reach the RCB 0 or RCB 1 status, thus providing a basis for selecting a better treatment option., 2 years
Event Free Survival（EFS), Event Free Survival (EFS) refers to the time from the start of randomization (the start of treatment in a single-arm trial) to the first occurrence of any of the following events: disease progression that makes surgical treatment impossible, local or distant recurrence, death due to any cause, etc. It can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug., 3 years
