Sorafenib With Capecitabine for Patients With Measurable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This research study will evaluate Sorafenib (Nexavar®) and Capecitabine (Xeloda®) to see the following:

* how effective this combination of study drugs will be in treating HCC
* how long subjects respond to these study drugs
* what types of side effects can be expected, and
* how severe the side effects are

All subjects in this study will receive:

* Sorafenib twice a day by mouth
* Capecitabine twice a day by mouth

Treatment will be given in a 28-day treatment cycle.

Subjects will take sorafenib every day of the cycle. Subjects will take capecitabine on days 1-7 and 15-21 of the cycle
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Sorafenib & Capecitabine
Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events, The primary objective of the study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of the study treatment regimen. The analyses will be descriptive and no formal hypotheses testing will be performed. Toxicities (i.e. Adverse Events) are evaluated prior to each treatment and during any clinical visit., 6 months
Disease Control Rate of Response (DCR), Tumor response is evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). Target lesions are assessed by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI:) Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions to qualify for Progressive Disease; Progressive Disease (PD), 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Disease control rate (DCR) is the sum of the percentages of patients achieving complete and partial responses and stable disease, 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), The time from treatment initiation to death by any cause, 5 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), The time from treatment initiation to disease progression or death by any cause. Progression is evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0). Target lesions are assessed by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI:) Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions to qualify for Progressive Disease; Progressive Disease (PD), 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., 5 years
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as primary liver cancer, is the most common form of liver cancer and is responsible for 80 percent of the primary malignant liver tumors in adults. It is the fifth most common cancer in the world. HCC disproportionately affects men, with four times as many men developing the disease as women. In 2002, approximately 626,000 cases of HCC were reported worldwide (15,000 in the United States and 53,600 in Europe), and more than 600,000 deaths (about 13,000 Americans and 57,000 Europeans) due to HCC were reported. The five-year relative survival rate is about seven percent.

The Gem-Ox regimen has been used in the treatment of pancreatic cancer with encouraging results. Preliminary results of the Gem-Ox combination have been encouraging as well.Based on these observations the possibility of adding bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGF, is being studied by other investigators. However, the combination of GEM-OX with bevacizumab is unlikely to be tolerated by HCC patients with Child-Pugh class B and C liver cirrhosis especially those with significant thrombocytopenia.It would seem therefore that the agents that could be tolerated by cirrhotic patients with advanced HCC would include capecitabine, erlotinib and sorafenib. We propose this phase II trial of sorafenib + capecitabine combination in patients with HCC and advanced liver cirrhosis who have a platelet count of ≥ 40,000 and a Child-Pugh (C-P) class A-and B liver cirrhosis with a life expectancy of ≥16 weeks.
