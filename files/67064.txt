OBJECTIVE:

This study aims to determine wether a geriatric intervention based on an individualized program of physical exercise and nutritional support improves the ability to complete oncological treatment at the doses and time initially planned in patients ≥ 70 years affected by hematological malignancies.

DESIGN:

Prospective, clinical trial, randomized, parallel and open groups.

SETTING:

Patients ≥ 70 years recently diagnosed of malignant hematological pathology in a comprehensive cancer center

INTERVENTION:

All those patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate, will sign the corresponding informed consent and will be assessed through a CGA (comprehensive geriatric assessment), that includes the performance of a physical condition test (SPPB), and randomized to the study group or control group. Patients in the study group will participate in an intervention program with nutritional support and physical exercise during the period in which they are receiving oncological treatment or for a maximum period of 6 months. The patients of the control group will pass to follow up. All patients, regardless of the branch of study to which they are assigned, will receive the oncological treatment indicated by their doctor and a standard follow-up according to the current care protocols in the center.

DETERMINATIONS:

Main variable: proportion of adherence to treatment calculated as the percentage between the dose administered and the prescribed. Adherence over 80% will be considered acceptable.

Secondary variables: geriatric, nutritional and physical-condition parameters before and after the intervention, quality of life before and after the intervention, toxicity and complications during treatment and response to treatment.
