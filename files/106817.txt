Study of Ibrutinib Combined With Venetoclax in Subjects With Mantle Cell Lymphoma (SYMPATICO)
This Phase 3 multinational, randomized, double-blind study is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of ibrutinib and venetoclax vs. ibrutinib and placebo in subjects with MCL.

Occurrence of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) (Safety Run-in Period), To evaluate the occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with the concurrent administration of ibrutinib and venetoclax., Approximately 3 months after last subject enrolled into safety run-in portion|Occurrence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) (Safety Run-in Period), To evaluate the occurrence of DLTs with the concurrent administration of ibrutinib and venetoclax., Approximately 3 months after last subject enrolled into safety run-in portion|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) (Safety Run-in Period), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event that, based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.

Complete Response (CR) (Randomization Period), Complete response rate (CR) based on the best overall response per investigator assessment according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma., approximately 1 year after last subject has stopped treatment with study drug(s)|Overall response rate (ORR) (Randomization Period and Treatment-Naive Arm), ORR is defined as CR or PR per investigator assessment according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma., approximately 1 year after last subject has stopped treatment with study drug(s)|MRD-negative remission rate in participants who achieve CR per investigator assessment (Randomization Period and Treatment-Naive Arm), MRD-negative remission is defined as undetectable MRD at documented CR in subjects who were MRD positive at screening as assessed by flow cytometry in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood, with requirement of confirmation of MRD negativity in the subsequent peripheral blood 12 weeks later., approximately 1 year after last subject has stopped treatment with study drug(s)|Overall Survival (OS) (Randomization Period and Treatment-Naive Arm), OS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study treatment to death from any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of Response (DOR) (Randomization Period and Treatment-Naive Arm), DOR is defined as participants who achieve an overall response as the time from the first occurrence of response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5 years|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT) (Randomization Period and Treatment-Naive Arm), TTNT is defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the start date of any anti-lymphoma treatment subsequent to study treatment., Up to approximately 5 years|Percentage of participants experiencing Adverse Events (Randomization Period), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., Up to approximately 5 years|Occurrence of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) (Randomization Period), To evaluate the occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) with the concurrent administration of ibrutinib and venetoclax., Approximately 3 months after last subject enrolled into safety run-in portion|Cmax if Ibrutinib (Randomization Period), Cmax if Ibrutinib., Week 6|Tmax if Ibrutinib (Randomization Period), Tmax if Ibrutinib., Week 6|AUClast if Ibrutinib (Randomization Period), AUClast if Ibrutinib., Week 6|Half-Life (T1/2) if Ibrutinib (Randomization Period), Half-Life (T1/2) if Ibrutinib., Week 6|Cmax of Venetoclax (Randomization Period), Cmax of Venetoclax., Week 6|Tmax of Venetoclax (Randomization Period), Tmax of Venetoclax., Week 6|AUC of Venetoclax (Randomization Period), AUC of Venetoclax., Week 6|Time to worsening in FACT-Lym subscale of the health-related quality of life (Randomization Period) questionnaire (FACT-Lym), Time to worsening in FACT-Lym subscale of the health-related quality of life questionnaire (FACT-Lym) will be compared between treatment arms., Week 6|Duration of CR (Treatment-Naive Arm Period), Duration of CR, defined for subjects who achieve CR as the time from the first occurrence of CR to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 5 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS) (Treatment-Naive Arm Period), To evaluate PFS of ibrutinib and venetoclax compared to ibrutinib and placebo., approximately 1 year after last subject has stopped treatment with study drug(s)
