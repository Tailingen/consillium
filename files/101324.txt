Metoprolol Treatment for Cytokine Release Syndrome in Patients Treated With Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells
The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of metoprolol, a beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, in the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) caused by chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell infusions, its effects on the serum levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other cytokines.
