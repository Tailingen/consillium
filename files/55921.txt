Effects of the C-SCAT versus usual care on the primary outcomes of self-efficacy for symptom management immediately post intervention (Time 1) by comparing the scores from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System®; PROMIS® Scale., Self-efficacy for symptom management will be assessed with the PROMIS® Self Efficacy for Symptom Management Scale that contains 28 items and assess the person's current level of confidence to manage/control symptoms, manage symptoms in different settings, and keep symptoms from interfering with work, relationships, or activities. Response options are on a 5-point Likert scale (1=I am not confident at all; 5=I am very confident). Scores are summed across items, and higher scores indicate greater self-efficacy, Baseline- Week 0|Effects of the C-SCAT versus usual care on the primary outcomes of self-efficacy for symptom management immediately post intervention (Time 1) by comparing the scores from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System®; PROMIS® Scale., Self-efficacy for symptom management will be assessed with the PROMIS® Self Efficacy for Symptom Management Scale that contains 28 items and assess the person's current level of confidence to manage/control symptoms, manage symptoms in different settings, and keep symptoms from interfering with work, relationships, or activities.

Items are scored using a 5-point Likert scale (0=never/rarely; 4=always). Scores are summed across all items.

Effects of the C-SCAT versus usual care on secondary outcomes (symptom severity) at baseline, by comparing the scores from the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS)., Symptom severity in the past week will be assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). Participants rate the severity on a 4-point Likert scale (1=slightly; 4=very severe), and the distress on a 5-point Likert scale (0=none; 4=very much)., Baseline-Week 0|Effects of the C-SCAT versus usual care on secondary outcomes (symptom severity) immediately post intervention (Time 1) by comparing the scores from the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS)., Symptom severity in the past week will be assessed with the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS).

This is a multi-site two-group randomized control trial (RCT) design to evaluate the effects of the Computerized Symptom Assessment Tool (C-SCAT) for improving symptom self-management versus usual care in 126 adolescents and young adults (AYAs) who are within the first three months of a diagnosis of cancer and who are receiving cancer treatment. For this study, cancer treatment will be defined as a prescribed infusion ( e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy).
