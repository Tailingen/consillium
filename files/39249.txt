A Trial to Evaluate the Impact of Lung-protective Intervention in Patients Undergoing Esophageal Cancer Surgery
The purpose of this trial is to determine whether low tidal volume during intraoperative one-lung ventilation could decrease the incidence rate of postoperative acute lung injury compared to "normal" tidal volume.
Acute Lung Injury
OTHER: protective ventilation|OTHER: conventional ventilation
cytokines of bronchoalveolar lavage, TNF-a,IL-1b,IL-6,IL-8 of BAL will be measured with enzyme-linked immunoassay,all markers will be reported with a unit of pg/ml, 10 minutes before surgery ,at the end of surgery immediately
postoperative hospital days, duration of hospital stay after surgery, after surgery up to the time when patient is discharged or deadï¼Œit is an average|incidence rate of acute lung injury, Diagnosis of acute lung injury is followed the consensus criteria for ALI/ARDS published in "Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1994, 149:818-824"., after surgery up to 28 days|incidence rate of surgical complications, surgical complications include anastomotic fistula, postoperative infection and the patients will be followed until death or discharged, after surgery up to 28 days|inhospital mortality, the number of death in the period of hospital stay, after surgery up to 28 days|Oxygenation Index, Oxygenation Index=PaO2/FiO2, 10 minutes before surgery,at the end of surgery immediately,12h after surgery|CT scan of chest, Severity of pulmonary edema will be evaluated by CT scan of chest, 12 hours after the surgery
Large tidal volume are known risk factor of acute lung injury.Mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume has been shown to attenuate lung injuries in critically ill patients.Esophagectomy surgery need a relatively long time of one-lung ventilation. A normal tidal volume of two-lung ventilation should be a large one when exerted to one lung. We hypothesized that low tidal volume ventilation during one-lung ventilation could decrease incidence rate of postoperative acute lung injury and mortality.
