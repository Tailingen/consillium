MRI- Guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation of Localized Prostate Cancer
Primary purpose :

Evaluation of the efficiency and safety of an alternative global prostate treatment in localized prostate cancer.

Primary Objective:

Absence of clinically significant cancer (CSC) on control biopsy at 1-year follow-up.

Secondary Objectives:

1. Biochemical response
2. Presence of any CSC on biopsy at 1- and 2-year follow-up
3. Radical treatment free survival
4. Adverse events, clinical tolerance
5. Urinary continence
6. Erectile function
7. Quality of life
