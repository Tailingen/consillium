Topical Rapamycin Therapy to Alleviate Cutaneous Manifestations of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and Neurofibromatosis I (NF1)
This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the safety of a topically applied formulation of rapamycin to cutaneous fibromatous lesions in subjects with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and Neurofibromatosis I (NF1). Subjects will apply either a Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coating (Skincerity) containing rapamycin or the PVDF coating alone nightly to fibromatous lesions for a duration of six months.

The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of the topical product in patients with TSC and NF1. The secondary goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the topical product for treatment of cutaneous fibromatous lesions.
