Intervention in Single Thyroid Nodule.
Thyroid nodules are common clinical problem. The incidence is 2-4 per 100,000 people per year, being more common in women and the elderly. thyroid nodule is a "discrete lesion within the thyroid gland that is radiologically distinct from the surrounding thyroid parenchyma. Most thyroid nodules are asymptomatic, may present as neck swelling

PROCEDURE: thyroidectomy
Improvement in the management of single thyroid nodule to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates, Compare between total thyroidectomy and hemithyroidectomy in patients with single thyroid nodule to improve the management of single thyroid nodule in general surgery department , Assiut university hospital., one year
Thyroid nodular disease comprises of a wide range of disorders. Benign forms such as colloid nodules,cysts and thyroiditis are more comman than benign follicular neoplasms and thyroid carcinomas. Incidence of malignancy ranges from 10% to 30% in solitary thyroid nodule(STN).Studies have shown that the occurrence of malignancy is higher in case of solitary thyroid nodule compared to multinodular goitres. Preoperative evaluation of thyroid nodules is important in distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid nodules and also in treatment to avoid unnecessary extensive surgery and its complications. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the most common method of examining solitary thyroid nodules today.Total thyroidectomy and lobectomy remain the main primary surgical interventions for single thyroid nodule. There is debat between total thyroidectomy and hemithyroidectomy for patients with single thyroid nodule. our study is for comparing between total thyroidectomy and hemi thyroidectomy in single thyroid nodule
