Implantable Microdevice for In Vivo Drug Sensitivity Testing in Patients With Early Stage, HER2-Positive or Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and feasibility of placing and removing a small device that contains anti-cancer drugs in a breast tumor of patients who plan on having breast surgery without treatment prior or patients who plan on receiving standard preoperative chemotherapy prior to their breast surgery. This device may be able to predict what types of treatment work best against an individual's breast cancer. With this device, the investigators hope to be able to personalize treatment choices based on an individual's type of breast cancer.
