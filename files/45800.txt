The Effect Of Ultrasound-guided Modified Pectoral Nerves Block Versus Ketamine Plus Magnesium Infusion On Analgesic Profile In Breast Cancer Surgeries
Background: Postoperative pain is one of the greatest patient concerns following surgery. However, general anesthesia cannot provide adequate postoperative pain control and the routine use of parenteral opioids aggravates postoperative sedation, nausea, emesis, impaired oxygenation and depressed ventilation.

Hypothesis:

The investigators assume that both ultrasound guided Modified Pecs Block and combination of Ketamine and Magnesium sulphate infusion can achieve better analgesia in major breast cancer surgery in the form of reducing total amount of intraoperative fentanyl requirement and reducing postoperative morphine requirement and improvement of postoperative VAS scores both at rest and during shoulder movement so we plan this study to evaluate this assumption
Postoperative Pain
PROCEDURE: pectoral nerves block group|DRUG: Ketamine plus magnesium group|DRUG: Control group
total morphine requirements, calculating the total dose of morphine consumed in postoperative analgesia, 24 hours postoperatively
fentanyl consumption, Total amount of fentanyl used by the anesthetic provider in the operating room, intraoperative period|Visual analogue scale score, assessement of Pain intensity in the PACU using the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, both at rest and during shoulder movement, a scale from 0 to 10. scores towards 0 is reveal good analgesia., immediately after recovery and then at 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively.|Sedation score, Sedation score assessement in Post Anesthesia Care Unit according to ramasy sedation score.(125) a scale from 1 to 6 with the preferred scores 2 or 3., A sedation level recorded upon arrival to the PACU and at 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively.|Nausea and vomiting, assessement of Nausea and vomiting Scores using a four-point verbal scale (127).lower scores are preferred., during the first post-operative 24 hours
Surgery on the chest wall is relatively common and can be associated with significant postoperative discomfort and pain; and one of the most common surgical sites on the chest wall is the breast, with the main indication for breast surgery being breast cancer. Breast cancer has continued to be the most common cancer in females, accounting for approximately 31% of all newly detected cancer cases in the female population, worldwide. (1, 2) Thousands of patients undergo surgery in the mammary and axillary regions every year, and these procedures tend to cause significant acute pain and may develop in to cases of chronic pain in 25-60% of cases. (3) Pain can be controlled using systemic opioids which have a respiratory depressant effect and causing nausea and vomiting.

Also can be controlled using epidural catheter that can cause haemodynamic instability, so we are searching about how to devrease pain with less complications.
