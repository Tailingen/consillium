Low Risk Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: assessments
evaluate the impact of anxiety and the inability to tolerate ambiguity, on the decision making process in men with prostate cancer who are eligible for active surveillance and their partners/close allies. All participants will be administered a set of questionnaires that assess psychological and affective functioning, and treatment preferences., 2 years
how partners/close allies influence the decision making process, participants will be administered a set of questionnaires that assess psychological and affective functioning, and treatment preferences., 2 years
Each patient and his partner will fill out assessments at baseline. Thereafter we will obtain the patients' treatment decision (AT or AS) within approximately 6 months. Once a patient makes a decision, he and his partner will complete another set of questionnaires. The patient and his partner will then complete the remaining questionnaires approximately 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following the treatment decision. We will examine the associations between baseline assessments , and the treatment decision as well as the changes in the assessments and the treatment decision. We will also assess associations between follow-up assessments and the decision to change a treatment decision from AS to AT. Data from patients and partners/close allies will generally be analyzed separately, thus patients who do not have a partner (or partner declines to participate) can still be enrolled and their psychosocial outcomes assessed.
