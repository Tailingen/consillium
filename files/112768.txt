Patients will be monitored for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the dose escalation in order to define the MTD. Two of the three arms in the dose expansion will include PF-06747143 in combination with standard of care chemotherapy and will include a safety lead in. The third arm, pending clinical data, will be PF-06747143 as a single agent.
