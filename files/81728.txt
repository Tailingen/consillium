Study of Azacitidine，Venetoclax，and Flumatinib in Newly Diagnosed Ph-positive Acute Leukemia and CML-AP/BP Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of azacitidine，venetoclax，and flumatinib in newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute leukemia and accelerated phase or blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients.
Philadelphia Chromosome|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Chronic Myeloid Leukemia|Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia
DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Flumatinib
CMR, Complete molecular remission (CMR) was defined as undetectable BCR/ABL transcript., End of cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)
CR/CRi, MRD-negative CR, CCyR, MMR, Complete remission (CR) was defined as \< 5% bone marrow blasts in an aspirate with spicules and independent of transfusions.

CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) was defined as \<5% bone marrow blasts, either ANC\<1×10\^9/L or platelets \< 100×10\^9/L, transfusion independence but with persistence of cytopenia.

Minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR was defined as a leukemic cell count below the sensitivity threshold of 1×10-4 (0.01%) bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) by multiparameter flow cytometry.

Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) was defined as lack of Ph in ≥ 20 bone marrow metaphases.

Major molecular response (MMR) was defined as a BCR-ABL/ABL transcript ratio of 0.1% (international scale)., End of cycle 1 and 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|Number of adverse events, Adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V5.0., End of cycle 1 and 2 (each cycle is 28 days)|RFS, Relapse-free survival (RFS) was the duration from the day of CR to leukemia relapse, death, or last follow-up., 2 years|OS, Overall survival (OS) was the time from enrollment to death for any reason., 2 years
This is a phase Ⅱ, open-label, single-arm, single-center study in newly diagnosed Ph-positive acute leukemia and CML-AP/BP patients. The patients will receive azacitidine, venetoclax, and flumatinib regimen in the induction treatment. The patients who respond to induction treatment will undergo consolidation treatment, and an optional allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and post-transplantation maintenance treatment with induction therapy according to patient's wishes.
