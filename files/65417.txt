Sym004 in Subjects With Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1b, dose escalation trial of Sym004 administered in combination with 1 of 3 platinum-doublets in subjects with Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

The sponsor decided to discontinue the development of Sym004. Also the decision was made to discontinue the development of Sym004 in NSCLC indication. The decision to discontinue Sym004 in NSCLC was not related to any safety or efficacy findings regarding Sym004. As a result of the early discontinuation of the trial during the dose escalation part, the expansion cohort will no longer be performed hence the pre-specified secondary endpoints are not analyzed and were removed from the protocol based on protocol amendment 2 dated 31 March 2015.

Number of Subjects With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT: any National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 Grade 4 hematologic or Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities that occurred during DLT observation period and were considered by Investigator to be at least possibly related to trial treatment, and were confirmed by Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC), with exception of Grade 4 neutropenia for not \>5 days; Grade 4 lymphocytopenia/ thrombocytopenia for not \>5 days; fatigue/headache lasting \< 7 days; nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea lasting not \>3 days; asymptomatic Grade 3 increase in liver function tests that resolve to baseline within 7 days; Mucositis \>= Grade 3 lasting \< 7 days; Grade 3 hyperglycemia that resolves in \< 7 days; any laboratory values \>Grade 3 without any clinical correlate (resolve within 5 days); Grade 3 skin toxicities that resolve to Grade 2 within 7 days; Grade 3/4 hypomagnesemia that resolves within 5 days. Subjects with DLTs presented based on investigator and SMC decision., Day 1 to Day 21 of Cycle 1
Number of Subjects With Treatment-emergent Adverse (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation and TEAEs Leading to Death, An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE was any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. AEs were considered treatment emergent if they started on or after the day of first administration of the first trial treatment given (Sym004 or one of the individual Platinum-Doublet therapies) or if they worsened after receiving first dose of treatment., Day 1 up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (up to 53 weeks)
