Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab as Neoadjuvant Treatment in Patients With HER2-Positive Breast Cancer
This research is being done to determine if early changes on a type of imaging procedure called PET (Positron Emission Tomography) can predict which patients are most likely to respond to the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab when given prior to surgery.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Positron emission tomography (PET)|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Pertuzumab
Percent Change in Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) as Measured by SULmax on [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET), SULmax is the maximum SUV corrected for lean body mass. Change in SULmax from baseline to Day 15 on FDG PET in correlation with pathological complete response (pCR) in patients treated with preoperative pertuzumab/trastuzumab. pCR was defined as no viable invasive cancer in breast and axilla by local pathology review. SULmax was measured via spherical volume over the target primary breast cancer tissue., Baseline and Day 15
Change in ptDNA With Response, To correlate PIK3CA mutation status and other genomic alterations (mutations/somatic rearrangements) qualitatively and quantitatively in plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) with pCR, 2 years|Change in PI3K Pathway Activation With Response, To correlate PI3K pathway activation (e.g. PTEN low and/or PIK3CA mutation, human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 1-4 expression and/or phosphorylation) in tumor samples and pCR, 2 years|Changes in Ki67 With Response, To correlate baseline and change (day 15) in Ki67 with pCR, 2 years
This study will evaluate for the first time the correlation between early changes in SUV and pCR in men and women with ER-negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer receiving trastuzumab and pertuzumab (PT) pre-operatively. This has not previously been evaluated in patients receiving anti HER2 therapy alone and as such is novel and potentially practice changing. The results from this phase 2 biomarker study will be used to plan a randomized study using a predefined cut point for SUV decline such that the investigators can further attempt to identify a group of individuals with HER2-positive early breast cancer who do not require cytotoxic chemotherapy in addition to anti-HER2 agents. This non-invasive biomarker approach will be of great interest to breast cancer oncologists and patients by facilitating a personalized approach to managing patients with HER2-positive disease that will undoubtedly spare toxicity and reduce the costs associated with anti-cancer strategies, without compromising efficacy.
