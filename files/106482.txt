Recombinant Human Endostatin Continued Pumping Into Vein Combining With CCRT in Unresectable Stage III NSCLC
Resistance of hypoxic tumor cells to radiation is a significant reason of failure in the local control of tumors, especially the squamous cell carcinomas. Preclinical models have shown that Endostar may transiently "normalize" the tumor vasculature to make it more efficient for oxygen delivery, thereby providing a window of opportunity for enhanced sensitivity to radiation treatment. This study is to evaluate the safety, toxicity, and efficacy of the addition of Endostar Continued Pumping into Vein to the standard CCRT regimen in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC.

Response rate, complete response(CR); partial response(PR); stable disease(SD); progressive disease(PD), 1 month|overall survival, from date of beginning treatment until date of death, 5 years|treatment related toxicities, radiation-induced esophagitis; radiation-induced pneumonia, 3 months
Primary

Evaluate the efficacy and safety of Endostar combined with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Secondary

Measure changes in VEGF and other angiogenic cytokines and antiangiogenic factors in plasma samples from these patients.

Evaluate the application of CT perfusion imaging to determine changes in tumor vascular mophology and function during treatment.
