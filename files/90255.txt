Sirolimus & Mycophenolate Mofetil as GvHD Prophylaxis in Myeloablative, Matched Related Donor HCT
A continuation study of sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis for patients undergoing matched related allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for acute and chronic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), high risk non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)
Hematologic Diseases|Acute-graft-versus-host Disease|Leukemia|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)|Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Sirolimus|DRUG: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)|DRUG: Carmustine|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide (Cyclo, CY)|DRUG: FTBI
Acute Graft-vs-Host Disease (GvHD) (Grade 2 to 4), Assessed as the incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) at Day 100 post-transplant.

Stage of Acute GvHD was assessed as follows.

* Stage 1: Skin: rash \< 25% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 2 to 3 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \> 500 mL/day or persistent nausea with positive biopsy for GvHD
* Stage 2: Skin: rash 25 to 50% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 3 to 6 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \>1000 mL/day.
* Stage 3: Skin: rash \> 50% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 6 to 15 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \> 1500 mL/day.
* Stage 4: Skin: generalized erythroderma with bulla formation. Liver: bilirubin \> 15 mg/dL. Gut: severe abdominal pain with or without ileus

Grade of Acute GvHD was determined as follows.

* Grade 1: Stage 1-2 Skin + No Liver stage + No Gut stage
* Grade 2: Stage 3 Skin OR Stage 1 Liver or Stage 1 Gut
* Grade 3: No Skin stage + Stage 2 to 3 Liver Stage 2 to 4 Gut
* Grade 4: Stage 4 Skin + or Stage 2 to 3 Liver + No Gut stage, 100 days post-transplant
Acute GvHD (Grade 3 to 4), Assessed as the incidence of grade 3 to 4 acute GvHD at Day 100 post-transplant.

Stage of Acute GvHD was assessed as follows.

* Stage 1: Skin: rash \< 25% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 2 to 3 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \> 500 mL/day or persistent nausea with positive biopsy for GvHD
* Stage 2: Skin: rash 25 to 50% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 3 to 6 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \>1000 mL/day.
* Stage 3: Skin: rash \> 50% of skin. Liver: bilirubin 6 to 15 mg/dL. Gut: diarrhea \> 1500 mL/day.
* Stage 4: Skin: generalized erythroderma with bulla formation. Liver: bilirubin \> 15 mg/dL. Gut: severe abdominal pain with or without ileus

Grade of Acute GvHD was determined as follows.

* Grade 1: Stage 1-2 Skin + No Liver stage + No Gut stage
* Grade 2: Stage 3 Skin OR Stage 1 Liver or Stage 1 Gut
* Grade 3: No Skin stage + Stage 2 to 3 Liver Stage 2 to 4 Gut
* Grade 4: Stage 4 Skin + or Stage 2 to 3 Liver + No Gut stage, 100 days post-transplant|Disease-free Survival (DFS), Assessed as survival without recurrence of disease, 2 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as time from enrollment to time of death or last follow-up, within 2 years., 2 years|Veno-occlusive Disease (VoD), Assessed as the incidence of veno-occlusive disease (VoD) at 100 days post-transplant., 100 days post-transplant
To explore the novel combination of sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) prevention in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or marrow transplantation (BMT), collectively hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This study will report the toxicities associated with this drug combination.

For all treatments and procedures, Study Day is based on the day of HSCT as Day 0.
