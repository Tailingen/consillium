A Study Using Allogenic-Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Specific Cells for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the infusion of partially matched, allogeneic, CMV specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) for patients with GBM that have failed primary therapy.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|BIOLOGICAL: CMV Specific Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL)
To determine the incidence of tumor responses, as defined as stable disease, partial, or complete responses after the infusion of CMV CTL., 2 years
To determine the duration and magnitude of donor chimerism post infusion by micro chimerism assays., 2 years|To determine the incidence of increases in CMV pp65 or IE-1 T cells post infusion of allogeneic CMV CTL of GBM patients., 2 years|To determine safety of allogeneic CTL infusions in this patient population., 2 years
Tumor specimens of consenting patients will be tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the presence of IE-1 and/or pp65. Subjects whose tumors test positive for either or both CMV antigens will be consented for the treatment phase which will include a regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide daily for two days, cyclophosphamide only for a third day, followed by one day of rest prior to the day of CTL infusion.

This trial intended to be a Phase 1/2 trial, but it never progressed to Phase 2 before termination.
