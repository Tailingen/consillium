DTPACE Followed by Tandem Transplant With Melphalan (MEL) 200 Versus MEL/Dexamethasone/Thalidomide (DT) Platinol/Adriamycin/Etoposide (PACE) Hybrid and DTPACE Consolidation
The purpose of this study is to find out if transplant with a new regimen of chemotherapy called DT PACE-Melphalan is better than transplant with Melphalan alone. DT-PACE refers to a chemotherapy regimen for multiple myeloma consisting of Dexamethasone, Thalidomide, Cisplatin or Platinol, Adriamycin or doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, and Etoposide. Another purpose of this study is to find out if there will be fewer side effects with the new regimen of DT PACE-Melphalan, compared to melphalan alone.

Transplant With DT PACE-Melphalan Regimen of Chemotherapy vs. Transplant With Melphalan Alone., Compare a new regimen of chemotherapy called DT PACE-Melphalan (new experimental therapy) is better than transplant with Melphalan alone (standard therapy), 3 years depending on start date
To evaluate, in a randomized phase III clinical trial in previously treated multiple myeloma patients, whether angio-chemotherapy with D.T. PACE followed by tandem transplant with MEL-DTPACE Hybrid may be equivalent or superior to tandem transplant with high dose melphalan in terms of complete remission (CR)/near CR/very good partial remission (VGPR) rate and event-free and overall survival.
