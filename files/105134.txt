Percutaneous Cryoablation of Low-risk Early Breast Cancer
Expand the current evidence base regarding percutaneous cryoablation of early-stage, low-risk breast tumors, integrated into the standard therapeutic pathway with well-defined follow-up data, as well as data on quality of life. Demonstrate, therefore, that the use of percutaneous cryoablation in the treatment of low-risk breast carcinoma is not inferior to surgery when combined with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy (when necessary). The hypothesis is that cryoablation, being simple and oncologically effective, ensures a better quality of life for the patient (reduced morbidity, no need for general anesthesia, improved cosmetic outcomes) and consequently has a lesser psychological impact, as well as a better cost-benefit ratio compared to the standard surgical approach.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Cryoablation
Procedure failure rate, Percentage of patients with residual tumor at the site of cryoablation, 8 months
Assessment of subject's quality of life in terms of evaluation of sources of distress, Quality of life will be assessed using National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) DISTRESS THERMOMETER, 60 months|Assessment of subject's satisfaction, Satisfaction will be assessed using BreastQ questionnaire, 60 months|Cost-analysis - evaluation of cost of intervention, hospitalization and re-intervention (if applicable), Cost will be calculated for all patients considering the cost of the intervention, the cost of hospitalization and cost of eventual re-intervention in case of unsuccessful intervention, 60 months|Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, Percentage of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, 60 months|Distant metastasis, Percentage of distant metastasis, 60 months
PRECICE is a prospective single arm, single centre, observational study which aims to enroll patients â‰¥50 years old, diagnosed with early-stage luminal A/B, unifocal Breast Cancer (BC), \< 15 mm in size, without in situ component detected at imaging (by breast ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Mammography) and confirmed by needle biopsy, defining histotype and biology. All patients that receive treatment with cryoablation as their standard care for BC followed by RadioTherapy (RT), according to the MultiDisciplinary Tumor Board (MDTB) referral and fulfil the inclusion criteria, will be prospectively included in the study.

Follow-up protocol involved breast imaging with mammography, ultrasound, and MRI, assessment of procedure failure rate, quality of life, psychological impact, oncological outcome and economical efficacy. Adjuvant therapy will be planned after further multidisciplinary discussion
