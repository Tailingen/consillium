Abemaciclib and Letrozole to Treat Endometrial Cancer
This is a phase II single arm trial to determine the percentage of patients without evidence of disease progression on abemaciclib and letrozole in advanced stage, persistent or recurrent endometrioid endometrial cancer at 6 months. Treatment will continue until either unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease, or investigator/patient request for withdrawal.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Abemaciclib|DRUG: Letrozole
Progression-free survival, To evaluate the efficacy in terms of the probability of surviving progression free for at least 6 months (PFS at 6 mo), From date of protocol entry to date of first documented progression up to 6 months
Response rate, To determine the proportion responding by RECIST v1.1 in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent endometrioid endometrial cancer, From date of protocol entry to date of first response assessed up to 5 years|Time to disease progression or death, To estimate the time to disease progression or death (PFS and OS endpoints)., From date of protocol entry to date of progression or death assessed up to 5 years|Toxicity Assessment of Adverse Events, To describe the toxicities in patients receiving combination therapy with letrozole and abemaciclib, Every 4 weeks assessed up to 5 years
Protein expression analysis of Cyclin D and E Pathway, Perform multiplexed protein expression analysis at a single cell level using imaging mass cytometry (IMC), exploring the relationship to response, and assessing for longitudinal changes upon progression/relapse. Cyclin D and E Pathway: Protein expression of CCND1, CDK4, CDK6, RB1, phospho-RB1, CDKN2A, CCNE1, CCNE2, CDK2, CCND3, At time of primary and secondary outcome analysis up to 5 years|Protein expression analysis of Immune Cell Infiltration and activity, Perform multiplexed protein expression analysis at a single cell level using imaging mass cytometry (IMC), exploring the relationship to response, and assessing for longitudinal changes upon progression/relapse. Immune cell infiltration and activity: CD45, CD3, CD8, CD4, FoxP3, PD-1, Tim-3, CTLA-4, CD25, Ki67., At time of primary and secondary outcome analysis up to 5 years|Protein expression analysis of sex hormone/insulin/IGF pathway, Perform multiplexed protein expression analysis at a single cell level using imaging mass cytometry (IMC), exploring the relationship to response, and assessing for longitudinal changes upon progression/relapse.

Sex hormone/insulin/IGF pathway: Protein expression of ER (ESR1), PR, IR, IGF1R, and phospho-IGF1R/IR, At time of primary and secondary outcome analysis up to 5 years|Cyclin D1 3'UTR mutations, Determine the frequency of Cyclin D1 3'UTR mutations and correlatioin with response., At time of primary and secondary outcome analysis up to 5 years|Estradiol levels, Compare the pre- and post-treatment circulating estradiol levels, and association with response., At time of primary and secondary outcome analysis up to 5 years|Insulin levels, Compare the pre- and post-treatment circulating insulin levels, and association with response., At time of primary and secondary outcome analysis up to 5 years
