The purpose of this study is to test the oxycodone/naloxone combination compared to oxycodone alone in patient's specific type of "chronic cancer pain".

This is a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, double-dummy, parallel group study using oxycodone/naloxone and oxycodone to treat moderate to severe, chronic cancer pain. Subjects with documented history of cancer pain that requires around-the-clock opioid therapy will be included. Subjects must have a medical history of constipation that was induced by, or worsened by their opioid therapy.

After subjects have qualified for the study they will be randomised and to enter the double-blind treatment phase of the study.

Subjects will be randomised to receive either oxycodone/naloxone or oxycodone. Subjects will receive the double-blind medication for a period of 4 weeks.

Subjects who complete the double-blind phase or who discontinue due to constipation and still comply with all relevant screening inclusion and exclusion criteria will have the option to enter the 24 week extension phase. Subjects will receive open-label oxycodone/naloxone for up to 24 weeks.
