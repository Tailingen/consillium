A Phase I Trial of AZD3965 in Patients With Advanced Cancer
The main aims of this clinical study are to find out the maximum dose that can be given safely to patients, the potential side effects of the drug and how they can be managed and what happens to AZD3965 inside the body.

AZD3965 is a type of drug called a monocarboxylate transporter 1 inhibitor which is being used to stop the growth of cancer cells and kill cancer cells by blocking the action of one of the proteins involved in moving chemical compounds in and out of the cells of the body. This will be the first time that this type of drug has been given to patients.

The drug is a capsule and is taken daily. The study is in two parts. In Part 1 of the study, small groups of patients are treated at increasing doses to find the highest safe dose and best dose to give to patients in Part 2 of the study. It is planned that 40 patients will be entered into Part 1 of the trial.

In Part 2, the dose found to be safe in Part 1 is given to patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). It is planned that 20 patients will be entered into Part 2 of the trial.

Patients will need to visit the hospital weekly for two months and then every fortnight. Patients will have regular blood and urine tests, scans, heart traces and eye tests amongst other clinical tests. Research blood samples will also be taken to look at what happens to the drug inside the body. Treatment is planned to be given for up to 6 months, but patients benefiting from treatment will be able to keep having it for as long as they continue to benefit. It is important to explain that this is the first study of this drug and patients will have advanced cancer so it is unlikely that patients will benefit directly from taking part but the study may help improve future treatment of cancer.

MTD of AZD3965, MTD was determined by testing increasing AZD3965 doses in Part 1 dose escalation cohorts (Cohorts 1-6) and defined as the total daily dose level below that at which ≥2 out of ≤6 evaluable patients had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1 (including Day -7). DLTs were defined as highly probably/probably AZD3965 related haematological, cardiac, ophthalmic, other Grade 3/4 toxicity, death or drug-related toxicity causing AZD3965 interruption \>2 weeks (see protocol for specific criteria), Day -7 to Day 28|Number of Patients Who Experienced DLTs, Number of patients who experienced protocol-defined DLTs (defined according to NCI CTCAE version 4.02). DLTs were defined as highly probably/probably AZD3965 related haematological, cardiac, ophthalmic, other Grade 3/4 toxicity, death or drug-related toxicity causing AZD3965 interruption \>2 weeks (see protocol for specific criteria), Day -7 to Day 28|Number of Patients Who Experienced Serious AEs, A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE, regardless of dose, causality or expectedness, that results in death, is life-threatening, requires in-patient hospitalisation or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant incapacity or disability, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect or is any other medically important event. Any ophthalmic and/or cardiac DLT is considered a medically important event and therefore an SAE in this trial. Specific AE terms are provided in the Adverse Events section, From the date of written informed consent and until 28 days after the last dose of AZD3965; an average (median) of 80 days (range: 36 to 517 days)|Number of Patients Who Experienced Non-Serious AEs, A non-serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that does not meet the serious criteria described for outcome measure 3 above. Specific AE terms are provided in the Adverse Events section, From the date of written informed consent and until 28 days after the last dose of AZD3965; an average (median) of 80 days (range: 36 to 517 days)
Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) From 0 to 24 Hours Post AZD3965 Dosing, Plasma samples were analysed to determine the concentrations of AZD3965 using a previously developed liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. For twice daily dosing, Day -7 data reflect the full daily dose but subsequent timepoints reflect half the daily dose as PK sampling was conducted up to 12 hours following the first of the two daily doses; therefore, AUC is from 0 to 12 hours at those timepoints and is reported as a separate outcome measure., Part 1 (Cohorts 1-4): Day -7 (pre-dose; 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48 hours post-dose) and Day 1 (pre-dose; 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 24 hours post-dose)|AUC From 0 to 12 Hours Post AZD3965 Dosing, Plasma samples were analysed to determine the concentrations of AZD3965 using a previously developed LC-MS/MS method.

Part 1 follows a rolling six dose escalation schedule of AZD3965 given once daily (OD) or twice daily (BD) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined.

The recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) is based on the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) results from Part 1.

All patients in Part 2 are treated at this RP2D to further explore the tolerability of this dose and schedule and to explore proof of principle of MCT1 inhibition in tumour types that were shown to express MCT1 and in which AZD3965 showed some effect pre-clinically (DLBCL and BL).
