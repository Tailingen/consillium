Envofolimab and Lenvatinib Combined With Gemcitabine Plus Cisplatin for Advanced BTC as First-Line Treatment(ENLIGHTEN)
This is a phase 2, single-arm, open label study. The purpose is to investigate both the efficacy and safety of Envofolimab and Lenvatinib in combination with Gemcitabine plus Cisplatin for treatment of advanced biliary tract cancer as first-line treatment.
Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: Envofolimab|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria., Up to 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from first treatment to death, regardless of disease recurrence., Up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of administration to progression or death., Up to 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved CR, PR or stable disease(SD), as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria., Up to 2 years|Incidence of Adverse Events (AE), The percentage of patients who suffer grade 3 or worse adverse events from the first dose of administration to last follow-up, assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., Up to 2 years
The trial will recruit 43 patients. At the first step, 10 patients will be recruited. Only when at least 4 patients achieve objective response will the trial enter the second step and continue to recruit other patients. After being enrolled, all patients giving written informed consent will receive treatment until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity or death. The tumor response evaluation will be conducted on a regular basis until progression of disease. Long-term survival follow up will be conducted as well.
