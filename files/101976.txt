A Study of Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of ATG-010 in Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
This is an open-label, single arm, and registered study of ATG-010 in Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.
Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
DRUG: ATG-010 60 mg, orally, twice weekly, each 4 week (28-day) a cycle
ORR, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the revised criteria for response assessment of lymphoma (2014 Lugano criteria: A complete metabolic response requires Score 1, 2, or 3 with or without a residual mass on 5PS(5-point scale using PET-CT). A PR requires a decrease by more than 50% in the sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters of up to six representative nodes or extranodal lesions.), 12 months
PFS, PFS is defined as the duration from start of selinexor treatment to time of central imaging laboratory determined PD (based on 2014 Lugano criteria: Progressive metabolic disease requires Score 4 or 5 with an increase in intensity of uptake from baseline. Progressive disease by CT criteria only requires an increase in the PPDs of a single node by â‰¥ 50%.)or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 12 months
This is an open-label, single arm, and registered study. About 60 patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL plan to be enrolled in about 10 study sites of the study. It is planned that at least 50% (\~30 patients) will have the GCB subtype of DLBCL. Enrolled patients will be treated with a fixed dose, 60 mg of ATG-010, orally, twice weekly, each 4 week (28-day) a cycle. Patients should remain on the study treatment of ATG-010, until either PD or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity.
