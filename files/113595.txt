A Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of LB1410 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumor or Lymphoma（Keyplus-001）
This is a Phase I study designed to evaluate if experimental anti-PD-1 and anti-TIM-3 bispecific antibody, LB1410, is safe, tolerable and efficacious in participants with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.

This first time in patients, open-label, multi-centre study will have LB1410 administered intravenously (IV) to participants with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. This study will have 2 parts: Part A which will have dose escalation cohorts and Part B which will have the dose expansion cohorts.
