Feasibility Study: Conservative Treatment in Cervical Cancer
Currently conservative treatment for patients of childbearing affected by cervical cancer is reserved for women with FIGO stage IA2 - IB1 with tumor size less than 2 cm . The trachelectomy and the cone biopsy with pelvic lymphadenectomy are the choice for these patients wishing to preserve their reproductive function.

In this context , recently literature show the results about the use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy about the reduction of tumor volume and therefore the magnitude of the subsequent surgical treatment (including patients with tumors larger than 2 cm ). So it becomes crucial a prospective analysis on the possibility to include in this type of treatment patients with stage IB1 and IIA1 with tumor size greater than 2 cm ( up to 4 cm ) .

The current study , in fact , would like to do a prospective evaluation on the advantages of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the possibility of broadening the inclusion criteria to conservative treatment in women , suffering from cervical cancer, stage IB1 and IIA1 ( with tumor volume between 2 and 4 cm) and wishing to preserve their reproductive function.
Stage IB1 Cervical Cancer
PROCEDURE: conservative treatment
pregnancy rate, time of pregnancy. Case of miscarriage, pre-term delivery or full term delivery., 3 years
disease free survival, time of disease free surviva, 5 years|Overall survival, Time to the last follow up/death, 5 years
The investigators would like to be conservative in young patients affected by early stage cervical cancer.
