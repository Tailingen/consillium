Impact of ADM in Reduction of Surgical Complexity of Breast Reconstructions With Implants (Nava)
The objective of this study is to demonstrate that acellular dermal matrix, Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix, can reduce the surgical complexity and post-operative pain of breast reconstructions with implants by avoiding one more surgical step in the operating room.
Patients With Breast Cancer Requiring Mastectomy and Suitable for Reconstruction
DEVICE: Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix
Number of surgeries where a differentiation will be made between major and minor depending upon the requirement to enter the breast pocket under general anesthesia., Total numbers of major and of minor surgeries for each patient during the full trial period and including any surgeries that the PI determines are clinically still necessary at the end of the trial period. Major procedures are defined as those involving the patient to be treated in the OR: re-entering the implant pocket; soft-tissue flaps not performed under local anesthesia; general anesthesia; or procedures requiring inpatient admission. Other procedures, including for instance CT-guided percutaneous drainage or breast fat grafting (lipofilling), are defined as minor procedures., At month 36 post-implant placement
Post operative sensation at Postoperative, Patients' subjective experience of sensation in the reconstructed breast as estimated by the subjective scale. In the experimental arm, this datum will be assessed at the POD 14 visit after the single stage implant (SSI) + ADM procedure; in the control arm\\ this datum will be assessed at the POD 14 visit after the first stage and again POD 14 after the second surgical stage (TE/Implant exchange). The questionnaire will also be completed at Months 6, 12, 24 and 36., At Post-op Days 14, 30 and at Months 6, 12, 24, and 36 post implant placement|Quality of life pre-operatively and at post operative, Patients' QoL, including emotional and satisfaction status, will be assessed before the reconstruction procedure and at POD 30 after single stage implant (SSI) + ADM in the experimental group via the Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaire; and at POD 30 after TE/Implant exchange in the control group., At month 6,12,24, and 36 post-implant placement
Safety endpoints: evaluated by the number and type of complications that may occur., Safety will be assessed continuously for the study period., At 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post-implant placement|Rate of capsular contracture at post operative, The incidence of grade III and IV of Baker capsular contracture rates will be assessed after reconstruction., At month 6,12,24 and 36.|Surgeon's evaluation of aesthetic outcome via photographs pre operatively, Photographs, taken at follow up visits, will be assessed for aesthetic outcome after reconstruction. Conventional Anthropometric distance measurements will be assessed, including nipple-sternal notch, nipple-nipple and nipple-infra-mammary fold after reconstruction., At month 6,12,24,and 36 post-implant placement|Costs related to in-hospital stay and devices., Overall cost of In-hospital stay (crude and including revision procedures) and device costs will be assessed., At 6, 12, 24 and 36 months post-implant placement|Duration of post operative drainage., Duration of drain time from placement to removal and total drainage per day will be assessed after all surgical procedures where drains are used., At Post-op Day 30|Total operating time, Operating time in minutes (in the control arm, operating time of the first and the second surgical stages will be recorded separately)., At Day of Surgery and Day of Expander/Implant exchange|Acute inflammatory response, Concatenated score as well as scores from each of the subscales will be examined., At Day of Discharge, Post-op Days 14 and 30
This study is designed to compare the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing mastectomy followed by a direct to implant breast reconstruction with Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix to patients undergoing a standard two-stage reconstruction without Strattice™ or any other mesh or tissue flap.

Potential candidates for the study will be identified through routine practice. Women who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. A screening visit will take place maximally 30 days prior to surgery.

Randomization will occur maximally 7 days prior to the mastectomy procedure. As some women may have to undergo bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction, the randomization scheme will ensure that both breasts will be reconstructed with the same surgical approach.

The Day of Surgery consists of both a mastectomy and a breast reconstruction. The surgical site and the breasts will be evaluated on the day of hospital discharge and at postoperative days 14 and 30 for all patients after each hospital admission. During these visits, the breasts will be examined and an Acute Inflammatory Assessment (AIR) will be completed. In addition the breast flaps and incisions will be evaluated for signs of infection, seroma, hematoma or skin necrosis.
