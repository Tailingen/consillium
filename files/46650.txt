Efficacy Study of Osimertinib in Treatment-naïve Patients With EGFR Mutant NSCLC According to TP53 Mutational Status.
This is a prospective, biomarker-driven, open-label, clinical trial of osimertinib in treatment- naïve patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC, to evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib according to the TP53 mutational status.

DRUG: Osimertinib
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST v1.1, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death (by any cause) in the absence of progression, whichever comes first., 24 months
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of participant's death due to any cause., 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using RECIST v1.1 criteria., 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is define as the percentage of patients who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), 24 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) until the date of documented progression or death, whichever comes first, only for participants who achieve CR or PR using RECIST v1.1 criteria., 24 months|Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs) according to CTCAE V5.0, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., 24 months|Time to Central Nervous System (CNS) progression, Time to CNS progression is defined as the time from randomization until the date of objective disease progression in the CNS using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) in the Central Nervous System (CNS), ORR in the CNS is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for CNS lesions using RECIST v1.1 criteria., 24 months
