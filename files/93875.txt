Serum Biomarkers in Diagnosis and Predicting Prognosis of Ovarian Cancers
This study evaluates the usefulness of serum levels of trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), secreted frizzled related protein 4 (sFRP-4), reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (Romo1) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in ovarian carcinoma.

Efficacy of serum levels of trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), secreted frizzled related protein 4 (sFRP-4), reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (Romo1) and nuclear factor (NF)-Κb in discrimination of benign and malignant gynecologic disease, To measure serum levels of trefoil factor 3 (TFF3), secreted frizzled related protein 4 (sFRP-4), reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (Romo1) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB between groups and to identify a possible significant diagnostic marker, 2 days
