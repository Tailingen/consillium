NYSCF Scientific Discovery Biobank
The New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) Research Institute is performing this research to accelerate diverse disease research using cells from the body (such as skin or blood cells) to make stem cells and other types of cells, conduct research on the samples, perform genetic testing, and store the samples for future use.

Through this research, researchers hope to identify future treatments or even cures for the major diseases of our time.

OTHER: Biological Sample Collection
Biobank, Establishment of a diverse repository of biological samples, stem cell lines, derivatives, and associated information to support investigations into the biology, etiology, manifestations, progression, risk factors, genetic underpinnings, and treatment of diseases, conditions, and traits., Baseline
Researchers at the New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF) Research Institute study diverse diseases, conditions, and traits by creating stem cells from biological samples. These "pluripotent" stem cells can become any cell in the human body, including cells that may be difficult, invasive, or impossible to obtain directly.

Additionally, researchers perform genetic testing to learn more about DNA, a material in most cells that contains instructions for the body's development and functions (such as traits like eye color and risk of certain diseases). A piece of DNA that determines the specific role of a cell is called a "gene." If the instructions in a gene are abnormal, this can lead to disease.

Participation in the study involves: (1) completion of health questionnaires, (2) providing a skin and/or blood sample from which stem cells may be created, (3) collection of a saliva sample for genetic analysis, and (4) possible future followup to provide additional information or learn about other research studies.

This study is not a clinical trial.
