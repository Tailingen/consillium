Radiotherapy Versus Radiotherapy Combined With Temozolomide in High-risk Low-grade Gliomas After Surgery
It has been reported that radiation therapy followed by PCV chemotherapy (procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine) could improve progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with high-risk WHO grade 2 gliomas after surgery. However, procarbazine is not available in China. In clinical practice, Chinese doctors often use radiotherapy combined with temozolomide to treat these patients, though large-scale prospective studies are lacking. This trial aims to confirm whether RT combined with temozolomide can improve PFS and OS in patients with high-risk low-grade gliomas.
Low-grade Glioma
DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: intensity modulated radiation therapy
Progression-free survival, Our primary outcome is progression-free survival which is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of first reported disease progression or the date of death., up to 120 months
