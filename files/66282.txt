Molecular Alterations Associated With Resistance to Endocrine Therapy and Impacting Treatment With mTOR Inhibitor
This is a prospective biomarker study to show that p4EBP1 staining predicts clinical benefit from treatment with everolimus in patients who are eligible for everolimus+exemestane treatment. This trial is not aimed at evaluating a drug activity. Everolimus and exemestane are prescribed within their approved indication as per usual practice and are not part of this trial.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Biopsy
the predictive value of p4EBP1 for an mTOR inhibitor efficacy, The primary endpoint of the trial is the predictive value of p4EBP1 for an mTOR inhibitor efficacy, measured by the association between expression level of the biomarker (high vs low expression with a cutoff value set at the median percentages of marked cells) and clinical benefit after 6 months of everolimus+exemestane treatment., from inclusion up to 6 months
Estrogen hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer who failed to non steroidal aromatases inhibitors in patients who are eligible for everolimus+exemestane treatment
