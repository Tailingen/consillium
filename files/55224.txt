Study of Ribociclib With Everolimus + Exemestane in HR+ HER2- Locally Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer Post Progression on CDK 4/6 Inhibitor.
The purpose of this study is determine if the triplet combination of ribociclib, everolimus and exemastane is safe and effective in the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer following treatment with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Ribociclib|DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Exemestane
Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities by Preferred Term in Cycle 1 (28 Days) - in Phase I, A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as having a reasonably possible relationship to the study medication(s) and is unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first 28 days of treatment (cycle 1) and meets any of the criteria defined in the protocol. National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03 will be used for all grading., Baseline up to 28 days|Clinical Benefit Rate as Per Central Review by Group- Phase II, Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or with stable disease (SD) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V1.1 or Non-Complete Response or Non-Progressive Disease (NCRNPD) during first 24 weeks of first dose. CR=disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, SD=neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for progressive disease (PD), PD=at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameter of all target lesions.

The hypothesis was to be rejected if the lower limit of the 95% Confidence Interval for Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) was greater than 10%., From baseline up to 24 weeks|Best Overall Responses (BOR) Summary Table as Per Central Review by Group - Phase II, Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) at 24 weeks as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or Non-CR Non-PD (NCRNPD) at Week 24., Baseline up to 24 weeks and at 24 weeks
Everolimus Pharmacokinetic Plasma Concentrations by Cohort - Phase I, Plasma concentrations; below limit of quantitation values set to zero, Cycle 1,2: Day 1 and 15 - pre-dose, 2 and 4 hour post dose, Cycle 3 , Day 1 - pre-dose|Best Overall Responses (BOR) Summary Table as Per Central Review by Cohort - Phase I, Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or Non-CR Non-PD (NCRNPD), From baseline up to 24 weeks|Clinical Benefit Rate as Per Central Review by Dose Cohort - Phase I, Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or with stable disease (SD) at 24 weeks as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V1.1 or Non-Complete Response Non-Progressive Disease (NCRNPD) up to Week 24 and at Week 24., Baseline up to 24 weeks and at week 24|Summary of Progression-free Survival (PFS) (Months), as Per Central Review by Group - Phase II, Progression is defined as \<= 12 weeks after randomization/ start of treatment (and not qualifying for CR, PR or SD)., Baseline up to approximately 32 months|Overall Survival (OS) by Group - Phase II, Overall survival is the time from date of first treatment to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival will be censored at the last date of contact., Baseline up to approximately 32 months|Duration of Overall Response (DOR) by Group - Phase II, Patients whose best response is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The start date is the date of first documented response (CR or PR) and the end date is the date of first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer., Baseline up to approximately 16 months|Time to Definitive Deterioration of ECOG Performance Status in One Category of the Score by Group - Phase II, Time to definitive deterioration of ECOG performance status in one category of score is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of event, which is defined as at least one score lower than the baseline., Baseline up to approximately 8 months|Everolimus Pharmacokinetic Plasma Concentrations - Phase II, Plasma concentrations; below limit of quantitation values set to zero, Cycle 1,2: Day 1 and 15 - pre-dose, 2 and 4 hour post dose, Cycle 3 , Day 1 - pre-dose
This trial had two phases. The purpose of Phase I dose escalation and dose de-escalation was to determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) and/or identify the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination treatment of ribociclib+ everolimus + exemestane. The dosing was continuous in adult men and postmenopausal women with HR+ HER2-negative advanced breast cancer which was resistant to the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors, fulvestrant or tamoxifen.

The purpose of the phase II portion of this trial was to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of exemestane, everolimus and ribociclib combination therapy following progression on a CDK 4/6 inhibitor.

The planned duration of the study was 30 months.
