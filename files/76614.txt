Phase II Trial of HM61713 for the Treatment of ≥2nd Line T790M Mutation Positive Adenocarcinoma of the Lung
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of HM61713 in patients with T790M-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after treatment with an epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).

The QT interval will be rate-corrected using 3 methods: QTcF, QTcB and QTcS., To assess the safety and tolerability of HM61713., Adverse events will be collected from baseline until 28 days after the last dose
This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 study to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of oral single agent HM61713 administered to patients with T790M-positive NSCLC after treatment with an EGFR-TKI as measured by objective response rate (ORR).
