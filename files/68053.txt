Vaccination of Advanced-Stage Lung Cancer Patients
The overarching purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of an investigational agent, P10s-PADRE, a peptide mimotope-based vaccine, in combination with standard-of-care (SoC) treatment in subjects with advanced-stage (i.e., metastatic) Lung Cancer. Vaccine will consist of P10s-PADRE admixed with an adjuvant, MONTANIDETM ISA 51 VG. Up to one hundred fifty (150) subjects with advanced-stage Lung Cancer of any histologic type will be enrolled for this vaccine trial.

This single-arm, multi-site trial is designed to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of the vaccine in subjects with advanced-stage lung cancer. The primary objectives of the study are: (1) to monitor the safety and tolerability of the vaccine when it is administered in combination with SoC therapy; and (2) to determine whether immunization with vaccine can successfully elicit a robust immune response in subjects with advanced-stage lung cancer.

Number of participants with vaccine related adverse events as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0., The National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has published standardized definitions for adverse events (AEs), known as the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, also called "common toxicity criteria"), to describe the severity of organ toxicity for patients receiving cancer therapy. The tables describing AEs graded in the CTCAE (version 4.0) provides a references for adverse events reporting. From grade 1 AEs being minor/low grade adverse events to grade 5 AEs being serious adverse events usually resulting in death., 64 weeks +/- 2 weeks per subject|Number of participants with vaccine induced immune related response., 64 weeks +/- 2 weeks per subject
