Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Platinum-Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of dexamethasone plus paclitaxel and gemcitabine in treating patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride|DRUG: paclitaxel
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate, progression time, and survival of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel and gemcitabine.
* Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.
* Evaluate the toxic effects and safety profile of premedication with steroids with this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with paclitaxel (none or relapse more than 6 months after paclitaxel versus progressive disease or relapse less than 6 months after paclitaxel).

Patients receive dexamethasone IV, then paclitaxel IV followed by gemcitabine IV, for 3 consecutive weeks on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment is continued every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

All patients are followed until death.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
