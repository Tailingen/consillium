Percentage of Participants Meeting the Criteria for Responder, Percentage of responders, defined as participants who met the following conditions:

* Menstrual blood loss (MBL) volume \< 80 mL during the Final Month (the last 28 days prior to and including the Reference Day, which is defined as the last visit date during the Treatment Period \[last treatment visit date\] or the last dose date if there are evaluable alkaline hematin data after the last treatment visit date and prior to or on the last dose date), and
* â‰¥ 50% reduction in MBL volume from Baseline to the Final Month.

Participants who prematurely discontinued study drug due to "lack of efficacy," "requires surgery or invasive intervention for treatment of uterine fibroids," or "adverse events" were considered non-responders regardless of whether she meets the two aforementioned responder criteria or not., Final Month (the last 28 days prior to and including the Reference Day), up to Month 6
Change From Baseline in MBL Volume to the Final Month, Baseline MBL volume was defined as the mean of total MBL volume from all the qualified menstrual cycles during the Screening Period, in which the total MBL volume is from all validated and non-validated sanitary products and the MBL volume of validated sanitary products only (excluding non-validated sanitary products) was greater than 80 mL.

The Reference Day is defined as the last visit date during the Treatment Period (last treatment visit date) or the last dose date if there are evaluable alkaline hematin data after the last treatment visit date and prior to or on the last dose date., Month 0 (Baseline), Final Month (the last 28 days prior to and including the Reference Day), up to Month 6|Percentage of Participants With Suppression of Bleeding at the Final Month, Suppression of bleeding is defined as having 0 days of bleeding (spotting is allowed) during the Final Month with the interval starting from Study Day 11.

The Reference Day is defined as the last visit date during the Treatment Period (last treatment visit date) or the last dose date if there are evaluable alkaline hematin data after the last treatment visit date and prior to or on the last dose date., Final Month (the last 28 days prior to and including the Reference Day), up to Month 6|Change From Baseline in MBL Volume to Month 6, Month 0 (Baseline), Month 6|Change From Baseline in MBL Volume to Month 3, Month 0 (Baseline), Month 3|Percentage of Participants With Baseline Hemoglobin <= 10.5 g/dL Who Have an Increase in Hemoglobin > 2 g/dL at Month 6, Month 0 (Baseline), Month 6|Change From Baseline in MBL Volume to Month 1, Month 0 (Baseline), Month 1
