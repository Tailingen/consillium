CD147-CART Cells in Patients With Recurrent Malignant Glioma.
This is a single-center, single-arm, open label and dose escalation clinical study of anti-CD147 CART cells in patients with recurrent malignant glioma.
Recurrent Glioblastoma|CD147 Positive
BIOLOGICAL: CD147-CART
Incidence and type of adverse events induced by CD147-CART, To assess the safety and tolerability of CD147-CART (anti-CD147 CAR-T cell) for glioma which measured by number and type of adverse events., 12 weeks
DLT and MTD of CD147-CART cell, To determine the dose limited toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CD147-CART., 12 weeks|Clinical Activity of CD147-CART cell, To evaluate treatment response of CD147-CART for glioma, 2 years|CD147-CART detection in Peripheral Blood, Quantification of CD147-CART cells in blood samples., 2 years
Patients autologous T cells are activated and then engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for CD147(CD147-CART). CAR-T cells are expanded in culture and returned to the patient by Ommaya Reservoir at specific cell doses. Three CD147-CART doses patient are planned at 1-week intervals. Serum cytokine level and CAR-T cell number will be measured in whole treatment session.
