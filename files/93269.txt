Intraoperative Radiotherapy in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
INTRAGO II resembles a multicentric, prospective, randomized, 2-arm, open-label clinical phase III trial which tests if the median progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) can be improved by the addition of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) to standard radiochemotherapy.
Glioblastoma
PROCEDURE: Standard surgery|RADIATION: Intraoperative radiotherapy|RADIATION: Radiochemotherapy|DRUG: Temozolomide
Median Progression-Free Survival, Determined according to modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria and serial perfusion imaging, 24 Months
Median Overall Survival, 24 Months|PFS within a 1-2 cm margin around the cavity, Determined by serial contrast-enhanced MRI scans using modified RANO criteria and serial perfusion imaging, 24 Months|OS with respect to Age, Median overall survival of patients \<65 vs. ≥ 65 years, 24 Months|PFS with respect to Age, Progression-free survival of patients \<65 vs. ≥ 65 years; determined according to modified RANO criteria and serial perfusion imaging, 24 Months|OS with respect to KPS, Median overall survival of patients with KPS 80-100% vs. 60-70%, 24 Months|PFS with respect to KPS, Progression-free survival of patients with KPS 80-100% vs. 60-70%; determined according to modified RANO criteria and serial perfusion imaging, 24 Months|OS with respect to thickness of anticipated T1-Gd-enhancing (remaining) tumor margin, Thickness of anticipated T1-Gd-enhancing (remaining) tumor margin as per the discretion of the surgeon (margin ≥0.5 cm or multiple spots of residual tumor within the cavity vs. \<0.5 cm), 24 Months|PFS with respect to thickness of anticipated T1-Gd-enhancing (remaining) tumor margin, Thickness of anticipated T1-Gd-enhancing (remaining) tumor margin as per the discretion of the surgeon (margin ≥0.5 cm or multiple spots of residual tumor within the cavity vs. \<0.5 cm); determined according to modified RANO criteria and serial perfusion imaging, 24 Months|OS with respect to extent of resection, Early postoperative MRI scans must be used to determine the extent of resection (EoR). The EoR is given as sum of all maximum diameters of residual lesions in cm. OS will be calculated for the following groups:

* Max Diameter group 0: 0 cm (no residual tumor)
* Max Diameter group 1: \>0 to ≤1.5 cm (cumulative if multiple residual lesions)
* Max Diameter group 2: \>1.5 cm (cumulative if multiple residual lesions), 24 Months|PFS with respect to extent of resection, Early postoperative MRI scans must be used to determine the extent of resection (EoR). The EoR is given as sum of all maximum diameters of residual lesions in cm. PFS will be determined according to modified RANO criteria and serial perfusion imaging for the following groups:

* Max Diameter group 0: 0 cm (no residual tumor)
* Max Diameter group 1: \>0 to ≤1.5 cm (cumulative if multiple residual lesions)
* Max Diameter group 2: \>1.5 cm (cumulative if multiple residual lesions), 24 Months|OS with respect to MGMT promoter methylation status, OS in patients with promoter methylation vs. no promoter methylation, 24 Months|PFS with respect to MGMT promoter methylation status, PFS in patients with promoter methylation vs. no promoter methylation; determined according to modified RANO criteria and serial perfusion imaging, 24 Months|Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire, Assessed by European Organization for Research and Treatment (EORTC)- Quality of Life Questionnaires (QLQ C30/BN20), 24 Months|Activities of daily living (ADL), assessed using the Barthel Index (Mahoney & Barthel, 1965)., Change in functional outcomes as measured by BI from its baseline value., 24 Months|Radiation-related (acute / early delayed / late) neurotoxicity, Assessed by regular neurological examinations and serial MRI scans, 24 Months
