The Implementation of the Go Wish Game to Promote Advance Care Planning in Onco- Hematologic Disease
This is a mixed-method, device-free and drug-free multicenter interventional study. The study aims at facilitating end-of-life conversations within the doctor-patient relationship through the use of the Go Wish Game (GWG) and supporting patients, their caregivers and healthcare professionals to complete Advance Care Panning documentation.

The GWG helps people clarify and identify their priorities, should they be affected by a chronic, disabling and potentially non-healing illness. In fact, the GWG consists of a small deck of cards, and on each card is a concrete action or situation that may be important to a person at the end of life.

The "Onco-hema Go wish-ACP" project aims to evaluate the feasibility of a Go Wish Game-based intervention with patients with refractory lymphoma, leukemia or multiple myeloma or advanced solid tumors with prognosis \> 3 months.

In terms of secondary objectives, the study aims to.

* Evaluate and compare the intervention with hematology and oncology patients in terms of: - Other feasibility indicators; Involvement in CCP pathways; Quality of communication; Meaning of life; Impact on hope; through a series of questionnaires administered to patients and caregivers involved in the intervention
* Qualitatively assess the acceptability of the intervention in terms of recruitment and delivery with patients and caregivers through semi-structured interviews and with professionals through Focus Groups (FGs).
* To analyze the clinical records of enrolled patients in terms of: values and preferences; awareness of prognosis; end-of-life choices and shared decision-making on treatment decisions.

OTHER: Go Wish Game
Intervention Feasibility, We will evaluate the feasibility of the intervention. Feasibility will be investigated by:

1. proportion of patients who will accept to participate among those screened/eligible who received the proposal to participate;
2. proportion of enrolled patients who will withdraw from the study after the first GWG discussion among the enrolled patients; 3, percentage proportion of enrolled patients who will attend all the planned GWG discussions;

4. proportion of enrolled patients that will complete the ACP document (after participating in all the planned GWG discussions), 1 Year
ACP Engagement;, We will further assess and compare the intervention within hemato-oncological and oncological patients in terms of:

1. ACP engagement: we will use the 4-item ACP Engagement (4-item ACP-E) questionnaire, 18 Months|Quality of Communication;, We will further assess and compare the intervention within hemato-oncological and oncological patients in terms of:

2. Quality of communication: we will use the 19-item Quality of Communication (QOC) questionnaire, 18 Months|Meaning of Life;, We will further assess and compare the intervention within hemato-oncological and oncological patients in terms of:

3. Meaning of life: we will use the Meaning in Life scale (MLS), 18 Months|Impact on patients' hope, We will further assess and compare the intervention within hemato-oncological and oncological patients in terms of:

4. Impact on patients' hope: we will use the Hope Herth Index (HHI), 18 Months|Acceptability, 5. Acceptability of intervention in terms of recruitment and intervention delivery will be further investigated by: semi-structured interviews with patients and caregivers and FG with HPs who applied the GWG.

., 18 Months|ACP documentation, We will analyze the ACP documentation of patients enrolled to qualitatively investigate the congruence and relations between the priorities defined during the GWG meetings and the decisions written in the care plan, 18 Months
