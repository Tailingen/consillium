A Study of TP-0184 to Treat Anemia in Adults With IPSS-R Low or Intermediate Risk MDS
This study will evaluate preliminary safety and efficacy of TP-0184 to treat anemia when administered to adult patients with Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) low or intermediate risk MDS. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined by the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) in the Phase 1 portion of the study.

Assessment of CHF will be based based on NYHA criteria, 12-Lead ECG abnormalities, quantification of cardiac iron by MRI, ECHO or MUGA scans, and peripheral blood cardiac markers, The time from the date of first treatment, while the patient is taking TP-0184, and for 30 days after stopping therapy, an average of 4 months.|Phase 1/2: Determine the Proportion of Patients Progressing to AML, Proportion of patients progressing to AML, 4 months|Phase 1/2: Determine Overall Survival, The effect of TP-0184 on the overall survival, From the first dose of TP-0184 until the time of death due to any cause, up to 4 months off treatment.|Phase 1: Determination of the Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) and Area Under the Plasma Concentration vs. Time Curve (AUClast), To determine the maximum concentration of TP-0184 and the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve of TP-0184, Phase 1: Blood samples drawn on days 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 22 of the first study cycle; days 1, 8, 15, and 16 of the 2nd cycle. Phase 2: Blood samples drawn on Cycle 1, day 22; cycle 2, days 1, 8 and 15; cycle 3, day 1.|Phase 2: Determine the Changes in Neutrophil Counts, Proportion of patients achieving hematologic improvement in neutrophil count (HI-N) over any consecutive 8-week (56-day) period and / or decrease in neutrophil count, 56 days|Phase 2: Determine the Changes in Platelet Counts, Proportion of patients achieving hematologic improvement in platelets (HI-P) over any consecutive 8-week (56-day) period and / or decrease in platelet count, 56 days|Phase 2: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) & Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Assessment of safety and tolerability of TP-0184 administered in participants by reporting of AEs and SAEs, The time from the date of first treatment, while the patient is taking TP-0184, and for 30 days after stopping therapy, up to 6 months.|Phase 2: Determine Steady-state Trough PK, Characterize TP-0184 plasma trough concentration data at various timepoints., Cycle 1 Day 1 of Week 4 and Cycle 2 Day 1 of each Week 5, 6, 7, and 9|Phase 2: Determine the Level of Fatigue Based Off of the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), The BFI measures the severity of fatigue based on the worst fatigue experienced during the past 24-hours, From the first dose of TP-0184 up to 4 months or study closure
