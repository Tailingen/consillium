Development and Validation of a Survival Prediction Model for Esophageal Cancer Patients After Esophagectomy
In this retrospective study, we analyzed data from the Sichuan Cancer Hospital \& Institute Esophageal Cancer Case Management Database (SCH-ECCM Database) from January 2010 to December 2017. Our study focused on examining the clinicopathological characteristics, lymph node removal at each station, and treatment details of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who underwent esophagectomy. Using this data, we developed a prediction model for OS by considering a combination of clinical characteristics and details of lymphadenectomy variables.
Survivorship
OTHER: This was an observational study without any intervention
Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the month and year of surgery until death or the last follow-up in April 2022., April 2022-April 2024

Using this data, we developed a prediction model for OS by considering a combination of clinical characteristics and details of lymphadenectomy variables. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated an area under the curve greater than 0.7 at 1, 3, and 5 years in both the verification and training groups. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves showed that our model effectively distinguished between high- and low-risk groups (p \< 0.01).
