Current best practice recommends Carboplatin combined with Taxol in the treatment of Ovarian cancer.

Taxol is paclitaxel in the solvent Cremophor-El and the solvent has been associated with significant side effects e.g. anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity. this requires the routine use of premedication with antihistamines and steroids.

Abraxane by contrast is Cremophor-El free and is protein bound. This has 2 advantages over Taxol.

1. No need for routine premedications
2. Increased drug entry into cells facilitating greater potential for anti-tumor activity.

Schedule: Carboplatin day1 every 28days. Abraxane day1,8,15 every 28days.
