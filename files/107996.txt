Study of Lonafarnib Versus Placebo in Subjects With Either Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) (Study P02978AM3)(TERMINATED)
The purpose of this study is to assess the benefit of lonafarnib (versus placebo) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Benefit will be measured by achievement of platelet transfusion independence for at least 8-consecutive weeks, and without simultaneous worsening of hemoglobin and/or need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Additional endpoints will be hematologic response (which includes complete remission, partial remission, hematologic improvement), number of RBC transfusions, bleeding events, infections and safety.
