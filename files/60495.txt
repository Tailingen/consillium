The Real World Study of Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy in Early Stage NSCLC in China
Several published clinical trials have shown the superiority of immunotherapy in neoadjuvant setting. Here we conducted this real world study to see whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy would bring MPR and survival benefits in NSCLC, for example, single agent immunotherapy or immunotherapy combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore biomarker analysis would be also performed to achieve personalized neoadjuvant immunotherapy.

MPR, To evaluate the major pathological response (MPR) rate of participants, From the date of surgery up to 10 weeks
Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, From the date of surgery up to 10 weeks|MPR based on diverse PD-L1 expression, Percentage of Participants with Major Pathologic Response Rates For Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1)-Positive Versus PD-L1-Negative Participants, From the date of surgery up to 10 weeks|Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events, No delayed resection rate and incidence of adverse event (AE)/serious adverse event (SAE), From the date of the first cycle of neoadjuvant treatment until 90 days after end of treatment, assessed up to 100 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival, From date of the first cycle of neoadjuvant treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
Pathological Complete Response (pCR), Evaluation of the pathological complete response: The pathological complete response is defined as the absence of residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes in patients treated with chemo-immunotherapy versus patients treated with chemotherapy alone, From the date of surgery up to 10 weeks
