Identification of Neuromas by High Resolution Ultrasound in Patients With Peripheral Nerve Injury and Amputations
Neuromas are frequent after trauma and surgery, including amputation and can be identified by high-resolution ultrasound. The role of neuromas as the cause of neuropathic pain is uncertain. In this observational cohort study, the investigators wish to explore if the prevalence of neuromas are higher in patients with pain after peripheral nerve injury and amputation, than in patients with the same conditions but without pain.
