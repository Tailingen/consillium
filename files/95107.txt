Study to Evaluate the Safety of Pembrolizumab in Participants With Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma or Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in India (MK-3475-593/KEYNOTE-593)
This study has been designed to evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in participants in India with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are either untreated (programmed cell death ligand 1 \[PD-L1\] ≥50%) or have experienced disease progression after a platinum-containing systemic therapy (PD-L1 ≥1%).
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Melanoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), Percentage of participants experiencing an AE defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study therapy, From time of signing the informed consent form (ICF) until the end of follow-up (up to approximately 25 months)|Incidence of Drug-Related AEs, Percentage of participants experiencing an AE that is determined by the investigator to be related to the treatment, From time of signing the ICF until the end of follow-up (up to approximately 25 months)|Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Percentage of participants experiencing a SAE defined as an AE that did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship to the treatment, that was life-threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect; was suggested to be significantly detrimental; was a cancer; overdose; or resulted in death, From time of signing the ICF until the end of follow-up (up to approximately 27 months)|Incidence of Drug-Related SAEs, Percentage of participants experiencing a SAE that is determined by the investigator to be related to the treatment, From time of signing the ICF until the end of follow-up (up to approximately 27 months)|Incidence of Treatment Discontinuations, Percentage of participants discontinuing study drug due to an AE, From time of initiation of study treatment until the end of study treatment (up to approximately 24 months)|Incidence of Events of Clinical Interest (ECIs), Percentage of participants with ECIs including the following: 1) an overdose of pembrolizumab defined as any dose of ≥1000 mg or 2) an elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) lab value that is ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is ≥2 times ULN and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is \<2 times ULN, as determined by way of protocol-specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing, From time of signing the ICF until the end of follow-up (up to approximately 27 months)
