Haploidentical Lymphocytes With Nivolumab/Ara-C as Consolidation in Elderly AML Patients
A phase II trial to compare the efficacy and safety of nivolumab and intermediate dose cytarabine with or without haploidentical lymphocyte infusion. To identify the role of haploidentical lymphocytes in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia in older adults. The patients will be stratified based on the remission number (first or second)
