Ispinesib in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Unresectable Kidney Cancer
This phase II trial is studying how well ispinesib works in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable kidney cancer. Ispinesib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
Recurrent Renal Cell Cancer|Stage III Renal Cell Cancer|Stage IV Renal Cell Cancer
DRUG: ispinesib
Response rate defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a complete or partial response with ispinesib evaluated per RECIST, If the response rate is 30% or more, further study would be proposed based on the estimates produced in this trial. Will be presented along with 95% confidence intervals., Up to 4 years
Overall survival, Will be presented in Kaplan-Meier plots and the median values of each (if reached) will be reported., Up to 4 years|Time to progression, Will be presented in Kaplan-Meier plots and the median values of each (if reached) will be reported., Up to 4 years|Qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen graded according to NCI CTCAE, Up to 4 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the efficacy of SB-715992 in patients with advanced renal cell cancer who have received at least one prior therapy. This will be achieved by a multi-center, single arm phase II study to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieve a complete or partial response with this agent.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the overall survival. II. To assess the time to progression. III. To evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive ispinesib (SB-715992) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.
