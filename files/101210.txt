A Study of Enzalutamide in Combination With AZD5363 in Patients With mCRPC
A multicentre prospective, randomised, phase II interventional study in mCRPC patients previously treated with 1-2 lines of chemotherapy and at least 12 weeks of abiraterone with a safety run-in and single stage phase II expansion cohort.
Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate
DRUG: AZD5363|DRUG: Enzalutamide
Phase I: Type, frequency, severity, seriousness and relatedness of adverse events, Type according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), frequency according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4, seriousness, and relatedness of study treatment-emergent adverse events will be assessed, 35 days|Phase I: Laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v4, 35 days|Randomised phase II: Best overall tumour response, Best overall tumour response as defined by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) decline of ≥50% (according to PCWG2), confirmed objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or ONLY for patients with detectable circulating tumour cell count of ≥5/7.5ml blood at baseline, conversion of CTC \<5/7.5ml blood nadir, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to an estimated 22-24 months|Phase II expansion: Best overall tumour response, Best overall tumour response as defined by PSA decline of ≥50% (according to PCWG2), confirmed objective response by RECIST 1.1 or ONLY for patients with detectable circulating tumour cell count of ≥5/7.5ml blood at baseline, conversion of CTC \<5/7.5ml blood nadir, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to an estimated 22-24 months
Phase I and phase II expansion only - Pharmacokinetic (PK) assay analyses, PK assay analysis including endpoints of Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) and Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), 35 days|Phase I - Antitumour activity of the combination, 35 days|Randomised phase II and phase II expansion - Overall survival and radiographic progression free survival, From date of randomization/trial entry until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to (estimated) 12 months|Maximum PSA decline and circulating tumour cell (CTC) fall, Maximum PSA decline and CTC fall by 30% at any time during the trial and at 12 weeks., 12 weeks|Pain Palliation - Randomised phase II only, Pain palliation will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) (BPI-SF) worst pain intensity score, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to (estimated) 12 months|Number of Adverse events will be graded according to NCI-CTCAE v4, From trial entry until 30 days post date of last dose or death from any cause
Patients with mCRPC will receive enzalutamide and AZD5363 (or enzalutamide and placebo in the randomised phase II) until confirmed disease progression.

The trial aims to identify the safety and tolerability of enzalutamide and AZD5363 and identify recommended phase II dose of AZD5363 (phase I safety run-in). The randomised phase II will estimate and compare the anti-tumour activity of AZD5363 and enzalutamide, and placebo and enzalutamide as measured by response. The single stage phase II expansion cohort will estimate the anti-tumour activity of AZD5363 and enzalutamide in patients who have previously progressed on enzalutamide alone.
