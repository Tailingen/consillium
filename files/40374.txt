Adjuvant Dynamic Marker-Adjusted Personalized Therapy Trial Optimizing Risk Assessment and Therapy Response Prediction in Early Breast Cancer
Trial for the optimization of risk assessment and therapy success prediction in patients with early breast cancer by the use of biomarkers in advance to therapy decision-making to personalize therapies.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Induction therapy
Identification of a responder sub-population with intermediate and high risk, which due to therapy has outcome comparable to HR+/RSâ‰¤11, In order to identify patients that are at comparable low risk as hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative patients with low Recurrence Score, any sub-population across the sub-trials will be compared to this risk group., 8 years
Overall survival, 8 years
Any pre-specified outcome measure is defined within the sub-protocols., Toxicity and cost efficacy are common endpoints of all sub-protocols. Additional "translational research" questions occurring during the trial will be defined in sub-protocols., 8 years
