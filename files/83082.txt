Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, Plus Nivolumab in Patients With Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer With Selective Bladder Sparing
This is a phase 2 trial seeking to define the safety and activity of gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus nivolumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer and to define the role of clinical complete response in predicting benefit in patients opting to avoid cystectomy.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin
Clinical Complete Response (CCR) Rate, Clinical complete response rate will be defined as the percentage of patients who achieved cT0 or cTa disease after gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus nivolumab., 24 months|Predict Benefit From Treatment, Determine the ability of clinical complete response (cT0 or cTa) to predict benefit from treatment.Benefit will be defined as a pathologic complete response (\<pT1) in patients undergoing cystectomy and 2 year metastasis-free in patients pursuing surveillance.

The positive predictive value of CCR with 95% confidence interval are presented in Outcome Measure Data Table. Positive predictive value is the ratio of patients truly diagnosed as positive to all those who had positive test results., 24 months
Adverse Events, The frequency and severity of all grade 3+ treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in at least 10% of patients are reported by CTCAEv4 term and grade., AE had been recorded from time of signed informed consent until 100 days after discontinuation of study drug(s) or until a new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever occurs first, up to a maximum of 13 months.|Bladder Intact Overall Survival, Bladder-intact overall survival is defined as the time from initiation of treatment until death or cystectomy., Up to a maximum of 60 months|Recurrence-free Survival, Recurrence-free survival is defined as the time from initiation of treatment to death or recurrence, depending on which occurs first, Up to a maximum of 60 months|Pathologic Complete Response Rate in Patients Undergoing Cystectomy, Pathologic complete response rate in patients undergoing radical cystectomy is defined as the proportion of patients with \<pT1, Up to a maximum of 53 months|Association Between a Prespecified Panel of Genomic Biomarkers and Benefit From Treatment in Patients Achieving a Clinical Complete Response., Benefit will be defined as a pathologic complete response (p\<T1) in patients undergoing cystectomy and 2 years metastasis-free in patients pursuing surveillance.

The positive predictive value of CCR with or without genomic alterations in baseline TURBT tissue for a composite outcome measure of 2-year bladder-intact survival in patients forgoing immediate cystectomy or \<ypT1N0 in patients undergoing immediate cystectomy are presented with 95% confidence interval in Outcome Measure Data Table.

Positive predictive value is the ratio of patients truly diagnosed as positive to all those who had positive test results., 24 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from initiation of treatment to death., Up to a maximum of 60 months
