Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Antibodies Plus Anti-VEGF Antibody Treatment in Patients With Advanced-Stage HCC
This study is being done to analyze the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment using combination of anti-VEGF and anti-PD-1/PDL1 antibodies for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

This is a study of combination anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies and anti-VEGF for adult patients (â‰¥18) with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

Anti-VEGF (including Avastin, IBI305 etc.) is designed to block a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, therefore blocking the blood supply that feeds the tumor. Also, Anti-VEGF has recently been shown to play a key role regulating cancer cell proliferation trough epigenetic pathway.

Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies (including pembrolizumeb, nivolumab, sintilimab, toripalimab, camrelizumeb, tislelizumab and atezolizumab etc.) are given intravenously at assigned dose. Treatment may continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.

This study is aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of anti-VEGF and PD-1/PD-L1 mAb in unresectable late-stage HCC patients.
