A Study to Investigate LP-118, Ponatinib, Vincristine and Dexamethasone in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Lymphoblastic Lymphoma (LBL)
The purpose of this study is to learn more about LP-118 (an experimental drug) and its side effects and decide on acceptable doses. The purpose of this study is to determine if LP-118 can be given safely with another medicine called ponatinib, that is FDA-approved for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

DRUG: LP-118|DRUG: Ponatinib|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Methotrexate
Recommended Phase II Dose To demonstrate safety and to identify the recommended phase II dose for combination of LP-118, ponatinib, vincristine and dexamethasone, Recommended phase II dose for combination of LP-118, ponatinib, vincristine and dexamethasone as assessed by rate of dose-limiting toxicities among study participants., 36 weeks
Complete Clinical Remission at Days 28 and 56, Complete clinical remission at days 28 and 56 for study participants defined as the disappearance of leukemia as indicated by \<5% marrow blasts and the absence of peripheral blasts, with recovery of hematopoiesis defined by ANC ≥1000/μL and platelets ≥100,000/μL., 36 weeks|Complete clinical remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) at Days 28 and 56, Complete clinical remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) at day 28 and 56 for study participants treated at the recommended phase 2 (RP2D) dose level, defined as complete clinical remission except with ANC\< 1000/μL and/or platelets \<100,000/μL, 36 weeks|Complete Clinical Remission (CR) with Measurable Residual Disease (MRD), Complete clinical remission with measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity at day 28 and 56 for participants treated at the recommended phase 2 (RP2D) dose level., 36 weeks|Complete clinical remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) with Measurable Residual Disease (MRD), CRi with MRD negativity at days 28 and 56, defined by absence of detectable disease by flow cytometry (sensitivity of 0.01%), and V(D)J next-generation sequencing-based MRD assessment (sensitivity of 0.0001%), 36 weeks|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from treatment administration to death from any cause, or until last contact if the patient has not died., 36 weeks|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from treatment administration to documented disease progression or death from any cause, or until last contact if no event has occurred., 36 weeks
The purpose of this study is to learn more about LP-118 (an experimental drug) and its side effects and decide on acceptable doses. The purpose of this study is to determine if LP-118 can be given safely with another medicine called ponatinib, that is FDA-approved for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

This study will investigate the combination of LP-118 and ponatinib at different dose levels to find the best doses that can be safely given to patients. This means that enrolled subjects will receive progressive increasing or decreasing doses of these drugs until the maximally tolerated dose is determined. All participants will also receive a standard of care chemotherapy combination consisting of the FDA approved drugs vincristine, dexamethasone and intrathecal (injection into the spinal canal, also called "spinal tap") methotrexate. This combination is standard of care for relapsed T-ALL/LBL.
