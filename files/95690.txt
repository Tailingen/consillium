International CAPS Registry: Pancreas Cancer Cases in Surveillance Programs
Various centers around the world are currently investigating the feasibility and yield of surveillance for pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals. Evidence is beginning to accumulate that surveillance may lead to the early detection of non-invasive precursor lesions and asymptomatic early stage cancer. Ultimately, the goal of surveillance is to reduce mortality in these high risk individuals, but before this can be confirmed many research questions need to be answered. While the numbers of high-risk individuals screened in each separate screening facility are likely too small to properly address many of these questions, pooling data comprises a sizable sample size providing unique research opportunities. The objective of this study is retrospectively review all cases of high-risk individuals participating in our pancreatic surveillance program in whom 1) a suspicious precursor lesions was detected for which a pancreatic resection was performed and 2) in whom an advanced malignant disease was diagnosed. The de-identified information will be entered into an international multicenter database registry.
Pancreas Cancer
Proportion of patients and resected lesions with pancreatic cancer in situ (high grade dysplasia) or invasive malignancy, Prevalence of pancreatic neoplasia high risk patients who had surgery for detected lesions in screening programs, 5 years
Indications for pancreas surgery, Pathology or imagining related to surgery indication, 5 years|Proportion of specific types of pancreatic neoplasms by lesion type, 5 years|Incidence of pancreatic in-situ and invasive malignancy after baseline screening, Proportion of patients who had surgery or biopsy for new pancreatic lesions on follow-up, 5 years|Calculate all-cause and disease specific mortality, 5 years|Calculate survival time from point of diagnosis and treatment, 5 years
