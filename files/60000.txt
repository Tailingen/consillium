Study Testing Two Conditioning Regimen With a Single Prophylaxis of GVHD by Cyclophosphamide and Methotrexate Post-transplant in Patients Eligible for Matched-donor Allograft Transplantation
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-CSH).

Recently, in the context of semi-identical (=haploidentical) HLA donors, but also of compatible HLA donors, the use of cyclophosphamide (CY) administered in high doses at early post-transplant (PT) (=PTCY) (Days +3 and +4 or +5) has shown excellent control of acute and chronic GVH, even enabling the discontinuation of other immunosuppressive drugs administered after allo-CSH (ciclosporin, mycophenolate mofetyl (MMF) or Cellcept).

This step has already been taken in the context of allo-CSH with myeloablative conditioning (MAC), which is a minoritary conditioning in adults.

However, in the context of allo-CSH with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), which predominates in adults, this strategy seems insufficient to prevent the risk of GVHD.

The idea of reducing the use of immunosuppressants in the context of RIC/HLA-compatible transplants seems, however, still relevant, in order to reduce their adverse effects, improve patients' quality of life and enhance the reconstitution of the post-transplant immune system.

For this reason, the investigators now wish to test the administration of a combination of a high dose of early post-transplant CY (PTCY) and methotrexate (MTX) on days (D) D+1, D+4, D+6, D+11 (doses already performed in MAC transplant prophylaxis), with anti-lymphocyte serum (ALS) with RIC conditioning, without ciclosporin or MMF.

The investigators hypothesize that administration of this PTCY+MTX combination will enable immunosuppressive drugs to be discontinued as early as D+11 post-transplant, compared with the usual average of 3 to 4 months.
