Study of VIP943 in Subjects With Advanced CD123+ Hematologic Malignancies
Dose Escalation - Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), if possible, or minimum optimal biologic dose (OBD), and evaluate the safety and tolerability of VIP943 in subjects with advanced CD123+ hematologic malignancies
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: VIP943 (QW)|DRUG: VIP943 (BIW)
Incidence of DLT (Dose limit toxicity) of VIP943, Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 2 Day 1, where each cycle is up to 28 days
Response rate to VIP943 as assessed by investigators using disease-specific response criteria, Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 30 days after the last dose, where each cycle is up to 28 days (up to approximately 10 months)|Maximum observed drug concentration in measured matrix after single dose administration (Cmax) of VIP943, Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 2 Day 1, where each cycle is up to 28 days|Area under the concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity after single (first) dose (AUC) of VIP943, Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 2 Day 1, where each cycle is up to 28 days
Relapsed or refractory AML, MDS, or B-ALL subjects who are CD123 positive. Subjects must have exhausted all available standard therapies or be deemed ineligible for potential available therapies.
