Monitored Anesthesia Care With Propofol Plus Remifentanil During Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection: Evaluation of Bispectral Index Monitoring
There are clinical usefulness issues associated with bispectral index (BIS) for sedation of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). However, the clinical usefulness of BIS for deep sedation is incompletely described. The purpose of this study is to show that BIS-guided sedation is safe and useful clinically and may provide stable sedation status to physicians and patients.
