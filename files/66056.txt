Implementation and Effectiveness Trial of HN-STAR
People who have been treated for head and neck cancer (HNC survivors) can experience serious consequences from their cancer and its treatment, ongoing risks of new cancers, and other unrelated illnesses. These concerns pose challenges to the provision of comprehensive care to HNC survivors. We created HN-STAR to facilitate and tailor the ongoing care of HNC survivors. Survivors use HN-STAR on a computer or tablet to answer questions about symptoms and health concerns before a routine visit with a cancer care provider. During the clinic visit, the provider uses HN-STAR to see evidence-based recommendations for managing each concern reported by the survivor. The provider and survivor discuss recommendations and select appropriate actions (e.g., testing, referrals, prescriptions, self-management). HN-STAR produces a survivorship care plan that includes all reported concerns and the actions selected in clinic. The survivorship care plan is given to the survivor and the primary care provider. Three months, six months, and nine months later, the survivor uses HN-STAR from home (or clinic) to report their concerns again, and a new survivorship care plan is created each time.

Our trial randomizes 20-36 oncology practices from the National Community Oncology Research Program to use HN-STAR or provide usual care to 298-400 recent survivors of head and neck cancer. We hypothesize that survivors in the HN-STAR arm will have greater improvement in patient-centered outcomes (including cancer-related well-being, symptoms, and patient activation) over one year compared to survivors in the usual care arm, measured by surveys at baseline and one year later. We also hypothesize that survivors in the HN-STAR arm will be more likely to receive care that is aligned with evidence-based recommendations during the year of the study than survivors in the usual care arm. Our final aim investigates the implementation of HN-STAR in clinical practice, using interviews and surveys of survivors, providers, and other clinic staff to understand the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and other aspects of providing survivorship care to head and neck cancer survivors.
Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: HN-STAR Intervention
Change in HNC-Specific QOL, Measured using Trial Outcome Index from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head and Neck. It is a 23-item summary measure that ranges from 0 to a maximum of 96 where higher scores indicate better overall physical and functional outcomes., Baseline & 1 year
Change in QoL, Measured using domains and overall measures from the FACT H\&N. The total score evaluates overall QoL in Head and Neck Cancer patients and ranges from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating better overall QoL. Subscales are calculated by summing the relevant questions \[answered using a Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much)\]. Higher scores on subscales represent a better health state., Baseline & 1 year|Change in QoL, Measured using scales from the EORTC QLQ-C30. Scales from the EORTC QLQ-C30 evaluate functional status, global health status and symptoms. All scales range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing higher functioning, QoL or symptoms., Baseline & 1 year|Change symptom burden, Measured using scales from the EORTC QLQ-HN43. Symptom subscales from the EORTC QLQ- HN43 range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing higher symptom burden., Baseline & 1 year|Change in symptom burden, Measured using PRO-CTCAE items for relevant symptoms., Baseline & 1 year|Change in pain, Measured using Brief Pain Inventory Short Form. Pain severity and interference items are measured using a scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse pain or interference. The average is used as a summary measure of pain severity and pain interference., Baseline & 1 year|Change in patient activation, Measured using Patient Activation Measure Short Form. PAM score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher score meaning higher level of activation., Baseline & 1 year|Change in perceived quality of cancer care, Measured using the CAHPS® Cancer Care Survey., Baseline & 1 year|Adherence and surveillance of guideline concordant care, Rate at which survivors had ≥1 visit to a primary care provider in the year following the initial visit will be compared by arm. Receipt or non-receipt of guideline-concordant cancer surveillance will be derived from the oncology medical records and compared by arm., These variables will be derived from the medical record during the year following the initial visit.
