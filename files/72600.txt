Vaccination of AJCC Stage IIB, IIC, III and IV Melanoma Patients With Human and Mouse Tyrosinase DNA Vaccines
The overall goal of this study is to find out about the safety of injecting the genes (DNA) for human and mouse tyrosinase in patients with melanoma. There is no evidence yet that injection of tyrosinase DNA results in any clinical benefit. Tyrosinase is the substance found in melanoma cells that helps to produce their black color. The DNA used in this study was purified from bacteria which contains the gene for tyrosinase. DNA is material which contains the information needed to produce many substances in the body.
