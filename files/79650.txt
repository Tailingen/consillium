Masitinib in Combination With FOLFIRI in Third or Fourth Line of Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
A prospective, multicentre, open-label, randomized, phase 2-3 study to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid) versus Best Supportive Care, in third or fourth line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Masitinib
Overall survival, Overall survival (0S) is defined as time in months from the randomization date to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the date of last known date patient alive., From day of randomization to death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months
Survival rates, Survival rate, defined as the proportion of patients alive at each time point, estimated with Kaplan-Meier distribution, Every 24 weeks, assessed up to 60 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of earliest evidence of disease progression or death, for participants who progressed or died before subsequent cancer therapy. Disease progression will be assessed by the investigator on CT scan according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., From day of randomization to disease progression or death, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
The objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with FOLFIRI (irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid) versus Best Supportive Care in third or fourth line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
