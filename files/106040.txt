Efficacy & Safety of LOBO™ Vascular Occlusion Device for Embolization of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate both the technical success and efficacy of using the LOBO™ device in patients undergoing embolization of Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations (PAVM). The main question\[s\] it aims to answer \[is/are\]:

* What is the technical success rate, the number of LOBO™ devices needed for occlusion, and time to occlusion for each feeding artery during PAVM embolization using the LOBO™ device?
* What is the short-term occlusion rate of the LOBO™ device for PAVM embolization (6 months post-embolization)?
* What are the medium- and long-term occlusion rate of the LOBO™ device in PAVMs (12 months and 36 months post embolization)?

Researchers will compare the percentage of LOBO™ embolized PAVMs that develop recanalization at 6, 12, and 36- month intervals compared to percentage of conventionally embolized PAVMs that develop recanalization at the same intervals.

Participants will undergo the embolization procedure and be followed for 36 months after the procedure. There will be a total of 4 study visits:

* Treatment visit
* 6-Month Follow-up visit
* 12-Month Follow-up visit
* 36-Month Follow-up visit

At each clinical follow-up visit participants will undergo imaging with a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest.

Proportion of Technical Success, Technical success will be defined as the successful deployment of the LOBO™ device in the intended vessel and complete occlusion of the vessel. Successful deployment will be defined as 1) no technical malfunctions in the LOBO™ deployment system that leads to an inability to deploy the device and 2) deployment of the device into the intended vessel and not into surrounding vessels. Complete occlusion will be defined as complete cessation of blood flow through the embolized vessel based on intraprocedural angiography., At treatment until stasis is achieved. Approximately 1 - 2 hours.
Mean Number of LOBO Plugs, Descriptive statistics for the number of LOBO™ devices needed for technical success will be reported., At treatment until stasis is achieved. Approx. 1 - 2 hours.|Mean Time to Complete Occlusion, Descriptive statistics for the time to completion will be reported., At treatment until stasis is achieved. Approx. 1 - 2 hours.|Short-term Occlusion Rate, Recanalization will be defined as contrast visualization through the plug or the aneurysmal sac on follow-up CTA's. Interpretation of these images will be done by standard clinical radiologists and not research personnel. The reading radiologist's interpretation will be used to determine if recanalization has occurred., 6 months post-embolization|Medium- and Long-term Occlusion Rates, Recanalization will be defined as contrast visualization through the plug or the aneurysmal sac on follow-up CTA's. Interpretation of these images will be done by standard clinical radiologists and not research personnel. The reading radiologist's interpretation will be used to determine if recanalization has occurred., 12 months and 36 months post-embolization|Recanalization Rates by Modality (LOBO vs conventional), Proportion of LOBO™ embolized PAVMs that develop recanalization at 6, 12, and 36- month intervals compared to proportion of conventionally embolized PAVMs (those embolized with coils, Amplatzer, MVPs) that develop recanalization at the same intervals. The retrospective comparator group will consist of patients who have undergone conventional embolization at UNC in a separate trial., 6, 12, and 36-months post-embolization
This is a prospective, interventional, single-center investigation involving the enrollment of 30 participants with PAVMs with feeding arteries ≥2 mm in diameter. Per standard of care and current clinical practice at UNC, all patients are first evaluated at the UNC Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) clinic which is run by the UNC Hematology Division. Based on clinical symptoms and signs (shortness of breath, hypoxia, positive bubble study, history of stroke or transient ischemic attack), and/or imaging findings (i.e., feeding artery size) on chest computed tomography angiography (CTA), patients are referred to interventional radiology for consultation for PAVM embolization. At this time, patients will be approached for enrollment in this study. This study aims to assess the technical success and rates of recanalization of PAVMs embolized using the LOBO™ device.
