......SMARTEST Trial......
The SMARTEST trial is a phase II non-blinded randomized trial designed to evaluate the benefit of low dose cyclophosphamide in sequential combination with sub-ablative radiation (Arm A) versus sub-ablative radiation alone (Arm B) before surgery as well as the safety and efficacy of consolidation tremelimumab-durvalumab for eligible patients after surgery in both arms.
Mesothelioma, Malignant
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Tremelimumab|DRUG: Durvalumab
CD8 TILs density / gross tumor volume (GTV), The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that low dose cyclophosphamide in combination with sub-ablative radiation can enhance the anti-tumoral immune response compared to sub-ablative radiation alone, Up to five years
Survival, Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of tremelimumab-durvalumab in the adjuvant setting after sub-ablative radiation and surgery with and without low dose cyclophosphamide, Up to five years
Proportional change in circulating CD8 RA+ effector memory T cells, Proportional change in circulating CD4 RA+ effector memory T cells, Identify biomarkers associated with prognosis and response to therapy, Up to five years
This study has two parts. In the first part of the study the investigators are exploring the benefit of using low dose Cyclophosphamide in combination with low dose radiation before surgery and in the second part of the study the investigators are exploring safety and efficacy of using a combination of immunotherapy drugs, tremelimumab-durvalumab, after surgery.
