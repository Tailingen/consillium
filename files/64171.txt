Efficacy and Safety Study of Medical Thoracoscope Cryotherapy Combined Standard First-line Treatment of Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer and Malignant Pleural Effusion
This study intends to investigate the efficacy and safety of medical thoracoscopic cryotherapy combined with standard first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with malignant pleural effusion through a randomized controlled clinical trial.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: Medical thoracoscopic cryotherapy combined with standard first-line therapy for advanced non-cell lung cancer|OTHER: Sequential intrathoracic injection of cisplatin/erythromycin combined with standard first-line therapy for advanced non-cell lung cancer|OTHER: Standard first-line therapy for advanced non-cell lung cancer without intrathoracic treatment
pleural progression free survival, P-PFS, According to Millar's criteria, P-PFS was defined as absence of pleural effusion lasting more than 4 weeks; Or an order of magnitude reduction in pleural effusion (such as large to medium volume, or medium to small volume) lasting more than 4 weeks; Or pleural effusion with no significant change, lasting more than 4 weeks., up to 2 months
Total effective rate, Complete remission (CR) : pleural effusion disappeared and lasted for more than 4 weeks; Partial remission (PR) : reduction of pleural effusion by 1 order of magnitude (e.g., large to medium volume, or medium to small volume) for more than 4 weeks; CR+PR was denoted as the total effective rate., up tp 2 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), up to 2 months|modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, The modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC) is used to assess degree of baseline functional disability due to dyspnea. The minimum and maximum values are 0 and 4, and higher scores mean a worse outcome. Score 0 means dyspnea only with strenuous exercise; score 1 means dyspnea when hurrying or walking up a slight hill; score 2 means walks slower than people of the same age because of dyspnea or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace; score 3 means stops for breath after walking 100 yards (91 m) or after a few minutes; score 4 means too dyspneic to leave house or breathless when dressing., up to 2 months|Overall survival time, up to 2 months|Adverse reactions, up to 2 months
