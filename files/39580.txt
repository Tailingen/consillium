Differentiation of Progression From Treatment Effects in High-Grade Gliomas: A Clinical Trial With Multimodality MR Imaging
To evaluate the efficacy of multi-modality magnetic resonance quantitative parameters in evaluating the treatment effects of high-grade gliomas, and to provide new biomarkers for the establishment of new diagnostic criteria for the identification of true and pseudoprogression of high-grade gliomas.
