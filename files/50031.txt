Complete response (CR) defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. Progressive disease (PD) defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions since the prior scan. Stable disease (SD) defined as responses not fulfilling CR, PR or PD., Up to 1 year
