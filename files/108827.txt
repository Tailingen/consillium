Nivolumab or Nivolumab and Azacitidine in Patients With Recurrent, Resectable Osteosarcoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nivolumab, or nivolumab in combination with azacitidine in participants with recurrent, resectable osteosarcoma
Osteosarcoma|Osteosarcoma in Children|Osteosarcoma Recurrent|Sarcoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Azacitidine|PROCEDURE: Post Treatment Surgery
Phase I: Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), If one or fewer dose limiting toxicities (DLT's) occur in 6 participants the study will advance to the next dose level. If 2 or more DLT's occur at a dose level, the prior dose level will be identified as the RP2D., 60 days|Phase II: Rate of Continued Complete Remission (CR), Continued complete remission by computed tomography (CT) scan 1 year after surgery., 1 year post surgery
Percentage of Participants with Event Free Survival (EFS), EFS: The time from diagnostic biopsy until the earliest of: death, local recurrence, new metastatic disease, progression of metastatic disease or secondary malignancy, or date of last contact., 1 year post surgery|Overall Survival (OS) Rate, The percentage of participants alive at 1 year post surgery., 1 year post surgery
Treatment will be administered in 28 day cycles with the first cycle in the neoadjuvant setting. This will be followed by surgery to render the participant in surgical remission. Subsequently the participant will continue to receive treatment for up to 12 additional cycles or until recurrence, whichever occurs first. For participants with known bilateral lung recurrence, the nodule\[s\] in one lung should be resected, prior to the first cycle of chemotherapy. This trial was initially designed as a Phase 1/2 study; However, phase 2 will not proceed.
