Comparative Study of the Quality of Life of Patients Suffering From OTOTOXICITY Due to Chemotherapy Based on Platinum Salts Fitted With a Hearing Aid Compared to Those Not Fitted.
There are many undesirable effects associated with platinum-based cancer treatments (renal failure, anaemia, etc.). Their administration also leads to neurosensory problems such as ototoxicity, tinnitus and reduced hearing acuity. According to a the French survey (2018), 39.7% of people suffer from hearing problems due to cancer treatments, five years after a cancer diagnosis.

Improving side effects such as hypoacusis and tinnitus can significantly improve patients' quality of life and adherence to treatment. Many clinical trials proposed a medicinal solution to patients receiving platinum-based cancer treatments but none has led to a consensus on management.

The aim of the study is to offer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy and suffering from hearing problems a hearing aid to improve their quality of life.

Quality of life of patients, The quality of life of patients with hearing aids suffering from ototoxicity due to platinum-based chemotherapy will be assessed using the 36 Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF36).

\[score 0 to 100 : score 0 representing the lowest possible scores and score 100 representing the highest possible scores. A higher score means better health., 6 months
Measuring hearing and the onset of tinnitus in patients, Hearing and the onset of tinnitus in hearing-aided patients suffering from chemotherapy-induced ototoxicity will be assessed by Hertz/Decibel measurement using an audiometer, 6 months|Patient compliance to wearing a hearing aid, Hearing aid compliance will be assessed according to the proportion of patients completing 6-month follow-up with a hearing aid among all included patients., 6 months
