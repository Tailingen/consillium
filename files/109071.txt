Enhancing Skin Cancer Early Detection and Treatment in Primary Care
Skin cancer screening may help find melanoma sooner, when it may be easier to treat. If found early melanoma and other types of skin cancer may be curable. Multi-component education may be an effective method to help primary care physicians (PCPs) learn about skin cancer screening. This clinical trial examines whether a clinician-focused educational intervention can improve PCP's knowledge and clinical performance to identify and triage skin cancer. This intervention may increase the PCP's ability to diagnose, treat and/or triage early-stage melanoma.

BEHAVIORAL: Training and Education
Reach of the educational intervention, Measured by proportion of clinicians invited to participate in the educational intervention that complete the training modules, 1 month|Clinician knowledge in screening for skin cancer, Change in knowledge based upon survey questions prior to training and post-training., 1 month|Use of dermatology referrals and e-consults, Measured through electronic health record (EHR) data., 3 months
Identification of suspicious lesions, Measured through EHR data., 3 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Evaluate whether a multi-component education strategy improves the ability of PCPs to identify and triage skin cancer.

OUTLINE:

Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.

PCP participants complete group training. All training participants will also be offered series of short booster teaching points delivered virtually. Participants who complete the training also take part in pre-post knowledge assessments. PCP participants may also participate in a qualitative interview.

PCPs at the two clinics who do not receive the group training will serve as study comparators.
