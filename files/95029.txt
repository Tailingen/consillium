Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) With Intravenous Busulfan and Melphalan as Conditioning Regimen
Analyze the results of ASCT using intravenous Busulfan and Melphalan as conditioning regimen for patients with Multiple Myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Intravenous busulfan and melphalan
The primary objective of this study is to analyze the safety profile and determine the overall response rate after ASCT with this conditioning regimen., Within the first three months after transplant
Evaluate the complete response (CR) rate, the duration of the response, time to progression, event-free and overall survival, Up to 5 years after transplant
Primary Efficacy and safety of the procedure in terms of number of remissions, survival, event-free survival, relapse risk, and early transplant-related mortality (up to day +100).

Secondary Graft kinetics (time to neutrophil and platelet recovery after ASCT) 2.Analyze the presence of transplant-related complications (infections, sinusoidal occlusive syndrome and others) 3.Analyze prognostic factors for engraftment, remission rate, relapse risk, disease-free and overall survival after ASCT
