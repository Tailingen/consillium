Effect of Dual-Task Training on Pediatric Oncology Patients
It is known that the treatment of children with cancer has negative effects on cognition, muscle strength, balance, and gait. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of dual-task training, which is based on the principle of simultaneous performance of cognitive tasks and motor tasks, on muscle strength, balance, and gait.

OTHER: Dual-task training
gait speed, Gait speed is the time one takes to walk a specified distance on level surfaces over a short distance. It will be recorded in m/s., 600 seconds|balance, Balance is evaluated with Timed-up and Go Test. The time elapsed during the test is recorded in seconds., 300 seconds|Muscle strength, Isometric muscle strength will be evaluated with a hand-held dynamometer. It will be recorded in kg., 600 seconds
With the increase in the incidence of cancer, the number of children who survived cancer is also increasing. Most studies on cancer survivors show that the disease and its treatment have side effects and long-term late effects on the musculoskeletal system, physical function, motor, and cognitive skills. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of dual-task training, which is based on the principle of simultaneous performance of cognitive tasks and motor tasks, on muscle strength, balance, and gait. This study is planned to be the first study in which dual-task training is applied in children with cancer.
