Analysis of Cell Count, Viability, and Immunogenicity of Discarded Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Tissue or Solid Tumor Tissues
This study examines tumor tissues and blood samples to aid in the development of therapies for brain cancer and other solid tumors. Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with glioblastoma or other solid tumor in the laboratory may help doctors understand brain tumors and better inform future treatments.
Glioblastoma|Malignant Solid Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection
Cell yield, This will be determined for each sample. Cell yield data is measured in 106and is assumed to be normally distributed. Summary statistics of mean, standard deviation, 95% confidence interval and range will be reported., At study completion, up to 12 months|Percentage cell viability, Percentage cell viability will be calculated by the number of viable cells divided by the cell yield. The mean will be computed using the sum of the viable cells divided by the sum of cell yield. The range of percentage cell viability and 95% confidence interval will be provided., At study completion, up to 12 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Assessment of cell yield and percentage of viable cells upon tissue receipt at the cell processing facility.

II. Obtain discarded tumor tissue from surgical resections for further studies to aid in development of future therapies for glioblastoma (GBM) and other solid tumors.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Assessment of cell yield and percentage of viable cells from other solid tumor cells shipped to the cell processing facility.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

I. An additional line of inquiry will be devoted to scientific exploration of the product's immunogenicity looking at important variables in the course of manufacture.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo collection of tissue sample during surgery. Patients also undergo collection of blood sample.
