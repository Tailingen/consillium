The study includes three phases: dose escalation (Phase Ia), dose extension (Phase Ib), and clinical exploration (Phase IIa).

First, the Phase Ia dose escalation will be carried out. After switching to the 3+3 escalation mode, the Phase Ib dose extension study can be carried out at the same time. After Phase Ia is completed and RP2D is obtained, Phase IIa clinical exploratory research can be carried out.
