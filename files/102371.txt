An Efficacy and Safety Study of Apalutamide (JNJ-56021927) in Combination With Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone Versus Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone in Participants With Chemotherapy-naive Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
The purpose of this study is to compare the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) of apalutamide in combination with abiraterone acetate (AA) plus prednisone or prednisolone (AAP) and AAP in participants with chemotherapy-naive (participants who did not receive any chemotherapy \[treatment of cancer using drugs\]) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) (cancer of prostate gland \[gland that makes fluid that aids movement of sperm\]).
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Apalutamide|DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Placebo
Radiographic Progression-free Survival (rPFS), The rPFS was defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of one of the following: 1) a participant was considered to have progressed by bone scan if - a) the first bone scan with greater than or equal to (\>=) 2 new lesions compared to baseline was observed in less than (\<) 12 weeks from randomization and was confirmed by a second bone scan taken \>=6 weeks later showing \>=2 additional new lesions (a total of \>=4 new lesions compared to baseline), b) the first bone scan with \>=2 new lesions compared to baseline was observed in \>=12 weeks from randomization and the new lesions were verified on the next bone scan \>=6 weeks later (a total of \>=2 new lesions compared to baseline); 2) progression of soft tissue lesions measured by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1., Up to 3 years and 4 months
Overall Survival (OS), The OS was defined as the time from randomization to date of death from any cause., Up to 5 years and 10 months|Time to Chronic Opioid Use, Time to chronic opioid use was defined as the time from date of randomization to the first date of opioid use., Up to 5 years and 10 months|Time to Initiation of Cytotoxic Chemotherapy, Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy., Up to 5 years and 10 months|Time to Pain Progression, Time to pain progression: time from randomization to first date that participant either experienced an increase by 2 points from baseline in Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) worst pain intensity item (item 3) or Case Report Form (CRF) pain, observed at 2 consecutive evaluations \>=4 wks apart, or initiation of chronic opioids as defined in time to chronic opioid use, whichever occurred first. BPI-SF is a self-administered questionnaire developed to assess severity of pain and impact of pain on daily functions. Item 3(worst pain intensity) asks participants to rate worst pain in prior 7-days on a 0-10 numeric rating scale, where "0" indicates "No pain" and "10" indicates "Pain as bad as you can imagine." A lower score is better.CRF pain refers to participant's response to global pain assessment "How would you rate your pain over the past 7 days?"with a scale of 0("No pain") to 10("Pain as bad as you can imagine"),that is systematically reported and recorded on the eCRF., Up to 5 years and 10 months
This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the Investigator nor the participant know the treatment) placebo-controlled and multicenter (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study to determine if participants with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC will benefit from the addition of apalutamide to AAP compared with AAP alone. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening phase; Treatment phase, and Follow-up phase. At the final analysis, the study will be unblinded. After the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) review and the sponsor's subsequent decision participants will be offered to receive treatment either in the Open-Label Extension Phase or the Long-Term Extension Phase of study. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
