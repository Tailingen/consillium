Study of Pegylated Alfa Interferon, Sunitinib and Tarceva in Patients With Metastatic RCC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combination of Pegylated Alfa Interferon (PEG-Intron), Sunitinib and Tarceva to see if this drug combination delays the disease progression of patients with metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma. The first phase of this study will determine the best dose of Peg-Intron, Sunitinib and Tarceva when given in combination. The safety of giving these drugs in combination and response to treatment will also be examined.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Pegylated Alfa Interferon|DRUG: sunitinib|DRUG: erlotinib
Time to progression Objective response rate, every 6 wks
Overall survival, every 6 weeks
Over 75% of RCCs are highly vascularized tumors that overexpress a number of growth factors, including VEGF, PDGF, and bFGF. In addition, RCC tumors overexpress the receptors for these peptides. These ligands and receptors may be involved in the autocrine stimulation of tumor cell growth, or in the paracrine stimulation of neovascular or stromal fibroblast growth that supports tumor expansion. Novel treatment that specifically interrupts these signaling pathways may have significant anti-tumor activity. When taken together, these data provide a rationale for investigation of a combination therapy with PEG-Intron, Sunitinib and Tarceva for clear cell and papillary RCC patients.
