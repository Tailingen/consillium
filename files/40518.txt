CD19-directed CAR-T Cell Therapy for R/R Acute Leukemia and Lymphoma
The goal of this prospective, multicentric, single-arm, phase I/II clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel CD19-directed CAR-T cell locally produced in an academic institution in Brazil in patients with refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Participants will receive a single intravenous infusion of an autologous academic anti-CD19 CAR-T cell and will be followed for 5 years.
Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic|Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
BIOLOGICAL: CART-19
Safety: Number of participants who experience early adverse events., To evaluate the occurrence of early adverse events related to the study treatment, from inclusion until 30 days after CAR-T cell infusion., From patient's inclusion until 30 days after CAR-T cell infusion|Safety: Number of participants who experience late adverse events., To evaluate the occurrence of early adverse events related to the study treatment, from week 5 to week 52., From week 5 to week 52
Efficacy: Overall Response Rate (ORR), The combined number of participants achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as the best response at day 30 and day 90 after CAR-T cell infusion, determined by the investigators, following Lugano criteria in non-Hodgkin lymphomas; or the combined number of participants achieving Complete Remission (CR) or Complete Remission with Incomplete Hematologic Recovery (CRi) as the best response at day 30 and day 90 after CAR-T cell infusion, determined by the investigators, in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia., Day 30 and day 90 after CAR-T cell infusion|Efficacy: Event Free Survival (EFS), The time between patient's inclusion and relapse, disease progression, or death of any cause., From patient's inclusion until 5 years|Efficacy: Relapse Free Survival (RFS), The duration of response, defined as the time from the first complete or partial response to the date of first documentation of relapse, disease progression, or death of any cause., From patient's inclusion until 5 years|Efficacy: Overall Survival (EFS), The number of participants surviving since patient's inclusion until 5 years, From patient's inclusion until 5 years
Exploratory: Number of patientes with CAR-T cell persistence over the time, To evaluate the persistence of infused CAR-T cells in patient's peripheral blood over the time, From CAR-T cell infusion until 5 years|Exploratory: Replication-competent lentivirus (RCL), To evaluate the presence of replication-competent lentivirus in patient's peripheral blood, after CAR-T cell infusion, in a cohort of 10 patients., From CAR-T cell infusion until 5 years
Eighty-one patients with refractory/relapsed (R/R) B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) will be included in this multicentric, phase I/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel academic CD19-directed CAR-T cell developed in Brazil.

After the inclusion of the patient, lymphocyte apheresis will be performed for lymphocyte collection, followed by activation, transduction with a lentiviral vector, and expansion of produced CAR-T cells.

The patient will be hospitalized and receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy started five days before CAR-T cells infusion, with cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/day) and fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) for three days. On Day 0, CAR-T cells will be intravenously administered over 20-30 minutes. The optimal CAR-T cell dose will be 1,7 to 5,4 x106 cells/kg, for ALL patients, and 0,6 to 6,0 x 108 cells (total dose) for NHL patients, but any dose higher than 0,2 x 106 cells/kg (for patients \< 50 Kg) or 0,14 x 106 cells/kg and 0,1 x 108 cells (total dose) (for patients â‰¥ 50Kg), and lower than the maximal 2,6 x 108 cells (total dose) will be infused, depending on the obtained cellular product. During and after infusion, the patient will be monitored for signs and symptoms of toxicity and will remain hospitalized for at least two weeks. All patients will receive anti-viral and anti-pneumocystis prophylaxis. They will be monitored to evaluate treatment efficacy, and acute and late toxicities for five years after infusion.
