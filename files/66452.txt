Points are awarded for 12 body areas (left and right axillae, left and right sub/inframammary areas, intermammary area, left and right buttocks, left and right inguino-crural folds, perianal area, perineal area, and other): points were awarded for nodules (2 points for each); abscesses (4 points); fistulas (4 points); scars (1 point); other findings (1 point); and longest distance between two lesions (2-6 points, 0 if no lesions); and if lesions are separated by normal skin (yes-0 points; no-6 points). The total Sartorius score is the sum of the 12 regional scores. Higher scores indicate greater severity of HS. A negative change indicates decrease in severity.

HS is a painful, chronic skin disease characterized by recurrent inflamed nodules and abscesses, which may rupture to form fistulas and subsequent scarring. This study is an open-label extension study available to subjects who participated in a prior adalimumab study who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.
