PAncreatic Disease Cohort of TOuLouse
This study is a prospective cohort dedicated to pancreatic diseases excluding cancer. The aim is to develop positive or differential diagnostic tools between benign potentially malignant or malignant pancreatic pathologies. During this study the investigators collect data and biological samples to support research project.

This collection focuses on pathology of the pancreas requiring specific investigations or management for diagnosis or treatment. Pancreatic pathologies can be classified as malignant, potentially malignant or benign tumors. These can be solid or cystic. There is an inflammatory attack on the pancreas, generating acute pancreatitis in the acute period, if the inflammatory manifestations persist, chronic pancreatitis will develop. Some lesions may be at risk of malignancy during their evolution, it is therefore necessary to improve the performance of monitoring and diagnostic tools in order to adapt the management of patients.
