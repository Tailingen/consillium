A Multicenter Trial Assessing the Efficacy and Safety of tamOxifen Plus LY2228820 in Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Progressing on aromatasE Inhibitors
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains an incurable disease and despite an improvement of the effect of systemic treatments. After relapse on first-line non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor, current clinical practice and treatment guidelines include tamoxifen, fulvestrant (an ER antagonist) and exemestane as available options (NCCN treatment guidelines 2012), but in this context of resistance, their efficacy are poor.

Some results confirm the possibility to improve the efficacy of tamoxifen in metastatic setting by a combination with therapy targeting signal transduction pathways. Other transduction pathways seem to be involved in endocrine sensitivity/resistance, such as RAS/RAF/MEK/MAK pathway.

LY2228820 inhibits the activity of p38 MAPK (selective inhibitor of the α and β isoforms of p38 MAPK in vitro) and reduces phosphorylation of its cellular target, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP-K2).
Postmenopausal|Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Ralimetinib (LY2228820 dimesylate)
To define the efficacy (progression-free survival rate at 6 months) of LY2228820 in combination with tamoxifen for postmenopausal women with an ER positive and HER2 negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who progressed on aromatase inhibitors., at 6 months after treatment start.
- To evaluate the toxicity profile (Safety and Tolerability) of the LY2228820 in combination with tamoxifen, Adverse events description and grade in all participants, From date of randomization until study participation (during average 12 months)|- To estimate the Progression-Free Survival of the LY2228820 in combination with tamoxifen, evaluated every 8-12 weeks (during average 12 months)|- To assess the overall survival of the LY2228820 in combination with tamoxifen, From date of randomization until the date of first documented date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|- To assess response duration of the LY2228820 in combination with tamoxifen, evaluated every 8-12 weeks during treatment to progression or death for any cause.(during average 12 months)
