Risk of Squamous Cell Carcinoma on Skin Areas Treated With Ingenol Mebutate Gel, 0.015% and Imiquimod Cream, 5%
The purpose of the study is to compare the risk of developing squamous skin cancer (SCC) or other types of cancer after treatment of AKs with ingenol mebutate gel or imiquimod cream. Subjects will be randomised to treatment with ingenol mebutate or imiquimod and will receive a second treatment cycle with the same treatment if the first treatment does not clear all AKs. Subjects will be followed over a period of three year (36 months) after first treatment

DRUG: Ingenol Mebutate Gel, 0.015%|DRUG: Imiquimod Cream, 5%
Incidence of SCC, Cumulative incidence of SCC after treatment with ingenol mebutate gel and imiquimod cream.\> The primary response criterion is diagnosis of SCC (defined as invasive SCC i.e. excludes SCC in situ) in the treatment field across the 3-year trial period.\> Kaplan-Meier estimate based on time to SCC or censoring., 3 years
Incidence of SCC and Other Neoplasia, Cumulative incidence of SCC and other neoplasia after treatment with ingenol mebutate gel and imiquimod cream.\> The secondary response criterion is diagnosis of SCC and other neoplasia in the treatment field across the 3-year trial period.\> Kaplan-Meier estimate based on time to SCC and other neoplasia, or censoring., 3 years|Number of Participants With Complete Clearance of AK Lesions After Last Treatment, To compare the complete clearance of AK lesions in the selected treatment area after the last treatment cycle (at Week 8 or 16), 8-16 weeks|Number of Participants With Partial Clearance of AK Lesions, To compare the partial (at least 75%) clearance of AK lesions in the selected treatment area after the last treatment cycle (at Week 8 or 16), 8-16 weeks|Number of Participants With Complete Clearance of AK Lesions at 12 Months, To compare the complete clearance of AK lesions at 12 months, defined as no AK lesions in the selected treatment area at any time from the last treatment cycle at Week 8 or 16 through to Month 12., 1 year
