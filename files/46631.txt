A Phase II Study of Imatinib Versus Interferon as Adjuvant Therapy in KIT-mutated Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to compare the relapse free survival and overall survival of Imatinib (Gleevec) or high dose Interferon (Intron) in treating melanoma which has primary tumor and regional lymphonode (if have) removed in patients whose disease carries a c-kit mutation. It is assumed that Gleevec may be more effective on relapse free survival as the adjuvant treatment compared with Interferon.
Melanoma
DRUG: imatinib|DRUG: Interferon
relapse free survival, participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 18 months
overall survival, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 48 months
If mutation tests show that the patient is eligible and they choose to participate in the study, they will be randomized and receive imatinib/Interferon. Each imatinib pill will be 100mg and the participants will take 4 pills once daily (400mg).Participants randomized to the interferon arm will receive Interferon 1500wiu/m2 d1-5 for 4 weeks followed by 900wiu IH TIW for 11 months. The following study procedures will also be performed at routine intervals throughout the course of treatment including blood tests, medical history updates, physical exams and Chest/Abdomen/Pelvic CT examinations.Participants will be on this study for one year and then be followed up to relapse or distal metastasis.
