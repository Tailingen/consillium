Clinical Trial for Assessment of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Serum for Early Treatment of COVID-19 Cases
Phase I/II Randomized Clinical Trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune serum.

The study will include patients at early stage of COVID-19 with increased risk for severe disease due to underlying medical conditions to determine the utility of an equine heterologous serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 to avoid progression to a severe COVID-19

Phase I/II Clinical Trial, randomized, multicentric, on three stages (A, B and C) to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum and dose escalation.

The study will be in three stages:

Stage A: 30 kidney transplanted participants (very high risk), where 15 will received 1 vial (5 mL) and 15 will received 2 vials (10 mL) of serum;

Stage B: 30 immunocompetent participants with at least 2 risk factors for severe disease (high risk) who will receive the dose selected by stage A;

Stage C: 558 participants, of very high risk and high risk, compared with placebo in allocation 2:1 (endpoint-driven design)

Allocation type Open study without allocation of randomization on Stages A and B Randomized allocation with placebo comparator in Stage C.

Recruitment Status: On planning

Date of 1st recruitment Expected: April 2021

Target sample siz 618 (30/30/538) participants
