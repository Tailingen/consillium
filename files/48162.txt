Phase I Study of TBI-1401(HF10) Plus Chemotherapy in Patients with Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer.
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of TBI-1401(HF10) treatment in combination with chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel or TS-1) in patients with stage III or IV unresectable pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer Stage III|Pancreatic Cancer Stage IV
BIOLOGICAL: TBI-1401(HF10)|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: TS-1
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Determine the recommended dose of TBI-1401(HF10) in combination with Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel., Through 1st TBI-1401(HF10) injection to before 3rd injection (basically 4 weeks).
Adverse Events (AEs), Evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0)., Through 1st TBI-1401(HF10) injection to study completion (up to 13 month).|Objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST, Overall tumor response evaluated by RECIST version 1.1, At 16 weeks and through study completion (up to 1 year).|Objective response rate (ORR) by irRECIST, Overall tumor response evaluated by irRECIST., At 16 weeks and through study completion (up to 1 year).|Progression-free survival (PFS) by RECIST, Evaluation the time to progression during and after the treatment., Through disease progression (up to 1 year).|Progression-free survival (PFS) by irRECIST, Evaluation the time to progression during and after the treatment., Through disease progression (up to 1 year).
Overall survival (OS), Evaluation the overall survival., From 1st treatment to death (up to 2 years).|1 year survival rate, Determine the 1 year survival rate of patient who received treatment., for 1 year.
A Phase I, open-label, multi-center study to determine the recommended dose of TBI-1401(HF10) treatment in combination with chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel or TS-1) in patients with stage III or IV unresectable pancreatic cancer. Patients with stage IV must failed a gemcitabine based first-line chemotherapy.

Patients with stage III will receive the repeated intratumoral injection of TBI-1401(HF10) at recommended dose at 2-week intervals in combination with intravenous infusion of 1000 mg/m\^2 Gemcitabine and 125 mg/m\^2 Nab-paclitaxel at weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week rest.

Patients with stage IV will receive the repeated intratumoral injection of TBI-1401(HF10) at recommended dose at 2-week intervals in combination with oral of 40 - 60 mg TS-1 at twice daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks rest.

Patients will receive the combination therapy of TBI-1401(HF10) + chemo for up to 1 year if eligible for treatment.
