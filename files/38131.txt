Study of Disulfiram and Copper Gluconate in Patients With Treatment-Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a phase I, open-label trial of disulfiram in combination with copper gluconate in patients with treatment-refractory multiple myeloma. The trial is designed to assess the Phase 2 Recommended Dose (RP2D) of disulfiram and copper gluconate in combination. The trial will open with dose escalation, followed to an expansion cohort to further characterize the safety and tolerance of the combination.

Dose escalation will utilize a standard 3+3 design and will test up to five dose levels. Dose levels will be separated into two sequential parts defined by the fixed dose of copper as copper gluconate administered with ascending doses of disulfiram. Part 1 of dose escalation will consist of dose levels 0 and 1 with the option to reduce to Dose Level -1 if Dose Level 0 is deemed intolerable. Part 2 will test dose levels 2 and 3. The Dose Level deemed to be the RP2D will be used in dose expansion.
