Videoendoscopic Pilonidal Sinus Surgery
This study examines performing pilonidal sinus surgery minimal invasively with videoendoscopic approach.
Recurrence|Postoperative Complication
PROCEDURE: videoendoscopic resection of pilonidal sinus
recurrence rates, primary outcome measure of effectivity of pilonidal sinus surgery is recurrence rates., six months
postoperative complications, wound healing, Postoperative complications such as bleeding and infection are important outcome measurements. Wound healing time is the other important one., 1 month
Lots of surgical techniques are performing on pilonidal sinus disease treatment. Lately large flap techniques are popular but causing anatomical distortions and bad cosmesis. In this new approach the investigators concluded that two 1cm diameter holes are enough to surgical treatment. One hole is for videoendoscopic camera and the other one for grasper to extract piluses and granulation tissues.
