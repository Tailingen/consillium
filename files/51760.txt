Diabetes Care for Breast Cancer Patients
The goal of this study is to find a new way to make diabetes care better for patients with breast cancer and diabetes who are currently receiving cancer treatment. We will have two groups, the researchers will decide who is in which group. One group will be working with a nurse who is trained in diabetes care while the other does not. This will allow the investigators to see if having a trained nurse as part of the care team can help improve the care the patients receive.

Recruitment Success Ratio, Number of participants recruited divided by the number of participants approached, 2 years|Intervention Completion Success Ratio, Only for the interventional group The number of participants who completed intervention divided by the number of participants who enrolled, 2 years|Data Collection Success Ratio, Number of participants who completed both surveys divided by the number of participants who were enrolled., 2 years|Patient Questionnaire: Self-report of intervention feasibility, Questionnaire: Feasibility of Intervention Measure (4 items)

Response Scale:

For each item, respondents can choose a value from 1-5. Scales can be created for the measure by averaging responses for all 4 items for the overall score. The average score range is from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating that the intervention is very feasible, and lower scores (below 3) indicating the intervention is not feasible., Immediately post-intervention at the week 12 follow-up|Provider Questionnaire: Self-report of intervention feasibility, Questionnaire: Feasibility of Intervention Measure (4 items)

Response Scale:

For each item, respondents can choose a value from 1-5. Scales can be created for the measure by averaging responses for all 4 items for the overall score. The average score range is from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating more favorable attitudes toward the intervention and lower scores (below 3) indicating less favorable attitudes., Immediately post-intervention at the week 12 follow-up|Provider Questionnaire: Self-report of intervention acceptability, Questionnaire: Acceptability of Intervention Measure (4 items)

Response Scale:

For each item, respondents can choose a value from 1-5. Scales can be created for the measure by averaging responses for all 4 items for the overall score. The average score range is from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating the intervention suits their needs well and lower scores (below 3) indicating the intervention does not fit their needs well., Immediately post-intervention at the week 12 follow-up|Provider Questionnaire: Self-report of intervention appropriateness, Questionnaire: Intervention Appropriateness Measure (4 items)

Neuropathy - PRO-CTCAE (2 items) 0-8 with higher scores representing worse neuropathy, From baseline to week 12 follow-up visit|Change in Patient Self-report Responses of Diabetes Distress Scale Questionnaire, Diabetes Distress Scale (17 items) A score of "1" indicates a particular item is not a problem or bother for the patient, whereas "6" represents an item is very concerning for the patient. To score, the patient's responses will be summed and then divided by the number of items in that scale. A mean score of 3 or higher (moderate distress) is considered as a level of distress that is above average., From baseline to Week 12 follow-up|Change in Patient Self-report Responses of the Audit of Diabetes Dependent QoL Questionnaire, Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of life (QoL) (15 items). For each item, respondents provide a score for both "impact" and "importance." Total weighted scores range from -9 to +3. Lower scores reflect poorer quality of life., From baseline to Week 12 follow-up|Change in Patient Self-report Responses of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast Questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Breast (44-items) measures quality of life for patients with breast cancer.

The present study aims to develop a stakeholder-engaged nurse practitioner (NP)-led intervention to improve diabetes care for patients with breast cancer and diabetes who are undergoing cancer treatment.

This is a pilot feasibility study, in which we will use a quasi-experimental pre-post design with non-randomized intervention and control groups. In this feasibility study, the investigators will first enroll 38 eligible patients for the control group and collect effectiveness measures at baseline and follow-up (end of chemotherapy or other cancer treatment, \~12 weeks). Through chart review, the investigators will document cancer treatment regimen completion at follow-up. The investigators will then enroll 38 patients for the intervention group, collecting the effectiveness and implementation outcomes at the end of their treatment (\~12 weeks).

The main hypothesis that will be tested in this pilot study is that a nurse practitioner embedded in the oncology team who is trained in diabetes management may successfully manage diabetes during active cancer care for patients undergoing cancer treatment.
