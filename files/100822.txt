Study of TLR9 Agonist Vidutolimod (CMP-001) in Combination with Nivolumab Vs. Nivolumab
The main goal of this research study is to determine how nivolumab and nivolumab/Vidutolimod (CMP-001) combination affect the likelihood of destroying melanoma involving lymph node and/or in-transit/satellite areas.

The main goal of the PET/CT scan with 18F\]F-AraG is to evaluate how \[18F\]F-AraG uptake changes before and after administration of either nivolumab or nivolumab/CMP-001 combination.

Major Pathologic Response Rate (MPR), A ratio of responders (to treatment) to total number of tumors (responders plus non-responders to treatment). Immune-related pathologic response rate based on the percent (%) of residual volume of tumor (RVT). Pathologic Non Response (pNR) is defined as %RVT\>50%; Partial Pathologic Response (pPR) is defined as 10%\< %RVT\<50% (at least 10%, up to 49%); Major Pathologic Response (MPR) is defined as %RVTâ‰¤10%; Pathologic, At the time of surgery (Week 8-10)|Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate, Per Immune-related pathologic response criteria (irPRC), pCR is defined as 0% RVT remaining in post-therapy specimen., At the time of surgery (Week 8-10)|Distant-metastasis free survival (DMFS), The length of time from initiation of treatment until distant-metastasis of melanoma or death., At 6-months, 12-months, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year; up to 5 years
Tumor PET response via [18F]F-AraG, \[18F\]F-AraG is an experimental PET imaging agent. Tumor PET response will be assessed via standard uptake values (SUV) measured as SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, and SUVtotal.The max, peak, mean and total values for each patient will be used to determine the average standard uptake values for the study population. The possible range of SUV values is between 0 - 100. Higher SUV correlates with greater malignancy., At Week 1 (baseline) and Week 5|Relapse-Free Survival (RFS), The length of time from initiation of treatment until melanoma relapse or death., At 6-months, 12-months, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year; up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), The length of (survival) time from the start of treatment until death from any cause., At 6-month, 12-months, 2-year, 3-year, 5-year; up to 5 years|Adverse Events at Least Possibly Related to Study Treatment, Toxicities defined by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 are adverse events classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded and the frequency of toxicities will be tabulated for the study population., Up to 5 years
CD8+ T cell density, The quantity of CD8 + T-cells that infiltrate tumors, measured via flow cytometry., Pre-treatment (Screening), at Week 3 of treatment; up to 21 days
This is a phase II pilot study designed to compare the pCR rate of two neoadjuvant immunotherapies in high-risk resectable melanoma with two integrated biomarkers. The integrated \[18F\]F-AraG imaging biomarker images activated CD8+ T cells. The CD8+ T cell density biomarker quantitates CD8+ T Cells using an automated method. The primary purpose of the study is to describe the correlation between pCR and the distribution of either biomarkers in patients receiving either neoadjuvant Vidutolimod (CMP-001)/nivolumab or neoadjuvant nivolumab.

Patients with stage IIIB-IIID cutaneous (or unknown primary) melanoma with palpable nodal disease who have yet to undergo definitive surgery are eligible to enroll. Patients with nodal relapse including those who have received prior adjuvant IFN and/or ipilimumab are eligible to enroll.

Suitable patients will be identified pre-operatively. Patients will undergo a 28 day screening evaluation including surgical assessment, clinical assessment, systemic/CNS staging scans, and laboratory studies to confirm suitability. Patients will undergo biopsies of both planned injected and uninjected lesions (Arm A) and target lesion (Arm B). Biopsies of these lesions will occur pre-treatment, at W3 or W4 and the target lesion(s) will be resected at the time of surgery.

Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive Arm A (neoadjuvant Nivolumab/(CMP) vs. Arm B (neoadjuvant Nivolumab) during the (Prime Phase) pre-operatively. Patients randomized to Arm A will receive: Nivolumab 240mg IV q2 x3 and CMP-001 5mg SC 1st dose then 10mg IT 2nd-7th doses (7 weeks). Patients randomized to Arm B will receive: Nivolumab 240mg IV q2 x3 (6 weeks).

\[18F\]F-AraG PET-CT scan (18-F PET) is an integrated biomarker and will be performed at 2 imaging time-points: pre-treatment (pre-W1) and on-treatment (W2). At each imaging timepoint, \[18F\]F-AraG will be administered by a licensed nuclear medicine technologist under the supervision of a nuclear medicine physician on an outpatient basis. Each patient will receive a single bolus injection of 5 mCi \[18F\]F-AraG IV into a hand or arm vein. At Screening and W2 imaging timepoints, following \[18F\]F-AraG injection, a 30-min static PET-CT scan will be performed covering the brain to the upper legs.

For CD8+ T cell density assessments, patients will undergo biopsies at 2 timepoints: pre-treatment (Screening) and on-treatment (W3 or W4). In Arm A, patients will undergo biopsies of planned injected and a 2nd uninjected lesion. At each imaging timepoint, biopsies will be performed.

Following the Prime Phase and restaging systemic scans, patients will undergo surgical resection.

Post-operatively, patients will continue to receive maintenance therapy (Boost Phase) per randomization. In the Boost Phase, patients randomized to Arm A (neoadjuvant Nivolumab/(CMP) will receive 480mg IV q4 x12 along with Vidutolimod (CMP-001) 5mg SC q4 x12 over a 48 week period; while patients randomized to Arm B (neoadjuvant Nivolumab) will receive Nivolumab (480mg IV q4 x12 over a 48 week period). In the post-operative period, CMP-001 will be administered subcutaneously (Arm A only).
