Study of Recombinant Human Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody in Patients With Advanced Tumours
This study is an open, multi-dose, dose escalation and cohort expansion, phase Ⅰ study to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficiency, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity of SG001 in subjects with advanced tumours.
Advanced Solid Tumours|Cervical Cancer|Malignant Mesothelioma|Lymphoma|Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SG001
Safety and tolerability of SG001 by assessing the percentage of participants who experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), To investigate the safety and tolerance profile tolerance profile of SG001 in subjects with advanced solid tumors, Phase Ⅰa: 21 days|Objective response rate (ORR) in solid tumor（The ORR of cohort B, C, and E will be evaluated by Independent Review Committee）., To investigate the efficiency of SG001 in subjects with advanced solid tumors, Phase Ⅰb: From date of first drug administration until the date of first documented progression of disease or the date of death or the date of lose to follow-up, which occurs first, assessed up to 2 years.|Safety of SG001 in patients with advanced tumors., To investigate the safety of SG001 in advanced tumors., Phase Ⅰb: From signing informed consent form (ICF) to 90 days after the last dose of study drug or initiation of a new therapy for cancer, which occurs first.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of SG001, such as Cmax, AUC, t1/2 tmax, Vss, CL (clearance rate) etc., The pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of SG001., Phase Ⅰa: At the end of cycle 7（every cycle is 14 days，except cycle 1 is 21 days）; Phase Ⅰb: At the end of cycle 13 （every cycle is 14 days）.|The ORR of cohort B, C, and E, which will be evaluated by investigators., The efficiency of SG001., From date of first drug administration until the date of first documented progression of disease （PD） or the date of death or the date of lose to follow-up, which occurs first, assessed up to 2 years.|The ORR of cohort D, which will be evaluated by Lugano criteria 2014., The efficiency of SG001., From date of first drug administration until the date of first documented progression of disease （PD） or the date of death or the date of lose to follow-up, which occurs first, assessed up to 2 years.|DOR (duration of response)., The efficiency of SG001., From the date of first documentation of confirmed CR（complete response）/PR（partial response） to the date of first documentation of PD or the date of death from any cause or the date of lose to follow-up, which occurs first, assessed up to 2 years.|DCR (disease control rate)., The efficiency of SG001., DCR is defined as the percentage of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, or SD（stable disease）, which will be assessed up to 2 years.|TTP (time to progression)., The efficiency of SG001., From the date of first drug administration to the date of first documentation of PD, assessed up to 2 years.|PFS (free-progression survival)., The efficiency of SG001., From date of first drug administration until the date of first documented progression of disease （PD） or the date of death, which occurs first, assessed up to 2 years.|OS (overall survival)., The efficiency of SG001., From date of first drug administration until the date of death, assessed up to 2 years.|Immunogenicity of SG001., The immune profile of SG001., From the first dose of study drug to 28 days after its last dose.|The activated T cell receptor occupancy., The pharmacodynamics of SG001., Phase Ⅰa: At the end of cycle 7（every cycle is 14 days，except cycle 1 is 21 days）; Phase Ⅰb: At the end of cycle 13 （every cycle is 14 days）.
Phase Ⅰa: open, multi-dose, dose escalation. Phase Ⅰb: open, fixed-dose, cohort expansion.
