Low-dose Radiotherapy Plus Chemotherapy With Gem-based Doublets and Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
Aim of this study is to evaluate if low-dose radiotherapy (LDR) can intensify local effect of a chemotherapy regimen with Gem-based doublets administered sequentially with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and to assess the safety and efficacy of this combined treatment on patients affected by locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma (LAPC).
Pancreatic Cancer
RADIATION: LDR|DRUG: Gem-based doublets|RADIATION: SBRT
Progression-free survival, defined as the time from the initiation of therapy to the time of first event (local, regional or distant progression or death due to any cause). Patients without any such event at the time of data analysis will be censored at the last date they were known to be event-free. Patients with no tumor assessments after baseline will be censored at day 1, 1 year
Toxicity(scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v4.0)), Acute gastrointestinal toxicity is defined as adverse events occurring \<3 months after SBRT; long-term toxicity was defined as those occurring after 3 months. Toxicity is scored according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v4.0), every 3 months, up to 1 year|Overall survival, defined as the time from the date of initiation of therapy to date of death due to any cause. Patients who is alive on the date of last follow-up were censored on that date, 1 year
