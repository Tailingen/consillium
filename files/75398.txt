Gene Abnormalities and Prognosis in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
to detect the translocation of c-Myc, Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 by FISH and 481 gene mutation by next generation sequencing and analyze the relationship between this gene abnormalities and the efficacy and prognosis in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

This is one arm, single center non-intervention study. New diagnosed diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients were enrolled to detect the translocation of c-Myc, Bcl-2 and Bcl-6 by FISH and 481 gene mutation by next generation sequencing, then patients received standard treatment with R-CHOP, R2CHOP and DA-EPOCH by investigate's choice according to the patients pathological characteristics. the basic characteristics and treatment response and progression-free survival and overall survival were collected and analyzed with the gene abnormalities. a total of 100 diffuse large B cell lymphoma patients will enrolled in one year and will finish after 3 years.
