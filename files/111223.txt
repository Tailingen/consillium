Cyclophosphamide, VELCADE, DOXIL, and Dexamethasone, (CVDD) in Newly Diagnosed Patients With Multiple Myeloma (MM)
Cyclophosphamide is a chemotherapy agent with known activity in myeloma. The new regimen that we will test in this study is called CVDD and contains Cyclophosphamide with Bortezomib (VELCADE), Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (DOXIL®, PLD), and Dexamethasone (VDD).

The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of another type of chemotherapy agent, Cyclophosphamide, to the regimen VDD (CVDD) is well tolerated and improves response rates in myeloma. We will also find the highest safe dose of the study drugs taken together that a patient can tolerate, and how long it takes for multiple myeloma patients to respond after they have taken the study drugs and how long the response lasts.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Bortezomib; Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin; Dexamethasone (VDD)
Phase I - Maximum Planned Dose (MPD) Level, Maximum Phase II planned dose of cyclophosphamide when given in combination with bortezomib, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and Dexamethasone (CVDD) in participants with newly diagnosed active multiple myeloma. Dose levels 1, 2, 3, 4 as outlined in Treatment Arm A.

If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was reported in the first 3 participants at a dose level, that dose level was to be considered safe and 3 participants would be enrolled at the next dose level. If 1/3 participants in a cohort at a dose level had dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the dose level would be expanded to obtain 6 evaluable participants. MPD reflects the highest dose of drug that did not cause a DLT in 33% of participants., 9 months|Phase II: Overall Response Rate (ORR), Best response to CVDD chemotherapy. Overall Response: Partial Response (PR) + Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) + Complete Response (CR). PR: ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 hour urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to \< 200 mg per 24 hours; VGPR: Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein with urine M-protein level \< 100 mg per 24 hours; CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and ≤ 5% plasma cells in bone marrow., Up to 6 months
Phase II: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival after CVDD in participants with newly diagnosed active multiple myeloma. PFS: time from the initiation of therapy to progression, relapse or death from any causes.

Progressive Disease (PD): Progressive Disease requires any one or more of the following:

Increase of ≥ 25% from baseline in:

* serum M-component and /or (the absolute increase must be ≥ 0.5 g/dL)
* urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg/24 h), Up to 50.9 months|Phase II: Two Year Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival by disease risk stratification after CVDD. OS: time from initiation of therapy until death from any cause., 2 years
The first cohort of 3 participants enrolled into Phase I of the study will receive dose level 1. A full safety evaluation will be conducted when these participants have completed one cycle (21 days) of combination therapy. Further patient accrual will be suspended while the safety data is evaluated at each dose level.

Dose escalation for subsequent patients will proceed through dose levels 2, 3 and 4 as follows:

* If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is reported in the first 3 participants at a dose level, that dose level will be considered safe and 3 participants will be enrolled at the next dose level. If 1/3 participants in a cohort at a dose level has a DLT, the dose level will be expanded to obtain 6 evaluable participants.
* If \> 1 of 3 participants in a cohort experience DLT, that dose level will not be considered safe. No further dose escalation will take place, and the immediate lower dose level will be considered the maximum planned dose (MPD) if 6 patients had been enrolled at that dose level. Otherwise, expand the immediate lower dose level to 6 evaluable patients\*.
* If there are \< 2 participants with a DLT among the expanded cohort of 6 evaluable participants, a cohort of 3 participants will be enrolled in the next higher dose level.
* If there are 2 or more participants with a DLT among the expanded cohort of 6 evaluable participants, that dose level will not be considered safe. No further dose escalation will take place, and the immediate lower dose level will be considered the MPD if 6 patients had been enrolled at that dose level. Otherwise, expand the immediate lower dose level to 6 evaluable patients\*.
* \* If DLT occurs in no more than 1 patient in the expanded dose cohort, then that dose level will be considered MPD. Otherwise, the dose will be further de-escalated in a similar fashion until the MPD is reached.
