Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Responses are according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by investigator, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, up to 2 years
Objective response rate(ORR), Defined as percentage of participants achieving assessed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) by the investigator according to the RECIST 1.1., from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, up to 2 years|Disease control rate(DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who have a confirmed complete response（CR） or partial response（PR） or stable disease（SD） per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by investigator, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, up to 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, up to 3 years|adverse events (AE), overall incidence of adverse events (AE); incidence of grade 3 or higher AE; incidence of severe adverse events (SAE); incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of drug use; incidence of AEs leading to suspension of drug use., from day 1 of first dosing to 30days after permanent discontinuation of fruquintinib
