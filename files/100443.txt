MCC-24-GYN-11: Comparison of Nodal Sampling in Endometrial Cancer
This study aims to estimate the recurrence-free survival rates in women with endometrial cancer treated with selective versus sentinel node surgical staging. This study will gather information to help determine the best way to evaluate lymph nodes during surgery for endometrial cancer.
Endometrial Cancer
PROCEDURE: Selective surgical staging|PROCEDURE: REFLEX
Recurrence free survival, Participants with no measurable disease from study entry until disease recurrence, death, or date of the last contact, up to 5 years
Concordance between selective surgical staging and final pathology Incidence, Percentage of participants for whom selective surgical staging and final pathology match, 5 years|Progression-free survival, period from study entry until disease progression, death, or date of the last contact, up to 5 years|Disease-specific Survival, period from study entry until death from the disease (endometrial cancer), up to 5 years|Overall patient survival rate, period from study entry until death from any cause, 5 years
Location patterns of nodal involvement associated with staging procedures, 5 years|Location patterns of nodal involvement associated with disease stage, 5 years|Patterns of nodal involvement associated with histological characteristics, 5 years
