A Phase II, Open-Label, Multicenter Trial of Cabazitaxel in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer After Failure Of Cisplatin, Cetuximab and Taxanes
This is a multi-center phase II study assessing whether cabazitaxel could be efficient for treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer after failure of cisplatin, cetuximab and taxanes.
Recurrent Head and Neck Cancer|Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Cabazitaxel
non-progression at 6 weeks, To assess the efficacy of cabazitaxel in terms of non-progression at 6 weeks for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer after failure of cisplatin, cetuximab and taxanes.

Non-progression will be assessed after centralized review of CT-scans., 6 weeks
progression free survival, 1-year|Toxicity according to NCI-CTCAE v4.0, from the first dose up to 30 days after the last dose|Quality of life evaluated by the QLQ-C30 and H&N35 questionnaire, at the inclusion, at 6 weeks and at the end of treatment
Patients will be treated with intravenous cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (D1=D22) for 6 cycles.

In absence of progression disease or unacceptable toxicity, the treatment could be continued until a maximum of 10 cycles.

Disease response will be assessed every 6 weeks (i.e. every 2 cycles) clinically and by CT-scan.

An interim analysis will be carried out after the inclusion of the first 10 eligible and assessable patients.
