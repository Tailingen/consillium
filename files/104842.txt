Liver Embolization Approaches for Tumor Management
The goal of this evaluate short, medium and long term outcome of the different embolization techniques in patients with primary and secondary hepatic tumors. The main aim is to evaluate progression free survival following embolization in this study population or evaluate residual hepatic volume in cases in which these techniques are used to induce liver regeneration. This study is an observational registry - all patients will follow their normal therapeutic and treatment scheme as per clinical practice, without any additional intervention.

PROCEDURE: Embolization
Progression free survival, Treatment Efficacy, Short term (3-6 months)|Progression free survival, From time of intervention up to 1 year (medium term)|Progression free survival, From time of intervention up to 5 years (Long term)|Residual hepatic volume, Treatment Efficacy, within 40 days of procedure
Overall survival, Overall survival, From date of procedure until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years
