Schedules of Nab-Paclitaxel in Metastatic Breast Cancer
Longer first line chemotherapy duration has recently been associated with a modest, but significant improvement in overall survival and a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival, in metastatic breast cancer patients. Prolonging chemotherapy until disease progression, however, must be weighed against the detrimental effects of continuous chemotherapy delivery. The SNAP trial seeks to improve the tolerability of prolonged chemotherapy administration strategy by studying alternative treatment schedules, while preserving and possibly improving treatment efficacy in this disease setting.

The availability of a new nanoparticle albumin-bound taxane, nab-Paclitaxel (Abraxane®), represents an opportunity to test this hypothesis. Nab-Paclitaxel has been developed in an attempt to reduce the toxicity associated with standard taxane administration (caused by the use of chemical solvents) while increasing antitumor efficacy.

The SNAP randomized phase II trial evaluates three schedules of nab-Paclitaxel as prolonged chemotherapy administration strategy. Each of three arms will be compared to a historical reference of seven-month median progression-free survival (PFS) based on the most recent trial with docetaxel as control arm to determine whether any of the three arms are worthy of further investigation.
Metastatic Breastcancer
DRUG: nab-Paclitaxel
Progression-free Survival, Time from randomization until objective disease progression \[progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions\] or death, whichever occurs first. For patients without progression, follow-up was censored at the date of last disease assessment without progression, unless death occurred within a short period of time (12 weeks) following the date last known progression-free, in which case the death was counted as a PFS event., Reported after 18.2 months median follow-up since randomization
Feasibility of Treatment: Number of Participants Completed Treatment According to the Protocol for at Least 24 Weeks, Whether or not the patient completed treatment according to the protocol for at least 24 weeks. Patients who progressed within 24 weeks were considered as not completing., Baseline to 24 weeks follow-up|Disease Control: Overall Response of Stable Disease for a Duration of ≥24 Weeks, Overall response of stable disease (or non-CR/non-PD for patients with non-measurable disease) for a duration of ≥24 weeks, or better (i.e., partial or complete response) according to RECIST criteria \[Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.\], From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 18 months|Best Overall Response, Best response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria \[assessed by MRI\] recorded from the start of treatment across all time points until end of study treatment. Confirmation of partial or complete response by an additional scan was not requested in this trial., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 18 months|Overall Survival, Time from randomization until death from any cause, or censored at date last known alive, Reported after 18.2 months median follow-up since randomization|Changes in Physical Well-being (Change From Day 1 of Cycle 4 to Day 1 of Cycle 6), Primary quality of life=physical well being; endpoint based on the GLQ 8. The indicator was in Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA) format ranging 0-100 (0=as bad as it can be, 100=as good as it can be)., Assessed from day 1 of cycle 4 through day 1 of cycle 12
