LIONS (PLK4 Inhibitor in Advanced Solid Tumors)
The primary objective of this study is to identify a safe and tolerated dose and schedule of the orally administered PLK4 inhibitor RP-1664. In addition, this study will examine the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of RP-1664 in advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: RP-1664
Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) as assessed per NCI CTCAE v5.0 criteria, From start of study intervention up to 90 days after last administration|Dose Limiting Toxicities to determine a maximum tolerated dose and schedule of RP-1664 based on safety and tolerability as measured by CTCAE v5.0, pharmacokinetic parameters, pharmacodynamic readouts and efficacy data per RECIST or INRC criteria, Maximum Tolerated Dose and Schedule of RP-1664 based on CTCAE v5.0 grade and frequency of DLTs
To assess the PK parameters of RP-1664 in the fed and fasted states by measurement of plasma concentrations of RP-1664 with calculation of maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)., Through Study Day 114|To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of RP-1664 in participants with molecularly selected advanced solid tumors treated at pharmacologically active dose ranges. Anti-tumor activity will be measured by ORR according to RECIST 1.1 and INRC., About 36 months
This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to:

Evaluate the safety profile and MTD of RP-1664 and establish a recommended dose and schedule for further clinical investigation, In addition, the study aims to characterize the PK, PD, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of orally administered RP-1664. Exploratory objectives include examination of biomarker responses in relationship to RP-1664 exposure.

After the recommended dose and schedule is determined, expansion cohorts with molecularly selected advanced solid tumors will be enrolled to preliminarily assess the anti-tumor effect, and further examine the safety and PK of RP-1664 at the RP2D.
