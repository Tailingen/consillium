Confocal Laserscanning Microscopy for Detection of Barretts Esophagus
Four quadrant biopsies in regular ranges is the goldstandard in monitoring this disease. The ideal situation for the endoscopist is to visualize cellular structures, which implies having microscopic imaging available. A potential candidate to fill this gap could be confocal fluorescence microscopy (Cellvizio®-GI and Mauna Kea Technologies). To compare the gold standard with the confocal fluorescence microscopy for detection of metaplastic - or intraepithelial neoplastic changes of barrett-suspicious esophageal mucosa this study has been initiated.
Barrett Esophagus
PROCEDURE: confocal laser microscopy
diagnostic accuracy of confocal laser scanning microscopy for detection of metaplasia or neoplasia in Barrett´s esophagus
inter- and intra observer variability for confocal laser scanning microscopy
