Everolimus, Bortezomib and/or Rituximab in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia
The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of the combination of everolimus, rituximab and bortezomib. Everolimus is a drug that works by preventing cells in your body from growing and dividing. Information from basic and other clinical research suggests that everolimus may also inhibit tumor growth in people with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. The FDA has approved everolimus for the treatment of multiple myeloma, a cancer that is closely related to Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. Rituximab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which included Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia.

Everolimus Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Stage A [Phase I], The MTD of Everolimus/Rituximab combination is determined by the number of patients who have dose limiting toxicity (DLT). See DLT primary outcome measure for definition. MTD is defined as the highest dose where \<1/3 participants experience a DLT. If no DLT's are observed on Level 1, 3 subjects will be enrolled in the Level 2. If \>1/3 subjects in a cohort have DLT, that dose will not be considered safe, with no escalation (MTD exceeded). If 1/3 subjects experience DLT, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If \<2 subjects with a DLT among the expanded cohort of 6 evaluable subjects a cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled in the next higher dose level. If 2 or more subjects with a DLT among the expanded cohort of 6 subjects, that dose level will not be considered safe, no escalation (MTD exceeded). If no DLT's are observed, then the MTD is not reached. The MTD was not reached with 0/3 participants experiencing a DLT in the highest dose level. Higher doses were not planned/tested., Assessed within the first cycle (28 days) of the study.|Everolimus Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Stage B [Phase I], The MTD of Everolimus/Bortezomib/Rituximab combination is determined by the number of patients who have dose limiting toxicity (DLT). See DLT primary outcome measure for definition. MTD is defined as the highest dose where \<1/3 participants experience a DLT. If no DLT's are observed on Level 1, 3 subjects will be enrolled in the Level 2. If \>1/3 subjects in a cohort have DLT, that dose will not be considered safe, with no escalation (MTD exceeded). If 1/3 subjects experience DLT, the cohort will be expanded to 6 subjects. If \<2 subjects with a DLT among the expanded cohort of 6 evaluable subjects a cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled in the next higher dose level. If 2 or more subjects with a DLT among the expanded cohort of 6 subjects, that dose level will not be considered safe, no escalation (MTD exceeded).If no DLT's observed, then the MTD is not reached. The MTD was not reached with 0/3 participants experiencing a DLT in the highest level. Higher doses were not planned/tested., Assessed within the first cycle (28 days) of the study.|Everolimus Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) [Phase I], The following qualify as dose limiting toxicities:

* Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity, considered by the investigator to be related to study drugs.

* Complete resolution of extramedullary disease, i.e., lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly if present at baseline
* No new signs/symptoms of active disease

PR:

* Monoclonal IgM protein is detectable ≥50% but \<90% reduction in IgM level from baseline

TTP is defined as time from enrollment to the date of progressive disease (PD). PD is defined as ≥25% increase in serum IgM level from lowest nadir and/or progression in clinical features attributable the disease. Patients without PD and not reporting use of non-protocol therapy prior to PD are censored at date of last objective progression-free disease assessment. Patients reporting use of non-protocol therapy prior to PD are censored at date of last objective progression-free disease assessment date prior to post-discontinuation therapy., Patients were assessed for disease every cycle while on treatment (168 days) and every three months while on maintenance therapy. In long-term follow-up, disease was monitored every 3 months. Study cohort median (range) follow-up was 15 (1 - 23) months.|2 Year Progression-free-survival [Phase II], 2-year progression free survival (PFS) is the probability of participants alive and progression free at 2 years from study entry estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. PFS is defined as the time from enrollment to progressive disease (PD) or death. PD is defined as ≥25% increase in serum IgM level from lowest nadir and/or progression in clinical features attributable the disease. Patients alive without PD and not reporting use of non-protocol therapy prior to PD are censored at date of last objective progression-free disease assessment. Patients reporting use of non-protocol therapy prior to PD are censored at date of last objective progression-free disease assessment date prior to post-discontinuation therapy., Patients were assessed for disease every cycle while on treatment (168 days) and every three months while on maintenance therapy. In long-term follow-up, disease was monitored every 3 months. Study cohort median (range) follow-up was 15 (1 - 23) months.|Phase II Duration of Response (DoR), The DoR is defined as the elapsed time from date when the measurement criteria are first met for a complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the date of first observation of objective disease progression. Analysis of DoR will be as follows:

* For responding patients who die without objective PD (including death from study disease), DoR will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment.
* For responding patients not known to have died as of the data cut-off date and who do not have objective PD, DoR will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment.
* For responding patients who receive subsequent systemic anticancer therapy (after discontinuation from the study chemotherapy) prior to objectively determined disease progression, DoR will be censored at the date of the last objective progression-free disease assessment prior to post discontinuation therapy., Patients were assessed for disease every cycle while on treatment (168 days) and every three months while on maintenance therapy. In long-term follow-up, disease was monitored every 3 months. Study cohort median (range) follow-up was 15 (1 - 23) months.|PTEN Mutation Rate [Phase II], The PTEN mutation rate is the percentage of patients with PTEN mutation identified in pre-therapy and post-therapy bone marrow samples per established methods., Samples were collected pre-therapy before the beginning therapy (baseline) and post-therapy after finishing the 6th treatment cycle (168 days).
Study Design

This is a phase I/II study. The phase I portion of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of everolimus, rituximab, and bortezomib combination, while the phase II portion will evaluate the depth of responses to the everolimus, rituximab, and bortezomib combination. If patients show response, they will continue on therapy for a total of 6 cycles, and then go on maintenance therapy with everolimus alone until progression. Patients on maintenance will be monitored every 3 months for response. Because of the potential of an IgM flare after rituximab, patients who show an increase in IgM after rituximab in the first 3 months will not be deemed as having progressive disease unless they show evidence of clinical progression and not just an increase of IgM levels. If biochemical progression is confirmed by m-spike, but the participant is clinically benefitting from therapy, the participant may continue on treatment for a few additional points of assessment and re-discuss benefit of therapy. Additionally, if the participant progressed because the treatment was held, participant may remain on study at the discretion of the overall Principal Investigator. Relapse from CR is defined by the reappearance of monoclonal IgM protein and/or recurrence of bone marrow involvement, lymphadenopathy/splenomegaly or symptoms attributable to active disease (Owen et al., 2012). Progression from PR is defined by ≥ 25% increase in IgM level from lowest recorded value and confirmed by a repeat assessment. The development of new signs and symptoms of disease, including Bing Neel syndrome and histological transformation, is also considered as evidence of disease progression. An absolute increase of at least 5 g/l is required to define progression when the IgM level is the only applicable criterion (Owen et al., 2012).
