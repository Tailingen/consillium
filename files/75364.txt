Dose Escalation Study of Talquetamab in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety of Talquetamab and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) and dosing schedule assessed to be safe for Talquetamab (Part 1 \[Dose Escalation\]) and to further characterize the safety of Talquetamab at the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2Ds) (Part 2 \[Dose Expansion\]).
Hematological Malignancies
DRUG: Talquetamab
Part 1: Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), The Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) are based on drug related adverse events and defined as any of the following events: hematological / non-hematological toxicity of Grade 3 or higher., Up to Day 28|Part 1 and Part 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., From signing of Informed Consent Form (ICF) up to follow up (until 100 days after the last dose of study drug or until the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, if earlier [approximately 2.10 years])
Part 1: Talquetamab Serum Concentrations, Serum concentrations will be calculated for Talquetamab., Up to 4 weeks|Part 1 and Part 2: Biomarker Assessment, Serum cytokine concentrations will be measured pre- and post-infusion of Talquetamab for biomarker assessment., Up to Cycle 7 Day 1 (each cycle of 21-days)|Part 1: Number of Participants with Talquetamab Antibodies, Antibodies to Talquetamab will be assessed to evaluate potential immunogenicity., Up to 4 weeks|Part 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a partial response (PR) or better according to the international myeloma working group (IMWG) criteria., Approximately 2.10 years|Part 2: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a minimal response (MR) or better according to the IMWG criteria., Approximately 2.10 years|Part 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as time from date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to date of first documented evidence of PD, per IMWG criteria., From the date of initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD) (approximately 2.10 years)|Part 2: Time to Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time between date of first dose of study drug and the first efficacy evaluation that the participant has met all criteria for PR or better., From the date of first dose of study drug to the date of initial documentation of a response (approximately 2.10 years)|Part 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from date of first dose of study drug to date of first documented PD, per IMWG criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Every 16 weeks until end of study, participant dies, withdrawn consent, or lost to follow up (up to 18 months)
