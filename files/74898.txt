An Investigational Immunotherapy Study of BMS-986310 Administered Alone and in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine if BMS-986310 administered in combination with nivolumab, will demonstrate adequate safety and tolerability, as well as a favorable risk/benefit profile, to support further clinical testing.
