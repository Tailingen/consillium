HR070803 in Combination With Oxaliplatin, 5-FU/LV Versus AG for First-line Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy and safety of HR070803 in combination with 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin (5FU/LV) plus oxaliplatin compared to nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine treatment in improving the overall survival of patients not previously treated for metastatic pancreatic cancer.
First-line Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: HR070803; Oxaliplatin; 5Fluorouracil; Calcium folinate|DRUG: nab-paclitaxel; gemcitabine
Overall survival (OS), From study start until 399 OS events have occurred (approximately 15 months after last patient enrollment)
Objective Response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), per RECIST 1.1., up to 6 months following the date the last patient was randomized|Disease Control Rate, The study is designed to evaluate the disease control rate with advanced pancreatic cancer. DCR is defined as the percentage of patients with a best response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD)., up to 6 months following the date the last patient was randomized|Duration of Response, DoR is defined as the time from first documentation of response (CR or PR whichever occurred first, as per RECIST version 1.1) to disease progression or death, whichever is earlier., up to 6 months following the date the last patient was randomized|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or date of death, whichever occurs first., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months
