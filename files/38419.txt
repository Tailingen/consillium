A Study of Nivolumab in Participants With Hepatocellular Carcinoma Who Are at High Risk of Recurrence After Curative Hepatic Resection or Ablation
This study will investigate if nivolumab will improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to placebo in participants with HCC who have undergone complete resection or have achieved a complete response after local ablation, and who are at high risk of recurrence
