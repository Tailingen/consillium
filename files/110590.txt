Therapeutic Vaccination for Patients With HPV16+ Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN2/3)
This study will test the efficacy and safety of different routes of administration of a DNA vaccine in patients with HPV16+ CIN2/3. Subjects will be enrolled in one of six treatment groups. Subjects enrolled in the first two groups will receive vaccination intradermally with a needle-free delivery device. Subjects enrolled in groups 3 and 4 will receive vaccination intramuscularly. Subjects enrolled in groups 5 and 6 will receive vaccine intralesionally.
HPV16 Positive|Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN 2/3)
BIOLOGICAL: DNA vaccination|DEVICE: Gene gun vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: intramuscular vaccination|BIOLOGICAL: intra-lesional vaccine administration|PROCEDURE: therapeutic resection of the lesion|DRUG: imiquimod
Number of Participants With Related Serious Adverse Events, Presence of intervention-related serious adverse events as defined by CTCAE, 9 months
Absence of CIN2/3 Lesion by Week 15, Number of participants with no CIN2/3 lesion at the week 15 visit, 15 weeks
Primary Objectives

* To evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of vaccination in women with CIN2/3 caused by HPV16
* To evaluate the effect of vaccination on histology
* To compare immunogenicity of three different routes of administration: intradermal (ID), intramuscular (IM), intralesional (IL).

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate changes in HPV viral load
* To evaluate the cellular immune response to vaccination
* To evaluate the humoral immune response to vaccination
* To evaluate local tissue immune response
* To correlate measures of immune response with clinical response
* To correlate measures of immune response with those observed in the preclinical model
