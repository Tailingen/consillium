Observational Study for the Evaluation of Incidence of Familial AML/MDSs in Patients With Myeloid Neoplasms
Observational study aimed at evaluating the incidence of familial AML/MDSs in patients with de novo MDSs or AML with almost one relative affected by hematologic neoplasms and/or other cancers at young age (\< 40 years)

Incidence of familial AML/MDSs, Evaluation of incidence of familial AML/MDSs in patients with de novo MDSs or AML with almost one relative affected by hematologic neoplasms and/or other cancers at young age (\< 40 years). The incidence of familial AML/MDSs will be evaluated by means of number of diagnosis of familial AML/MDSs on the number of all diagnosis of AML/MDS between January 2014 and December 2022., at 1 year
Hematological characteristics of familial AML/MDSs, Evaluation of hematological characteristics of patients with familial AML/MDS., at 1 year|Distribution of familial hematologic neoplasms and/or other cancers, Type and rate of familial hematologic neoplasms and/or other cancers, at 1 year|Incidence of transplantation, Outcome of transplant in patients with familial AML/MDS, at 1 year|Survival Distribution, Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS), at 1 year|Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), SMR to compare the survival risk in patients with familial AML/MDS with the risk in the Italian general population, at 1 year
This is a multicenter, retrospective and prospective, observational study aims to collect clinical information on patients with familial AML/MDSs from January 2014 to December 2022. No intervention is expected.

The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize the patients with familial MDSs or AML (i.e. with relatives affected by hematologic neoplasms and/or other cancers at young age (\< 40 years)) or presence of signs, symptoms or laboratory tests compatible with one of the known syndromes with germinal susceptibility to AML/MDSs.

In order to estimate the incidence of familial AML/MDSs, a survey will be sent every year to all participating sites to collect only the number of the all diagnosis of AML/MDS. All patients will be followed until December 2023 in order to have at least 1 year of observation.
