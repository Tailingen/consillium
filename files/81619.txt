Temporary Artery Clipping for Robotically-assisted Myomectomy, a Multicentric Randomized Controlled Trial
This study aims to investigate the efficacy of temporary clipping of the uterine artery and utero-ovarian ligament during robotically assisted myomectomy (RAM) for uterine fibroids. While RAM is increasingly used for myomectomy, bleeding control remains challenging. Temporary clipping of arteries has shown promise in conventional laparoscopy but has not been studied in RAM. This randomized controlled trial will assess primary endpoints such as estimated blood loss, need for transfusion, and hemoglobin drop, alongside secondary outcomes like complication rates and operation time.

PROCEDURE: Temporary clipping of the uterine arteries and the utero-ovarian ligmants.|PROCEDURE: No temporary clipping of the uterine arteries and the utero-ovarian ligmants.
Peri-operative blood loss: Estimated blood loss, Multiple primary endpoints will be used to asses the blood loss:

- Estimated blood loss \>500 mL, 1 week|Peri-operative blood loss: Hemoglobin drop perioperatively >2g/dL, Multiple primary endpoints will be used to asses the blood loss:

- Hemoglobin drop perioperatively \>2g/dL (difference between hemoglobin preoperatively and postoperatively), 1 day|Peri-operative blood loss: Need for peri-operative blood transfusion, Multiple primary endpoints will be used to asses the blood loss:

- Need for peri-operative blood transfusion, 1 week
Hospitalisation time, Number of postoperative nights the patient had to stay in the hospital., 6 weeks|Operation time in minutes, Total surgical time, from the completion of anesthesia induction untill the end of surgery (in minutes), 1 day|Number of patients with complications postoperatively, graded by Clavien Dindo classification, The Clavien Dindo classification is a validated tool to quantitatively assess postoperative complications.

Grade 0: No complications Grade 1: Any deviation from normal postoperative course, without requiring intervention Grade 2: Requiring pharmacological treatment Grade 3: Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention Grade 4: Life-treathening complication requiring intermediate or intensive care Grade 5: Death of a patient, 6 weeks|Number of patients requiring secondary hemostatic measures, Was there a need for non-routine hemostatic measures, such as:

* Tranexamic acid
* Misoprostol
* Oxytocin
* Embolisation
* Local application of sealant patch or glue (e.g TachoSil or Tisseel)
* Hysterectomy, 1 day
Uterine fibroids, also known as myomas or leiomyomas, are benign smooth muscle neoplasms of the uterus. Uterine fibroids are the most common neoplasms affecting women of reproductive age (up to 70-80% at the age of 50)(1). As fibroids grow, they may induce clinical problems such as menorrhagia, abdominal pain, or infertility.(2,3) Removal of uterine fibroids (myomectomy) is a gynaecological surgical procedure performed most frequently through laparotomy or minimally invasive surgery such as conventional laparoscopic or robotically assisted surgery. Because of the straight-stick instruments with limited degree of freedom, the excision and suturing of the myoma can be rather cumbersome, not in the least because myomectomies may be associated with relatively profuse peri-operative bloodloss. Owing to its enhanced 3D vision and wristed instruments, robotically assisted surgery may be a more suitable surgical technique, especially in the case of multiple myomas, large myomas or posterior localization. Consequently, in recent years a gradual shift has been seen to the use of robotically assisted myomectomies.

However, control of the bleeding during a myomectomy can be a challenge, even in the hands of an experienced robotic surgeon. Various strategies have been developed to combat this scenario; including rectal or IV misoprostol, intramyometrial injection of bupivacaine with epinephrine or vasopressin, , tranexaminic acid IV or various ligation strategies. There is moderate quality evidence for some of these interventions. Recently, the use of clips to temporary occlude the uterine artery for myomectomy with conventional laparoscopy for prevention of blood loss was validated in several studies, including 2 randomized controlled trials. To enhance hemostasis, recent articles described a technique to temporary clip both the uterine artery and infundibulopelvic artery with conventional laparoscopy, also resulting in fewer intra-operative bleeding compared to no artery clipping. The possible benefit of these ligation technique has never been studied in the setting of robotically-assisted myomectomies. On the one hand, RAM may involve more complex cases due to myoma size, localization or multiple myomas, and on the other hand, bleeding control may also be better with robotic surgery. This makes a prediction of the usefulness of this technique difficult, in terms of reducing blood loss.

Estimated blood loss remains a difficult outcome to reliably quantify, especially when using only visual parameters. During RAM, often only suction is used, making the estimation easier in comparison to open surgery, for which a variety of compresses and suction is used. This study will work with multiple primary endpoints, combining estimated blood loss over 500 mL, the need for a peri-operative blood transfusion or a hemoglobin drop exceeding 2 g/dL.

Other secondary outcomes will include complication rate, the operation time, postoperative pain and the need for additional hemostatic measures. In the literature, the risk of changes in ovarian reserve is also investigated, however it proved not significant and this was only a theoretical risk in the context of temporary clipping the infundibulopelvic artery, which is the main blood supply of the ovary. In this study, which will involve temporary clipping the utero-ovarian ligmant, there is no risk for a decrease in ovarian reserve.
