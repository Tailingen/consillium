DETECT III - A Multicenter, Phase III Study to Compare Standard Therapy +/- Lapatinib in HER2-ve MBC-Patients With HER2+ve CTCs
The HER2 status in breast cancer patients may change during the course of the disease. In 30% of initially HER2-negative patients with circulating tumor cells (CTC), HER2-positive CTCs can be detected in peripheral blood samples(1). At present, it is unclear if therapy based on the HER2 status of CTC offers a clinical benefit for these patients. The DETECT III - trial compares lapatinib, as HER2-targeted therapy in combination with standard therapy versus standard therapy alone in those patients, with initially HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and HER2-positive circulating tumor cells.

As one of the first interventional trials based on the assessment of CTC phenotypes, the DETECT III - trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapy in patients with MBC and HER2-positive CTCs as well as the significance of CTC as an early predictive marker for treatment response.
