Monitoring and Predicting Chemotherapy Response Using DOSI
RATIONALE: New imaging procedures, such as diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging, may help measure a patient's response and allow doctors to plan better treatment.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging in monitoring and predicting response in patients with locally advanced breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy before surgery.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: DOSI
Accuracy of %Change in TOI Between Baseline and Mid-therapy to Predict Pathologic Response (pCR +/-), This measure will look at the Accuracy of % change in DOSI measured Tumor Optical Index (TOI) from baseline to mid therapy to predict pathologic response (pCR+ v pCR-) Pathologic response (dichotomized into responders (pCR+) and non-responders (pCR-) based pathologic assessment) will be used as the reference standard and Accuracy will be determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine the ROC Area Under the Curve (AUC)., From baseline to mid-therapy
%Change in TOI Between Baseline and Mid-therapy to Predict pCR+; Stratified by Progesterone Receptor (PR) Status (Positive, Negative, Unknown ), Pathologic Complete response vs Non-Complete response, by PR status Progesterone Receptor Status (positive, negative, unknown ) is determined at pathological assessment of the tumor sample.

%change in TOI is evaluated from baseline to mid-therapy., baseline to mid-therapy|Accuracy of %Change in TOI Between Baseline and Mid-therapy to Predict pCR+; Stratified by Oxygen Saturation (St02), subset analysis, subjects were stratified using the median tumor StO2

%change TOI Between Baseline and Mid-therapy dichotomized at -40% stratified by the set evaluable subjects with baseline tumor StO2 dichotomized at 76.9%. (i.e. population median).

Accuracy will be determined using ROC analysis to determine the ROC Area Under the Curve (AUC)., baseline to mid-therapy|Estimate the Optimal Cutpoint for %Change in TOI From Baseline to Mid-therapy to Predict pCR, Determine the optimal cutpoint (aka Youden-index) for %Change in TOI ratio (T/N) to maximize sensitivity and specificity in the predication of pCR, baseline to mid-therapy
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine whether the percentage change in the diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging (DOSI) measurement of the tumor/normal (T/N) tissue optical index (TOI) from baseline to mid-therapy is predictive of the final pathologic response of the primary tumor in patients with locally advanced breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Secondary

* To investigate whether change of TOI measurements from baseline to post-therapy are predictive of the final pathologic response in these patients treated with this regimen.
* To investigate whether baseline TOI measurements are associated with final pathologic response in patients treated with this regimen.
* To investigate whether TOI measurements at baseline, change from baseline to mid-therapy, and change from baseline to post-therapy correlate with available MRI volumetric imaging measurements.
* To investigate whether changes on TOI measurements from baseline to mid-therapy, and from baseline to post-therapy, correlate with other standard-of-care imaging and/or any MRI-imaging measurements.
* To explore whether additional optical endpoints and indices obtained during DOSI measurements can be used to predict final pathologic response in patients treated with this regimen.
* To determine a cutpoint for the percent change of TOI from baseline to mid-therapy that is predictive of pathological complete response in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients undergo diffuse optical spectroscopy imaging (DOSI) at baseline, 5-10 days after initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, during early- and mid-neoadjuvant therapy, and within 21 days after completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Results are compared to standard-of-care imaging (e.g., MRI, ultrasound, mammography). Patients then undergo surgery.
