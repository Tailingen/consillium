Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation Therapy Combined With Immunotherapy for MSS Ultra-low Rectal Cancer
At present, there are no relevant studies or reports on the effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy combined with immunotherapy for MSS ultra-low rectal cancer. Studied in this paper combin neoadjuvant chemoradiation with immune therapy, carry out "Multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy combined with immunotherapy for MSS ultra-low rectal cancer" in order to provide a high-level evidence-based medical evidence for ultra-low rectal cancer treatment and improve ultra-low rectal cancer diagnosis and treatment effect.
