This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 2 study of BBI608 administered in combination with either cetuximab, or panitumumab, or capecitabine. A cycle will consist of daily and continuous oral administration of BBI608 for four weeks in combination with either cetuximab, or panitumumab, or capecitabine.
