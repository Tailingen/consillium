POWER UP: Participating Online While Exercising to Recover Using Play
We will conduct a two-phase study. The first phase is to adapt and develop an active video game (AVG)-centered lifestyle physical activity (PA) intervention (POWER UP) for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with central nervous system tumors. The second phase is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week virtually delivered, group-based active video game-centered lifestyle physical activity intervention on function and quality of life in AYAs (aged 15-39) who are â‰¤1-year post-surgery for a central nervous system tumor. This population is at very high-risk for steep functional decline.

Quality of Life Questionnaire, PROMIS 29 includes the following domains

* Physical Function (5=without any difficulty, 1=unable to do)
* Anxiety (5=always, 1=never)
* Depression (5=always, 1=never)
* Fatigue (5=very much, 1=not at all)
* Sleep Disturbance (5=very poor, 1=very good)
* Ability to participate in Social Roles and Activities(5=never, 1=always)
* Pain Interference (5=very much, 1=not at all)
* Pain Intensity (10=worst pain imaginable, 0=no pain), through study completion, an average of 1 year
Objective:

To develop (Aim 1) and test (Aim2, Primary Objective) the feasibility and acceptability of a virtually delivered, group-based active video game-centered lifestyle physical activity intervention targeting affect to improve function and quality of life in insufficiently active AYAs with central nervous system tumors. Also, (Aim 2, Secondary Objective) in a pilot randomized trial, compare the physical function, quality of live, and physical activity level between intervention and control groups.

Primary: Feasibility and acceptability of the POWER UP intervention and assessments.

Secondary: Physical function, quality of life (QOL), symptoms, and PA levels as measured at the 12- and 24-week follow ups

. Other endpoints relevant to the primary and secondary objectives: BMI status, dietary intake, Fitbit data (days worn and steps), exercise motivation, basic psychological needs at the 12- and 24-week follow-ups
