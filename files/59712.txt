Pilot Study of Biomarkers of Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade in Metastatic Melanoma
This study uses molecular imaging and novel immune monitoring to identify a biomarker of response for melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Prior to treatment, FDG and FLT PET/CT will be obtained, together with blood and tumor biopsies from each patient. A follow-up FDG and FLT PET/CT will be obtained, together with blood and tumor biopsies, 10-12 weeks after starting treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody. Additional tumor biopsies and blood samples for immune monitoring will be obtained 4-6 weeks after starting treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody as well as 16-18 weeks after starting anti-PD-1 treatment for patients still receiving anti-PD-1 antibody at that time.

Correlation of baseline of response and antitumor response, To correlate baseline and post-treatment molecular imaging biomarkers of response to immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 with antitumor response based on analysis of the FDG-to-FLT PET/CT ratio in melanoma patients, Anticipated at one-year after last patient enrolled, around Sept 2019
Correlation of in vivo clonally amplified T cells to FDG PET uptake in melanoma tumors, To correlate in vivo clonally amplified T cells in blood that traffic to tumor to FDG PET uptake in melanoma tumors following treatment with anti-PD-1, Anticipated at one-year after last patient enrolled, around Sept 2019|To correlate histologic and molecular markers of antitumor response to FLT PET uptake in melanoma tumors following treatment with anti-PD-1, To correlate histologic and molecular markers of antitumor response to FLT PET uptake in melanoma tumors following treatment with anti-PD-1, Anticipated at one-year after last patient enrolled, around Sept 2019
