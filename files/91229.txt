Clinical Trial of Standard Versus Goal-Directed Perioperative Fluid Management (GDT) for Patients Undergoing Liver Resection
The purpose of this study is to help us learn what is the best amount of fluid to administer to patients during liver surgery. Patients will receive either an amount for this surgery based on weight, blood pressure, heart rate and urine output or an amount guided by a computerized system (FloTrac) that helps doctors know how much fluid each patient needs. The FloTrac calculates the amount of fluid patients needs on a minute-to-minute basis, based on real time information like blood pressure, pulse and the ability of the heart and blood vessels to maintain normal vital signs.
Liver Cancer
PROCEDURE: Standard fluid management|DEVICE: Goal directed fluid therapy with the Edwards EV1000 system
Postoperative Complications, The incidence of overall 30-day postoperative complications will be recorded. These are defined in the MSKCC Adverse Events Program and organized by categories reflecting organ systems and further subdivided into specific complications within those and graded., 30 days post procedure
Low Cardiac Output Time, Assess the impact of GDT compared to standard fluid therapy on the total time patients experience low cardiac output perioperatively, Up to the first 24 postoperative hours|Total Volume of Fluid Used Perioperatively, Assess the impact of GDT compared to standard fluid therapy on the total volume of fluid given intraoperatively, Up to the first 72 hours postoperatively|Total Volume of Fluid Used Postoperatively, Postoperative fluid volume, Postoperatively for the total admission time, up to 8 days|Postoperative Length of Stay, Assess the impact of GDT compared to standard fluid therapy on net fluid balance for the total admission time, Postoperatively for the total admission time, up to 8 days
