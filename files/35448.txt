Effect of Sarcopenia on Hepatocellular Carcinoma(HCC) After Systemic Therapies
Sarcopenia is associated with the prognosis of HCC and cholangiocarcinoma. But there has been rare study focusing on the effect of sarcopenia on the prognosis of HCC treated with systemic therapy, such as interventional therapy, targeted therapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy and so on.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Sarcopenia
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Diagnostic Test: gait speed; ct scan; grip strength and chair stand test
complications, The complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, such as hypertension, fever, abdominal pain and so on., 3 months|overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from initiation of lenvatinib to death for any reason., 2 years|progression free survival, Progression free survival was defined as the time from initiation of lenvatinib to first progression or death., 2 years
Hospital stay, The time that patients spent in the hospital was recorded., 3 months|Hospital cost, Hospital cost that patients spent was recorded., 3 months
By tracking the short-term and long-term results of HCC patients treated with systemic therapy,the difference of short-term results between patients with sarcopenia and patients without sarcopenia was analyzed, and the correlation between sarcopenia and short-term and long-term results of patients after systemic treatments was explored, so as to improve people's awareness of sarcopenia and pay attention to its prevention and treatment.All implementation details are based on the newest EuropeanWorking Group on Sarcopenia in Older People(EWGSOP) definition. The investigators consecutively admitted patients the questionnaire and evaluated the assessment of muscle strength (grip strength test and chair stand test), muscle quantity (L3 plane total skeletal muscle area) and physical performance (gait test) following the F-A-C-S approach, to confirm patients with sarcopenia accurately. And by tracking the short-term and long-term outcomes, the differences were analyzed and the relationship between sarcopenia and prognosis of systemic treatments was explored.
