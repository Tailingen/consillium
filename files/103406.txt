Safety, Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Tomivosertib Combined With Paclitaxel in Advanced Breast Cancer
This is a multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of tomivosertib in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC) of any subtype.

The trial will enroll up to 45 patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0, 1, or 2 with any breast cancer (BC) subtype and at least one measurable lesion, for whom standard-of-care treatments are ineffective, not tolerated or were refused.

All patients will be initially treated with tomivosertib for 14 days (referred as the run-in period). Once treatment samples are obtained, weekly paclitaxel will be added to the treatment regimen.

Tumor assessments will be done at screening and then periodically throughout trial treatment. Patients will continue to receive trial treatment until progressive disease, as defined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, intolerable trial-treatment-related toxicity, consent withdrawal, or other criteria is met (defined within the trial protocol).
Breast Cancer
DRUG: tomivosertib|DRUG: paclitaxel
Number of Patients with Adverse Events (AEs), The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of non-serious and serious AEs. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities will be used to code all AEs to a system organ class and a preferred term. Incidence of AEs will be tabulated by system organ class, preferred term and toxicity grade. Each of these outputs will include for each AE, system organ class and preferred term as reported by the Investigator based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE). Detailed listings for all adverse events will also be provided., Every serious adverse event (SAE) and related AE, following informed consent and at least until the '30-day safety follow-up' visit, will be assessed. All AEs during treatment will also be included.|Change from Baseline Pharmacodynamic Effects (PD) Following 14 Days of Tomivosertib Monotherapy, The PD evaluations to be performed will include endpoints related to both direct anti-neoplastic and immunomodulatory actions of the drug. A patient will be considered to have a response if one or more of the PD endpoints (listed in the lab manual) differ between baseline and on-study. The PD response rate will be calculated as the percentage of the patients in the PD Population for whom a PD response is observed., All enrolled patients will undergo the sampling for PD assessments during screening and after 14 days (± 2 days) of tomivosertib monotherapy.
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a complete response or partial response according to RECIST v.1.1, based on the Investigator's assessment., Tumor assessments used to determine ORR will be conducted at screening and every 8 ± 2 weeks from the enrollment date for 12 months, then every 12 ± 2 weeks, until progressive disease, consent withdrawal, or death.|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of patients who have a complete response or partial response or stable disease according to RECIST v.1.1, based on the Investigator's assessment., Tumor assessments used to determine CBR will be conducted at screening and every 8 ± 2 weeks from the enrollment date for 12 months, then every 12 ± 2 weeks, until progressive disease, consent withdrawal, or death.|Pharmacokinetic Effects (PK), Plasma concentrations of tomivosertib and paclitaxel will be determined using validated liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry assays. Plasma concentrations will be summarized by scheduled time point with descriptive statistics, which will include the n, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (%), median, minimum, and maximum., All patients from Group 1 and 5-8 patients from Group 2 will be considered as the PK subset. Plasma samples will be obtained at the pre-determined time points during cycle 2 - days 1 and 2. Following cycle 1, treatment cycles are 28 days.
