CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy for GD2 Positive Glioma Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with GD2 positive glioma patients.
Glioma of Brain|CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy
BIOLOGICAL: GD2 CAR-T immunotherapy
Classification of adverse reactions, To observe the common 1-4 levels of side effects, 3 months
Progression free survival （PFS）of patients, PFS was defined as the interval between treatment initiation and local relapse, distant metastasis, or death, whichever occurred first., 1 year
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a recombinant receptor with both antigen-binding and T cell activating functions. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell Immunotherapy has more advantages compared with conventional immunotherapy, especially in dealing with patients of hematologic malignancies and solid malignant tumors.This study design a novel specific Chimeric antigen receptor aiming at GD2 antigen.After CAR-T cell infusion,At periodic intervals, the investigators will evaluate clinical symptoms Improved conditions of this disease.Through this study,the investigators will evaluate the safty and effectiveness of CAR-T cell immunotherapy in treating with GD2 positive glioma patients.
