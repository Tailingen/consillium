Phase I/II Study of Avelumab in Pediatric Cancer Participants
This is a multi-center, open-label, international study to evaluate the dose, safety and tolerability, antitumor activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of avelumab in pediatric subjects 0 to less than 18 years of age with refractory or relapsed malignant solid tumors (including central nervous system tumors) and lymphoma for which no standard therapy is available or for which the subject is not eligible for the existing therapy.

The study was planned to be conducted in 2 parts: the dose-finding part (Phase I) and the tumor-specified expansion part (Phase II). However, Phase II was cancelled due to limited clinical benefit of PD-L1 monotherapy in pediatric participants.
Refractory or Relapsed Solid Tumors|Lymphoma
DRUG: Avelumab|DRUG: Avelumab
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) as Per Severity With Grade 3 or Higher According to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE v4.03), Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have causal relationship with treatment. A serious AE was defined as an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged in participant hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs were those events with onset dates occurring during the on-treatment period for the first time, or if the worsening of an event was during the on-treatment period. TEAEs included both serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs. Severity of grade 3 or higher TEAEs were graded using NCI-CTCAE v4.03 toxicity grades, as follows: Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe; Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death. Number of participants with TEAEs as per severity with Grade 3 and higher were reported., Baseline up to 1182 days|Number of Participants Who Experienced Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), For the purpose of dose finding, any of the following AEs occurring during the primary DLT observation period.

PD: At least a 20 % increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PFS was measured using Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates., Time from first administration of study drug until the first documentation of PD or death, assessed up to 1182 days|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival was defined as the time from date of first dose of study drug to the date of death due to any cause.
