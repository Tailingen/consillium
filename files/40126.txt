Trial of Idelalisib in Patients With Relapsed Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
Based on the high response rate in heavily pretreated patients with indolent B-cell lymphomas, among which it is likely that many have undetected transformed disease, the investigators hypothesize that idelalisib may also be active in relapsed DLBCL, particularly of the GCB subtype. Possibly, the efficacy may be related to the presence of specific mutations within the B-cell receptor pathway.
