Chiauranib , which simultaneously targets against VEGFR/Aurora B/CSF-1R, several key kinases involved in tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell mitosis, and chronic inflammatory microenvironment.

Chiauranib is a novel orally active multi-target inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the angiogenesis-related kinases (VEGFR2, VEGFR1, VEGFR3, PDGFRa and c-Kit), mitosis-related kinase Aurora B and chronic inflammationrelated kinase CSF-1R in a high potency manner with the IC50 at a single-digit nanomolar range. In particular, Chiauranib showed very high selectivity in the kinase inhibition profile with little activity on off-target non-receptor kinases, proteins, GPCR and ion channels, indicative of a better drug safety profile in terms of clinical relevance.

This trial is a material balance study of \[14C\]Chiauranib in participants with small cell lung cancer, with the goal of learning more about the drug's absorption, metabolism, and excretion in the human body, as well as monitoring the subjects' safety after treatment. Chiauranib's scientific foundation for future progress.
