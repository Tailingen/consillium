To Examine the Effects of Axitinib Dose Reduction and Interruption for Adverse Event Management Among Patients Receiving Axitinib in for the Treatment of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
To assess how dose reductions or treatment interruptions related to axitinib can be implemented to manage and resolve adverse events occurring among patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma treated with first-line axitinib in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Axitinib|DRUG: Avelumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Number of Participants With Different Type of Adverse Events, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study medication without regard to possibility of causal relationship to it.Index date was defined as the initiation of first-line axitinib (used in combination with IO therapy) on or after May 2019, which marked FDA approval of axitinib in combination with avelumab for first-line advanced RCC treatment. Observation period was time from index date to the earliest of initiation of a second line therapy, death, loss to follow-up, or date of chart abstraction. Data, index date, and observation period were on the basis of data extracted from medical charts of participants., Observation period of maximum up to 7.1 months; duration of this retrospective study was approximately 1.5 months|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events, AE was considered serious when it: resulted in death, life-threatening, requires in-participant hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Index date was defined as the initiation of first-line axitinib (used in combination with IO therapy) on or after May 2019, which marked FDA approval of axitinib in combination with avelumab for first-line advanced RCC treatment. Observation period was time from index date to the earliest of initiation of a second line therapy, death, loss to follow-up, or date of chart abstraction. Data, index date, and observation period were on the basis of data extracted from medical charts of participants., 6 months|Duration From Treatment Initiation to Onset of Adverse Events, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study medication without regard to possibility of causal relationship to it. In this outcome measure time from index date to occurrence of incidence of any AE is reported. Index date was defined as the initiation of first-line axitinib (used in combination with IO therapy) on or after May 2019, which marked FDA approval of axitinib in combination with avelumab for first-line advanced RCC treatment. Observation period was time from index date to the earliest of initiation of a second line therapy, death, loss to follow-up, or date of chart abstraction. Data, index date, and observation period were on the basis of data extracted from medical charts of participants., Observation period of maximum up to 7.1 months; duration of this retrospective study was approximately 1.5 months|Duration of Adverse Events From Onset to Resolution, The time to resolution from AE onset and from initiation of management strategy was calculated for all AEs experienced including repeated AEs. The time to resolution of AE (from the onset of AE and from the initiation of management strategies) was separately estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis; median time to event will be reported. Index date was defined as the initiation of first-line axitinib (used in combination with IO therapy) on or after May 2019, which marked FDA approval of axitinib in combination with avelumab for first-line advanced RCC treatment. Observation period was time from index date to the earliest of initiation of a second line therapy, death, loss to follow-up, or date of chart abstraction. Data, index date, and observation period were on the basis of data extracted from medical charts of participants., Observation period of maximum up to 7.1 months; duration of this retrospective study was approximately 1.5 months|Number of Adverse Events Classified According to Type of Management Strategy, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship with the study treatment. Index date was defined as the initiation of first-line axitinib (used in combination with IO therapy) on or after May 2019, which marked FDA approval of axitinib in combination with avelumab for first-line advanced RCC treatment. Observation period was time from index date to the earliest of initiation of a second line therapy, death, loss to follow-up, or date of chart abstraction. Data, index date, and observation period were on the basis of data extracted from medical charts of participants., Observation period of maximum up to 7.1 months; duration of this retrospective study was approximately 1.5 months|Duration of Treatment Interruption for Axitinib, Duration of treatment interruption was calculated as the total days of treatment interruption. Index date was defined as the initiation of first-line axitinib (used in combination with IO therapy) on or after May 2019, which marked FDA approval of axitinib in combination with avelumab for first-line advanced RCC treatment. Observation period was time from index date to the earliest of initiation of a second line therapy, death, loss to follow-up, or date of chart abstraction. Data, index date, and observation period were on the basis of data extracted from medical charts of participants., Observation period of maximum up to 7.1 months; duration of this retrospective study was approximately 1.5 month|Maximum Axitinib Dose Reduction, Maximum axitinib dose reduction was calculated as the difference between axitinib dose at AE onset and the minimum axitinib dose recorded between the date of AE onset and either the date of AE resolution (if the AE had a reported resolution date) or the end of follow up (if the AE did not have a reported resolution date).Index date was defined as the initiation of first-line axitinib (used in combination with IO therapy) on or after May 2019, which marked FDA approval of axitinib in combination with avelumab for first-line advanced RCC treatment. Observation period was time from index date to the earliest of initiation of a second line therapy, death, loss to follow-up, or date of chart abstraction. Data, index date, and observation period were on the basis of data extracted from medical charts of participants., Observation period of maximum up to 7.1 months; duration of this retrospective study was approximately 1.5 months
The specific objectives of the study are as follows:

Describe incident adverse events (AEs) experienced among patients with advanced RCC who received first-line axitinib in combination with immuno-oncology (IO) therapies.

* Type and seriousness of AEs (ie, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, nausea, palmar plantar erythrodysesthesia \[hand-foot syndrome\]).
* Proportion of patients who experienced repeated AEs.
* Time from treatment initiation to AE onset, overall and by type and seriousness of AEs.

Among patients with advanced RCC who developed incident AEs while receiving first line axitinib in combination with IO therapies, characterize and describe management strategies for AEs, stratified by type and seriousness of AEs.

* Proportion of patients who used each of the following management strategies:
* No action for axitinib and IO therapy;
* No action for axitinib, but treatment modification for IO therapy (ie, treatment interruption, treatment discontinuation);
* Axitinib dose reduction, but no action for IO therapy;
* Axitinib treatment interruption, but no action for IO therapy;
* Axitinib treatment discontinuation, but no action for IO therapy;
* Axitinib dose reduction, and treatment modification for IO therapy;
* Axitinib treatment interruption, and treatment modification for IO therapy;
* Axitinib treatment discontinuation, and treatment modification for IO therapy.
* Average axitinib dose reduction (absolute and percentage change), where applicable.
* Duration of treatment interruption, where applicable.

Assess the frequency of and time to AE resolution (from AE onset and initiation of management strategy, separately) among patients with advanced RCC who developed incident AEs while receiving first-line axitinib in combination with IO therapies according to different management strategies implemented, stratified further by type and seriousness of AEs, as allowed by sample size.

The above objectives will also be conducted for repeated AEs of the same type
