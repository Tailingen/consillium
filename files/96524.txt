A Phase I Study of LEE011 in Asian Patients
This study will evaluate safety and tolerability to estimate the MTD and/or recommended dose for expansion.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: LEE011
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), First cycle (28 days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recomended dose (RD), First cycle (28 days)
Safety and Tolerability of LEE011, Assessed by incidence, duration and severity of adverse events and serious adverse events; changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs and ECGs; tolerability of study drug (dose interruption, dose reduction), from informed consent till 28 days after end of treatment|PK parameters of LEE011, Concentration of LEE011 and PK parameters (e.g. Cmax and AUC), every week up to first 4 weeks, once a week in the subsequent 2 weeks|Best overall response, To assess preliminaly anti-tumor activity based on RECIST, every 2 months until 28 days after end of treatment|Overall response rate, To assess preliminaly anti-tumor activity based on RECIST, every 2 months until 28 days after end of treatment|Progression-free survival, To assess preliminaly anti-tumor activity based on RECIST, every 2 months until 28 days after end of treatment|Disease control rate, To assess preliminaly anti-tumor activity based on RECIST, every 2 months until 28 days after end of treatment|Duration of response, To assess preliminaly anti-tumor activity based on RECIST, every 2 months until 28 days after end of treatment|Overall response, To assess preliminaly anti-tumor activity based on RECIST, every 2 months until 28 days after end of treatment
This is a multi-center, open label, dose finding, phase I study of oral single agent LEE011, administered once daily.
