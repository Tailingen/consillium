Japanese BAY80-6946 Monotherapy Phase I Study
This study will be conducted as an open label, single centre, Phase I study of PI3K (phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase) inhibitor BAY80-6946 in Japanese patients with advanced or refractory solid tumours. The eligible subjects will be dosed intravenously at Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 with three weeks on and one week off in each treatment cycle.
