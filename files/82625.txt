A Phase 1/2, Study of YL-15293 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors With a KRAS G12C Mutation
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated, safety, tolerability and PK of oral YY-15293 in patients with advanced solid tumors with a KRAS G12C mutation, to confirm the recommended phase 2 dose of YY-15293, and to obtain preliminary efficacy information in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a KRAS G12C mutation.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: YL-15293
The overall response rate (ORR), The overall response rate (ORR) will be estimated based on the proportion of evaluable patients whose overall response (ORR) during study treatment is CR or PR. Disease response will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1., Throughout the study for approximately 2 years
Progression free survival, PFS, PFS, defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to first, Throughout the study for approximately 2 years|Overall survival, OS, The time from randomization to death for any reason, Throughout the study for approximately 2 years|Disease control rate, DCR, The percentage of cases with remission (PR+CR) and stable lesions (SD) after treatment, Throughout the study for approximately 2 years
The study will be conducted in the United States of America (USA) and China to provide safety, efficacy and PK data from these regions. A dose escalation part 1 will be conducted to determine the MTD, DLT's, and part 2 will confirm the safety/tolerability of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), of YL-15293 given once daily, in patients with advanced NSCLC to obtain preliminary efficacy information. PK samplings at Cycle 1, Day 1 and at steady-state conditions (Cycle 1, Day 28) will be performed. PD evaluations will occur at cycle 1 and cycle 2.
