MRD/Risk-oriented Therapy of Adult Ph- ALL Including Pegylated Asparaginase and Lineage-targeted Methotrexate
This study will be conducted in different centres and will study adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The study treatment will include a induction/consolidation therapy incorporating pegylated Asparaginase (Peg-ASP) and lineage-targeted high-dose methotrexate plus other antileukemic drugs, for the achievement of an early negative minimal residual disease (MRD) status. The MRD study supports a risk/MRD-oriented final consolidation phase.

Number of patients on disease free survival (DFS)., DFS is defined as the time interval between the evaluation of CR and relapse of the disease or death in first Complete Response (CR); patients still alive, in first CR, will be censored at the time of the last follow-up. In this case, the DFS will be truncated at 2 years., At two years.

The aim of this clinical study in adult ALL is to improve , by risk category, the overall disease-free survival in relation to the achievement of an early MRD negative status and following induction/consolidation with Peg-ASP, lineage-targeted methotrexate infusions and other disease-specific therapeutic elements, with or without the application of allogeneic or autologous SCT depending on risk class and MRD study results. A survey of severe infections occurring along the entire chemotherapy and stem cell transplant program and until 2 years from the achievement of CR will be performed with the aim to increase the knowledge of these complications and to evaluate their impact on the antileukemic program and on the long term outcome of the underlying malignancy. The prospective survey of severe infections will be performed as an ancillary observational objective of the present study.
