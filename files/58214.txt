Evaluation of KX2-391 in Elderly Subjects With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This Phase 1b study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of KX2-391 given as a once-daily dose, in elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: KX2-391
To determine the maximum tolerated dose of KX2-391 when given once-daily to AML patients., The MTD will be used to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose that is associated with an approximately 33% DLT rate during the first 28 days of treatment in elderly patients with AML, 28 days
Evaluate pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and activity of KX2-391., The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of KX2-391 will be evaluated in AML patients by measuring serum and bone marrow levels of drug and evaluating the disruption of microtubule networks in these samples to determine whether target inhibition has occurred at the doses tested. Hematological and bone marrow response will be assessed according to International Working Group (IWG)-AML criteria., 28 days
KX2-391 has been evaluated in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with solid tumors using twice-daily dosing. This study will employ the Storer's two-stage design to determine the maximum tolerated dose of KX2-391 mono-therapy,given as a once-daily oral dose,in elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who are refractory to or have declined standard induction therapy. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and activity of KX2-391 will be evaluated.
