Magnetic Resonance-guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (MR-HIFU) Used for Mild Hyperthermia
This study will help to elucidate the treatment sites in the extremities and pelvis for which MR-guided HIFU heating is feasible, which has the potential to be beneficial for patients with conditions at those sites (soft tissue sarcoma, cervical cancer, etc.). The investigators anticipate that successful completion of this study will lead to clinical trials in those feasible sites of interest to determine the safety and efficacy of administering therapeutic levels of heat for hyperthermia or other applications.
Healthy Participants|Pelvic Neoplasms|Soft-tissue Sarcoma|Bladder Cancer|Cervical Cancer|Rectal Cancer
DEVICE: Magnetic Resonance-guided High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound
Feasibility of the MR-HIFU device as measured by whether an area can be heated to the designated temperature and held at that temperature for an appropriate time frame, -Temperature in the participant will be monitored using MR thermometry with the MR scanner, 1 day (2 hour timeframe)|Feasibility of the MR-HIFU device as measured by whether an area can be heated while simultaneously maintaining patient comfort, * Patient comfort will be measured by the Comfort Score. Before the scan, participants will be asked to rate any pain, discomfort, in the area to be heated, as well as any anxiety or claustrophobia on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being minimal/none and 10 being extreme. The skin area to be treated will also be reviewed for any redness/discoloration. After the scan, the same questions will be asked again of the subject.
* Participants will be contacted by phone 5-10 days following participation in the study. Participants will be asked to describe any negative effects in the area heated since participation in the study, including pain, discomfort, and/or cosmetic changes (such as skin redness). Participants will be asked to score pain/discomfort on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being minimal/none and 10 being extreme., Up to 10 days|Feasibility of the MR-HIFU device as measured by whether coupling can be maintained with the body area in the same position while having contact with the transducer for an appropriate time frame., -Patients' skin will be cooled using the MR-HIFU system's direct skin cooling device to minimize over heating of the skin, unless one or more gel pads are required to achieve proper coupling to the HIFU system. In order to ensure good contact with the surface of the HIFU interface, participants may be shaved or have other hair-removal products applied to limited regions of their body., 1 day (2 hour timeframe)
Behavior of hyperthermia delivery as measured by the build-up of time until the different treatment cells can reach a desired uniform temperature, --Temperature in the participant will be monitored using MR thermometry with the MR scanner, 1 day (2 hour time frame)|Behavior of hyperthermia delivery as measured by if the heating cell behavior is the same in healthy and tumor tissues, --Temperature in the participant will be monitored using MR thermometry with the MR scanner, 1 day (2 hour time frame)|Behavior of hyperthermia delivery as measured by post-treatment heat diffusion behavior to anticipate any issues when heat is given at a clinically relevant level, -Participants will be contacted by phone 5-10 days following participation in the study. Participants will be asked to describe any negative effects in the area heated since participation in the study, including pain, discomfort, and/or cosmetic changes (such as skin redness)., Up to 10 days
