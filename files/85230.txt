Effect of HSD3B1 (1245C) Gene Mutation on Treatment of Stage I-III Breast Cancer
This stage IV trial examines how a mutation in HSD3B1 (1245C) gene affects treatment of stage I-III breast cancer. This trial may help researchers determine if mutations in HSD3B1 decreases the efficacy of aromatase inhibitor therapy such as letrozole. Letrozole may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Changes in Ki67, Will be assessed according to germline status., Before (baseline) and up to 9 months after surgery|Changes in Ki67, Will be assessed according to somatic HSD3B1 (1245C) variant status., Before (baseline) and up to 9 months after surgery|Changes in estrogen receptor (ER)alpha, Will be assessed according to germline status., Before (baseline) and up to 9 months after surgery|Changes in estrogen receptor (ER)alpha, Will be assessed according to somatic HSD3B1 (1245C) variant status., Before (baseline) and up to 9 months after surgery|Changes in ER beta, Will be assessed according to germline status., Before (baseline) and up to 9 months after surgery|Changes in ER beta, Will be assessed according to somatic HSD3B1 (1245C) variant status., Before (baseline) and up to 9 months after surgery|Effect of HSD3B1 (1245C) variant on changes in Ki67, Will evaluate whether androgen receptor (AR)+ modifies the effect of HSD3B1 (1245C) variant on changes in Ki67 before and after preoperative letrozole treatment, and whether this effects ER- and AR- gene expression signatures., Before (baseline) and up to 9 months after surgery|Expression of 3betaHSD1, Will compare expression of 3betaHSD1 according to HSD3B1 allele status., Up to 9 months after surgery|Expression of intracellular androgen, Will compare expression of intracellular androgen according to HSD3B1 allele status., Up to 9 months after surgery|Expression of estrogen levels, Will compare expression of estrogen levels according to HSD3B1 allele status., Up to 9 months after surgery
OUTLINE:

Patients receive letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If tumor resection occurs before or after day 22, letrozole administration must occur for a minimum of 14 days and a maximum of 70 days of total treatment. Patients also undergo collection of saliva samples.
