Phase II Palbociclib +Ibrutinib in Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The proposed study is a single-arm, multi-center, open-label phase II study of the combination of palbociclib and ibrutinib in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma to evaluate the efficacy of this combination, with the primary objective of the study being to assess median PFS and the secondary objectives to include ORR, CR, DOR, OS and toxicity. Subjects will be enrolled and treated with palbociclib and ibrutinib with each cycle of therapy being 28 days. Treatment will be based on the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) from the phase I combination trial.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma|B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Ibrutinib
Progression free survival, Time interval between registration and progression or death, 42 months
Overall survival, time from registration to death due to any cause, 42 months|Duration of response, Time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression, 42 months|Overall Response Rate, Proportion of patients with reduction in tumor burden of a predefined amount, 42 Months|Complete Response, Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level, 42 Months|Toxicity: Incidence and severity of adverse events by summaries of toxicity data/contingency tables, Evaluation of incidence and severity of adverse events by summaries of toxicity data/contingency tables, 42 Months
Treatment will consist of:

* Palbociclib administered at 100 mg oral once daily for 21 days on followed by 7 days off
* Ibrutinib administered at 560 mg oral continuously

Patients will continue to receive study drugs until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. If at any time one of the agents is held due to toxicity, the other agent may be continued in those patients who are receiving clinical benefit.

Response will be assessed by PET/CT and/or CT every 3 cycles while on therapy for the first year and then every 6 cycles thereafter until disease progression or at the investigator's discretion if otherwise medically indicated. A PET will be required to confirm CR. A bone marrow biopsy will be performed in patients with bone marrow involvement at the start of therapy to confirm complete response once patients have otherwise met criteria for CR.
