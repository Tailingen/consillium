Sunitinib Tumor Levels in Patients Not on Enzyme-Inducing Anti-Epileptic Drugs Undergoing Debulking Surgery for Recurrent Glioblastoma
The purpose of this research study is to determine if sunitinib can get past the blood-brain barrier and into the brain tumor. Sunitinib has shown promising results in treating other cancers and works by blocking blood flow to tumors, which may prevent them from growing further. At the present time, there is no chemotherapy that can cure glioblastoma. The reason why chemotherapy is not fully effective is that many drugs cannot penetrate into brain tumors. This is due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which normally protects the brain from substances in the blood.
Glioblastoma|Brain Tumor
DRUG: Sunitinib
To assess the ability of sunitinib to achieve a target tumor: plasma ration greater than or equal to 0.2 in patients with recurrent GM., 3 years
To determine if there is an association between growth factor receptor inhibition and tumor phenotype, tumor: plasma ratio of sunitinib and overall survival., 3 years
* Participants will take the study drug, sunitinib, for 7 days prior to their surgery. The surgery is part of the routine care for glioblastoma and will be performed on Day 8. The study drug is supplied in capsule form and is to be taken at home.
* On Day 7 participants will come to the clinic and have the following tests and procedures performed: Neurological and physical examination; vital signs; and blood samples. On day 9 (the day after the surgery) an MRI scan will be performed.
* Fourteen days after the participants surgery (Day 22), they will restart sunitinib treatment. They will take the study drug once a day for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week rest period (no study drug treatment). This 6 week period is called a cycle of study treatment. Participants can continue to receive cycles of study treatment as long as their disease does not progress and they do not experience any serious side-effects.
* Before each new cycle of study treatment (once every 6 weeks) the participant will come into the clinic for the following tests: Neurological and physical examination; vital signs; blood sample; urine sample; MRI scan of the brain (done every even cycle).
