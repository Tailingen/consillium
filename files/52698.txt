A Study of Management of Tarceva - Induced Rash in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
This 2 arm study will evaluate the management of Tarceva-induced skin rash in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who have failed first-line chemotherapy for advanced disease. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive a)doxycycline 100mg po daily or b)no preventative treatment; all patients will receive Tarceva 150mg/kg po daily. The anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. Analysis was performed by visit well as at the last available value after baseline (Endpoint); change from baseline to endpoint was also determined., Baseline, Days 14 and 28 and Months 2, 3, and 4|Percentage of Participants by DLQI Global Score Classification of Disease Effect on Quality of Life, Quality of life was assessed by participant's responses to a DLQI questionnaire. The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire assessing quality of life; questions were assessed on a 4-point scale (0=not at all; 1=a little; 2=a lot; and 3=very much). The DLQI was calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 (extremely large effect on participant's life) and a minimum of 0 (no effect at all on participant's life). The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The DLQI global score was classified into 5 levels: 0-1 (no effect at all), 2-5 (small effect), 6-10 (moderate effect), 11-20 (very large effect) and 21-30 (extremely large effect)., Baseline, Days 14 and 28 and Months 2, 3, and 4|Quality of Life Score as Assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Quality of life was assessed by participant's responses to a VAS questionnaire - (evaluation of satisfaction with skin status). VAS was measured on a 100 millimeter (mm) scale where 0 = not at all satisfied and 100 = very satisfied. Participants were asked to mark the line corresponding to their satisfaction at each visit and the distance from the left edge was measured. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement. Analysis was performed by visit well as at the last available value after baseline (Endpoint)., Baseline, Days 14 and 28, and Months 2, 3, and 4
