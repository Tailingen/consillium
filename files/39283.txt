Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is commonly used for the treatment of advanced liver cancer. Recent studies have suggested that TACE induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens. While PD-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with anti-PD-1 antibody in patients in advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.
