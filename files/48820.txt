The PEACE (Posthumous Evaluation of Advanced Cancer Environment) Study
Historically, cancer research has been limited by sample acquisition in late stage disease, often restricted to single sites of disease with limited parallel clinical data collection in terms of prior therapy exposure. The PEACE study is intended to facilitate tissue donation from multiple tumour sites in the post-mortem setting and enable future research using samples collected at post-mortem within different disciplines related to cancer research.
