Epstein-Barr Virus and Cancer Risks
The goal of this prospective cohort study is to investigate the associations between Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) antibody levels and the risk of overall and site-specific cancer types in Southern China. The main questions it aims to answer are:

Question 1: In addition to the established EBV-associated cancer types, such as lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and stomach cancer, whether EBV is associated with other cancer types? Question 2: What's the cancer burden attributed to EBV in Southern China?
Cancer
OTHER: Diagnostic test: EBV antibody tests
Cancer incidence, The primary outcome of the study was the diagnosis of any type of cancer. The cancer type for each participant was defined as their initial and primary cancer diagnosis., 10 years
All-cause mortality, The participants were followed up annually for cancer incidence, vital status and immigration status through the Cancer Registry, Death Registry, and Population Registry of local regions., 10 years
Growing molecular evidence suggests the involvement of EBV in various cancers, however, comprehensive epidemiological evidence is still lacking. In this study, researchers conducted a population-based prospective cohort study to investigate the associations between EBV antibodies and the risk of overall and site-specific cancer types in Southern China. All the participants underwent EBV antibody tests at enrollment and were subsequently followed up annually for cancer incidence, vital status, and immigration status. The primary objective of this study was to provide prospective evidence for the role of EBV in multiple cancers, shedding light on the etiology of a broad range of common EBV-associated cancers.
