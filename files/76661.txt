A one-arm exploratory clinical research program Study of Apatinib in Advanced Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma （mRCC） Patients.It's arm to evaluate the treatment of advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma in patients with objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life score (QoL) and safety.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Apatinib
objective response rate (ORR), 8 weeks
progression-free survival (PFS), 8 weeks|overall survival (OS), 8 weeks|quality of life score (QoL), 8 weeks
Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) (according to RECIST 1.1 Standard Edition)，progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life (QoL).Evaluation once every 8 weeks, If the efficacy results of the evaluation are complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), confirmed imaging efficacy at 4 weeks after the initial assessment ， efficacy evaluation time window of ± 7 days.
