The purpose of this study is to test if an imaging agent called Zr-DFO-pertuzumab that finds HER2 proteins can be used to take pictures of HER2-positive cancer.
HER2-positive Carcinoma|HER2-positive Primary Malignancy
DRUG: Zr-DFO-pertuzumab PET/CT
Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events, including vital signs as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Patients will be monitored closely for evidence of adverse events, including vital signs before and after tracer administration. The day after tracer administration, a physician will screen for any side effects requiring treatment. If a severe adverse effect (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or 4) attributable to 89Zr-DFO-pertuzumab occurs in any patient, then further use of 89Zr-DFO-pertuzumab will be suspended and the protocol reviewed with the MSKCC Data Safety Monitoring Committee., 1 year
