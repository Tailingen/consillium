A Safety Study of Enfortumab Vedotin in Indian Adults With Urothelial Cancer
This study is for Indian adults in India who have cancer in the bladder lining (urothelial cancer). Their cancer is advanced or has spread to other parts of the body. Enfortumab vedotin is a treatment for this type of cancer.

The main aim of the study is to confirm the safety of enfortumab vedotin in Indian adults with urothelial cancer.

During the study, people will receive enfortumab vedotin. The study treatment will be given to people slowly through a tube into a vein. This is called an infusion. People will receive 3 separate infusions of enfortumab vedotin in each 28-day (4 weeks) treatment cycle.

People visit their study clinic for health-checks several times during and after they receive enfortumab vedotin.

Number of participants with Adverse events, Adverse events (AE) will be coded using MedDRA. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention. This includes events related to the comparator, if applicable, and events related to the (study) procedures., Up to 8 months|Number of participants with laboratory value abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant laboratory values., Up to 7 months|Number of participants with vital sign abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant vital sign values., Up to 7 months|Number of participants with electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities and/or AEs, Number of participants with potentially clinically significant ECG values., Up to 6.5 months|Number of Participants at each grade of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score, The ECOG scale will be used to assess performance status. Scores range from 0 (fully active) to 5 (dead). Negative change scores indicate an improvement. Positive scores indicate a decline in performance., Up to 7 months
Confirmed Overall Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST V1.1) per investigator assessment, ORR is defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response is a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1 per investigator assessment, Up to 34 months|Duration of Response (DOR) according to RECIST version 1.1 per investigator assessment, DOR is defined as the time from the date of the first documented response (CR or PR that is subsequently confirmed) per RECIST version 1.1 as determined by investigator to the date of first documented radiological disease progression per RECIST version 1.1 or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 34 months
