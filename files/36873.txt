Comparing Dosing Intervals of Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cancers
A randomized research study of drugs nivolumab and pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancers. Based on data from earlier studies it appears that the drugs can be given less often then the currently approved schedule. This trial will compare drug levels from the blood from standard interval dosing levels versus taking the drugs less often.

Noninferiority margin of extended interval dosing compared to standard dosing, To assess the noninferiority of pharmacokinetic success, defined as drug trough levels above the target concentration of 1.5 Âµg/mL. Evaluable patients will be categorized as success or failure for this primary objective., 2 years
Compare the efficacy of extended interval and standard interval dosing, To compare the correlation of extended interval and standard interval dosing, as based on a combination of time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD) and overall survival (OS). This secondary analysis will include all patients who received at least one dose, 2 years
