Phase III Randomized Study of 5-FU, CoFactor, and Avastin vs. 5-FU, LV and Avastin for First-Line Colorectal Cancer.
To compare the progression-free survival time (PFS) in patients treated with 5-FU modulated with CoFactor (plus bevacizumab) to 5-FU modulated with leucovorin (plus bevacizumab) in patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
