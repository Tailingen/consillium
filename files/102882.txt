Simulation-Based Caregiving Skills Training for Family Members of High Grade Glioma Patients
Family caregivers of patients with a primary brain tumor experience a high caregiving load including assistance with activities of daily living without any formal training. It is not surprising that this vulnerable caregiver population reports high levels of distress along with numerous caregiving-related concerns, which may compromise their ability to provide quality care. This project will examine the feasibility and initial evidence for efficacy of a caregiving skills intervention aiming to improve caregiver and patient psychological health; caregiving efficacy and role adjustment; and reduce patient cancer-related symptoms and healthcare utilization.

BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaires|BEHAVIORAL: Caregiver Assessment
M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) questionnaires, M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) questionnaires score scale ranges ( 0-10) 0 has not been present been and 10 is bad as you can imagine., through study completion and average of 1 year.
Trial 1 (single-arm study)

â€¢ Aim 1: Examine the usability of the intervention content and trial assessments in 10 caregiver-patient dyads to refine study procedures as needed.

Trial 2 (RCT)

Aim 1 (primary aim): Determine the feasibility of implementing a caregiving intervention using a randomized controlled design in 50 caregiver-HGG patient dyads.

Aim 2: Evaluate the initial evidence for intervention efficacy relative to a WLC group regarding patient and caregiver psychological symptoms (primary outcome), caregiver caregiving efficacy and role adjustment, and patient cancer-related symptoms and healthcare utilization (secondary outcomes).

Aim 3: Understand caregivers' experiences using qualitative methods regarding participation in this study and explore emerging themes as possible intervention mediators/moderators to be examined in future research.
