Serial Testing To Assess Cognitive Function In Cancer
The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of immunotherapy on cognitive function of cancer patients and follow them clinically over a period of six months with the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) to assess changes in cognition.
Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
Rate of Cognitive Function Change, The changes in MoCA scores over 6 months in patients from each group will be plotted and summarized with mean change, standard deviation of change, and standard errors of mean change. The standardized response mean (SRM), calculated as the mean change from baseline to 6 months, divided by the standard deviation of change, will be reported as the main effect size for evaluating the magnitude of change in cognitive function., Baseline and 6 months
Changes in MoCA scores, Changes of MoCA scores at 3 months and 6 months from the immunotherapy group will be fitted by the mixed-effects linear model including time effects, which will describe the relationship between the common effect of MoCA score changes, the random effect of time, and the random error representing subjects' observation time., 3 and 6 months
"Chemo brain" has been described as a side effect of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy in cancer patients. With the advent of immunotherapy and progress made in treatment of cancer, long term-survival has increased which raises the question of preserving cognitive function in these patients. However, to date, no large center studies have been done to assess the effects of immunotherapy on cognitive function in patients of all cancer types. Studies that have been done are on preclinical models and very small number of patients, which remained inconclusive.

The primary objective of this pilot clinical trial is to estimate the rate of cognitive function change using the MoCA scale over 6 months in each individual group of patients with cancer treated with immunotherapy alone, combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and in patients with cancer on no active treatment, respectively. The secondary objective is to estimate the changes of MoCA scores after 3 months and 6 months in patients receiving immunotherapy alone for the treatment of their cancer.
