Prognostic Values of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients With Allo-HSCT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous disease and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative treatment option for AML except for AML-M3. Relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure after allo-HSCT. Molecular residual disease has been shown to be a strong risk factor for relapse after HSCT. In this study, the investigators will detect mutations before/after allo-HSCT by using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique to measure residual disease and evaluate the prognostic impact of molecular residual disease in a cohort of AML participants receiving allo-HSCT.
