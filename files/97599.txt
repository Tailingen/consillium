Immunotherapy With Racotumomab Versus Support Treatment in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
This study is designed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of racotumomab in patients with advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), in concomitance with chemotherapy (docetaxel) when a second-line therapy is indicated. The study will also compare survival and progression free survival on both study arms.
Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: racotumomab|OTHER: Best support treatment
Number of Participants with Adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability, Safety will be evaluated at each study visit according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0 and will include physical examination with vital signs, performance status as per the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale(ECOG scale), laboratory tests and clinical history., Until death, on average during 17 months|Evaluation of the reactivity if the antibodies against X63 tumor line, Baseline|Determination of T supressor cell (Treg cell) frequency by immunostaining and flow cytometry., Baseline|Evaluation of the reactivity of the antibodies against the patients tumoral tissue (whenever samples are available), Baseline|Determination of gamma interferon by ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot) assay., Baseline|Measurement of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Baseline|Determination of T supressor cell (Treg cell) frequency by immunostaining and flow cytometry., Month 2|Determination of T supressor cell (Treg cell) frequency by immunostaining and flow cytometry., Month 4|Determination of T supressor cell (Treg cell) frequency by immunostaining and flow cytometry., Month 8|Determination of T supressor cell (Treg cell) frequency by immunostaining and flow cytometry., Month 12|Determination of IgM and IgG antibody titers against N-Glycolil-GM3 ganglioside, Baseline|Evaluation of the reactivity of the antibodies against the patients tumoral tissue (whenever samples are available), Month 2|Measurement of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines., Baseline|Determination of IgM and IgG antibody titers against N-Glycolil-GM3 ganglioside, Month 2|Determination of IgM and IgG antibody titers against N-Glycolil-GM3 ganglioside, Month 8|Determination of IgM and IgG antibody titers against N-Glycolil-GM3 ganglioside, Month 4|Determination of IgM and IgG antibody titers against N-Glycolil-GM3 ganglioside, Month 12|Determination of IgM and IgG antibody titers against N-Glycolil-GM3 ganglioside, Every 4 months (after the first year, on average during 17 months)|Evaluation of the reactivity if the antibodies against X63 tumor line, Month 2|Evaluation of the reactivity if the antibodies against X63 tumor line, Month 12|Evaluation of the reactivity if the antibodies against X63 tumor line, Every 4 months (after the first year, on average during 17 months)|Evaluation of the reactivity if the antibodies against X63 tumor line, Month 4|Evaluation of the reactivity if the antibodies against X63 tumor line, Month 8|Evaluation of the reactivity of the antibodies against the patients tumoral tissue (whenever samples are available), Month 4|Evaluation of the reactivity of the antibodies against the patients tumoral tissue (whenever samples are available), Month 8|Evaluation of the reactivity of the antibodies against the patients tumoral tissue (whenever samples are available), Month 12|Evaluation of the reactivity of the antibodies against the patients tumoral tissue (whenever samples are available), Every 4 months (after the first year, on average during 17 months)|Determination of gamma interferon by ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot) assay., Month 2|Determination of gamma interferon by ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot) assay., Month 4|Determination of gamma interferon by ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot) assay., Month 8|Determination of gamma interferon by ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot) assay., Month 12|Determination of gamma interferon by ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot) assay., Every 4 months (after the first year, on average during 17 months)|Measurement of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Month 2|Measurement of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Month 4|Measurement of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Month 8|Measurement of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Month 12|Measurement of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Every 4 months (after the first year, on average during 17 months)
