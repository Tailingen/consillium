A Study of JNJ-63898081 in Participants With Advanced Stage Solid Tumors
The main purpose of this study are to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) regimen and the maximum tolerated dose, and to determine the safety of JNJ-63898081.
Neoplasms
DRUG: JNJ-63898081
Part 1 and Part 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study., Approximately 3 years|Part 1: Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Number of participants with DLT will be assessed. The DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: high grade non-hematologic toxicity, or hematologic toxicity., Approximately 3 years|Part 1: Severity of Adverse Events as Assessed by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), Severity of AEs has 5 grades based on CTCAE criteria: Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; Grade 5: Death., Approximately 3 years
Part 1 and Part 2: Serum Concentrations of JNJ-63898081, Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of JNJ-63898081 using a validated method., Approximately 3 years|Part 1 and 2: Systemic Cytokine Concentrations, A panel of cytokines, including those proinflammatory ones, will be measured., Approximately 3 years|Part 1 and 2: Number of Participants with JNJ-63898081 Antibodies, Anti-JNJ-63898081 antibodies will be evaluated in serum samples collected from all participants., Approximately 3 years|Serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Concentration, Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentration will be assessed., Approximately 3 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a PR or better according to the disease-specific response criteria. Evaluation of prostate treatment response will be performed according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)., Approximately 3 years|Duration of Response, Duration of response (DOR) will be calculated from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the disease-specific response criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Evaluation of prostate treatment response will be performed according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)., Approximately 3 years
