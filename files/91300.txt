Clinical Pharmacokinetics of TKIs in Chinese Patients of Hepatitis B (HBV)
The study will explore the characteristics in clinical pharmacokinetics of gefitinib, erlotinib,afatinib,osimertinib, crizotinib, apatinib, icotinib in Chinese patients of Non-small-cell lung cancer and hepatitis B. The study is self-controlled. The plasma concentration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors will be analyzed before and after system treatment of HBV.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Hepatitis B
DRUG: Entecavir 1Mg Oral Tablet
Average plasma concentration of the drugs (TKIs), compare the concentration of TKIs prior to and after anti-HBV treatment, one year after recruit
Incidence of adverse reaction caused by TKIs, the adverse reaction of TKIs before and after anti-HBV treatment, one year after recruit
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are first line treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with mutations in targeted genes. TKIs are metabolized in liver into inactive metabolites before eliminating from body. Liver function might plays a significant role in inter-individual differences of pharmacokinetics of TKIs. Hepatitis B is a disease of high prevalence in south China. The liver function will be compromised if the infection of hepatitis B virus has not been controlled. This study aims to compare the pharmacokinetics of TKIs before and after controlling HBV with standard treatment in Chinese patients of non-small-cell lung cancer.
