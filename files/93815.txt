Study of FCN-098 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
A multi-center, open, single-arm phase I dose exploratory study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic characteristics and primary antitumor activity of FCN-098 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: FCN-098
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicity within 2 days of single administration and 28 days of continuous administration., From first dose up to 28 days|Determine the recommended phase II dose, From first dose up to 28 days
To quantify the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) reported in all subjects who received study drug, Incidence of untoward medical occurrences (adverse event = AE) in a participant who received study drug. Adverse events will be evaluated by dosing cohort and recorded according to NCI CTCAEv5 Common Toxicity Criteria., From enrollment up to 30 days after last dose|To quantify the occurrence of TESAE during the treatment and cause permanent withdrawal of toxic effects, From enrollment up to 30 days after last dose|the death of the last medicine occurred within 30 days of frequency and cause of death, From enrollment up to 30 days after last dose|To quantify the Plasma Concentration of FCN-098 and its metabolite M1 (FCN-097), 2 months|To determine the best overall response rate (ORR) by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 in subjects with advanced solid tumors, To evaluate the proportion of patients with an objective response (SD, PR, CR) as defined by RECIST 1.1., Baseline up to approximately 1 year
This study is a multicenter, open, single-arm Phase I clinical study. The safety, tolerance and PK characteristics of FCN-098 in patients with advanced solid tumors were determined, the MTD of oral FCN-098 was determined, and the RP2D of FCN-098 was determined, and the efficacy of FCN-098 was preliminarily evaluated.
