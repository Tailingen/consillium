Trastuzumab(Henlius®) Combined With Pertuzumab(Perjeta®) and Chemotherapy in Chinese Patients With Her2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Trastuzumab
Currently, data of the efficacy of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and chemotherapy is limited in the HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer patients previously treated with trastuzumab during (neo)adjuvant and metastatic setting, and results are not consistent.The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the 6-month progression free survival(PFS) of trastuzumab(Henlius®) combined with Pertuzumab(Perjeta®) and Chemotherapy as first to third line therapy in Chinese patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who received trastuzumab previously.Primary Endpoint is 6-month Progression-free survival (PFS);Secondary Endpoint(s) include Progression-free survival (PFS) Overall Survival (OS);Objective Response Rate(ORR);
