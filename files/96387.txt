Assessing an Oral EGFR Inhibitor, DZD9008 in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer(NSCLC) With EGFR Mutations (WU-KONG15)
This study is a single center cohort study to access the anti-tumor efficacy, safety and tolerability of DZD9008 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sensitizing mutations and EGFR uncommon mutations who have progressed following standard TKI therapy, and in treatment naive patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR Exon20 insertion mutation and EGFR sensitizing mutations.
