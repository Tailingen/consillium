Efficacy of Lenalidomide Maintenance in Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma and Primary Vitreoretinal Lymphoma: a Phase II, Open-label, Single-arm Study
Therefore, we intend to conduct a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with lenalidomide as the maintenance therapy for patients with PCNSL or PVRL who have achieved CR or partial response after HD-MTX-based induction therapy followed by reduced-dose WBRT.Twentypatients with PCNSL or PVRL will be recruited. The primary outcome is 2-year progression-free survival from the first date of reduced-dose WBRT. Besides, the safety and the incidence of cute and late neurotoxicity related to reduced-dose WBRT, the single nucleotide polymorphism assay,and the clinical applications of plasma and CSF circulating tumor DNA and CSF lactate level will be investigated.
