A Clinical Trial Evaluating JYP0035 Capsule Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The goal of this Phase I clinical trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the JYP0035 capsule in patients with advanced solid tumors. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What is the safety profile of JYP0035 when administered to these patients?
* How does JYP0035 capsule behave in the body pharmacokinetically?

Participants will:

* Receive escalating doses of JYP0035 capsule during the dose-escalation phase (PART-1).
* Continue with the identified dose in the dose-expansion phase (PART-2).

As this is a single-arm study, there is no comparison group.
