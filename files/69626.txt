The purpose of this study is to describe the use of teclistamab/talquetamab in the treatment of patients with RRMM outside of clinical trials.
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM)
OTHER: Teclistamab|OTHER: Talquetamab
Describe Baseline Characteristics of Participants with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM) who Received Teclistamab/ Talquetamab Outside of Clinical Trials, Participants' demographics and disease characteristics (age, co-morbidities, renal function), and prior antimyeloma therapies will be reported., Baseline (Day 1)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) in Participants with RRMM who Received Teclistamab/Talquetamab Outside of Clinical Trials, ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have a PR or better as assessed by investigator per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria., Up to 40 months|Time to First Response in Participants with RRMM who Received Teclistamab/Talquetamab Outside of Clinical Trials, Time to first response is defined as the time between date of first dose of teclistamab/talquetamab and the date when patient has achieved first response, as assessed by investigator per IMWG response criteria., Up to 40 months|Time to Best Response in Participants with RRMM who Received Teclistamab/Talquetamab Outside of Clinical Trials, Time to best response is defined as the time between date of first dose of teclistamab/talquetamab and the date of the best response, as assessed by investigator per IMWG response criteria., Up to 40 months|Duration of Response (DOR) in Participants with RRMM who Received Teclistamab/Talquetamab Outside of Clinical Trials, DOR will be calculated among participants (with a PR or better response) from the date of the first response (PR or better) to the date of first evidence of progressive disease, as assessed by investigator per IMWG response criteria., Up to 40 months|Minimal Residue Assessment (MRD) in Participants with RRMM who Received Teclistamab/Talquetamab Outside of Clinical Trials, Number of participants with MRD negative rate will be assessed., Up to 40 months|Overall Survival (OS) in Participants with RRMM who Received Teclistamab/Talquetamab Outside of Clinical Trials, OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of teclistamab/talquetamab to the date of the participant's death., From the date of first dose of teclistamab/talquetamab to the date of the participant's death (up to 40 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Participants with RRMM who Received Teclistamab/Talquetamab Outside of Clinical Trials, PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of teclistamab/talquetamab to the date of first evidence of progressive disease, as assessed by investigator per IMWG response criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 40 months|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT) in Participants with RRMM who Received Teclistamab/Talquetamab Outside of Clinical Trials, TTNT is defined as the time from the date of first dose of teclistamab/talquetamab to the start of the next line of antimyeloma treatment., Up to 40 months|Describe the Safety Management of Teclistamab/Talquetamab in the Treatment of Participants with RRMM Outside of Clinical Trials, Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and other AEs as well as medications used for prophylaxis and management of adverse events will be reported., Baseline (Day 1) up to end of treatment (up to 40 months)
Describe the Use of Teclistamab/Talquetamab in the Treatment of Participants with RRMM Outside of Clinical Trials, Treatment patterns including healthcare setting and treatment schedules will be reported., Baseline (Day 1) up to end of treatment (up to 40 months)
The purpose of this study is to describe the use of teclistamab/talquetamab in the treatment of patients with RRMM outside of clinical trials.
