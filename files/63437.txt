Phase 1b/2 Study of BKM120 Plus Trastuzumab in Patients With HER2-positive Breast Cancer
This study will assess the safety and efficacy of BKM120 in combination with trastuzumab in patients with relapsing HER2 overexpressing breast cancer who have previously failed trastuzumab.

The study will further assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of BKM120 in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine in patients with relapsing HER2 overexpressing breast cancer and brain metastases (BM) who have previously failed trastuzumab.
Metastatic Breast Cancer|HER2+ Breast Cancer
DRUG: BKM120|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Capecitabine
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) - Phase l Only, Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the dose escalation part of the study was based upon the estimation of the probability of DLT in Cycle 1 in patients of the dose-determining set., cycle 1 - 28 days|Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Phase ll, Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the rate of patients with best overall response (BOR) equal to complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.0 from the Investigators review.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 assessed of the disease status by imaging (i.e. CT/MRI): Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all tumor lesions; Partial Response (PR)= \>=30% shrinkage of lesions; Overall Response (OR) = patients with CR and PR., 18 months
Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on Investigator Assessment- Phase l & ll, Disease control rate (DCR) = patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) as per RECIST criteria.

Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 assessed the disease status by imaging (i.e. CT/MRI): CR = disappearance of all tumor lesions; PR = \>=30% shrinkage of lesions; SD = Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR or CR nor an increase in lesions which would qualify for progressive disease (PD); PD = At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of all measured target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of longest diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline., 18 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) - Phase l & ll, CBR = patients with CR, PR or SD â‰¥ 24 weeks according to RECIST by the investigator.
