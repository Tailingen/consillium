Randomized Trial of Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation
This study is to compare radiation toxicity of accelerated partial breast irradiation (ABPI) with whole breast irradiation (WBI) in low-risk breast cancer.
Breast Neoplasms|Neoplasm Recurrence, Local
RADIATION: APBI|RADIATION: WBI
Number o participants with Grade 2 or more toxicity, The evaluated toxicities include the following and are evaluated by CTCAE 3.0 criteria:

acute skin toxicity,breast swelling, breast pain,radiation pneumonitis, cardiac toxicity, pulmonary fibrosis, cosmetic result, 5 years
locoregional recurrence, ipsilateral breast and axillary nodal recurrence, 5 years|overall survival, any death, 5 years|disease-free survival, any recurrence or death, 5 years|distant-metastasis survival, distant metastasis, 5 years|Quality of life measured with BR-23 questionnaire, BR-23 questionnaire, 2 years
This study is a single-center phase II randomized clinical trial to enroll low-risk breast cancer treat with breast-conserving surgery. All eligible patients are randomized to receive either ABPI (40Gy/10fx/2wks) or WBI(43.5Gy/15fx/3wks). Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique is used. Grade 2 or more acute and late toxicities are prospectively evaluated and compared.
