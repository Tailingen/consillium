Concurrent Chemo-proton Radiotherapy With or Without Resection and Spacer Insertion for Loco-regional Recurrence of Previous Irradiated Rectal Cancer
The investigators conduct this study to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effect of salvage concurrent chemo-proton therapy (CCPT) with or without surgical resection in previously irradiated recurrent rectal cancer.

The obtaining of local control in previously irradiated recurrent rectal cancer is crucial for survival prolongation as well as quality of life of patients. But, it is not easy to get with surgery and/or conventional radiotherapy (RT) because of the limitation of RT dose. Proton therapy has unique advantage showing superior dose distribution focusing tumor escaping surrounding normal tissues using "Bragg-peak".
