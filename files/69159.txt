24 Gy in One Fraction Urethral-sparing "HDR Like" SBRT for Prostate Cancer
Patients with prostate cancer who are candidates for stereotactic radiotherapy to the prostate and seminal vesicles will undergo staging exams, which will include prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). If the PET scan is negative and the uroflowmetry is acceptable, the patients will perform the treatment, after fiducial implantation, simulation CT and magnetic resonance (MR), in a single fraction, delivered with a high-dose-rate (HDR)-like urethral sparing technique. In 70 patients, acute and late toxicity, biochemical control, overall survival, cancer specific-survival, and quality of life (through specific questionnaires) will be evaluated.
Localized Prostate Carcinoma
RADIATION: prostate SBRT
Acute toxicity, Incidence of acute toxicity of grade 3 or 4 as maximum toxicity value during the radiation treatment or in any case within a month of the end of SBRT, using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 scale (toxicity from 0- patients without toxicity to 5-death from toxicity), one month
Biochemical control, Biochemical control rate at 1,3 and 5 years by measuring Prostate Specific Antigen-PSA- value which must be below (2+nadir) ng/ml, 5 years (with interim analyzes at 1 and 3 years)|Biochemical relapse, Biochemical Relapse-Free survival, 5 years (with interim analyzes at 1 and 3 years)|Local Control, Local Relapse-Free survival, 5 years (with interim analyzes at 1 and 3 years)|Distant Disease Control, Distant Metastases-Free Survival, 5 years (with interim analyzes at 1 and 3 years)|Survival, Overall Survival, 5 years (with interim analyzes at 1 and 3 years)|Subacute Toxicity, Subacute toxicity rated on CTCAE v5.0 scale (see Outcome 1 for details), 3 months|Late Toxicity, Late toxicity rated on using CTCAE v5.0 scale (see Outcome 1 for details), 5 years (with interim analyzes at 1 and 3 years)|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed with general quality of life questionnaires, Survey with the questionnaire of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of life of cancer patients (QLQ C30) which contains 30 questions on patients' quality of life with answers from 1, lowest grade, to 4, highest grade, 5 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed with prostate specific quality of life questionnaires, Survey with the questionnaire of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of life of prostate cancer patients (QLQ PR25) which contains 25 questions on patients' quality of life with answers from 1, lowest grade, to 4, highest grade, 5 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed with urinary quality of life questionnaires, Survey with the questionnaire International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) which has 8 questions with answers rom never (0) to almost every time (5). The score is obtained by summing the answers, 5 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed with erectile quality of life questionnaires, Survey with the questionnaire IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function). The IIEF-5 score is the sum of the ordinal responses to the 5 items, with higher scores indicating no erectile dysfunction and lower scors indicating severe erectile dysfunction., 5 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed with composite quality of life questionnaires, Survey with the questionnaire EPIC-26 (The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) a questionnaire designed to measure Quality of Life issues in patients with Prostate cancer, through 13 questions with answers from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the absence of the problem and 5 indicating an important problem. Lower scores indicate a better outcome, 5 years
Organ movement, Modeling of organ movements during treatment: Movements of the target and neighboring organs between the treatment fractions and during the treatment will be quantified in millimeters, the median value will be recorded with the range and mean with the standard deviation, and the contributing factors will be identified to find a useful solution, 3 years|Radiomics, Evaluation of radiomic characteristics: Mathematical extraction of the spatial distribution of signal intensities and pixel interrelationships of medical images of the patients, to quantify textural information resampled according to International Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI)., 5 years ( with interim analyzes at 3 years)
This is an interventional prospective non-randomised single-center trial that will enroll, 13 patients for the first phase of the study, according to the optimal design of Simon. The hypothesis is that the proportion of patients free from acute cumulative G3-G4 toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events-CTCAE v5.0 scale) 1 month after the end of treatment must be \< 85% to suspend treatment and \> 95% to consider the treatment as safe.

The treatment will be interrupted if G3-G4 toxicities and/or biochemical recurrences are recorded within a month in 2 or more patients; otherwise the study will continue with the second phase. Another 52 patients will be added, for a total of 65 patients. The treatment consists in a single fraction of 24 Gy with the "urethral sparing HDR like" technique. Assuming a minimal drop-out, given that the primary endpoint is toxicity one month after treatment, we will enroll 5 more patients in total, thus reaching a total number of 70 patients (65 necessary + 5 for any drop-outs).

In the absence of worse subsequent toxicity, and with biochemical control comparable to that in the literature as well as historical treatments in our Radiation Oncology, the scheme will be considered safe, and the enrollment will continue open label.

Patients with negative lymph nodes and without distant metastases will be enrolled and treated on the prostate/prostate and tumor vesicles (depending on the stage) at a total dose of 24 Gy delivered in a single fraction, sparing the urethra and with a dose distribution similar to high dose rate brachytherapy. Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) will be prescribed according to the guidelines for the stages of the disease.

Short-term cortisone and alpha lytics will be prescribed, for prophylactic purposes. Follow-up visits will be performed at 1, 3, 6,12,18, 24, 36, 48, 60 months with blood tests including prostate specific antigen (PSA) and testosterone (performed every 3 months in the first two years, every 6 months in the next 3 years), imaging, when needed, and quality of life questionnaires: European Organization for Research and Treatment of cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) C30 and QLQ-PR25, International Prostate symptoms score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)- 26.
