Role of [18F]-FDG Brain PET in Newly Diagnosed Primary Cerebral Lymphoma, in Immunocompetent Patient Older Than 60 Years
Patients older than 60 years account for half of cases of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) and have a poorer outcome. No prognostic or predictive factors exist for survival after initial remission. 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose - Positron Emission Tomography (\[18F\]FDG-PET) plays a key role in grading and therapy monitoring of systemic diffuse large B-cell type.

LOCALYZE is an ancillary Positron Emission Tomography / Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) clinical study from BLOCAGE 01 (Pr Hoang-Xuan). The aim is to evaluate the usefulness of \[18F\]FDG-PET to monitor treatment response in PCNSL older than 60 years (n=56), in complement to multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

Hypothesis The investigators assume that the development of new imaging biomarker extracted from PET imaging and multiparametric MRI, could improve the assessment of treatment response in PCNSL.
Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
RADIATION: [18F]-FDG PET/MR
Progression free survival calculated from the date of completion of the end of chemotherapy PET, To evaluate the predictive value of \[18F\]FDG-PET assessment performed at the end-of-treatment (high-dose methotrexate based polychemotherapy), on progression free survival in newly diagnosed PCNSL with age ≥60 years (n=56)., 6 months
\[18F\]-FDG PET/MR will be performed in the Department of Nuclear Medicine - Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital:

* prior to initiation of chemotherapy (rituximab, methotrexate, procarbazine, vincristine and cytarabine) (PET#1),
* after two chemotherapy cycles (PET#2),
* at the end of the first-line chemotherapy regimens (PET#3).
