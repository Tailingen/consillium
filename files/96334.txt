Trial of Pulsed Electric Field Therapy in Patients With Late-stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to verify the safety and clinical benefit of pulsed electric field(PEF) treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) patients with acquired resistance to anti programmed cell death protein 1(PD-1) monoclonal antibody therapy.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Safety of PEF treatment of metastatic NSCLC patients.
* Control of ablated and other targeted lesions.
* Local and peripheral immunoregulation effect. PEF energy will be delivered to preselected lesions of participants, then anti PD-1 will be routinely administrated if no adverse event(AE)/serious adverse event(SAE) which need medical intervention occurs.
NSCLC
DEVICE: PEF|DRUG: Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody
Technical success rate of PEF treatment, The percentage of the number that the equipment successfully reached the target lesion and completed PEF energy delivery., 7 days|Incidence of PEF treatment related AE/SAEs, The incidence and severity of PEF treatment related adverse events according to CTCAE version 4.0, 1 month
Local control of ablated lesions by CT, Compared with the baseline CT scan before treatment, the maximum diameter of the ablated lesion decreased, remained unchanged or increased by less than 20%., 3 months|Local control of ablated lesions by CT, Compared with the baseline CT scan before treatment, the maximum diameter of the ablated lesion decreased, remained unchanged or increased by less than 20%., 6 months|Progression free survival rate at 6 months, 6 months|Overall survival rate at 6 months, 6 months|Overall survival rate at 12 months, 12 months
Eligible patients will will be enrolled to experimental arm and receive standard of care combining with PEF treatment on Day 1, followed by anti PD-1 on Day 7 and then routinely.

All kinds of adverse events will be recorded and analyzed to evaluate the safety of the treatment. At the same time, the local control rate of treated lesions, PFS and OS after PEF will be analyzed to evaluate the clinical value of the treatment.
