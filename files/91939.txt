Cervical Boost by Ablative Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SABR) vs Brachytherapy in Patients With Cervical Carcinoma
Background Cervical cancer (CaCu) is the fourth cause of death in women. In patients with locally advanced disease, the treatment of choice is CT/RT, followed by additional boosting with brachytherapy (BT). There is an international decrease in the use of this technique due to financial restrictions. Given the difficulties in using brachytherapy as a boost, several series have described promising results in local control using boost with highly conformal techniques such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). On the other hand, prospective studies are scarce and with controversial results. No study has been published that directly compares three-dimensional intracavitary SBRT and BT. In this clinical trial, the researchers aim to demonstrate that boosting with SBRT is not inferior to intracavitary brachytherapy in patients with CC.

Methodology

Primary Objective:

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of concomitant CT/RT followed by Ablative Body Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SBRT) vs Brachytherapy in patients with Cervical Cancer in clinical stage IB3-IIIC1 at INCan.

Secondary Objectives:

The purpose of this study is to evaluate quality of life, local efficacy (local control and time to local recurrence), overall survival, disease-free survival, and time to distant recurrence.

Study Design:

SABRVICAL is a meticulously designed randomized two-arm open-label phase II study to compare QT/RT + SBRT vs QT/RT + Brachytherapy. It will include patients with IB3-IIIC1 CaCu \>18 years of age with adequate renal function. They will be randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm or the standard arm.

Expected Results and Outlook With this study, we aim to assess that the safety and efficacy of concomitant QT/RT with cisplatin followed by SBRT is not inferior to boost with brachytherapy in patients with CaCu IB3-IIIC1. The potential impact of this study is significant, as it could provide new treatment options for hospitals that do not have brachytherapy or have a prolonged waiting list for this procedure.

A randomized phase 2 trial is required for two reasons:

1. The literature lacks enough prospective information. In this context, a randomized phase 2 study would identify SBRT as a promising experimental treatment that, depending on the results, could be tested in a phase 3 trial.
2. Randomization will provide an adequate control group to serve as a comparator for the experimental arm since non-randomized historical or contemporary controls are not appropriate due to the amount of bias they introduce in patient selection as well as confounders (use of 2D brachytherapy). instead of 3D or the use of conformal radiotherapy and not intensity-modulated radiotherapy).

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of concomitant CT/RT followed by SBRT vs high rate 3D Intracavity Brachytherapy in patients with Cervical Cancer in clinical stage IB3-IIIC1 at INCan:

1. Evaluate the safety of CT/RT using the CTCAE V5.0 criteria.
2. Evaluate local efficacy and objective response using the RECIST 1.1 criteria.
3. Compare the time to local, regional, and distant recurrence between radiotherapy techniques.
4. Compare overall survival and progression-free survival between both radiotherapy techniques.
5. Measure the patient's quality of life using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CX24 questionnaires.

Randomized open-label phase 2 study in people with CaCu clinical stages IB3-IIIC1 treated with QT/RT. Subjects will be randomized to cervical boost with SBRT or 3D intracavitary brachytherapy in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by nodal status.

Arm 1 will be the experimental arm and will consist of patients with CC clinical stages IB3-IIIC1 who will be treated with CT/RT with a minimum dose of 45Gy and boost in the case of macroscopic nodes (1.8Gy per fraction from Monday to Friday) with cisplatin and cervical boost with SBRT of 28Gy in 4 fractions administered at least every 40 hours to achieve an EQD210(Gy) at PTV D90% of 83.9Gy. Arm 2 will be the control arm that will consist of patients with CC clinical stages IB3-IIIC1 and will be treated with CT/RT with a minimum dose of 45Gy and boost in the case of macroscopic nodes (1.8Gy per fraction from Monday to Friday) with cisplatin and cervical boost with high-dose-rate 3D brachytherapy with a dose of 28Gy in 4 fractions administered at least every 40 hours to achieve an EQD210(Gy) at point A of 83.9Gy.

Sample size The maximum acceptable toxicity (grade 3 or higher) is 24%. The only phase II clinical trial published in the literature about SBRT in CC reported late toxicity of 26.7% at 2 years. For intracavitary brachytherapy, a grade 3 late toxicity of 3.31% has been reported.

The sample size was calculated using a formula for 2 proportions, in which an incidence of grade 3-4 toxicity of 26.7% for arm A and 3.31% for group B was considered. A α error of 5% and a power of 80%. A total of 35 patients for each arm are needed plus a 20% loss = 42 patients for each arm (see figure attached).
