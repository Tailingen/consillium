A Retrospective Observational Study Comparing Two Different Treatment Options in Thyroid Cancer Patients With T4 Tumours
The study is to demonstrate non-inferior thyroid remnant first ablation success of Thyrogen and 131I compared to thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) and 131I in patients with T4 tumour based on historical diagnostic whole body scan (DxWBS) records.
