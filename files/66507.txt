PSMA-based 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and PET/MRI Pilot Studies in Prostate Cancer
The overall goal of this research is to validate and develop a non-invasive imaging biomarker of prostate cancer detection, progression, and recurrence. Development of such a biomarker may be useful to differentiate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer phenotypes allowing for selection of an appropriate risk adaptive therapy.

The investigators propose to evaluate a novel second-generation low-molecular-weight prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based positron emission tomography (PET) agent, 18F-DCFPyL, for detection of primary and metastatic prostate cancer. 18F-DCFPyL PET demonstrates very high tumor-to-background and tumor specific uptake which may allow for a more sensitive and accurate method for detection of early tumor recurrence and metastatic disease as compared to current PET radiotracers and current standard-of-care imaging including 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy (bone scan), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Primary Objectives: The investigators propose to evaluate this PET agent for four different prostate cancer clinical scenarios.

1. detection of clinically significant high-grade prostate cancer and initial staging
2. detection of sites of recurrence in the setting of biochemical recurrence after definitive prostatectomy
3. detection of advanced androgen-resistant metastatic prostate cancer, and
4. detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in very low to intermediate risk primary prostate cancer

Secondary Objectives:

* Evaluate the performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET and MRI whole body DWI for detection of local-nodal and distant metastatic disease on initial staging compared to conventional imaging modalities (CT and bone scintigraphy).
* Correlate 18F-DCFPyL PET standardized-uptake values (SUV) and MRI parameters with PSMA expression by prostatectomy pathology IHC.
* Evaluate the specificity of 18F-DCFPyL PET for differentiating primary prostate cancer versus non-malignant prostate lesions (BPH, prostatitis).
* Comparison of whole body low-dose CT and whole body MRI derived PET SUV-quantitation.
* Evaluate the performance of dedicated pelvic 18F-DCFPyL PET/MRI with dynamic PET acquisition and multi-parametric MRI for differentiation of urine versus recurrent malignancy in the prostatectomy bed.
* Evaluate the contribution of whole body MRI DWI obtained from PET/MRI to improve the diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT and PET/MRI for metastatic prostate cancer lesion detection.
* Assess the quantitative accuracy of PET-derived standardized uptake value (SUV)-based parameters in 18F-DCFPyL PET obtained from PET/MRI versus PET/CT.
* Assess the quantitative reproducibility of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT derived-SUV values in normal organ and metastatic tumor lesions.
* Evaluate the ability of 18F-DCFPyL PET to improve detection of clinically significant primary prostate cancer in men with very low to intermediate risk prostate cancer under active surveillance or watchful waiting.
