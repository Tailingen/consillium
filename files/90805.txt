Strata EXPress™: A Study Using StrataEXP™ to Identify RNA-Expression Biomarkers in Advanced Cancer Patients
The primary goal of this study is to identify patients with RNA expression profiles consistent with eligibility requirements for therapeutic clinical trials across solid tumors. Left-over tumor tissue will be collected from eligible participants for RNA expression analysis using next-generation sequencing.

The primary goal of this study is to identify patients with RNA expression profiles consistent with eligibility requirements for therapeutic clinical trials across solid tumors. Left-over tumor tissue will be collected from eligible participants for RNA expression analysis using next-generation sequencing.

A parallel study, StrataPATH™ (STR-004-001), has been developed to support therapeutic hypotheses. Participants may be consented and screened for enrollment separately into StrataPATH with an eligible matching biomarker/drug treatment cohort upon positive identification of a relevant expression signature. Treatment effectiveness of antibody drug conjugates and other targeted therapies will be evaluated in these molecularly defined cohorts.
