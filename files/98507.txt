Plasma Exosomes Reveal the Efficacy of Targeted Therapy in Patients With EGFR Mutation in Lung Adenocarcinoma
The objective of this observational study is to explore the therapeutic trajectory of targeted therapy in lung adenocarcinoma patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. The main objective is to identify potential biomarkers that can predict the efficacy of targeted therapy through plasma exosomes and to explore strategies to reverse drug resistance to targeted therapy. Biological specimens and medical imaging data will be collected from patients already receiving targeted therapy as a first-line treatment, and followed-up will be conducted to analyze prognosis based on different patterns.

OTHER: observational study
progression-free survival, The time of disease progression is evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1., A two-year period after starting treatment (Regular follow-up every three months after receiving targeted therapy combined with or without chemotherapy as first-line treatment)
Overall survival, The survival time after receiving targeted therapy combined with or without chemotherapy as first-line treatment, A three-year period after starting treatment (Regular follow-up every six months after receiving targeted therapy combined with or without chemotherapy as first-line treatment)
The medical imaging data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively, and the blood samples and tumor tissues will be collected prospectively.
