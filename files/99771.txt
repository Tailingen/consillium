A Study of BI-1206 in Combination With Rituximab With or Without Acalabrutinib in Subjects With Indolent B-Cell NHL
Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial of BI-1206, a Monoclonal Antibody to CD32b (FcyRIIB), in Combination with Rituximab with or without Acalabrutinib in Subjects with Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma That has Relapsed or is Refractory to Rituximab
Indolent B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: BI-1206|BIOLOGICAL: Rituximab|BIOLOGICAL: Acalabrutinib
Documenting AEs and SAEs and determining causality in relation to BI-1206 and/or rituximab and/or acalabrutinib, Assess the safety and tolerability profile of BI-1206 when administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) in combination with rituximab or rituximab and acalabrutinib in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), subtypes follicular lymphoma (FL)(except FL grade 3B), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Assessment will be done according to National Cancer Institute (NCI-CTCAE) criteria v. 5.0., During the 28-day treatment period on induction therapy|Determining the MTD of BI-1206 at the same dose level experiencing a BI-1206 or Rituximab-related or possibly related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Phase 1:

Select the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) by establishing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI-1206 given once weekly for 4 weeks, via IV infusion or SC injection in combination with rituximab., During the 28-day treatment period on induction therapy|Determine the recommended dose of BI-1206 in combination with rituximab and acalabrutinib, Phase 2a:

Select the recommended dose of BI-1206 in combination with rituximab and acalabrutinib., During the 28-day treatment period on induction therapy
Evaluation of PK parameters for BI-1206, PK parameters assessed will include AUC, Cmax, time to Cmax and t1/2 of BI-1206 when administered IV or SC, Up to 1 year|Evaluation of ADA (immunogenicity) response to BI-1206, Assess the incidence and titre of antidrug antibodies of BI-1206 in serum when administered IV or SC in combination with rituximab or rituximab and acalabrutinib., Up to 1 year|Measurement of peripheral blood B-lymphocytes depletion, Evaluate the effect of BI-1206 administered IV or SC in combination with rituximab or rituximab and acalabrutinib measuring B Lymphocytes CD19+ (absolute value) as part of hematology assessment to determine the level of peripheral blood B lymphocyte depletion., Up to 1 year|Assessment of overall response rate (ORR) according to the response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson, 2014)., Assess possible anti-tumor activity of BI-1206 administered IV or SC in combination with rituximab or rituximab and acalabrutinib at Week 6 after first dose of BI-1206 and for subjects who continue during maintenance therapy., Up to 1 year
Expression levels of CD32b protein, To investigate CD32b protein expression levels using flow cytometry to evaluate any potential correlation with clinical responses. Change from baseline expression levels will be summarized descriptively by dose cohort and/or response to treatment., Up to 1 year|Assessment of Patient Reported Outcomes using the NCI PRO-CTCAE questionnaire, The NCI PRO-CTCAE will be used to evaluate symptomatic toxicities reported by patients. The questionnaire characterizes the frequency, severity, interference, and presence/absence of symptomatic toxicities, all toxicities that can be meaningfully reported from the patient perspective.

Responses are scored from 0 to 4 (or 0/1 for absent/present). Scores for each attribute (frequency, severity and/or interference) will be presented descriptively (e.g. summary statistics or graphical presentations)., Up to 1 year|Expression levels of CD32b and/or other immunological markers, Perform whole-transcriptome, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and/or IHC analysis of lymph node biopsies to evaluate potential correlation with clinical responses., Up to 1 year|Measurement of serum cytokines levels and/or soluble CD32b., Study the potential cause of infusion related reactions (IRRs), such as cytokine release signs, C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or soluble CD32b., Up to 1 year
This is a Phase 1/2a, multicenter, dose escalation, consecutive-cohort, open-label trial of BI-1206 in combination with rituximab with or without acalabrutinib in subjects with indolent relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL, sub-types FL (except FL grade 3B), MZL, and MCL.

Phase 2a, consists of signal seeking cohorts followed by a randomized, parallel, two-arm dose optimization.

The trial consists of 2 main parts:

Phase 1

- Dose Escalation, with two different Arms assessing IV or SC dosing of BI-1206 in combination with rituximab, with dose escalation cohorts and selection of the IV and SC doses of BI-1206 for Phase 2a

Phase 2a

* Dose Expansion, with one expansion cohort evaluating the selected IV dose of BI-1206 in combination with rituximab
* Signal Seeking, assessing IV and SC dosing of BI-1206 in combination with rituximab and acalabrutinib. The Signal Seeking will consist of a Safety Run-in and an Expansion
* Dose Optimization to select the recommended dose of BI-1206 in combination with rituximab and acalabrutinib
