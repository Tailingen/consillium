A Study to Evaluate SHR-1210 in Subjects With Advanced HCC
This a randomized controlled Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 in subjects with advanced HCC who failed or intolerable to prior systemic treatment. The primary study hypothesis is that SHR-1210 treatment improves Objective Response Rate and Overall Survival when compare with SOC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Non-Resectable
BIOLOGICAL: SHR-1210
Objective Response Rate, Tumour responses were evaluated by the independent review committee (IRC) according to RECIST 1.1.The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a IRC-assessed objective response (defined as the percentage of patients whose best overall response was confirmed complete or partial response)., approximate 3 years|6-month Overall Survival Rate, 6-month overall survival rate (defined as cumulative overall survival rate from the date of the first dose to 6 months), from the date of the first dose to 6 months
Duration of Response, time from first response to progression or death base on the IRC assessment, approximate 3 years|Adverse Events, Number of Subjects with one or more adverse events as assessed by CTCAE 4.03, approximate 3 years|Overall Survival, Time from first dose to death from any cause, approximate 3 years
In June 2017, this study was revised to expand the Phase 2 part to enroll more subjects and remove the Phase 3 part under the same protocol. A Phase 3 study will be initiated separately.
