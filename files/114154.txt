Gene Expression in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Receiving Bevacizumab
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors understand how patients respond to treatment.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at gene expression in patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer receiving bevacizumab.
Colorectal Cancer
GENETIC: gene expression analysis|GENETIC: protein expression analysis|GENETIC: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction|OTHER: immunoenzyme technique|OTHER: immunohistochemistry staining method|OTHER: immunologic technique
Mean scores for VEGFb and pan-VEGF gene expression by IHC, 1 month|Gene expression as measured by tissue microarrays, 1 month|Splice form expression as measured by reverse transcriptase-PCR, 1 month|VEGF165b protein expression as measured by ELISA, 1 month
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine whether the balance of splice form expression alters susceptibility of tumors in vivo to respond to anti-VEGF therapy.

OUTLINE: Tumor tissue samples collected on clinical trial E-3200 are analyzed for laboratory endpoints.
