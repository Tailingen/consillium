Phase II Study to Evaluate the Combination of Rituximab and DepoCyteÂ® in the C5R Chemotherapy Protocol in Patients Between the Ages of 18 and 60 Years With Primary Cerebral Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Systemic Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma With Neuromeningeal Invasion at Diagnosis
The purpose of this study is to measure the rate of complete response (CR and UCR) at the end of a course of immuno-chemotherapy:

* before cerebral radiotherapy for PCL
* after the course of immuno-chemotherapy for aggressive lymphomas with neuromeningeal involvement Toxicity of the protocol Overall survival Survival without relapse Long-term incidence of neurocognitive toxicity
