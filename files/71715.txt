A Clinical Study of CEA-targeted CAR-T in the Treatment of CEA-positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
This is a phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAR-T in patients with CEA-positive advanced malignant solid tumors, and to obtain the maximum tolerated dose of CAR-T and phase II Recommended dose.

This is a single-center, double-arm, open-label study. The study plans to set up 2 groups,Intravenous infusion group have 3 dose groups, adopting a dose-escalating 3+3 design, and plan to recruit about 9-18 subjects with CEA-positive advanced malignant solid tumors.Intraperitoneal injection group have 4 dose groups, adopting a dose-escalating 3+3 design, and plan to recruit about 12-24 subjects with CEA-positive advanced malignant solid tumors.
