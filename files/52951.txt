Universal Genetic Testing for Cancer Risk Reduction
The purpose of this research study is to see if offering genetic testing for cancer-related genes is feasible and acceptable for patients presenting for gynecology clinic visits, instead of needing to see specialized providers or needing to meet specific criteria. The primary aim to assess the proportion of patients who undergo genetic testing, and the proportion of patients with pathogenic variants.
