Study of E7386 in Participants With Selected Advanced Neoplasms
This study will be conducted to assess the safety/tolerability profile of E7386 as a single agent administered orally in participants with selected advanced or recurrent neoplasms and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of E7386.
Advanced Neoplasms
DRUG: E7386
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs are any of the pre-specified drug-related toxicities (any toxicities considered related to E7386) occurring during Cycle 1 as assessed by the investigator. DLTs will be assessed to determine the maximum tolerated dose., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), RP2D will be selected based on an integrated evaluation of safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK) data, and any available pharmacodynamic (PD) data for all dose levels or all available data according to pre-specified guidelines., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Number of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), From the date of first dose of study drug up to 28 days after administration of study drug (up to approximately 6 years and 10 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving a best overall response of confirmed partial responses (PR) or complete response (CR), per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in the short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Up to approximately 6 years and 10 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the date of the first documentation of confirmed disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression, per RECIST 1.1, is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., Up to approximately 6 years and 10 months|Maximum Drug Concentration (Cmax) of E7386, Cmax is the maximum plasma concentration of a drug after administration., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-12 hours postdose (Dose Escalation); Cycle 1-4 Day 1: 0-1 hours postdose (Dose Expansion) (each Cycle = 28 Days)|Time to Reach the Maximum Concentration Following Drug Administration (tmax) of E7386, tmax is the time to reach maximum concentration following drug administration., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-12 hours postdose (Dose Escalation); Cycle 1-4 Day 1: 0-1 hours postdose (Dose Expansion) (each Cycle = 28 Days)|Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) of E7386, AUC is a measure of actual body exposure to drug after administration of the drug., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-12 hours postdose (Dose Escalation); Cycle 1-4 Day 1: 0-1 hours postdose (Dose Expansion) (each Cycle = 28 Days)|Elimination Half-life (t1/2) of E7386, t1/2 is the time required for the concentration of the drug to reach half of its original value., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-12 hours postdose (Dose Escalation); Cycle 1-4 Day 1: 0-1 hours postdose (Dose Expansion) (each Cycle = 28 Days)|Apparent Total Body Clearance (CL/F) of E7386, CL/F is the volume of plasma cleared of drug per unit time., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-12 hours postdose (Dose Escalation); Cycle 1-4 Day 1: 0-1 hours postdose (Dose Expansion) (each Cycle = 28 Days)|Volume of Distribution (Vd) of E7386, Vd is the apparent volume in which a drug is distributed., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-12 hours postdose (Dose Escalation); Cycle 1-4 Day 1: 0-1 hours postdose (Dose Expansion) (each Cycle = 28 Days)|Renal Clearance (CLr) of E7386, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-24 hours postdose (Dose Escalation) (each Cycle = 28 Days)|Accumulation Ratio (R) of E7386, R indicates the extent to which drug accumulates., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-12 hours postdose (Dose Escalation); Cycle 1-4 Day 1: 0-1 hours postdose (Dose Expansion) (each Cycle = 28 Days)|Fraction Excreted (fe) of E7386, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-24 hours postdose (Dose Escalation) (each Cycle = 28 Days)
