Closed Intravenous Catheter System on Catheter Success, Length of Stay and Complications
Peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs) can be used frequently in pediatric hematology oncology patients. There are different types of PIVCs as open and closed. There are studies on adults using the closed IV catheter system, which is a type of PICK. However, no study was found in the literature in which the closed IV catheter system was used in the pediatric population.
Catheter Complications|Catheter Leakage
DEVICE: closed IV catheter system (BD Nexiva™)|DEVICE: open IV catheter (BD Insyte™ Autoguard™)
catheter indwelling time, time between catheter insertion and removal, during the catheterization|success of catheter placement, first IV attempt, at catheter insertion
development of catheter complications, infiltration, during the catheterization
The primary purpose of this research is; to evaluate the effect of two different catheter systems (closed IV catheter system: BD Nexiva™/ peripheral open IV catheter: BD Insyte™ Autoguard™) on catheter stay in pediatric hematology and oncology patients aged 1-12 years.

The secondary aim of the research is; to evaluate the effect of two different catheter systems on the success of catheter placement and the development of complications in the first attempt in pediatric hematology and oncology patients.
