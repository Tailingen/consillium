Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Spine Tumors
This study will evaluate the local control rate as well as acute and late toxicity rates of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of spine metastases and benign spine tumors.
Spinal Metastases|Vertebral Metastases|Benign Spinal Tumors|Chordoma|Meningioma|Schwannoma|Neurofibroma|Paragangliomas|Arteriovenous Malformations
RADIATION: SBRT for Benign Extradural Spine Tumors|RADIATION: SBRT for Vertebral/Paraspinal Metastases
Initial Symptom Control, Evaluation of pain relief per patient report, 6 weeks post-SBRT (or at first post-treatment follow-up)|Local Tumor Recurrence Rate, Local recurrence is defined as tumor recurrence or progression within the planning target volume.

Local control rate will be evaluated by imaging techniques and/or clinical symptoms (worsening or no improvement in pain or neurologic compromise). If follow-up imaging is available, a local recurrence will be defined as an increase of \> 20% in tumor size., (1) At 1 year post-SBRT, (2) At patient's last follow-up or time of death
Late Toxicity Rate, Toxicity will be assessed using CTCAE grading criteria at specified timepoints., at patient's last follow-up (at least 3 months from treatment) or time of death
This study is a single site, non-randomized, prospective, phase IV trial. Patients are composed of 2 groups:Spine Metastases OR Benign Spine Tumors. Data collected will include patient demographics, pathology data, tumor stage, SBRT dose fractionation scheme, dose received by adjacent critical normal tissues, tumor recurrence data, and acute and late toxicities.

Follow up data will be collected during the patient's standard office visits. The anticipated duration of this study is 5 years
