Role of Empathy in Curative Treatment Outcomes of Non-metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
The aim of project EMPACOL will be to investigate, while taking into consideration the clinical factors known and well described in the literature, among the non-clinical factors, in particular, patient-healthcare personnel (HCP) relationship, a link between HCP's empathy perceived by the patient, and the results of the curative treatment of non-metastatic colorectal cancer, throughout the patient's care.
Non-metastatic Colorectal Cancer|Empathy|Morbidity|Morality|Quality of Life
The main objective of the EMPACOL project is to investigate, in non-metastatic CRC patients, a possible correlation, between perceived HCP's empathy and survival (OS and DFS)., Based on the curative treatment strategy, patients with non-metastatic CRC will be divided into three groups: group 1 (surgery alone), group 2 (surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy), group 3 (neo-adjuvant therapy, surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy).

The relationship between patient-perceived HCP empathy after 2 years of inclusion and 5-year survival will be studied., 5 years of follow up
The relationship between caregiver empathy, as perceived by the patient, and quality of life (QoL) will be studied., Quality of life will be studied using the QLQ C-30 questionnaire., One year after the end of treatment
EMPACOL will be a multicenter prospective longitudinal study. Over a 2-year period, in two French areas covered by a cancer register, 8 centers will include patients with non-metastatic CRC, uncomplicated at diagnosis Based on the curative treatment strategy, patients will be divided into three groups: group 1 (surgery alone), group 2 (surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy), group 3 (neo-adjuvant therapy, surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy).

The relationship between HCP's empathy, perceived by the patient, after 2 years of inclusion, and the quality of life (QoL) at one year after the end of treatment will be investigated. QoL will be investigated using the QLQ C-30 questionnaire. Finally, a link between PHC perception and oncological outcomes will be sought.
