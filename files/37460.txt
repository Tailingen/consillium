Prostate Cancer
DRUG: flutamide|DRUG: goserelin acetate|RADIATION: low-LET cobalt-60 gamma ray therapy|RADIATION: low-LET photon therapy
OBJECTIVES: I. Compare locoregional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival in patients with carcinoma of the prostate who are considered at high risk of relapse and receive long-term adjuvant zoladex (ZDX) vs. no adjuvant treatment following neoadjuvant ZDX/flutamide and radiotherapy. II. Compare sexual function in patients treated with these two regimens.

OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Neoadjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy and Releasing Factor Agonist Therapy plus Radiotherapy. Flutamide, FLUT, NSC-147834; and Zoladex, ZDX, NSC-606864; plus external-beam irradiation using megavoltage equipment with energies of at least 4 MV (at least 6 MV preferred). Arm II: Neoadjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy and Releasing Factor Agonist Therapy plus Radiotherapy followed by Adjuvant Releasing Factor Agonist Therapy. FLUT; and ZDX; plus external-beam irradiation using equipment as in Arm I; followed by ZDX.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 1,508 patients will be accrued over 2 years.
