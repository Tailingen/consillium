A Retrospective Study on Extranodal Lymphoma or Lymphoma of Rare Pathological Types
The aim of this study is to retrospectively collect clinical information on patients with extranodal or rare lymphomas, and to explore the best treatment strategy for these lymphomas in the real-world population.

Lymphoma is a highly common malignant tumor in Asia. For specific extra-abdominal sites or rare pathological subtypes of lymphoma, traditional chemotherapy protocols often cannot provide satisfactory results for patients. This study aims to retrospectively collect clinical information on patients with extranodal lymphoma or rare pathological subtype lymphoma, including the distribution of involved sites, clinical and molecular characteristics of different lymphoma subtypes, clinical treatment protocols, and prognosis, to explore the best treatment strategy for these lymphomas in the real-world population.
