A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Anti-Tumor Activity of Englumafusp Alfa in Combination With Obinutuzumab and in Combination With Glofitamab Following a Pre-Treatment Dose of Obinutuzumab in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of englumafusp alfa (RO7227166) in participants with relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (r/r NHL). Englumafusp alfa will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with obinutuzumab and in combination with glofitamab. A fixed dose of obinutuzumab (Gpt; pre-treatment) will be administered up to seven days prior to the first administration of englumafusp alfa and seven days prior to the first administration of glofitamab. This entry-into-human study is divided into a dose-escalation stage (Part I and Part II) and a dose expansion stage (Part III).
