IPI-504 in NSCLC Patients With ALK Translocations
IPI-504 blocks a protein that is in cancer cells and is also in normal cells. This protein is called Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 helps protect certain other proteins from being destroyed by cells. These proteins can mutate to give off signals that allow cancer cells to keep growing. By blocking the function of Hsp90, we hope that the cancer cell will block the mutated protein and cause the cancer cells to die. This drug have been used in other research studies and in the laboratory and information from those other research studies suggests that thsi drug may help to treat lung cancer with ALK mutations. In this research study, we are looking to see what effects IPI-504 has in patients with lung cancer who have an ALK mutation.

DRUG: IPI-504
Response Rate, The response rate was defined as the number of patients achieving a RECIST 1.0 defined response divided by the number of patients treated and was to be calculated separately for each arm. A response by RECIST criteria means that the pre-defined target lesions (sum of the longest diameters) had to decrease by 30% or more and this response needed to be confirmed on a second scan at least 4 weeks later., 2 years
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Further document the safety of this regimen. Treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by MedDRA coding terms and separate tabulations will be produced for treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-emergent serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and treatment-emergent events of at least Grade 3 severity. A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as an adverse event that was deemed to be related to the study intervention., 2 years
* Participants will receive the study drug (IPI-504) twice weekly for two weeks followed by 10 days without study treatment. This 3-week period is called a cycle. Participants will receive a total of 4 doses per cycle. On the days the participant receives study drug, they will come to the clinic and be given the IPI-504 by being. Participants will continue to receive study drug for additional cycles as long as they are benefiting from it and do not experience any severe side effects.
* Participants will have CT scans to assess the size and location of their tumor. They may also have a PET scan or a combination of PET/CT scans. Imaging will be done at the beginning of treatment and every five to six weeks while on study to assess how the tumor is responding to IPI-504.
* The following tests and procedures will be done on the prior to the first dose of IPI-504: physical examination, vital signs, routine blood tests, EKGs, serum or urine pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential).
* After the first dose of IPI-504, the following tests and procedures will be done: EKGs, vital signs (pulse only).
* For all other visit days throughout the study, the following exams, tests and procedures will be done: physical examination, vital signs, blood tests, tumor imaging assessments, MRI of the brain (if applicable), review of medications and answer questions about any side effects or changes in health.
* After the final dose of study drug the following tests and procedures will be done within 30 days: physical examination, ECOG Performance status, blood tests, review of medications and answer questions about any side effects of changes in health.
