Outcome of Dental Implant Therapy in Patients Treated With Antiresorptive Medication
Aim of the study is to examine the feasibility of dental implant insertion in patients receiving high, adjuvant and low dose \> 4 years.

PROCEDURE: Dental implant surgery|PROCEDURE: Prosthetic treatment
Dental implant survival, Defined as presence of the implant in the jaw after initial implant surgery before abutment surgery, 3 months|Dental implant survival, Defined as presence of the implant at time of final prosthetics, 6 months|Dental implant survival, Defined as presence of the implant 1 year after loading of the final prosthetics, 18 months|Dental implant survival, Defined as presence of the implant 2 years after loading of the final prosthetics, 30 months|Dental Implant success, Defined as less marginal bone loss than 1.5 mm the first year, and 0.2 mm per year thereafter at time of assessment, 30 months|Absence of medical related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), Defined as no exposed bone, no fistula, no radiologic sign of MRONJ, 30 months
Oral Health Impact Profile, Using OHIP-14 questionnaire to evaluate oral health-related quality of life, 30 months|EORTC QLQ-H&N 35, Performance of the EORTC questionnaire for the assessment of quality of life in head and neck cancer patients, 30 months
The hypothesis of the present study is that dental implant therapy using submerged healing is feasible and predictable in patients receiving high, adjuvant or low dose AR for more than 4 years, as documented by clinical and radiographic signs of osseointegration after 3-4 months, sufficient implant stability for abutment connection, and implant survival rates comparable to those of healthy individuals after one year of prosthetic loading.
