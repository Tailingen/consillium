Bortezomib and Bevacizumab ("BB-mib-mab") in Patients With Advanced or Recurrent Renal Cell Cancer (RCC)
This research study is for subjects with cancer of the kidney (also known as renal cell carcinoma) that cannot be treated with surgery. The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of bevacizumab and bortezomib is safe and tolerable and can help people with kidney cancer. The investigators would also like to find out what dose of the study drugs can be used safely and effectively, whether the combination of these two drugs can decrease cancer symptoms and stop tumor growth, and how frequently serious side effects might occur with this combination.

The study will be conducted in two phases-Phase 1 and Phase 2. In Phase 1, subjects will be assigned to a fixed dose of bevacizumab and different strengths of bortezomib given at 2 different schedules. Phase 2 will depend on how subjects tolerate the doses and schedules of bortezomib in Phase 1.

Bortezomib is a type of drug known as a "proteasome inhibitor." By blocking the "proteasome" in cancer cells, bortezomib affects the way these cells divide. Bevacizumab is an inhibitor (blocker) of blood vessel formation. Tumors need blood vessels in order to continue to grow and bevacizumab is thought to work by preventing new blood vessels from growing.

Bortezomib (also called Velcade or PS-341) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of myeloma, but has not been approved for the treatment of kidney cancer. Bevacizumab (also called Avastin) has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of colon cancer, but has not been approved for the treatment of kidney cancer. However, the FDA is permitting the combined use of bortezomib and bevacizumab in this research study.

The bevacizumab that will be given in this study is not a commercially marketed product. Although it is expected to be very similar in safety and activity to the commercially available drug, it is possible that some differences may exist. Because this is not a commercially marketed drug, bevacizumab can only be administered to subjects enrolled in this study and may only be administered under the direction of physicians who are investigators in this study.

Approximately 40-52 subjects will take part in this study.
