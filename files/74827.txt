Value of Pharmacokinetic Assays in the Prediction of Induction and Maintenance Therapeutic Response in Crohn's Disease
Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a monoclonal antibody which has shown its efficacy in Crohn's disease by inducing and maintaining clinical response/remission. The French marketing authorization was obtained for Crohn's disease in patients in failure with anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) agents.

For Crohn's disease patients treated with vedolizumab, a strong association between vedolizumab serum levels and clinical response to induction and maintenance was demonstrated by anterior studies.

It could be of paramount interest to early identify Crohn's Disease patients under vedolizumab who will be responders to vedolizumab induction and to identify those who will achieve clinical remission under maintenance therapy with vedolizumab.

Researchers decided to assess the clinical response to vedolizumab induction at week 10. For clinically non-responders at week 10, an additional dose of 300 mg of vedolizumab will be infused at week 10 and then every four weeks.

Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the heterodimer alpha 4 beta 7 integrin and which has shown its efficacy in Crohn's disease by inducing and maintaining clinical response/remission. The French marketing authorization was obtained for Crohn's disease in patients in failure with anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) agents.

For Crohn's disease patients treated with vedolizumab, a strong association between vedolizumab serum levels and clinical response to induction and maintenance was demonstrated by anterior studies.

It could be of paramount interest to early identify Crohn's Disease patients under vedolizumab who will be responders to vedolizumab induction and to identify those who will achieve clinical remission under maintenance therapy with vedolizumab.

Researchers decided to assess the clinical response to vedolizumab induction at week 10, as the Gemini III trial has reported, among patients who had experienced previous TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) antagonist failure. 15% of those given vedolizumab were in remission at week 6 (P=0.433) versus 12% under placebo. At week 10, 26% under vedolizumab were in remission versus 12% in the placebo arm.

Moreover, at week 10, the proportion of patients presenting a clinical response was significantly higher in Crohn's Disease patients treated with vedolizumab (46% vs 24%).

In this study, for clinically non-responders at week 10, an additional dose of 300 mg of vedolizumab will be infused at week 10 and then every four weeks. In a post hoc analysis of GEMINI 2, additional dose of vedolizumab in patients clinically non responders to vedolizumab obtained a clinical remission in 33% of case.
