Safety Part: Number of Subjects Experiencing DLTs (Dose Limiting Toxicity), DLT was defined as any Grade 4 hematologic toxicity or Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity assessed as related to trial treatment by the Investigator and/or Sponsor and confirmed by the safety monitoring committee (SMC) to be relevant to the combination treatment within the first cycle of therapy. Any Grade 3 or 4 non haematological toxicity, any Grade 4 hematological toxicity, treatment related deaths within the first 2 weeks of therapy. Toxicities excluded from DLT: alopecia, rash, nausea, vomiting and hypomagnesemia of Grade 3 or 4 severity, Grade 4 neutropenia or leukopenia lasting for =\< 5 days and not associated with fever; Single laboratory values out of normal range without any clinical correlation and resolve within 7 days; Grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea without adequate supportive care. Adequate supportive care has been administered and Grade 4 diarrhea persists (investigator decision); isolated Grade 4 lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia without clinical correlation., Time from the first dose of study drug up to 2 weeks|Randomized Part: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the randomization date to first documented sign of objective radio-graphic disease progression (PD) as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1. (RECIST 1.0) or death from any cause if reported within 12 weeks from the last tumor assessment. PD per RECIST v 1.0 was defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as the reference the smallest sum of longest diameters recorded since treatment started, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesion or appearance of new lesions. Subjects who did not progress or died at the time of analyses, or subjects who died without previously radio-graphically documented PD and death was observed after more than 12 weeks of last tumor assessment without progression, these subjects were censored at their last tumor assessment date or date of randomization, whichever occurred last., Time from randomization until progressive disease or death; assessed up to 18 months (i.e data cut-off date: 09 Oct 2013)
Overall Survival (OS) Time, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For subjects who were still alive at the analysis cut off date or lost to follow up, survival was censored at the last recorded date the subject was known to be alive or at the analysis cut off date, whichever occurred first., Time from randomization until death assessed up to 18 months (i.e data cut-off date: 09 Oct 2013)|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of objective radiographic disease progression (PD). PD per RECIST v 1.0 was defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as the reference the smallest sum of longest diameters recorded since treatment started, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesion or appearance of new lesions. For subjects who did not progress or who were without any post baseline tumor assessment, TTP was censored at their last tumor assessment date, or at the randomization date, whichever occurred last., Time from randomization until disease progression assessed up to 18 months (i.e data cut-off date: 09 Oct 2013)|Number of Subjects With Tumor Response, Tumor response was defined as the presence of at least 1 confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) as judged by RECIST version 1.0. CR was defined for target lesions (TLs) as the disappearance of all lesions, and for non-target lesions (NTLs) as the disappearance of all non-target non-measurable lesions and/or normalization of serum levels of tumor markers. PR was defined for TLs as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease from baseline (BL) in the sum of longest diameter (SLD) of TLs., Time from randomization up to 18 months (i.e data cut-off date: 09 Oct 2013)|Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), TTF was defined as the time from randomization to treatment discontinuation for any reason. For subjects on drug at the analysis cut off date or lost to follow up, TTF was censored at the trial discontinuation date or at the analysis cut off date, whichever occurred first., Time from randomization until discontinuation assessed up to 18 months (i.e data cut-off date: 09 Oct 2013)
