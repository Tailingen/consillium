Simultaneous Cochlear Implantation During Translabyrinthine Resection of Vestibular Schwannoma
This study will address the feasibility of simultaneous cochlear implantation during resection of a vestibular schwannoma.
Vestibular Schwannoma|Cochlear Implantation
DEVICE: Cochlear implant
Measurement of Hearing Parameters, Audiologist assesses changes in understanding of the AzBio test (words in quiet and words in background noise) post cochlear implantation., 1 month, 3 months and 6 months postoperatively.|Measurement of Hearing Parameters, Audiologist assesses changes in understanding of 50 random consonant-nucleus-consonant sounds., 1 month, 3 months and 6 months postoperatively.|Measurement of Hearing Parameters, Audiologist assesses changes in understanding changes in understanding of Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing., 1 month, 3 months and 6 months postoperatively.
Measurement of Change of Physical Symptoms Associated with Hearing Loss, Patients will complete the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively|Assessment of Change of Physical Symptoms Associated with Hearing Loss, Patients will complete the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively|Assessment of incision site healing, Surgeon evaluates wound hearing over 3 months, 1 week, and 1 and 3 months postoperatively
This is prospective study patients undergoing a translabyrinthine resection for a vestibular schwannoma with intact hearing in the contralateral ear. During surgery, simultaneous cochlear implantation will be performed if the cochlear nerve can be identified and preserved during the resection.

Relevant data to be collected will include patient demographics, details related to the vestibular schwannoma including side, size, symptoms (specifically pre-operative hearing loss, degree of tinnitus), and status of hearing in the contralateral ear. Surgical details to be recorded will include date of surgery, surgical time, and whether the cochlear nerve was identified and preserved. Details related to the post-operative course to be recorded include length of stay in the hospital, post-operative complications such as wound infection or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak, and need for revision or additional procedures.
