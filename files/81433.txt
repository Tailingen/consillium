A Clinical Study of VA-CAG as Induction Therapy in Newly Diagnosed AML Patients
This study aims to assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine and CAG(VA-CAG) as induction regimen in newly diagnosed young patients with acute myeloid leukemia(AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Venetoclax in combination with azacitidine and CAG
Overall response rate (ORR), The overall remission rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of patients who achieved complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), or morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS) per the International Working Group criteria for AML., At the end of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 of induction(each cycle is 28 days)
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (>=grade 3 ), Safety and tolerability analysis will be assessed by the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 2 years|Duration of myelosuppression, The duration of absolute value of peripheral blood neutrophils \<0.5×10\^9/L and platelet count \<50×10\^9/L during myelosuppression., Up to 2 years|Leukaemia-free survival, Leukaemia-free survival will be defined as the time since date of CR until either relapse or death in remission., Up to 2 years|Overall survival, Overall Survival will be defined as the time from administration of the initial doses until death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Rate of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negativity, Percentage of participants who converted to MRD \< 10\^-3 by flow cytometry before initiation of consolidation therapy., Up to 2 years
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase II clinical trial to assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine (VA) and CAG (G-CSF priming, low dose cytarabine, and aclarubicin) as induction regimen in newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

The combination of venetoclax and azacitidine is the standard therapy for elderly (\> 60 year old) patients with newly diagnosed AML who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. Previous studies have shown that venetoclax plus intense chemotherapy represent promising efficacy in de novo AML patients with high complete remission rates and good tolerance. The preliminary results suggest that venetoclax in combination with azacitidine and CAG are well tolerated and effective for newly diagnosed young patients with AML. Thus, this phase II clinical trial is going to further explore its efficacy and safety. It is expected that about 100 patients will take part in this trial.
