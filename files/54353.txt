Phase 1 Trial of BTM-3566 in Relapsed/Refractory Mature B Cell Lymphomas
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if BMT-3566 can safety be given to adult patients with relapsed or refractory mature b cell lymphomas. It will also learn how well BTM-3566 works to treat relapsed or refractory mature b cell lymphomas. The main questions it aims to answer are:

What are the side effects of BTM-3566 at different doses? What are the levels of BTM-3566 in the blood at different timepoints around dosing? What is the clinical benefit of BTM-3566 in treating cancer (i.e. how well does it slow or stop disease progression)?

Participants will:

Take BTM-3566 in 14-day periods with 7 days of dosing followed by 7 days of no dosing Visit the clinic regularly for checkups and tests Keep a diary of their dosing and weight

This is an open label, phase 1 dose escalation trial of BTM-3566 in relapsed/refractory mature b cell lymphomas. Dose escalation will utilize traditional 3+3 methodology to determine the maximum tolerated dose of BTM-3566. Treatment will be given as two-week cycles, with BTM-3566 taken daily during the first week of the cycle, and the second week 'off therapy'. DLT window will be the first two cycles of therapy (days 1 to 28). All enrolled patients will undergo a baseline FDG-PET/CT scan within 3 weeks prior to starting therapy. FDG-PET/CT will be repeated at the start of Cycles 3 and 5 or more frequently as clinically indicated. Beginning at Cycle 5, imaging will be repeated every 3 months (or as clinically indicated) for up to 12 months, and every 6 months thereafter, until disease progression or start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy.
