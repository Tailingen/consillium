The investigational drug being tested in this study is called MLN9708 also known as Ixazomib. This study will look at disease response rates and safety in people who take ixazomib in addition to cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone. NDMM participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of two treatment groups and RRMM participants will be assigned to a third group:

* NDMM - ixazomib (MLN9708) 4.0 mg + cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m\^2 + dexamethasone 40 mg
* NDMM - ixazomib (MLN9708) 4.0 mg + cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m\^2 + dexamethasone 40 mg
* RRMM - ixazomib (MLN9708) 4.0 mg + cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m\^2 + dexamethasone 40 mg

The study enrolled 148 participants. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United States, European Union, and Australia.
