HOBSCOTCH-CA (HOme-Based Self-management and COgnitive Training CHanges Lives in Brain CAncer)
The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of the home-based intervention, HOBSCOTCH-CA, to improve the quality of life and cognitive function in Service Members, Veterans and civilians who are survivors of brain cancer or a brain tumor (CA participants). This study will also assess the ability of the HOBSCOTCH-CA program to improve quality of life in caregivers of patients with brain cancer/tumor and to reduce caregiver burden. Enrolling with a Caregiver is optional for CA participants.

Investigators will compare two groups of CA participants and their Caregiver (enrolling with a Caregiver is optional): one who receives HOBSCOCTCH-CA immediately (Group 1) and another group that will receive HOBSCOTCH-CA (Group 2) after a 3-month waiting period. Participants will be in the study for about 6 months total.

HOBSCOTCH-CA involves 45 to 60 minute one on one virtual sessions with a certified Cognitive Coach including a "pre" program session and 8 weekly sessions thereafter. Participants will learn about problem solving therapy and mindfulness or relaxation training. CA participants are asked to do short homework assignments and keep a brief daily diary on a smart phone app. All participants complete study questionnaires or surveys at enrollment, 3 months later and at 6 months (at the end of the study).

The investigators' hypothesis is that the home-based intervention (HOBSCOTCH-CA) will improve quality of life and cognitive function in Service Members, Veterans and civilians with who are survivors of brain cancer or tumor. Also, that the integration of family caregiver participation in the HOBSCOTCH-CA intervention will reduce caregiver burden and increase caregiver knowledge of their loved one's disease and the cognitive challenges they face, ultimately leading to an improvement in caregiver quality of life (QOL).

The investigators will test the hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims:

Aim 1: Adapt the HOBSCOTCH program education module for delivery to patients with brain cancer/tumor (CA participant) and cognitive challenges.

The investigators' working hypothesis is that the existing education module of the HOBSCOTCH program can be adapted to address key knowledge areas for patients with brain cancer/tumor and their caregivers.

Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of the HOBSCOTCH-CA program in patients with brain cancer/tumor.

The investigators' working hypothesis is that the HOBSCOTCH-CA intervention will improve quality of life (QOL) in CA participants. The investigators also expect to see improvements in subjective cognition, knowledge, self-efficacy, symptom reduction, and health outcomes.

Aim 3: Incorporate family caregivers into select components of the HOBSCOTCH-CA intervention and evaluate the effects of the HOBSCOTCH-CA intervention on the caregiver.

The investigator's working hypothesis is that family caregivers will have improvement in QOL and reduced caregiver burden and improved health status as a result of their family member with CA participating in the HOBSCOTCH-CA intervention, and by their own participation in the HOBSCOTCH-CA modules delivering disease specific education and mindfulness skill building exercises.
