Durvalumab in Combination With Docetaxel, Cisplatin and 5-FU for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The prognosis of patients with locally advanced SCCHN is poor. Results of recent randomized trials evaluating induction chemotherapy by docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 fluorouracil are conflicting, and benefit on overall survival is uncertain. Improve efficacy of induction chemotherapy is important without increase toxicities. Durvalumab is a promising agent in SSCHN. The safety of combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, 5 fluorouracil with durvalumab is unknown.

The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and the safety of the association of DCF (standard regimen for induction in SSCCHN) and durvalumab. The safety profile of DCF and durvalumab are different, so the expected toxicities should not be additive. The addition of durvalumab to DCF could improve the efficacy of induction chemotherapy and the prognostic of patients with SSCCHN.

Concerning the translational research, the aim will be to explore the relationships between immune capacity, specificity, activation state and clinical outcome to help elucidate the determinants of response to immunotherapy.
