A Study of DSP-0337 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors to Determine the Safety and the Pharmacokinetic Profile
This is a Phase 1, open label, multi-center study of orally administered DSP-0337 in adult subjects with advance solid tumors that are refractory to standard treatment, or for whom no effective therapy exists.
Neoplasms
DRUG: DSP-0337
Maximum tolerated dose by assessing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Dose escalating cohort, 4 weeks|Determination of the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) by assessing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Dose escalating cohort, 4 weeks
Number of Patients with Adverse Events, Tolerability will be evaluated based on the adverse events (AEs) recorded at each contact with the patient, physical examinations, and the results of laboratory tests. Toxicity will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03., 12 months|Pharmacokinetics by assessing drug concentration in blood, For food effect, dose escalating cohort, 4 weeks|Urine excretion of napabucasin after DSP-0337 administration, Twenty four-hour urine will be collected and excretion of napabucasin will be evaluated., 24 hours|Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response or partial response (CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1., 6 months|Time to progression (TTP), Defined as the time from first dose to the earlier date of assessment of progression by RECIST v1.1., 6 months|Progression free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from first dose to the earlier date of assessment of progression or death by any cause in the absence of progression by RECIST v1.1., 12 months
Exploratory pharmacodynamic evaluation, including phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) expression level in patient-derived tumor tissue, as potential biomarkers, 12 months
The study is comprised of two parts: an initial dose escalation phase utilizing a 3 + 3 design to determine maximum tolerated dose followed by a dose expansion cohort in approximately 30 additional subjects. Study participants will initially receive DSP-0337 orally for 28 days (one cycle of treatment). If clinical benefit is seen, treatment can continue until disease progression.
