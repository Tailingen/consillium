Evaluation of Prognostic Monitoring for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients
The relationship between immune inflammation-related protein complexes in blood of triple negative breast cancer patients and recurrence or metastasis of breast cancer will be studied.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
immune inflammation-related protein complexes, The change of immune inflammation-related protein complexes which is measured by gel permeation chromatography., 2 years|blood markers, The expression of CA153, CEA, CA125 in the blood of the patients, which are measured by electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay., 2 years
200 patients with triple negative breast cancer will be followed up. Peripheral venous blood was collected every 3 to 6 months. Change regularity of breast cancer-specific immune inflammation-related protein complexes in blood at different follow-up time points will be studied. The relationship between disease-specific protein complexes and pathological state of patients will be analyzed.
