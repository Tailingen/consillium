Clinical Study of CAR-T Technology for the Treatment of Relapsed Refractory Malignant Haematological Tumours
The trial is designed as an early exploratory single-centre, open, single-arm clinical trial. The trial is planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T for the treatment of relapsed refractory malignant haematological tumours. The trial is divided into five visit periods as follows: screening period, non-myeloablative pretreatment, short-term follow-up period, mid-term follow-up period and exit visit.
Hematological Malignancy
DRUG: CAR-T cell therapy
Incidence of treatment-related adverse events, Adverse events associated with CAR-T therapy, serious adverse events and clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities., Up to 36 months
CAR-T amplification levels, Characterisation of CAR-T cell expansion levels in subjects (peripheral blood, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid and lymph nodes, etc.) over time., Up to 36 months|Duration of the CAR-T, Duration of CAR-T cell persistence in subjects (peripheral blood, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid and lymph nodes, etc., Up to 36 months|Lymphocyte abatement, The characteristics of lymphocyte ablation in the subject., Up to 36 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients whose tumour volume shrinks to a pre-specified value and who are able to maintain the minimum timeframe required, as the sum of the proportions in complete and partial remission. Objective tumour remission rates at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year follow-up after treatment.It is the sum of the proportions of complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR)., Up to 6 months|Progression-free survival(PFS), Time from start of patient's treatment to disease progression or death from any cause, Up to 36 months|Event free survival (EFS), Time from the start of enrolment to the occurrence of any event., Up to 36 months
1) Screening period (-21 to -7 days, 2 weeks): subjects signed the informed consent form and completed a series of examinations, and it was judged by the investigator whether subjects met the inclusion criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria based on the results of the examinations and the inclusion/exclusion criteria. And the investigator will judge whether some of the examination results within one month before the date of informed consent are acceptable according to the patient's condition.

2) Non-myeloablative preconditioning (-4 to -1 days for 4 days): the need for preconditioning and the preconditioning regimen were decided based on the subject's condition, and the most commonly used regimen was the FC regimen. After returning to the study centre for admission at the time notified by the investigator, subjects received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide on days -4 to -2 of the trial; the drugs were discontinued for 1 day on day -1 and a series of tests were completed as baseline information for subjects after non-clear myeloid preconditioning;

3) Short-term follow-up period (visits 4 to 10: 0 to 180 days over a period of 6 months): subjects return to the study centre for a series of examinations every month for 6 months following the start of infusing back the expected dose of CAR-T cells on Day 0 of the trial. The investigator evaluates the short-term safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy based on the subjects' examination results;

4) Medium- to long-term follow-up period (180 to 360 days over a period of 6 months): subjects will return to the research centre every 2 months for a series of examinations within 6 months after completion of the short-term follow-up. The investigators will evaluate the mid- and long-term safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy based on the subjects' examination results;

5) Withdrawal Visit (at any time): all subjects may withdraw from this study at any stage of the trial, with or without providing a reason. If the subject withdraws from the study after the return of the CAR-T cells, he/she will be required to complete the examination items required for the withdrawal visit in the visit flowchart; if the subject withdraws from the visit prior to the return of the CAR-T cells, he/she will be required to complete the safety examination items only, and the reason for the subject's withdrawal will be recorded in detail by the investigator. If the subject stops treatment due to AE, the investigator will follow the subject for necessary safety visits until the subject's AE returns to baseline levels or reaches steady state.
