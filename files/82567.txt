Combined Rituximab and Lenalidomide Treatment for Untreated Patients With Follicular Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the combined treatment of lenalidomide and rituximab in controlling the Follicular Lymphoma disease and also increase the length of response compared to the available standard combination chemotherapy treatment for Follicular Lymphoma.
Follicular Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Rituximab-CHOP|DRUG: Rituximab-CVP|DRUG: Rituximab-Bendamustine
Complete Response Rate (CR/CRu) at 120 Weeks by Independent Central Review, The Complete Response Rate (CR/CRu) is the percentage of participants who achieve complete response (CR/CRu) at 120 weeks as assessed per Independent Central Review.

* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all evidence of disease.
* Complete Response Unconfirmed (CRu): Disappearance of all disease with the exception of residual lymph nodes that are 1.5 cm or less in greatest transverse diameter and/or indeterminate bone marrow findings., At 120 weeks|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization into the study to the first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause.

Progressive Disease (PD) is characterized by any of the following:

* An increase of at least 50% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters (SPD) of any previously identified abnormal lymph node(s) or other disease sites.
* The appearance of any new lesion during or after treatment.
* An increase of at least 50% in the longest diameter of a previously identified node that was 1 cm or more in its short axis.
* An increase of at least 50% in the size of other lesions (e.g., splenomegaly, hepatomegaly).

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates., From randomization into the study to the first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause (up to approximately 140 months).
Complete Response Rate (CR) at 120 Weeks Per Independent Central Review, The Complete Response Rate (CR) is the percentage of participants who achieve confirmed complete response (CR) at 120 weeks as assessed per Independent Central Review.

- Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all evidence of disease., At 120 weeks|Event-free Survival (EFS), Event Free Survival (EFS) is defined as the time a participant remains free from certain negative events (disease progression, relapse, initiation of a new anti-lymphoma treatment, or death) between the date of randomization to the date of first documented progression, relapse, and initiation of a new anti-lymphoma treatment or death by any cause. Responding participants and those lost to follow up were censored at their last tumor assessment date.

Progressive Disease (PD) is characterized by any of the following:

* An increase of at least 50% in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters (SPD) of any previously identified abnormal lymph node(s) or other disease sites.
* The appearance of any new lesion during or after treatment.
* An increase of at least 50% in the longest diameter of a previously identified node that was 1 cm or more in its short axis.
* An increase of at least 50% in the size of other lesions (e.g., splenomegaly, hepatomegaly).

Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates., From randomization to the date of first documented progression, relapse, and initiation of a new anti-lymphoma treatment or death by any cause (up to approximately 140 months).|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the median length of time a participant stays alive from randomization. Participants who died, regardless of the cause of death, were considered to have had an event. Participants who withdrew consent for the study were considered censored at the time of withdrawal. Participants who completed the study and were still alive at the time of the clinical data cut-off date were censored. All participants who were lost to follow-up prior to the clinical data cut-off date were also considered censored at the time of last contact. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates., From randomization to the date of death by any cause (up to approximately 144 months).|Time to Next Anti-Lymphoma Treatment (TTNLT), Time to Next Lymphoma Treatment (TTNLT) was measured from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented administration of any new anti-lymphoma treatment (such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, radio-immunotherapy, or immunotherapy). Participants who continued to respond to treatment or who were lost to follow-up were considered censored on their last visit date. Participants who died (due to any cause) before receiving a new anti-lymphoma treatment were included in the statistical analysis, with death being counted as an event. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates., From the date of randomization to the date of the first documented administration of any new anti-lymphoma treatment (up to approximately 140 months).
Follicular Lymphoma (FL) is a cancer of a B lymphocyte, a type of white blood cell. FL is typically a slowly progressing but incurable disease. Follicular lymphoma cells produce a specific defect in the patient's immune system impairing their ability to control their cancer. Lenalidomide has been shown to reverse the specific immune defect caused by FL in the patient. By including lenalidomide, the RELEVANCE study aims to eliminate the cancer while restoring the patient's immune competence.

The 'Relevance' cooperative group trial is being conducted as two companion studies: RV-FOL-GELARC-0683 (N=750) and RV-FOL-GELARC-0683C (N=250); the combined total of 1000 Follicular Lymphoma patients enrolled in both studies will be analyzed.
