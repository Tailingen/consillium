A Phase I Open-Label Dose Escalation Study of Intravenous INKmune In Patients With MDS or AML
INMB-INB16-002 is a Phase I open-label, dose escalation study of INKmune therapy in subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with excess blasts without Auer rods (EB-1 or 2, or CMML 1 or 2) or subjects with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in complete remission.

BIOLOGICAL: INKmune
Primary Objective 1, Identify the incidence and seriousness of AEs and their relationship (causality) to INKmune as graded by NCI CTCAE criteria v.5.0., 2-3 years|Primary Objective 2, Identify a RP2D of INKmune. The RP2D is defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the agent which will be defined as the dose at which the complication rate is less than 33%., 2-3 years
Secondary Objective 1, To assess the overall response rate by measuring changes in percentage blasts in PB at days 29, 43, 73, 119 and BM at day 29., 1-2 years|Secondary Objective 2, To assess the overall response rate, partial response rate or complete response rate in subjects administered INKmune using the WHO criteria by measuring changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and safety laboratory parameters throughout the study., 3-4 years|Secondary Objective 3, To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) time defined as time to increase in transfusion dependence and or increase in percentage blasts in Peripheral Blood (PB) and/or Bone Marrow (BM)., 2-3 years
Exploratory Objective 1, Assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) (proof of biology) of INKmune by analyzing NK cells obtained from peripheral blood, and bone marrow as available and to measure primed NK cells and cell kill ability using the tumour killing assay., 2-3 years
INMB-INB16-002 is a Phase 1 open-label, dose escalation study of INKmune therapy in subjects with MDS with excess blasts without Auer rods (EB-1 or 2, or CMML 1 or 2) who have completed treatment with Azacytidine (AZA) and not achieved complete remission (CR) and who are not thought to be fit for intensive chemotherapy, or subjects with AML in complete remission (or complete remission with incomplete count recovery) unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation or subjects with relapsed MDS or AML post-allogeneic stem cell transplant with slowly progressive disease unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy.
