Adjuvant Treatment in Premenopausal Breast Cancer
Multicentric retroprospective observational study to collect outcome in premenopausal breast cancer patients who undergone the 21-multigene assay Oncotype DX from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2022 and adjuvant treatment.
Breast Cancer Early Stage Breast Cancer (Stage 1-3)
Invasive Disease-Free Survival (iDFS) at 5 years, The primary endpoint of the study will be the invasive Disease-Free Survival (iDFS) at 5 years among pN0 and pN1 premenopausal breast cancer patients in subgroups formed according to their genomic risk according to 21- multigene assay Oncotype DX., up to 30 months
To describe the effect of the different adjuvant treatments according to clinical and genomic risk, Descriptive statistics, statistical measure of association, and logistic binomial regression modeling of the association measures between the iDFS at 5 years and explicative variables including adjuvant treatment received (chemo/endocrine therapy; endocrine therapy with or without OSF), pathological tumor status, and genomic risk score according to 21-multigene assay Oncotype DX., up to 30 months
Premenopausal patients who undergone the 21-multigene assay Oncotype DX from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2022 with any Recurrence Score (RS) and pathological nodal status pN0/pN1 will be included in the study. The study will collect clinical-pathological, genomic characteristics, adjuvant treatments (chemotherapy, endocrine therapy with/without OFS), and survival outcome (iDFS).
