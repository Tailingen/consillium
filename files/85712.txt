Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation for Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is one of the common complications of cancer patients after operation with a 8.9%-46.1% incidence, which severely affecting patients' postoperative recovery, increasing the medical cost, affecting the social function of patients, reducing the quality of life and increasing the mortality.

Surgical trauma and perioperative pain can induce systematic inflammatory response and release systematic inflammatory mediators, which can enter the central nervous system (CNS) and lead to CNS inflammatory. In order to prevent the development of POCD among elder patients, the discovery of effective interventions reducing perioperative pain and inflammatory response is important.

Transcutaneous Electrical Acupoint Stimulation (TEAS) is a non-invasive alternative to needle-based electro-acupuncture (EA). It combines the acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) by pasting the electrode piece on the acupoint instead of sticking the needles on the skin. TEAS can trigger the release of endogenous neurotransmitters, releasing endogenous analgesic substances, such as endorphins. TEAS also can reduce the intraoperative anesthetic consumption, postoperative pain score, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), and improve the postoperative recovery of patients. Recently, TEAS was found to improve the cognitive function of geriatric patients with silent lacunar infarction. However, the current TEAS mainly focus on intraoperative. The effect of perioperative TEAS on POCD is not clear.

Here, the effect of TEAS on POCD in geriatric adults undergoing radical resection of gastrointestinal tumors under general anesthesia was investigated to determine whether TEAS can decrease perioperative pain or inflammatory response to prevent the occurrence of POCD and to find out the relationship among perioperative TEAS, inflammatory response, postoperative pain, and POCD preliminarily.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of perioperative transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) on postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients who were diagnosed with gastrointestinal tumor and received radical resection of gastrointestinal tumors under general anesthesia and to determine the relationship among perioperative TEAS, inflammatory response, postoperative pain, and POCD preliminarily.
