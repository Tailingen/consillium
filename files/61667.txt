LDRT and Chemoimmunotherapy in NPC With Liver Metastasis
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of adding low-dose radiotherapy to chemoimmunotherapy as a first-line treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with liver metastasis.
Nasopharyngeal Cancinoma (NPC)
OTHER: Low-dose radiotherapy combine with chemoimmunotherapy
Intrahepatic progression-free survival (iPFS), Defined as the time from the start of therapy to the first progression in liver, 1 year
Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the start of therapy to documented local or regional relapse, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., 1 year|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from the start of therapy to death from any cause or censored at the date of last follow-up., 2 year|Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in all patients. According to RECIST 1.1 evaluation criteria, physicians use the efficacy evaluation record as the determination criteria, 18 weeks|Incidence rate of adverse events (AEs), Analysis of acute and late adverse events (AEs) are evaluated by CTCAE v5.0., 2 year
