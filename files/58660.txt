Study Evaluating Efficacy & Safety of Afuresertib Plus Fulvestrant in Patients w/ Locally Advanced or Metastatic HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer
Study LAE205INT3101 is a Phase Ib/III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy with afuresertib plus fulvestrant (afuresertib/placebo plus fulvestrant in Phase III) in patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer who have failed 1 to 2 prior lines of endocrine therapy, and/or CDK4/6 inhibitor (up to 1 therapy), and/or chemotherapy (up to 1 chemotherapy) as described in the inclusion criteria.

Eligible patients for this study must have either (1) progressive disease whilst receiving an endocrine therapy (AI or a SERM), and/or a CDK4/6 inhibitor for locally advanced or metastatic disease; or (2) relapsed with metastatic disease whilst receiving an ET (AI or SERM), and/or a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and/or chemotherapy in adjuvant setting. No more than 2 prior lines of systemic treatments for locally advanced or metastatic disease are allowed for this study, including 1-2 prior lines of endocrine therapy, with/without CDK4/6 inhibitor (up to 1 therapy), and/or chemotherapy (up to 1 therapy).
