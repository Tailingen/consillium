Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Idelalisib in Combination With Bendamustine and Rituximab for Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) (Tugela )
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the addition of idelalisib (formerly GS-1101) to bendamustine + rituximab (BR) on progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Idelalisib|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Placebo to match idelalisib
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the interval from randomization to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause. PFS (months) = (minimum (date of disease progression, date of death) - date of randomization + 1)/30.4375., Up to 84 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was the percentage of participants who achieved a complete response (CR), CR with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi,) or partial response (PR) and maintained the response for at least 12 weeks. CR was defined as no lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly; normal complete blood count; confirmed by bone marrow aspirate \& biopsy.

PR was defined as \>1 of the following criteria: a 50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, liver size, spleen size; plus ≥ 1 of the following: ≥ 1500/μL absolute neutrophil count, \> 100000/μL platelets, \> 11.0 g/dL hemoglobin or 50% improvement for either of these parameters without transfusions or growth factors. CRi was defined as all criteria for CR met but with persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia or a hypocellular bone marrow., Up to 84 months|Lymph Node Response Rate, Lymph node response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of index lesions., Up to 84 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval from randomization to death from any cause. Overall survival (months) = (date of death - date of randomization + 1)/30.4375., Up to 84 months|Complete Response Rate, Complete response (CR) rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a CR., Up to 84 months
