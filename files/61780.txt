A Study of HMPL-306 in Advanced Solid Tumors With IDH Mutations
An open label single-arm clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of HMPL-306 in advanced or metastatic solid tumors with IDH mutation.
Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Gene Mutation
DRUG: HMPL-306
Part 1: Number of Subjects with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT is defined as an adverse event (AE) that meets protocol defined DLT criteria during cycle 1 and is at least possibly related to study drug., Up to 28 days after first dose of study drug|Part 1 and Part 2: Frequency and severity of AEs, From the first dose of the study drug to 37 days after the last dose of study drug
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with confirmed best overall tumor response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)., From first dose of study drug to the time of progressive disease, assessed up to 36 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is the proportion of subjects with stable disease (SD), confirmed PR or confirmed CR (CR+PR+SD)., From first dose of study drug to the time of progressive disease, assessed up to 36 months|Duration of response (DoR), DoR defined as the time from the date of the first CR or PR to the first date of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause., From first dose of study drug to the time of disease relapse or death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 36 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from first dose date of study drug to date of progression or date of death from any cause, whichever occurred first., From first dose of study drug to the time of progressive disease or death due to any causes, whichever comes first, assessed up to 36 months|Maximum serum drug concentration, Blood samples will be obtained from all patients for determination of the maximum serum concentration of HMPL-306, PK weeks at screening through safety follow-up, assessed up to 36 months|Time to maximum concentration, Blood samples will be obtained from all patients for determination time to maximum concentration of HMPL-306, PK weeks at screening through safety follow-up, assessed up to 36 months|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Blood samples will be obtained from all patients for determination of the AUC of HMPL-306, PK weeks at screening through safety follow-up, assessed up to 36 months
HMPL-306 is a dual IDH1/2 inhibitor

This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HMPL-306 administered orally in the treatment of subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with IDH mutation. The study consists of 2 parts: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion). The dose escalation part will determine the MTD/RP2D. The dose expansion part will administer the MTD/RP2D to mIDH-positive solid tumor malignancies including, but not limited to, cholangiocarcinoma, skeletal chondrosarcoma, low-grade glioma, perioperative low-grade glioma
