Neoadjuvant CIETAI With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Local Advanced Rectal Cancer
To increase the efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-1/PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in local advanced rectal cancer (LARC), we propose preoperative arterial infusion of Tirellizumab and oxaliplatin followed by tumor artery embolization with concurrent chemoradiotherapy as neoadjuvant regimen for LARC.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: CIETAI-R
Pathologic complete response (pCR), 4 months
disease-free survival (DFS), 2 years|overall survival (OS), 3 years
Based our previous multi-center randomized controlled study (Preoperative arterial perfusion Chemo- embolization combined with radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer, NCT03601156), the idea of "preoperative arterial chemo-immuno-embolization combined with radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer (CIETAI-R)" was proposed. This is also the serial study of CIETAI that explore the efficacy of tumor arterial chemo-immuno-embolization in lung cancer, LARC, metastatic liver cancer.
