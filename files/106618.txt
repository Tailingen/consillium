Microtransplantation Combined With Azacytidine to Improve the Efficacy of EAML
Patients enrolled from each center according to confirmed criteria specified in cooperative scheme are recieved induction and consolidation chemotherapy with microtransplantation . Observe the remission rate and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival(OS) rate.
Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: microtransplantation, HLA-mismatched donor peripheral stem cell infusion|DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Venetoclax
the remission rate, ①bone marrow: blasts \<5% (with a count of at least 200 Nucleated cells).②Hemogram: absolute neutrophil count of more than 1.0×109/L，platelets of \>100×109/L. ③Clinical: Without the signs and symptoms caused by leukemia infiltration d , and independent of transfusion;, 2month
Disease Free Survival, Measured from complete remission to the date of death or the date of last follow-up examination;, 2 year|Overall Survival, measured from the Date of beginning therapy to the date of death or the date of last follow-up examination;, 2 year
treatment-related mortality, Early mortality: death within 4 weeks after initiation of induction therapy, 2 year
Microtransplantation, which combines chemotherapy with adoptive infusion of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized HLA-mismatched peripheral blood stem cells (GPBSC). Data from more than 70 elderly AML patients who received microtransplantation in Beijing showed that the remission rate and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) reach 75-82% and 32-39% respectively, and microchimerisms (donor cells\<1%) were detected without GVHD. The results have been clinically validated in several other centers in China, United States and Australia.

In this study, azacytidine, decitabine, BCL / 2 inhibitor and other drugs combined with micro transplantation were used in elderly AML in order to improve the curative effect.
