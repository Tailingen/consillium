A Study of Neutropenia and Anemia Management in Patients With Solid Tumors Receiving Myelotoxic Chemotherapy
The primary objective was to describe the incidence of febrile neutropenia based on granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) use (primary, secondary, treatment, or no usage) in patients receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy.

This is a multi-center international observational study of patients receiving myelotoxic regimens, with an investigator assessed risk of febrile neutropenia ≥ 20%, for the treatment of solid tumors (breast, ovarian and lung).

This is an observational study in which patient risk factors were qualitatively (but not quantitatively) assessed, and adherence to G-CSF primary prophylaxis was at the discretion of physicians and not mandated by the protocol.
