Clinical Characteristics of Lymphatic Malformations
The primary purpose of this study is to retrospectively identify the clinical characteristics of abdominal lymphatic malformations (ALMs) in our single center in China. The second objective of this study is to retrospectively compare the epidemiological features, clinical presentations, cyst properties, surgical treatments, and risk factors for preoperative complications of ALMs between paediatric participants and adult participants.

Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are vascular anomalies that arise from abnormal embryonic development of the lymphatic system and can present as dilated lymphatic channels or cysts lined by lymphatic endothelial cells. Abdominal lymphatic malformations (ALMs) are rare entities that account for fewer than 10% of LMs and may occur not only in the tissues or organs in the abdominal cavity, such as the mesentery, spleen and pancreas but also in the retroperitoneal space. ALMs can manifest as an infection, chronic abdominal discomfort, acute abdomen, or fatal disease.
