A Study of Oral 7HP349 (Alintegimod) in Combination with Ipilimumab Followed by Nivolumab Monotherapy
This study is an open-label Phase Ib (Part A) dose escalation followed by a blinded, randomized, multi cohort Phase 2a (Part B) comparison of combination vs. reference regimens.

Currently study will only be enrolling the Phase 1b and the Phase 2a protocol requirements will be added to the study near completion of the Phase 1b

This Phase study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of oral Alintegimod (Alintegimod) alone, and then in combination with ipilimumab for, followed by nivolumab monotherapy cycles. All patients will receive nivolumab after completion of treatment with Alintegimod plus ipilimumab combination therapy to continue nivolumab treatment until the end of study (12 months) unless progression or toxicity result in early termination.
