A Study of Second Look Laparoscopy (SLL) in People With Ovarian Cancer Who Have Completed Their First Course of Chemotherapy
The researchers are doing this study to look at the health outcomes of people with advanced ovarian cancer who have a second look laparoscopy (SLL) after they complete their first course of chemotherapy. The researchers will compare the health outcomes of people who have minimal residual disease (MRD-small amounts of cancer cells in the body after a person receives treatment) at the time of SLL with the health outcomes of people who do not have MRD at the time of SLL. The researchers are also doing this study to determine if SLL is safe and practical (feasible) in people with advanced ovarian cancer who have completed the first course of therapy for their disease.
Ovarian Cancer
PROCEDURE: Second Look Laparoscopy
minimal residual disease (MRD) status, will be based on surgicopathological findings from multiple biopsies and peritoneal cytology obtained during the SLL procedure, up to 12 weeks
