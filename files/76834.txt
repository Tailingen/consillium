AVAdeno Study: An Observational Study of First-Line Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Patients With Adenocarcinoma of the Lung
This prospective observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line Avastin (bevacizumab) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in different age groups (\<60, 60-69, 70-79, \>80 years) in patients with inoperable advanced, metastatic or recurrent adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer. Patients will be followed for 18 months from the start of first-line therapy.
