Debulking Effect of Curretage on Basal Cell Carcinomas - a Histological Assessment.
The aim of this study was to compare histologically observed tumour infitration of basal cell carcinoma (bcc) lesions before and after curretage.A significant reduction of tumour depth would enable further bcc's included for superficial non-invasive treatment modalities such as topical photodynamic therapy.
Carcinoma, Basal Cell
PROCEDURE: Curretage
Reduction of tumour thickness 0,5mm or more after curretage, 1 hour
Comparison of tumour thickness in punch biopsies performed on referral, before and after curretage., 3 months
