Study to Learn if 200mg Test Drug (Fostamatinib) Helps People With Large B-Cell Lymphoma,a Type of Blood Cancer
This study will evaluate the effectiveness of fostamatinib (200 mg twice a day) in patients with worsening or unmanageable lymphoma with a specific type of lymphoma called Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (abbreviated as DLBCL)
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Fostamatinib
Objective Response Rate, Patients were assessed using the revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson). Patients were assessed for response, with CT and FDG-PET scans at 8 weeks, then every 12 weeks until radiological progression by clinical CT. Complete response (CR) was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions in the liver and spleen and all lymph node masses regressed to normal size. Partial response (PR) was defined as â‰¥50% reduction in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) for measured lymph nodes, splenic and liver lesions separately compared to baseline SPD. Objective response rate (CR + PR) analysis, exact binomial test, primary analysis., Week 8
