Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1., At month 6 after the last patient's first dose (approximately 18 months).
Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until date of documented progression per RECIST 1.1., Up to 30 months|Time to response (TTR), Time to response (TTR) is defined as the time from the start of treatment until the date of first documented objective response per RECIST 1.1., Up to 30 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR at 18 weeks is defined as the percentage of participants who have a CR or PR or who have stable disease (SD) for at least 17 weeks per RECIST 1.1., At month 6 after the last patient's first dose (approximately 18 months).|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from the start of treatment until progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., Up to 30 months|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from the start of treatment until the date of death due to any cause., Up to 30 months|Number and percentage of AEs in patients receiving Ceralasertib and Durvalumab combination, The safety and tolerability profile of Ceralasertib and Durvalumab combination will be evaluated using vital signs, laboratory data, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and adverse event data, Up to 30 months
This is a single-arm study, all participants will be assigned to one treatment group - ceralasertib plus durvalumab combination therapy. Each 28-day cycle will begin with ceralasertib administered orally followed by durvalumab administered intravenously.

The objectives of the current single-arm local study are to estimate the efficacy and safety of ceralasertib and durvalumab combination in local population to obtain relevant information for routine clinical practice. The results of this additional study will provide clinical data on efficacy and safety of an innovation drug in the new region - Russian Federation.
