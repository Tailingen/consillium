Diffuse Large B-Cell lymphoma is currently used as a standard treatment, with a combination of chemotherapy (R-CHOP), which includes Rituximab. However, the survival rate is very poor if the primary treatment is refractory or relapsed within a year or less. The duration of these patients ' lives is around one year and the five-year survival rate is 15-20 %. Thus, a new treatment strategy is needed to improve the survival of the patient with DLBCL, which are either refractory and relapsed.
