Study of KRAS Neoantigen mRNA Vaccine (ABO2102) in Patients With KRAS -Mutated Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics, as well as preliminary efficacy of KRAS neoantigen mRNA vaccine (ABO2102) alone and in combination with toripalimab (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) among participants with KRAS-mutated advanced pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors. The trial includes dose escalation (Part I) and dose expansion(Part II) parts.
