Busulfan-fludarabine Conditioning and T-cell Depleted Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Patients With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is:

1. To establish the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous busulfan (Busulfan®) in combination with fludarabine as conditioning regimen for transplantation with in-vivo T-cell depletion.
2. To evaluate disease free and overall survival after this conditioning regimen in patients with advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
3. To evaluate potential pharmacogenomic determinants of toxicity of this regimen.
4. To evaluate potential pharmacogenomic determinants of efficacy of this regimen.

Maximum Tolerated Dose, Maximally tolerated area under the curve of intravenous busulfan (Busulfan®) in combination with fludarabine as conditioning regimen for transplantation with in-vivo T-cell depletion. The number reported will be an Area Under the Curve (AUC) measure reported in µmol-min/L., 5 years
Overall Survival, Overall Survival measured as median survival in days, 5 years|Disease Free Survival, Disease Free Survival measured by median survival time in days, 5 years
