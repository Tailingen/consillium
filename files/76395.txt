Effect of Spironolactone on Adrenal or Ovarian Androgen Production in Overweight Pubertal Girls With Androgen Excess
Whether 12 weeks of spironolactone can reduce androgen production from ovaries and adrenal glands of girls with obesity and androgen excess
Obesity|Hyperandrogenemia|Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Spironolactone
Changes in free testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels after ACTH and rhCG administration respectively, before and after spironolactone administration for 12 weeks, 12 weeks after spironolactone treatment
Changes in adrenal and ovarian steroid precursors after ACTH and rhCG; body composition via air displacement plethysmography, BMI, and glucose tolerance testing results; baseline and after 12 weeks of spironolactone administration, 12 weeks after spironolactone administration
This study will test whether spironolactone administration can ameliorate androgen (male hormone) overproduction in overweight pubertal girls with androgen excess. The investigators hypothesize that reduction in P450c17alpha overactivity and androgen receptor blockade by 12 weeks of spironolactone administration will improve androgen levels after adrenal stimulation testing with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and ovarian stimulation testing with recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG).
