Study of ADCT-502 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Withhuman Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER2) Expression
This study evaluated ADCT-502 in participants with Advanced Solid Tumors with HER2 Expression. Participants participated in a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and were due to participate in the dose expansion phase (Part 2). In Part 2, patients were due to receive the dose level identified in Part 1, but the study was terminated prior to the beginning of Part 2.

Study ADCT-502-101 was the first clinical study with ADCT-502 in participants with Advanced Solid Tumors with HER2 Expression.

ADCT-502 is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) composed of an engineered version of the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, directed against the human HER2 receptor, conjugated to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer cytotoxin. ADCT-502 specifically binds to HER2, and once internalized, releases the PBD dimer to allow cross-linking of DNA and eventually trigger cell death.

The study had 2 parts. In Part 1 (dose escalation) participants received an infusion of ADCT-502, at escalating doses. Part 1 continued until the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended dose(s) and schedule(s) for expansion were determined. In Part 2 (expansion), participants were due to be assigned to the recommended dose level of ADCT-502 identified in Part 1 by the Dose Escalation Steering Committee, but the study was terminated prior to the beginning of Part 2.

For each participant, the study included a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period, and a follow-up period to assess disease progression and survival for up to 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The total study duration was dependent on overall participant tolerability to the study drug and response to treatment as participants were able to continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
