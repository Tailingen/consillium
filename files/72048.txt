Assessment of Frailty in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Cancers
This study is looking at the feasibility of performing frailty assessments on patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer.

This study is primarily looking to see if it is feasible to assess frailty in patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer. It is also evaluating whether there may be any correlation between these assessments and toxicity of treatment and outcome.

The assessments include: Frailty score, nutritional assessment, comorbidity score and quality of life. In addition sarcopenia will be assessed measuring muscle mass from imaging performed as part of routine clinical care.

The assessments will be performed at baseline on entry into the study, at week 9 and week 18.

There is the option for patients to also donate a blood samples for research purposes.
