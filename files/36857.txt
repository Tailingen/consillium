Study of Vinblastine and Sirolimus in Children With Recurrent/Refractory Solid Tumours Including CNS Tumours
This study is a Phase I study using vinblastine and sirolimus in patients with relapsed solid tumors including selected brain tumors and lymphoma. The investigators hypothesis is that the combination administration of weekly vinblastine and sirolimus is safe.
Solid Tumors|Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: Vinblastine and Sirolimus
Maximum tolerated dose of vinblastine in combination with sirolimus, Maximum tolerated dose (as defined by protocol) of vinblastine in combination with sirolimus, 12 months
Safety data, Safety data will be described for all patients receiving at least one dose of vinblastine and sirolimus. Safety data will include values for hematology, serum chemistry, vital signs, and adverse events. The proportion of patients experiencing adverse events, serious adverse events, dose limiting toxicities and treatment delays will be summarized for each dosing cohort., 12 months|Response Rate, The proportion of patients experiencing progressive disease, stable disease, partial responses or complete responses will be summarized in tabular format. Progression free survival and duration of any responses will also be summarized., 12 months
Published data demonstrating a survival advantage of the vinblastine-sirolimus regimen vs single agent in an orthopotic neuroblastoma mouse model and our unpublished data support a VBL in vitro pro-apoptotic plasma concentration of 1-2 nM range and an anti angiogenic concentration of 2pM. These plasma concentrations are achievable with a 6 mg/m2 (apoptosis) and 1 mg/m2 VBL regimen (anti-angiogenesis) weekly regimen. We expect that vinblastine delivered at any given dose, as described in the protocol, will carry both anti-apoptotic and antiangiogenic activity. Safety and preliminary efficacy of both drugs in pediatric tumors support the development of a clinical trial.
