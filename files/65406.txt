Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided Celiac Plexus Neurolysis (EUS-CPN)With Alcohol in Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer: a Pilot Study
The purpose of this study is to obtain preliminary safety and efficacy data after endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN) in patients with locally advanced or unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Hypotheses:

1. Increased amounts of alcohol used in EUS-CPN is safe and more efficacious in improving pain relief in patients with locally advanced or unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
2. Effective pain relief obtained from EUS-CPN will be related to better quality of life (QOL)
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: dehydrated alcohol
The Change in Mean Pain Scale Rating in Patients Following Treatment With 10mL or 20mL of Alcohol Injection, Pain will be assessed at baseline 24 hours after the procedure and weekly thereafter, until the subject reports no subjective pain relief from the procedure. Pain relief is defined as a decrease in 2 points on a 0-10 point pain rating scale. Zero is no pain and 10 is the worst pain., baseline up to 1 year
