Perioperative immunonutrition has been developed to improve the immuno metabolic host response and outcome in postoperative period and has been proven to be beneficial in reducing significantly postoperative infectious complications and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing elective gastrointestinal surgery for tumors. To date, the effects of preoperative oral immunonutrition (ORAL IMPACT) in non cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection for cancer are unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the administration of a short-term preoperative oral immunonutrition can reduce postoperative morbidity in non-cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection for malignant tumours.
