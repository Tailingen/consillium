Study of VAY736 as Single Agent and in Combination With Select Antineoplastic Agents in Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity and preliminary efficacy of VAY736 alone or in combination with other therapies in patients with NHL in a platform trial.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability in patients with NHL and identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose (RD) of VAY736 single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies.

This is a phase I/Ib, multi-center, open-label study with multiple treatment arms in an adaptive study design. The study is comprised of a dose escalation part and dose expansion part.

In dose escalation, the investigational drug VAY736 was explored alone or in combination with lenalidomide. Increasing doses of VAY736 alone or in combination were given to small groups of patients to identify the maximum tolerated dose/recommended dose (MTD/RD) in patients with NHL. In dose expansion, some or all the treatments from dose escalation could be tested at the recommended doses in patients with NHL. The study was expected to last approximately 4 years (from the enrollment of the first patient to the discontinuation of the last patient), but it was terminated early due to a business decision, not because of any safety or tolerability concerns. Consequently, the dose expansion part was not conducted.
