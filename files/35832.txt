A Study of ARX788 Combined With Pyrotinib Maleate Versus TCBHP (Trastuzumab Plus Pertuzumab With Docetaxel and Carboplatin) as Neoadjuvant Treatment in HER2-positive Breast Cancer Patients
This is a randomized, open label Phase II-III neoadjuvant study comparing the efficacy and safety of ARX788 combined with pyrotinib maleate versus TCBHP (trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with docetaxel and carboplatin) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.
HER2-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: ARX788|DRUG: Pyrotinib maleate|DRUG: Trastuzumab|DRUG: Pertuzumab|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Total pathological complete response rate (tpCR) rate, The standard for removal of breast and lymph node tumors which means there are no infiltrating cancer cells at the primary breast and axillary lymph nodes, and only intraductal cancer is allowed on the breast., 3 years
Breast pathological complete response rate (bpCR) rate, The standard for breast tumor removal which means that there are only infiltrating cancer cells at the primary breast tumor site., 3 years|Residual tumor burden (RCB), Postoperative pathological results will be used to assess the residual tumor area of primary breast tumor (area in mm×mm), the cell density of the residual tumor（cell density in percentages）, the proportion of carcinoma in situ (proportion of carcinoma in percentages), the number of positive lymph nodes and the diameter of largest metastasis with residual nodes (diameter in mm). The RCB class can be estimated from the above five pathological parameters through a network calculation: RCB-0 in grades: pCR; RCB-I in grades: minimal residual tumor; RCB-II: moderate residual tumor; RCB-III in grades: extensive residual tumor., 3 years|Best overall response rate (BORR), The proportion of patients who achieve remission at any point during the study., 3 years|Five-year overall survival (OS), The time from the random date to death due to any cause., 5 years|Event-free survival (EFS), The time from the day of enrollment to the first occurrence of recurrent disease, including second primary malignancies in the non-breast area and breast ductal carcinoma in situ., 3 years|Adverse events (AE), Adverse events (AE) will be assessed as per the NCI-CTC AE 5.0 standard., 3 years
This is a randomized, open label Phase II-III neoadjuvant study comparing the efficacy and safety of ARX788 combined with pyrotinib maleate versus TCBHP (trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with docetaxel and carboplatin) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment arms: arm 1, ARX788 plus pyrotinib maleate for 6 cycles; arm 2, trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with docetaxel and carboplatin for six cycles. Patients will undergo surgery after neoadjuvant therapy. Efficacy will be assessed every 2 cycles.
