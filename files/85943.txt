Pediatric Precision Laboratory Advanced Neuroblastoma Therapy
A prospective open label, multicenter study to evaluate the feasibility and acute toxicity of using molecularly guided therapy in combination with standard therapy followed by a Randomized Controlled Trial of standard immunotherapy with or without DFMO followed by DFMO maintenance for Subjects with Newly Diagnosed High-Risk Neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Ceritinib|DRUG: dasatinib|DRUG: sorafenib|DRUG: vorinostat|DRUG: DFMO
Number of days from start of therapy to date of first relapse, To measure the response of treatments chosen based on:

• Event free survival (EFS), Up to 8 years|Number of subjects that have a targeted agent chosen for treatment., At completion of the induction therapy, the investigators will determine feasibility of adding molecularly guided targeted therapy to standard of care chemotherapy. Feasibility will be defined as:

1. Subject has a targeted agent identified
2. Receives 75% of dosing of medications while on study protocol during cycles 3-6
3. Subject is not removed from study due to targeted agent drug related toxicity., 2 years|Number of subjects that receive 75% of dosing of medications while on study protocol during cycles 3-6., At completion of the induction therapy, the investigators will determine feasibility of adding molecularly guided targeted therapy to standard of care chemotherapy. Feasibility will be defined as:

1. Subject has a targeted agent identified
2. Receives 75% of dosing of medications while on study protocol during cycles 3-6
3. Subject is not removed from study due to targeted agent drug related toxicity., 2 years
Number of days that subjects remain alive, To measure the response of treatments chosen based on:

* Overall response rate (ORR) after induction therapy
* Overall survival (OS), 3 years plus 5 years follow up|Overall Response Rate (ORR) of Participants by the presence of radiologically assessable disease by cross-sectional CT or MRI imaging and/or by MIBG or PET scans., To measure the response of treatments chosen based on:

• Overall response rate (ORR) after induction therapy, Up to 8 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To compare toxicity effects of difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in combination with Dinutuximab/GM-CSF/IL-2 and isotretinoin versus Dinutuximab/GM-CSF/IL-2 and isotretinoin alone., 3 years|Amount of pain medicine required by Arm A versus Arm B, To compare level of pain medicine needed during immunotherapy in patients receiving difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in combination with Dinutuximab/GM-CSF/IL-2 and Isotretinoin versus those receiving Dinutuximab/GM-CSF/IL-2 and isotretinoin alone., 3 years|Number of subjects required to go off therapy due to treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0., At completion of the induction therapy, the investigators will determine feasibility of adding molecularly guided targeted therapy to standard of care chemotherapy. Feasibility will be defined as:

1. Subject has a targeted agent identified
2. Receives 75% of dosing of medications while on study protocol during cycles 3-6
3. Subject is not removed from study due to targeted agent drug related toxicity., 1 year
