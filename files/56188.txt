Study of TPI 287 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
Tapestry Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed a novel taxane analog, TPI 287. TPI 287 is synthetically manufactured from naturally occurring taxanes extracted from yew starting material. The synthesis involves modification to the taxane side chain to overcome multidrug resistance and to achieve mutant tubulin binding. This study will be a multi-center, dose escalation, sequential group, phase I study evaluating the intravenous administration of TPI 287, a novel third generation taxane.
