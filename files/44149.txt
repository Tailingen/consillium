Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Phase I Primary Objectives • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of KSQ-001EX in adult participants with advanced solid tumors (melanoma, HNSCC, NSCLC)

Phase I Primary Endpoint

• Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)

Phase I Secondary Objectives

* Determine expansion dose
* Assess the safety and tolerability of KSQ-001EX in participants with advanced solid tumors (melanoma, HNSCC, NSCLC)
* Evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of KSQ-001EX in participants with advanced solid tumors
* Evaluate the feasibility of the manufacturing process.

Phase I Secondary Endpoints

* Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and change from Baseline in laboratory results
* Objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), time to response (TTR) as assessed by the Investigator, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1
* Manufacturing success rate

Phase 2 Primary Objectives • To assess the anti-tumor activity of KSQ-001EX in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors

Phase 2 Primary Endpoint

• ORR per RECIST v1.1

Phase 2 Secondary Objectives
