Gemcitabine and Irinotecan in Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving gemcitabine together with irinotecan works in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

Difference in response to therapy in patients with clear vs nonclear cell renal cell carcinoma
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate in patients with epithelial (clear or nonclear cell) renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride and irinotecan hydrochloride.
* Compare the response in patients with clear cell RCC vs nonclear cell RCC treated with this regimen.
* Determine the toxicities of this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
