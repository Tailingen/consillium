Research for Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells (19#iSCLifeÂ®-MDS) in the Treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
The purposes of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) in treating Myelodysplastic Syndrome patients.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
BIOLOGICAL: Allogeneic umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells|DRUG: Decitabine
Treatment related-adverse events counting, patients will be monitored for any adverse events resulting from the treatment of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells, 16 weeks
Improvement in clinical function, According to 'Diagnostic and Curative Criteria of Hematological Diseases' 3rd edition edited by Zhang Zhinan and Shen Di, evaluate the hUC-MSCs efficacy. The result as follow:

* complete remission (CR);
* partial remission (PR);
* stable disease (SD);
* progressive disease (PD), 16 weeks
This is a randomized, double-blind, paralleled study. 40 patients will be separated into two groups, and receive basic treatment (Decitabine). Patients in experimental group will receive hUC-MSC, while control group receive placebo (normal saline), four weeks as a course of treatment. All of the patients accept examination before treatment, including

* diagnostic projects: bone marrow test, peripheral blood classification, chromosome, and MDS fusion gene test, etc.;
* routine examination: blood, urine, and stool routine test, X-ray film in chest, electrocardiogram, etc.;
* stem cell-based medicinal products usage, dosage, time, and course of treatment.

Then, patients will accept routine examination everyday, and after treatment, investigator will follow-up for 6 months, to evaluate the security and efficacy of hUC-MSC.
