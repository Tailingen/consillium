A Study to Assess Patient-Reported Quality of Life and Effectiveness on Control of Bleeding in Adult Participants With Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Due to Uterine Fibroids Taking Oral Oriahnn Capsules
Uterine Fibroids (UF) are noncancerous (benign) tumors that commonly occur in up to 80% of women of reproductive age. Symptoms can include heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), low back pain, urinary frequency and urgency, gastrointestinal symptoms, and fatigue. In participants with UF, this study will prospectively assess changes in patient-reported quality of life and patient-reported effectiveness in controlling HMB when treated with elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules (elagolix + E2/NETA).

Around 200 adult premenopausal female participants in the United States with a diagnosis of HMB associated with UF and are prescribed elagolix + E2/NETA by their physicians as per standard of care will be enrolled in this direct-to-patient observational study for up to 6 months.

Participants will have been prescribed elagolix + E2/NETA within the last 30 days prior to enrollment and will continue to take elagolix + E2/NETA throughout study participation.

There may be a higher burden for participants in this study compared to standard of care. Electronic patient reported outcomes (ePROs) will be collected at baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months to assess the impact of Elagolix + E2/NETA on patient-reported quality of life.
Heavy Menstrual Bleeding|Uterine Fibroids
Change From Baseline in Self-Reported Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB) Measured by Menstrual Bleeding Questionnaire (MBQ), MBQ is a self-reported questionnaire that measures impact of HMB with 20 items and includes perception of heaviness of bleeding, bleeding pattern, pain, and impact of symptoms including social embarrassment, fear of social embarrassment, and behavioral changes to avoid social embarrassment. Sum responses to obtain a total score and multiply score by 1.32 to scale. Zero, least impact possible; 100, worst impact possible., Up to 3 Months
