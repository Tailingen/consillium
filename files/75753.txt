High-Intensity-Interval-Training in Geriatric Rehabilitation - A Feasibility Study
Study with Patients (40-60 participants) above the age of 65. There will be a comparison of regular training on ergometer (10 trainings within 2 weeks, 40 min each) to high intensity interval training on ergometer (6 trainings within 2 weeks, 25 min each). At the beginning and at the end will be a spiroergometer to measure the individual limits and vO2max, which will be compared amongst the two groups. To receive a subjective feedback, there will be a series of questionnaires at the beginning, after one week and at the end. The goal of this study is to get more information about whether a HII-Training is feasible with elderly patients and whether they can profit form it.
