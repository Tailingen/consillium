Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Efficacy of BH011 in Subjects With Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of intravesical BH011 in patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer（NMIBC） after Bacillus Calmette-Guerin（BCG） failure and to assess the preliminary efficacy.
Bladder Cancer|Non Muscle Invasive
DRUG: BH011
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Adverse events will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0., From first dose to 30 days after last dose|3 month Complete Response Rate (CRR), Complete Response rate is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a CR at 3 months post-treatment. It will be measured by determining the percentage of participants without presence of high-grade disease using results from cystoscopy and urine cytology at any time point., 3 months
6 month Complete Response Rate (CRR), Complete Response rate is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a CR at 6 months post-treatment. It will be measured by determining the percentage of participants without presence of high-grade disease using results from cystoscopy and urine cytology at any time point., 6 months|Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the time from the first study treatment to the presentation of the first pathologically confirmed high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (T1, CIS, or high-grade Ta) recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurred earliest., up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first study treatment to the occurrence of the first bladder cancer infiltration into the muscularis propria, lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurred earliest., up to 24 months|Recurrence-Free Survival Rate, The RFS rate is defined as the rate of subjects without pathologically confirmed high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (T1, CIS, or high-grade Ta) recurrence or death from any cause., up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival Rate, The PFS rate is defined as the rate of subjects free of bladder cancer infiltration into the muscularis propria, lymphatic metastasis, distant metastasis, or death from any cause., up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetic of BH011, Maximum Concentration (Cmax), Weeks 1 and 6 of dosing|Pharmacokinetic of BH011, Time to Cmax (Tmax), Weeks 1 and 6 of dosing|Pharmacokinetic of BH011, Area Under the Curve From Time 0 Hours to Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-last), Weeks 1 and 6 of dosing|Pharmacokinetic of BH011, Area Under the Curve From Time 0 Hours to Infinity (AUC0-inf), Weeks 1 and 6 of dosing|Pharmacokinetic of BH011, Apparent Terminal Elimination Half-Life (t1/2), Weeks 1 and 6 of dosing|Pharmacokinetic of BH011, Apparent Total Clearance (CL), Weeks 1 and 6 of dosing|Pharmacokinetic of BH011, Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F), Weeks 1 and 6 of dosing
The plan is to study the safety and preliminary efficacy of BH011 in High-Risk NMIBC patients who failed BCG therapy. Most patients with NMIBC is (Cis, Cis with Ta and/or T1, high grade Ta or T1 with frequent or uncontrolled recurrences) who have failed BCG intravesical therapy (standard of care) usually have no other choice but to proceed to cystectomy. Cystectomy is a surgery associated with major morbidity, mortality and quality of life issues. Morbidity and long term tedious medical care will be for the rest of the patient's life span. Most patients at this stage do not show signs of disease progression into the muscle layer or of metastasis, making surgery a very difficult decision. BH011 will serve to provide a therapeutic alternative for this patient population in need.

In this study, patients will begin treatment with BH011 2-8 weeks after TURBT and will be administered once weekly for 6 weeks during the induction treatment period and once monthly for 12 months in the maintenance treatment period. Patients will undergo cystoscopy, urine cytology, and biopsy every 3 months for up to 24 months to confirm clinical efficacy.
