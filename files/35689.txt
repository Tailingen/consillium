A Study of CS23546 in Subjects With Advanced Tumors
The primary objectives of this study are to characterize the safety and tolerability of CS23546 and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CS23546 in subjects with advanced tumors.
Advanced Tumors

This study is a single arm, open phase I trial, consisting of a dose escalation phase (single dose+multiple doses) and a dose expansion phase, accompanied by pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic studies. The first visit period (21 days) of single dose and multiple doses during the dose-increasing phase is the DLT observation period.
