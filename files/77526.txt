6xFU/Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide (FEC) Compared to 3xFEC-3xDocetaxel in High-risk Node-negative Breast Cancer Patients
In low-risk node-negative breast cancer patients adjuvant chemotherapy should be spared. The identification of this subgroup can be based either on clinical and pathological or on tumour-biological criteria. Due to their high prognostic impact, the tumour-biological invasion markers uPA/PAI-1 (urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its inhibitor PAI-1) are potential candidates to effectively assess the risk of relapse in node-negative breast cancer. This study is aimed to compare the risk assessment by the traditional clinico-pathological factors and by tumour-biological factors. The second study question refers to the comparison between an adjuvant combination treatment with FE100C\*6 and a sequential treatment with FE100C\*3 and Docetaxel\*3.

DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil, Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide, Docetaxel
Disease-Free Survival, after 10 years follow up
Overall Survival, after 10 years follow up
1. To compare FEC\*6 with FEC\*3 followed by DOC\*3 with regard to:

   * the primary endpoint of the study: Disease-Free Survival (DFS)
   * the secondary endpoints: Overall Survival (OS), compliance, and toxicity of chemotherapy in each patient group
2. To compare patients with low risk according to clinico-pathological versus those according to biological risk criteria with regard to:

   * the proportion of low risk versus high risk patients
   * DFS
   * OS (secondary endpoint)
