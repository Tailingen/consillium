A Study of NPX887 for Participants With Solid Tumors Known to Express B7-H7/HHLA2
NPX887 is a human, antagonistic immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody targeting B7-H7 (HHLA2) that may potentiate an anti-tumor immune response. The goal of this first-in-human study is to learn whether NPX887 is safe and tolerable and shows a preliminary efficacy in participants with B7-H7 (HHLA2) expressing tumors at selected dose(s). The main questions it aims to answer are:

* what is an appropriate dose to be given to participants?
* are the side effects of treatment manageable?
* what is the preliminary anti-tumor activities?

Participants who are treated will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of NPX887 if their disease has not progressed, and be closely monitored by the treating physicians.

This study is comprised of Phase 1a (Dose Escalation) and Phase 1b including Part 1b (Dose Expansion) and Part 1c (Randomized Dose Comparison). Phase 1a will test different doses of NPX887 to determine the optimal dose(s) to continue with in Phase 1b. In the Phase 1b, more participants will be tested to evaluate preliminary activities in multiple disease-specific cohorts and compare the efficacy of the higher and lower doses chosen in Phase 1a.

Throughout the study, safety and preliminary efficacy data will be collected to characterize the clinical activity of NPX887. Samples of blood will be taken to help in an understanding of how NPX887 behaves in the body by assessing the amount of drug in the blood over time, and changes in blood components. Tumor tissue samples will be collected at screening and on-treatment stages for biomarker analysis and pharmacodynamics (PD) evaluation.
