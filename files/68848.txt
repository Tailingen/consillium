PD-1 Knockout Engineered T Cells for Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer
This study will evaluate the safety of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in treating metastatic advanced bladder cancer. Blood samples will also be collected for research purposes.
Invasive Bladder Cancer Stage IV
BIOLOGICAL: PD-1 Knockout T Cells|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: IL-2
Number of participants with Adverse Events and/or Dose Limiting Toxicities as a Measure of Safety and tolerability of dose of PD-1 Knockout T cells using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) in patients, Dose Escalation - Approximately 6 months
Response Rate:Response will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.1, 90 days|Progression free survival - PFS, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to average 10 months|Overall Survival - OS, The time from randomization to death from any cause, assessed up to 2 years|Peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA, Peripheral circuiting tumor DNA is collected at baseline and 6 weeks after last treatment, 6 weeks|Temporal Interleukin-2 change in the peripheral blood, Baseline and 1 month and 3 months|Temporal Interferon-Î³ change in the peripheral blood, Baseline and 1 month and 3 months|Temporal Interleukin-6 change in the peripheral blood, Baseline and 1 month and 3 months
This is a dose-escalation study of ex-vivo knocked-out, expanded, and selected PD-1 knockout-T cells from autologous origin. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups to determine the maximal tolerant dose. After the lower number of cycles are considered tolerant, an arm of the next higher number of cycles will be open to next patients. Biomarkers and immunological markers are collected and analyzed as well.
