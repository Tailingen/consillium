The purpose of this real-world study is the learn about the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients with prostate cancer who initiated relugolix
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Relugolix
Characterize patient characteristics initiating relugolix treatment, Descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics such as age will be defined as of the index date (start of relugolix) and retained in the dataset as a continuous variable. Findings will be presented as the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and interquartile range, Up to 1 year prior to initiating relugolix|Characterize clinical characteristics of patients intitiating relugolix treatment, Descriptive analysis of clinical characteristics such as baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value in ng/dL (among available) based on the PSA value on or prior to the index date will be evaluated. Findings will be presented as the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and interquartile range, Up to 1 year prior to initiating relugolix
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) such as injectable luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (e.g., leuprolide) is the standard of care for PC patients. ADT treatment can suppress testosterone level to castrate level and delay the progression of the disease.

Relugolix is a recently approved oral GnRH antagonist. While the introduction of relugolix has offered a unique opportunity for patients with PC, it's vital to understand how it is being used in real-world.
