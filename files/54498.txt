Radiation Therapy or Chemoradiation, Interstitial Brachytherapy in Combination With Hyperthermia in Advanced Cervical Cancer
The combination of radiation therapy or chemoradiation with Interstitial brachytherapy for advanced cervical cancer (pN+, FIGO-Stage II B - IV A is standard of therapy. The radio- and chemosensitive effect of an additional hyperthermia might improve the clinical outcome.
