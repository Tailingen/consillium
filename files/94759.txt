Study to Compare Adjuvant Immunotherapy of Bempegaldesleukin Combined With Nivolumab Versus Nivolumab After Complete Resection of Melanoma in Patients at High Risk for Recurrence
The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab versus nivolumab in patients with completely resected Stage IIIA/B/C/D, or Stage IV cutaneous melanoma who are at high risk for recurrence.

BIOLOGICAL: Bempegaldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab
Recurrence-free Survival (RFS) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) of Bempegaldesleukin Plus Nivolumab Versus Nivolumab Alone., Recurrence-free Survival (RFS) of bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab versus nivolumab alone is determined based on the disease recurrence date provided by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and is defined as the time between date of randomization and date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis by BICR), new primary melanoma (by BICR), or all-cause death, whichever occurs first., Up to 21 months
Overall Survival (OS) of Bempegaldesleukin Plus Nivolumab Versus Nivolumab Alone, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death due to any cause. Patients who do not have a date of death will be censored on the last date for which a patient was known to be alive., Up to 21 months|Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS) by Investigator in Patients Who Are Stage III at Study Entry., Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) by Investigator is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first distant metastasis by Investigator or date of death due to any cause, in patients who have Stage III melanoma at study entry., Up to 21 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), To evaluate safety and tolerability of (NKTR-214) 0.006 mg/kg in combination with nivolumab 360 mg IV infusion (or 4.5 mg/kg IV infusion q3w for patients \<40 kg) and nivolumab 480 mg IV infusion (or 6.0 mg/kg IV infusion q4w for patients \< 40 kg). Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that was not present prior to treatment with study drug but appeared following treatment or was present at treatment start date but worsened during treatment-emergent period. The treatment-emergent period is defined as the period from the date of the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the date of the last dose of study drug or the day prior to the initiation of subsequent anticancer treatment, whichever occurs first., Approximately up to 21 months|Changes at 6 Months of Treatment From Baseline in Scores for the Global Health/Quality of Life (GH/QoL) and Physical Functioning Subscales of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire, The EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 30 items (i.e. single questions). 24 of which are aggregated into nine multi-item scales, that is, five functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting) and one global health status scale. Participants rate items and a score ranging from 0 to 100 is calculated. A higher score on the global health status/quality of life scale indicates a better level of functioning, and positive changes from baseline indicate improvement. A change of 5 - 10 points is considered a small change, and a change of 10 - 20 points is considered a moderate change. Due to the study termination, results for the mean change from baseline for GH/QoL and the physical functioning subscale were analyzed at approximately 6 months of treatment., From baseline, up to approximately 6 months|Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression as a Predictive Biomarker for Recurrence-free Survival (RFS), The predictive strength of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression as a biomarker will be measured by the endpoint RFS by BICR based on PD-L1 expression level., Up to 21 months|Recurrence-free Survival (RFS) by Investigator of Bempegaldesleukin Plus Nivolumab Versus Nivolumab Alone., Recurrence-free Survival by Investigator is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis by Investigator), new primary melanoma (by Investigator), or all-cause death, whichever occurs first., Up to 21 months|Time to Disease Progression After the Next Line of Treatment for Study Patients Following Discontinuation of Bempegaldesleukin Plus Nivolumab Versus Nivolumab, Time to disease progression after the next line of treatment is defined as time from randomization to progression per Investigator after the start of next line of therapy or death, whichever occurs first. Patients who were alive and without progression after the next line of therapy can be censored at last known alive date., Up to 21 months|Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in Patients Who Are Stage III at Study Entry., Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first distant metastasis by BICR or date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, in patients who have Stage III melanoma at study entry., Up to 21 months
The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, as measured by recurrence-free survival (RFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR), of bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab versus nivolumab in patients with completely resected Stage IIIA (lymph node \[LN\] metastasis \> 1 mm), Stage IIIB/C/D, or Stage IV (American Joint Committee on Cancer \[AJCC\] 8th edition) cutaneous melanoma with no evidence of disease (NED) who are at high risk for recurrence.
