Pore Excision, Curettage, and Injection of Cymetra for Pilonidal Disease
Chronic pilonidal disease is a common problem with no ideal treatment. This is a prospective study that will evaluate the results of surgical pore excision, curettage, and injection of a regenerative tissue matrix, Cymetra, on patients with chronic pilonidal disease.
Pilonidal Sinus
PROCEDURE: surgery (Pore Excision, Curettage, and Injection of Cymetra)
wound failure, time lost from work or school, analgesic requirements, recurrence rates, 6 months
infection rates, wound care requirements, 6 months
In addition, the study will evaluate the credibility and reproducibility of results within other surgeons trained to perform the procedure. Data collection will focus on post-operative wound failure, infection ratwes, analgesic requirements, time lost from work or school, wound care requirements, and 6 month recurrence rates. These outcomes will be compared to outcomes using conventional pilonidal surgical intervention using published data.
