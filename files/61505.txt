A Phase I/II Trial of HER-2/Neu Pulsed DC1 Vaccine Combined With Trastuzumab for Patients With DCIS
The purpose of the study is to treat patients with Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with a combined treatment of DC1 vaccine with Trastuzumab. In this study the investigators will assess the safety and immunogenicity of the combination therapy. The target population is women over 18 years of age and have a diagnosis of DCIS that express HER-2 3 positive. Participants will receive 6 vaccines along with 2 doses of trastuzumab.
