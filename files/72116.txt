Impact of Environmental Exposures on Tumor Risk in Subjects at Risk of Hereditary SDHx Paraganglioma
The main objective of the pilot phase of PGLEXPO will be to assess the faisability and to precise methodology of a case-control study designed for testing the impact of environmental and professional exposures on the tumoral risk in SDHx-mutation carriers
Genetic Predisposition|SDH Gene Mutation|Environmental Exposure
Feasability of the protocol of a national case/control study (PGL.EXPO2), Successful pairing of 50 cases with 50 controls, 2 years
Feasibility of matching cases and controls, Proportion of cases for which a control could be identified, 2 years|Ease of matching cases and controls, Mean number of controls matching for a case, 2 years
The main objective of the pilot phase of PGLEXPO will be to assess the faisability and to precise methodology of a case-control study designed for testing the impact of environmental and professional exposures on the tumoral risk in SDHx-mutation carriers.

Patients will be selected from subjects with a mutation in one of the SDHx genes. The cases will have developed a tumor, while the controls will be tumor-free. Controls will be matched to the cases according to sex, age and type of gene affected. Past exposures will be sought through a telephone questionnaire.
