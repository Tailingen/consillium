A Study of TACE Combined With Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab or TACE Alone in Patients With Untreated Heaptocellular Carcionma
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combined with on-demand TACE compared to on-demand TACE alone in participants with hepatocellular carcinoma who are at high risk of poorer outcome following TACE treatment.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Becavizumab|DEVICE: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)
TACE Progression-Free Survival (TACE PFS) as Determined by Investigator, TACE PFS is defined as the time from randomization to untreatable progression or TACE failure/refractoriness or any cause of death, whichever occurs first, as determined by the investigator (INV)., Randomization to untreatable progression or TACE failure/refractoriness or death (up to approximately 46 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) after enrollment is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 94 months)
Time to Untreatable (unTACEable) Progression (TTUP) as Determined by Investigator, INV-assessed TTUP is defined as time from randomization to untreatable (unTACEable) progression, as determined by investigator., Randomization to untreatable (unTACEable) progression (up to approximately 46 months)|Time to Progression (TTP) as Determined by Investigator, INV-assessed TTP is defined as the time from randomization to unTACEable progression or TACE failure/refractoriness (as defined above), as determined by investigator., Randomization to unTACEable progression or TACE failure/refractoriness (up to approximately 46 months)|Time to Extrahepatic Spread (EHS) as Determined by Investigator, INV-assessed time to EHS is defined as the time from randomization to the first evidence of EHS, as determined by investigator., Randomization to first evidence of EHS (up to approximately 46 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), as Determined by Investigator, Objective response (OR) is defined as a complete or partial response, as determined by investigator., Randomization up to approximately 46 months|Duration of Responses (DOR) as Determined by Investigator, INV-assessed DOR is defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by INV., First occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)(up to approximately 46 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), as determined by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1., Randomization to first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurs first)(up to approximately 94 monthsJ)|Time to Deterioration (TTD), TTD is defined as the time from randomization to first deterioration in the patient-reported GHS/QoL, physical function, or role function scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30, maintained for two consecutive assessments, or one assessment followed by death from any cause within 3 weeks., Randomization to first deterioration (up to approximately 94 months)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Baseline up to approximately 94 months
