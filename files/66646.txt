Feasibility Study of a Dose Increase by a Boost of Curietherapy in Pulse Dose Rate (PDR) Associated With the Extern Radiotherapy in Prostate Cancer
The objective of the trial is to evaluating the feasibility of dose increase by a boost of curietherapy in PDR (at least 40 Gy on D95) associated to extern radiotherapy (34 Gy) in intermediate risk in prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer With Intermediate Risk
RADIATION: curietherapy and radiotherapy
Proportion of patients with a delivered dose by a boost of curietherapy is at least 40 Gy (D95) associated to a dose of 34 Gy for extern radiotherapy, at 5 months
Acute toxicities at month 3 after end of treatment: late toxicities, survival without biological relapse, without local relapse or metastatic evolution, feasibility of MRI use in prostatic CTV, at 5 months
The objective of the trial is to evaluating the feasibility of dose increase by a boost of curietherapy in PDR (at least 40 Gy on D95) associated to extern radiotherapy (34 Gy) in intermediate risk in prostate cancer.
