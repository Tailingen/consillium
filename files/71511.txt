Study of Acai Juice in Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Prostate Cancer Patients With Rising PSA
Men who have Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) recurrence with low PSA levels and long doubling times do not require immediate treatment with androgen deprivation therapy and may be safely observed. In these situations where current treatment options may cause more unnecessary side effects than anticipated benefit, it is reasonable to use a low-risk natural product such as Acai Juice Product with antioxidant properties to evaluate whether there are any anti-cancer effects.
