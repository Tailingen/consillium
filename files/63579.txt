A Study of Atezolizumab in Combination With an Immunotherapy Agent Investigated With or Without Anti-Cd20 Therapy in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study will investigate the safety, pharmacology, and activity of atezolizumab in combination with immunotherapy agents with or without an anti-CD20 agent (i.e., obinutuzumab) in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma (FL). The first immunotherapy molecule investigated will be emactuzumab (Arm A) in two combinations.
