This is a multi-center, single-arm Phase I study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and initial efficacy of DP303c in patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors. Patients will be treated with DP303c injection at 3.0 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Patients will receive DP303c until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death, or any other reasons for treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs first.
