A Prospective, Multi-Center Evaluation of a Powered Vascular Stapler in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomies
The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the powered vascular stapler for transection of the pulmonary artery (PA) and pulmonary vein (PV) during Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomy.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DEVICE: Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomy with powered vascular stapler
Incidence of Intra-Operative Hemostatic Interventions, Incidence of hemostatic interventions/procedures completed for intra-operative bleeding related to the transection of the PA and PV during VATS lobectomy with the use of powered vascular stapler (PVS) defined as bleeding detected and controlled intraoperatively (additional stapling, over-sewing, clip placement, compression, use of suture, sealant, and/or buttress, and/or use of energy); or bleeding that occurs intra-operatively requiring blood or blood product transfusion or an additional surgical procedure (e.g. conversion to open)., Intra-Operative|Post-operative Interventions or Procedures Related to Pulmonary Artery or Pulmonary Vein Bleeding, Incidence of hemostatic interventions /procedures completed for post-operative bleeding related to the transection of the PA and PV during VATS lobectomy with the use of PVS:

* Hemostasis intervention: bleeding that occurs post-operatively requiring blood or blood product transfusion or an additional surgical procedure (related to PA and PV transection).

No hemostasis intervention is defined as no interventions needed for post-operative bleeding (related to PA and PV transection)., Post-op through 4 week follow-up
The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the powered vascular stapler for transection of the pulmonary artery (PA) and pulmonary vein (PV) during Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomy.
