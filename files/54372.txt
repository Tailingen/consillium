The Utility of Cell-free DNA Methylation Markers for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The subjects of this study were patients with liver cancer diagnosed by physicians according to AASLD clinical criteria or pathological biopsy.

Those who plan to receive systemic drug treatment for liver cancer in National Taiwan University Hospital include Nexavar, Lenvatinib, Avastin, Tecentriq, Strivarga, Cabometyx, Cyramza, Nivolunab, Pembrolizumab, and Yervoy. Weak and uncooperative patients were excluded from blood tests, which were performed with full informed consent for relevant tumor markers (AFP ,PIVKA-II and methylation analysis). The data are then counted and compared.
