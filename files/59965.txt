Study Evaluating SKI-606 (Bosutinib) In Japanese Subjects With Philadelphia Chromosome Positive Leukemias
This is a two-part safety and efficacy study of SKI-606 in subjects who have Philadelphia chromosome positive leukemias (CML). Part 1 will be a dose-escalation study, in which an escalating dose of SKI-606 (Bosutinib), up to 600 mg, will be studied in subjects with imatinib resistant/refractory or imatinib intolerant chronic phase CML. Part 2 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SKI-606 (Bosutinib)identified in Part 1 of the study.
