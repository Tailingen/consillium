A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Preliminary Efficacy of Max-40279-01 in Combination With Azacitidine (AZA) in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (R/R AML)
This study is a phase Ib/II study of Max-40279-01 in combination with Azacitidine (AZA) in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (R/R AML). This study include Phase Ib and Phase II study. The phase Ib study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MAX-40279-01 in combination with Azacitidine (AZA) in patients with Relapsed or Refractory AML. The phase II study is designed to preliminarily assess the efficacy and safety of Max-40279-01 in combination with Azacitidine (AZA) in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) or Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (R/R AML).
