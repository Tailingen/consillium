Shave Margins in Breast Conservation Therapy
The investigators propose a randomized controlled superiority trial of standard breast-conserving surgery (BCS) versus BCS with cavity shave margins (CSM). The main objectives of this trial will be to evaluate prospectively the impact of routine standardized CSM on margin status following primary surgery for early stage breast cancer (Stage 0 - II), on post-operative patient satisfaction and cosmetic outcomes, and on general intraoperative time and operative costs. A parallel group format will be implemented to compare this modified surgical therapy - BCS with CSM - with BCS alone, which is the current standard of care.

PROCEDURE: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS)|PROCEDURE: Cavity shave margins (CSM)|BEHAVIORAL: BREAST-Q Questionnaire|DEVICE: 3-D breast imaging|OTHER: Indocyanine green|DEVICE: Intraoperative imaging device|PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood draw
Proportion of patients with positive margins on pathological specimen analysis, Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 60 months)|Patient perceptions of the surgery as measured by BREAST-Q questionnaire and novel 3-dimensional breast imaging, * The BREAST-Q questionnaire consists of 13 sections.
* The sections ask the patient questions about how they feel about how their breast area looks, how they feel emotionally, any physical side effects, and sexual side effects.
* Some of the sections ask the patients to answer a question on a scale of None of the Time (equals=1) to All of the Time (equals=5)
* Some of the sections ask the patients to answer a question on a scale of Very Dissatisfied (equals=1) to Very Satisfied (equals=4), 6-12 months post-surgery or post-radiation therapy, whichever is later)|Compare intraoperative NIR fluorescence from goggle system with pathologic tissue exam results, Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 60 months)
Relationship between CSM and volume of tissue excised in association iwth post-operative aesthetic outcomes, 6-12 months post-surgery or post-radiation therapy, whichever is later)|Cost-effectiveness of routine CSM in BCS as measured by operative time, specimen processing, and resource usage, Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 60 months)|Disease status associated with cancer biomarkers, The investigators plan to assess plasma and serum levels of several candidate biomarkers, including a phosphorylated form of the annexin A2 protein ("P-annexin A2"), in study patients by immunoblotting/ELISA. This biomarker evaluation in the context of disease status will provide new information in the clinical detection and diagnosis of malignancy. Successful validation of these biomarkers may lead to development of novel blood-based cancer diagnostic tests., Completion of surgery for all enrolled patients (approximately 60 months)|Tumor characteristics associated with cancer biomarkers, The investigators plan to assess plasma and serum levels of several candidate biomarkers, including a phosphorylated form of the annexin A2 protein ("P-annexin A2"), in study patients by immunoblotting/ELISA.
