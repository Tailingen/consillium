Comparison of Segmentectomy Versus Lobectomy for Lung Adenocarcinoma ≤ 2cm
This study aims to evaluate the superiority in recurrence-free survival of lobectomy compared with segmentectomy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma ≤ 2 cm with micropapillary and solid subtype positive by intraoperative frozen sections.
Lung Adenocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Lobectomy with systemic lymph node dissection|PROCEDURE: Segmentectomy with systemic lymph node dissection
recurrence-free survival rate, Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was defined as the time from surgery until recurrence or death from any cause, 5 year
overall survival rate, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from surgery until death from any cause, 5 year
At present, the technology of intraoperative frozen section has gradually matured, which can diagnose the benign and malignant tumors and guide the resection strategy for peripheral small-sized lung adenocarcinoma. Travis et al. reported high specificity of intraoperative frozen section in the identification of micropapillary components, confirming that intraoperative frozen section may guide the selection of surgical procedures. However, there is still little evidence whether segmentectomy is appropriate for invasive adenocarcinoma without micropapillary patterns. This prospective and multi-center study was aimed to evaluate the superiority in recurrence free survival and overall survival of lobectomy compared with segmentectomy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (≤ 2 cm) containing positive micropapillary components.
