Biomechanical and Metabolic Assessment Pre and Post Vertebroplasty in Multiple Myeloma Patients With Vertebral Collapse
In patients with Multiple Myeloma (MM), bone lesions can lead to multiple vertebral lesions, with vertebral collapses. The introduction of minimally invasive procedures such as percutaneous vertebroplasty allow patients to return to a fair level of function and a significant reduction in pain. Despite medical therapies, radiotherapy, analgesics and vertebroplasty procedures, patients with multiple spinal injuries often complain of pain and stiffness that limit their mobility, daily activities and work. The aim of this study is to measure how the biomechanical, thermo-metabolic and algic parameters change after vertebroplasty in patients with MM
Multiple Myeloma
Difference in mean of kinematic data for walking before and after vertebroplasty, Difference in mean of kinematic data for walking before and after vertebroplasty, 2 months|difference in mean of movement range for affected joints before and after vertebroplasty, difference in mean of movement range for affected joints before and after vertebroplasty, 2 months|Difference in mean of energy expenditure before and after vertebroplasty, Difference in mean of energy expenditure before and after vertebroplasty, 2 months
To explore the impact of vertebroplasty on thermal parameters, Central and superficial temperature will be measured before and after vertebroplasty. Difference will be reported as intrapatient mean difference, 2 months|To explore the impact of vertebroplasty on metabolic parameters, Carbon dioxide production after 30 minutes of walking will be measured before and after vertebroplasty and intrapatient mean difference will be reported., 2 months|To explore the impact of vertebroplasty on metabolic parameters, Cardiac frequency after 30 minutes of walking will be measured before and after vertebroplasty and intrapatient mean difference will be reported., 2 months|To explore the impact of vertebroplasty on metabolic parameters, Oxygen consumption after 30 minutes of walking will be measured before and after vertebroplasty and intrapatient mean difference will be reported., 2 months|To explore the impact of vertebroplasty on pain, Perceived pain will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory scale (BPI) before and after vertebroplasty. Difference will be reported as intrapatient mean difference. BPI values range between 0 and 10, with higher scores meaning worst pain, 2 months
