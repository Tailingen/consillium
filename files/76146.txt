Incidence of Pancreatic Fistula, the incidence of pancreatic fistula after radical gastrectomy in gastric cancer patients, in 30 days following gastrectomy
The Classification of Pancreatic Fistula, the percentage of different grades of pancreatic fistula, including Grade BL, Grade B and Grade C, in 30 days following gastrectomy|The mortality of Grade B and C Pancreatic Fistula, the percentage of patients died of Grade B or C pancreatic fistula, in 30 days following gastrectomy
Pancreatic fistula, which can lead to fatal end, is one of the most serious complications after radical gastrectomy. It is usually treated as a key factor to evaluate the quality of gastrectomy. The incidence of pancreatic fistula is far different between different areas, knowing the prevalence of pancreatic fistula and risk factors can help us to prevent pancreatic fistula and improve the short time outcome of gastric cancer surgery treatment. So, we designed this perspective, multi-center study to investigate the incidence of pancreatic fistula and its outcome in China.
