HIFU Hyperthermia With Liposomal Doxorubicin (DOXIL) for Relapsed or Refractory Pediatric and Young Adult Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Doxil (liposomal doxorubicin) given prior to MR-HIFU Hyperthermia is safe for the treatment of pediatric and young adult patients with recurrent and refractory solid tumors.
