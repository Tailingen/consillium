Number of participants with adverse events, application site assessment and clinically significant changes in laboratory assessments over 2 cycles of chemotherapy, Incidence, frequency, and severity of AEs and SAEs, including clinically significant changes in laboratory assessments and application site assessment., From screening until 15 days after the last dose of IV granisetron|Number of participants with change in physical assessment including height, weight, BMI and BSA, Change in height and weight to calculate BMI and BSA, Through study completion, an average of 8 weeks|Number of participants with change in vital signs, Change in pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressures measurements, Through study completion, an average of 8 weeks|Number of participants with change in ECG parameters, 12 lead ECGs will be conducted to time match PK samples after at least 5 minutes supine rest, Through study completion, an average of 8 weeks
This is an open-label, multi-center, cross-over study in male and female pediatric cancer patients, aged 6 to 12 years of age who are receiving at least 2 cycles of emetogenic chemotherapy requiring 5-HT3 antagonist treatment of up to 5 days duration. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and PK of transdermal granisetron (SancusoÂ® patch) in a pediatric population (aged 6 to 12 years), using a population PK approach.
