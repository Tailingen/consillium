Phase I/II Study of CD5 CAR Engineered IL15-Transduced Cord Blood-Derived NK Cells in Conjunction With Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy for the Management of Relapsed/Refractory Hematological Malignances
To determine the safety, efficacy and optimal cell dose of CAR 5/IL15-transduced CB-NK cells in patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell malignances, mantle cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The efficacy and optimal dose will be identified for individual diseases.
Hematological Malignancy
DRUG: Fludarabine Phosphate|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: CAR.5/IL15-transduced CB-NK cells
Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE Version 5.0., General grading:

Grade 1: Mild: discomfort present with no disruption of daily activity, no treatment required beyond prophylaxis.

Grade 2: Moderate: discomfort present with some disruption of daily activity, require treatment.

Grade 3: Severe: discomfort that interrupts normal daily activity, not responding to first line treatment.

Grade 4: Life Threatening: discomfort that represents immediate risk of death, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary objective:

To determine the safety, tolerability and optimal cell dose of iC9/CD5CAR/IL-15 NK cells in patients with relapsed/refractory T-cell malignances, mantle cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The efficacy and optimal dose will be identified for individual diseases.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the overall response rate (complete and partial response rates)
* To quantify persistence of infused allogeneic donor iC9/CD5CAR/IL-15 NK cells in the recipient.
* To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies.
