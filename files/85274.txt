Video Education With Result Dependent dIsclosure
The overall study objective of this trial study is to identify and evaluate strategies to improve the accessibility of the video education with result dependent disclosure (VERDI) model, increasingly utilized as a pre-genetic testing (pretest) education alternative in clinical practice, to better serve a more diverse patient population at risk for hereditary cancers.

Video Education Acceptability (Qualitative Interview Study), Pre- and post-test of knowledge of hereditary cancer risk and cancer genetic counseling with qualitative patient interview question domains and instruments to assess understanding of language and imagery of video education as correlated with measures of health literacy., 3 Weeks
This study consists of two parts:

* Qualitative assessment:

  * This part of the research study involves watching a brief educational video about genetic testing for inherited cancer risk (about 8 minutes) before completing a short interview by video or telephone with trained researchers. This interview will be digitally recorded for later review. Participation in the study will be considered complete after the interview is finished. The qualitative assessment study will recruit 20 total participants.
  * The data gathered from this study will inform the refinement and adaptation of the VERDI model for the subsequent randomized controlled trial.
* Randomized control trial:

  * A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate the VERDI model vs. standard genetic counseling in 1000 participants
