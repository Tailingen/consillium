Study of Treatment Free Remission in Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase
The principal aim of this study is to evaluate complete molecular remission in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in deep molecular response after stopping tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. The second aim is to characterize the immunological status of patients with CML at the time of TKI interruption and then at 3 months after the interruption.
CML
DRUG: Discontinuing treatment with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor after enrolment
Molecular relapse free survival during 24 months, Molecular relapse free survival, defined as the time from the start of TKI interruption until the loss of the MMR.

RQ PCR (IS) \>0.1% BCR ABL will be considered as loss of MMR, 24 months
Treatment-free survival during 24 months, Treatment-free survival , defined as the time from the start of TKI interruption to the restart of the TKI., 24 months
Overall survival during 24 months, Overall survival, defined from the day of TKI interruption until date of death, date of last contact or loss of follow-up., 24 months|Pharmacoeconomic analysis during 24 months, Calculate the total saving of the included patients un US dollars, considering the costs of TKIs, PCRs performing and medical visits,, 24 months
ARGENTINA STOP TRIAL is a multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled trial to estimate the persistence of molecular remission in patients with chronic phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in Deep Molecular Response after stopping Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)

Primary Objective:

- To identify the proportion of patients who continue on Major Molecular Response after discontinuing treatment with TKI.

Secondary objectives:

* To characterize the immunological status of patients with CML at the time of interruption and then at 3 and 12 months after the interruption.

Tertiary objective: To evaluate the pharmacoeconomic impact of interrupting the treatment.
