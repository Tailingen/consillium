Efficacy Study for AC220 to Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
AC220 will be administered as a once daily oral solution given continuously as 28-day treatment cycles, without any rest periods, until disease progression, relapse, intolerance to the drug, or elective allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
