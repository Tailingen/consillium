Efficacy Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy to Treat Advanced Ovarian Cancer
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is alternative treatment option to upfront cytoreductive surgery to treat advanced ovarian cancer. Paclitaxel plus carboplatin is most frequently selected chemotherapeutic regimen for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Docetaxel had similar therapeutic efficacy compared to paclitaxel in adjuvant chemotherapy trials in ovarian cancer. However, docetaxel had more favorable toxicity profile. Therefore, the investigators aimed to evaluate the efficacy of docetaxel plus carboplatin as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.
