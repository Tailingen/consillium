Trial of an Augmented Mobilization Strategy With Plerixafor (Mozobil®) in a Population at Risk for Poor Stem Cell Mobilization
Poor mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors needed to support autologous transplantation is a serious clinical problem. We are investigating the role of plerixafor administered in an at risk population to augment successful stem cell collection.

OBJECTIVES

To determine if plerixafor when administered on the day prior to planned autologous collection on first mobilization attempt in those with a peripheral blood CD34 ≤ 10X106/L will:

* increase the number of patients successfully collected in one day
* increase the number of patients successfully mobilized on first collection attempt
* is cost neutral within a Canadian setting
Multiple Myeloma|Lymphoma
DRUG: Plerixafor|OTHER: Observation: Nonintervention
To increase the proportion of Poor Mobilizers who after receiving plerixafor are successfully collected in one day. The anticipated proportion increase is from 30%-60%., within 1-2 days after commencing therapy
To increase the proportion of Poor Mobilizers who after receiving plerixafor are successfully collected on first mobilization attempt rather than requiring a second mobilization., After therapy|To describe the kinetics of platelet and neutrophil recovery post ASCT in those treated and not treated with plerixafor, After therapy|To examine the immune recovery at day 100 post ASCT in those treated and not treated with plerixafor, After therapy|To undertake a pharmacoeconomic evaluation to examine the impact of plerixafor on resource utilization in a population at risk for poor mobilization, After therapy
