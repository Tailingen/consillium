AIO-BNHO Comprehensive Clinico-genomics Database Network - AIO-BNHO CONNECT
National, retro- and prospective, observational, multicenter clinical research platform to connect clinical and genomic data of patients with advanced (locally advanced, inoperable, or metastatic) solid tumors (excluding NSCLC, SCLC, and mesothelioma) with results from multi-gene next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels (\>30 genes)

The AIO-BNHO CONNECT research platform is a clinic-genomic database collecting data on NGS results and corresponding clinical outcomes in patients with advanced solid tumors (excluding NSCLC, SCLC, and mesothelioma). Data of deceased patients will be included. The platform will provide insight into the current state of precision oncology in Germany by compiling real-world data encompassing a broad spectrum of care providers including but not limited to practice-based oncologists, community hospitals, and university hospitals. The platform also comprises a decentral tissue repository with clinically annotated tumor specimens retrieved within routine clinical care that can be used in future collaborative research projects.
