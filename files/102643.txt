Research-Action in Hematology From Hospitalization to Home
Objective :

To study and support the hospitalization and the return home of patients with the help of a psychological follow-up started in a hospital institution and which will continue in the patient's home, based on the concepts of transitionality and narrativity.

Material and method To do this, the subjects will benefit from psychological interviews where they will freely discuss what concerns them, whether it is illness, treatment, returning home, or any other personal subject.

They will be divided into two groups of 5 patients each, one of the groups will benefit from follow-up in an institution as contracted for several years between the Institute of Hematology and the psychologists of the UMDSP, another from the same follow-up but with the presence of the psychologist at the time of discharge extended to the patient's home after leaving the hospital for a period of 2 months.

To ensure a certain consistency in the evaluation criteria, these will be standardized in the form of questionnaires completed blindly by the patient, a caregiver and the investigator, at 3 key times of the research (entry, discharge from hospital, two months after this discharge)

Device tested:

The aim of this work is to test the benefits of a device based on transitionality, which can limit, thanks to the restoration of the symbolization process, the deleterious effects of each of the stages imposed by the disease, the care and the resumption of autonomy once the active phase of care has passed.

Narrativity is also at the heart of this transitional device. It makes it possible to evoke the present experience of the patient in connection with future projects and in the continuity of past, potentially traumatic events. It opens onto a dynamic temporal perspective where the trauma freezes.

The whole process promotes the subjective reappropriation of the experience and a psychic well-being.
