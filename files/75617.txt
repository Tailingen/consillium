Study of Anti-CEACAM5 ADC M9140 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors (PROCEADE PanTumor)
The PROCEADE PanTumor study aims to investigate M9140 in multiple tumor types which express carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) and it is therefore designed as a matrix study. This study aims to assess the antitumor activity, tolerability, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of M9140 as monotherapy or in combination treatments in adult participants with locally advanced/metastatic CEACAM5 expressing tumors. There will be 3 substudies under this Master Protocol that may be conducted in parallel.

* PROCEADE PanTumor: A Phase 1b/2, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of Anti-CEACAM5 Antibody-Drug Conjugate M9140 in Participants with Advanced Gastric Cancer (Substudy GC);
* PROCEADE PanTumor: A Phase 1b/2, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of Anti-CEACAM5 Antibody-Drug Conjugate M9140 in Participants with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (Substudy NSCLC);
* PROCEADE PanTumor: A Phase 1b/2, Multicenter, Open Label Study of Anti-CEACAM5 Antibody-Drug Conjugate M9140 in Participants With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (Substudy PDAC).

The study follows a master protocol concept with several separate substudies in specific indications.

* Substudy GC: The study duration per participant is on an average approximately 10 months. This includes a 28-day Screening period, infusion (approximately 1 hour) on Day 1 of every cycle, and Safety Follow-up Visit 30 (± 3) days after the last dose of M9140.
* Substudy NSCLC: Study duration per participant is approximately 12 months. This includes a 28-day Screening period, infusion (approximately 1 hour) on Day 1 of every cycle, and Safety Follow-up Visit 30 (± 3) days after the last dose of M9140.
* Substudy PDAC: Study duration per participant is on an average approximately 8 months. This includes a 28-day Screening period, infusion (approximately 1 hour) on Day 1 of every cycle, and Safety Follow-up Visit 30 (±3) days after the last dose of M9140.
