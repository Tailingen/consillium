Prevention of Infection in Patients With Hematologic Cancer and Persistent Fever Caused by a Low White Blood Cell Count
RATIONALE: Antibiotic therapy may prevent the development of infection in patients with hematologic cancer and the persistent fever caused by a low white blood cell count. It is not yet known which regimen of antibiotics is most effective in preventing infection in these patients.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of piperacillin-tazobactam with or without vancomycin in reducing fever in patients who have leukemia, lymphoma, or Hodgkin's disease.

OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of piperacillin and tazobactam with or without vancomycin in reducing fever in patients with hematological malignancies and persistent febrile granulocytopenia.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients receive piperacillin/tazobactam IV over 20-30 minutes every 6 hours. Patients who become afebrile within 48-60 hours after beginning treatment continue to receive piperacillin/tazobactam alone. These afebrile patients continue treatment for a minimum of 7 days, of which 4 must be consecutive without fever. Patients who are still febrile after the initial 48-60 hours are randomized to continue on piperacillin/tazobactam alone or with vancomycin. Vancomycin IV is administered over at least 1 hour twice daily. Treatment continues for a maximum of 28 days in the absence of persistent fever. Patients are followed at 7-10 days after completion of therapy.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study.
