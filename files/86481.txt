Study of Tislelizumab Plus Chemotherapy vs Chemotherapy as Perioperative Treatment in Participants With HER2 Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab plus chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone as perioperative treatment in participants who have triple negative HER2 negative breast cancer.

After a screening phase of approximately 28 days, each participant will receive neoadjuvant study treatment (Tislelizumab + Chemotherapy OR Chemotherapy) based on the randomization schedule for approximately 24 weeks (8 cycles). Each participant will then undergo definitive surgery 3-6 weeks after conclusion of the last cycle of the neoadjuvant study treatment.

After definitive surgery, each participant will receive adjuvant study treatment (routine adjuvant treatment +/- Tislelizumab) for approximately 42 weeks (14 cycles).

Following adjuvant study treatment, each participant will be monitored for safety, survival and disease recurrence.

Pathological complete response (pCR) rate using the definition of ypT0/Tis ypN0 (i.e., no invasive residual in breast or nodes; noninvasive breast residuals allowed) at the time of definitive surgery, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., Up to 30 weeks
