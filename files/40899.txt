A Phase II Study of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Plus Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and Tremelimumab in Advanced-stage Ovarian Cancer (TRU-D)
The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the synergistic effects of durvalumab and tremelimumab plus chemotherapy in advanced-stage ovarian cancer.

Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic cancer. The current standard therapy is surgical cytoreduction followed by taxane-platinum combination chemotherapy. However, most patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer will experience a relapse of disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve outcomes of patients with this aggressive cancer.

Research hypothesis: Adding durvalumab and tremelimumab to current neoadjuvant chemotherapy (front-line therapy) in advanced-stage ovarian cancer can increase response rate and improve patient's outcome such as progression-free survival and overall survival with minimal effects on safety.
