Randomized Controlled Trial of Group Psychotherapy Interventions for Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to compare two types of group counseling for cancer patients: Meaning-Centered counseling and Supportive counseling. Many cancer patients seek counseling to help with the emotional burden of their illnesses. Counseling often helps them cope with cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. "Meaning-Centered" group counseling is intended to teach cancer patients how to maintain or even increase a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives, despite cancer. "Supportive" group counseling is intended to help you cope with cancer by giving you a place to express your feelings and get support from other cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to compare the benefits of these two types of counseling approaches for cancer patients.
