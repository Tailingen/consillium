Neo-TACE-HAIC for PVTT-HCC
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is a common disease in the East Asia. During the disease course, 20%-50% patients suffered portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), which is characterized with poor outcome and low response for treatments. Although BCLC (Barcelona clinical liver cancer) system recommend to palliative targeted treatment, the East Asian countries recommend to resection or transartery chemoembolization (TACE).

Recently, FOLFOX (Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil) based hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) exhibited high response rate for advanced HCC.

Pilot study showed TACE combined HAIC (TACE-HAIC) had better tumor response, with low progression disease rate.

Whether TACE-HAIC would improve survival for patients with PVTT is need to further to study. A randomized clinical trial compared neo-TACE-HAIC with surgery versus surgery alone is aimed to answer this question.
