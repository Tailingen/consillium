Genetic Information to Inform Treatment and Screening for Prostate Cancer, GIFTS Study
This trial studies the role of inherited (present at birth) mutations in cancer risk genes such as BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM, CHEK2, and others in relation to prostate cancer. This study may help researchers understand the frequency and importance of inherited mutations in cancer risk genes in patients with prostate cancer and potentially help identify better ways to treat cancer in patients who have a mutation in one of these genes.

BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaire|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Genetic Testing|OTHER: Genetic Counseling|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Identification of a population-based cohort of men with prostate cancer (PC) and germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair gene (gDRG) mutations, Identification to be determined through the Washington State Cancer Registry and by genetic testing on saliva samples for inherited mutations in cancer risk genes such as BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM, and others in prostate cancer., From the start of study through death (up to 20 years)|Clinical, pathologic, and molecular predictors of gDRG mutation carriers for men with PC, Predictors to be identified by analyzing information provided by participants on their health history and potentially further testing or chart review on participants who consent to future contact., From the start of study through death (up to 20 years)|Utility and feasibility of cascade genetic testing through use of family history of men with PC identified to have gDRG mutations, To be determined by collection of information about participants' family history and subsequent analysis of cascade genetic testing outcomes., From the start of study through death (up to 20 years)|Identification of a cohort of men with gDRG mutations without PC, Identification to be determined through family history of men with PC identified through the Washington State Cancer Registry and by genetic testing on saliva samples for inherited mutations in cancer risk genes such as BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM, and others in prostate cancer., From the start of study through death (up to 20 years)
OUTLINE:

Participants complete questionnaire over 20 minutes at baseline, then undergo collection of saliva sample for genetic testing. Participants identified to have an inherited mutation in a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair gene undergo genetic counseling. Participants whose genetic testing does not indicate an inherited mutation in a DNA repair gene receive a letter thanking them for their participation and emphasizing the importance of ongoing communication with their physician and family members about cancer risk.

Participants will be sent newsletters every year to encourage study engagement and update health questionnaires every two years.
