Induction Immunochemotherapy Followed by Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in Patients With ESCC.
This trial is conducted in patients with unresectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The investigators plan to enroll 60 patients with unresectable locally advanced esophageal cancer in Tianjin cancer hospital.

After 2 cycles of induction immunochemotherapy, 60 patients with ESCC will be divided into 2 groups (CR+PR group and SD+PD group) according to the efficacy of induction therapy. Patients in the CR+PR group will be treated with the same immunochemotherapy regimen plus concurrent radiotherapy (50.4Gy/1.8Gy/28f) . And immunotherapy will maintain for a maximum of 1 year. Patients in the SD+PD group will be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (Radiotherapy: PTV/PGTV:50.4Gy/59.92Gy/28f and another chemotherapy regimen). Immunotherapy will not used during chemoradiotherapy because of immunotherapy resistance.

The trial can effectively stratify patients by induction immunochemotherapy, and a more appropriate treatment regimen for patients has the potential to further improve PFS and prolong OS in all patients.
