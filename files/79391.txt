Comparing Patient-Centered Outcomes After Treatment for Uterine Fibroids
The purpose of this observational, retrospective database study of patients with uterine fibroids is to compare the durability of symptom relief after uterus-conserving treatments for symptomatic fibroids in terms of incidence of, and time to, new or recurrent symptoms and subsequent procedures and evaluate the effect stakeholder participation had on the research process.
Uterine Fibroids
PROCEDURE: myomectomy|PROCEDURE: endometrial ablation|PROCEDURE: uterine artery embolization|PROCEDURE: MRI-guided focused ultrasound ablation
Number of uterine fibroids patients who experience new or recurrent symptoms after uterus-conserving treatments (myomectomy, endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]-guided focused ultrasound ablation), Minimum of two years after index procedure|Time to new or recurrent symptoms after uterus-conserving treatments (myomectomy, endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]-guided focused ultrasound ablation), Minimum of two years after index procedure|Number of uterine fibroids patients who experience a subsequent procedure after uterus-conserving treatments (myomectomy, endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]-guided focused ultrasound ablation), Minimum of two years after index procedure|Time to a subsequent procedure after uterus-conserving treatments (myomectomy, endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]-guided focused ultrasound ablation), Minimum of two years|Effect of stakeholder participation in the research process, From first stakeholder conference (April 2014) to final stakeholder conference (November 2015)
