Needle Localization During Prostate Brachytherapy Using Power Doppler Ultrasound
This study involves patients who are scheduled for standard care brachytherapy of focal tumours within the prostate, which is normally performed under standard 2-dimensional (2D) ultrasound guidance. The purpose of this study is the acquire power Doppler ultrasound while using a simple oscillator in physical contact with the end of a brachytherapy needle. The vibrations along the needle should be visible in the power Doppler ultrasound, helping to visualize the needle position within the anatomy.
