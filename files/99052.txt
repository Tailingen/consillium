A Study to Learn About the Study Medicine (Avelumab) in Japanese Patients With Urothelial Carcinoma That Has Spread
The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn about the current treatment patterns, safety, and effects of the study medicine (Avelumab) for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma.

This study is seeking Japanese participants who:

* have urothelial cancer that has spread
* are treated with Avelumab for maintenance

We will study the experiences of people receiving avelumab. This helps us learn the current treatment patterns, safety, and effects of avelumab. Participants will take part in this study up to 10 months. During this time, they will have no study visits.

"Non-objective response" when "Stable Disease" of "Progressive Disease", At baseline (at the initiation of avelumab maintenance therapy)|Number of Participants With Presence or Absence of Variant Histology, Number of participants with presence or absence of variant histology was reported., At baseline (at the initiation of avelumab maintenance therapy)|Treatment-Free Interval, Treatment free-interval is defined as the time from the end date of first-line chemotherapy to the start date of avelumab administration. Treatment-free interval divided into the following categories. \<4 weeks/4 to 10 weeks/\>10 weeks., At baseline (at the initiation of avelumab maintenance therapy)|Percentage of Participants With Second-Line Treatment Regimen, Second-Line Therapies were categorized as: 1. Platinum Chemotherapy, 2. Enfortumab Vedotin, Gem, Gemcitabine, 3.immune checkpoint inhibitor., At baseline (at the initiation of avelumab maintenance therapy)
Time to Failure (TTF) of Avelumab, TTF was defined as the time from start of avelumab maintenance therapy to the date of end of treatment due to any cause including death. If there is no record of the end of treatment, it be discontinued on the last visit date during the study period., Time from start of avelumab maintenance therapy to the date of end of treatment due to any cause including death, assessed up to 5.9 months|Real-World Progression-Free Survival (Rw-PFS), rwPFS is defined as: The time from start of avelumab maintenance therapy to date of first disease progression (as clinically assessed by local investigator based on radiology, laboratory evidence, pathology, or other assessments) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. If there were no clinical records of death or disease progression, they will be censored at the date of initiation of the next line of therapy for the participants undertaking 2 or more lines of therapy (subsequent therapy after avelumab maintenance therapy) based on the record, or at their last visit date during the study period for the participants undertaking only 1 line of therapy (only avelumab maintenance therapy) based on the record., From index date up to 30 Jun 2022, where index date was date of first prescription for avelumab between 24 February 2021 and 30 November 2021 (maximum observation period was of 16 months approximately)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), The Best ORR was defined as the percentage of participants having achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1 as determined by the IRC. CR: defined as disappearance of all target and all non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR: defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, no progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions., Time from start of avelumab maintenance therapy to the date of end of treatment due to any cause including death, assessed up to 5.9 months|Real-World Progression-Free Survival (Rw-PFS) From Chemotherapy (rwPFS-cï¼‰, rwPFS-c is defined as the following: The time from start of first-line Chemotherapy to date of first disease progression (as clinically assessed by local investigator based on radiology, laboratory evidence, pathology, or other assessments) or death due to any cause during avelumab treatment, whichever occurred first. If there were no clinical records of death or disease progression, they will be censored at the date of initiation of the next line of therapy for the participants undertaking 2 or more lines of therapy (subsequent therapy after avelumab maintenance therapy) based on the record, or at their last visit date during the study period for the participants undertaking only 1 line of therapy (only avelumab maintenance therapy) based on the record., Time from start of avelumab maintenance therapy to the date of end of treatment due to any cause including death, assessed up to 5.9 months
