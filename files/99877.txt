Sintilimab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Neoadjuvant Treatment of Potentially Resectable Esophageal Cancer
This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of sintilimab combined with platinum-based chemotherapy in neoadjuvant treatment of potentially resectable esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: Liposomal Paclitaxel + Cisplatin + S-1
Safety and feasibility, Safety is defined as the incidence of Grade 3-4 Treatment-Related Adverse Events (TRAEs) from the day of neoadjuvant therapy to 30 days after surgery or within 90 days after last neoadjuvant treatment. Feasibility of surgery is defined as the incidence of TRAEs causing surgery delay of â‰¥30 days and/or inoperable patients., 20 months
MPR rate, Major Pathological Response (MPR) is defined as the presence of 10% or fewer viable cancer cells in the hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E)-stained slides from the resected tumor following neoadjuvant treatment., 20 months|R0 resection rate, R0 resection is defined as no cancer cells are seen microscopically at the resection margin following surgery., 20 months|Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS) is calculated from surgery to the date of recurrence or death., 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is calculated from the beginning of neoadjuvant treatment to the date of death from any cause., 5 years
Exploratory Outcomes, Correlation between biomarkers, including tumor mutational burden (TMB), clonal mutations, genetic alterations, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and therapeutic response to neoadjuvant therapy will be explored., 20 months
This study was designed as an open-lable, single-arm, exploratory clinical study. Sintilimab in combination with liposomal paclitaxel, cisplatin and S-1 will be given every 3 weeks to our patients for 2 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy. A radical dissection is scheduled within 6 weeks after last neoadjuvant treatment. This study will be devided for 3 phases: safety run-in, efficacy pilot and efficacy confirmation.
