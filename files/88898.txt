Comparison of Vagus Nerve-preserving RADG and Conventional RADG for AGC
Through comparative observation of robot vagus nerve preserving distal gastric cancer radical surgery and conventional robot distal gastric cancer radical surgery (not reserved vagus nerve) operative and postoperative indicators, and evaluating the feasibility and safety of vagus nerve preserving distal gastric cancer radical surgery in advanced gastric cancer. Which can provide the evidences for the clinical development of the preserving function gastric cancer surgery.
