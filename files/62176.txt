Study of Fc-Optimized Anti-CD19 Antibody (MOR00208) to Treat B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia(B-ALL)
This is an open-label, multicentre study to characterize the safety and preliminary efficacy of the human anti CD19 antibody MOR00208 in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: MOR00208 (formerly Xmab5574)
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR= CR (Complete Remission) + PR (Partial Remission)

Antitumor activity of MOR00208, Throughout during study until progression, after each treatment cycle
Patients Response Duration Evaluation by Hematology, Bone Marrow Aspirates or Biopsy, CT, Two patients had a response to treatment. For one of the two patients a progression was recorded, the other patient was censored due to an AE. Conse quently, the planned Kaplan-Meier analyses of response duration and time to hematological relapse could not be calculated., Throughout during study until progression, after each treatment cycle|Safety Will be Evaluated by Assessing Adverse Events, Clinical Lab Data and Vital Signs, ECG, Physical Exam, Number of patients with at least one treatment-emergent AE, weekly, up to 7 months|Pharmacokinetics of MOR00208, Steady State Trough Plasma Concentration (Cpre-dose) at 9th dose (infusion), weekly, up to 16 weeks, based on samples taken Pre-dose (ie before infusion start)|Number of Patients Who Develop Ant-MOR00208 Antibodies as a Measure of Immunogenicity, monthly, up to 7 months|Safety Will be Evaluated by Assessing Adverse Events, Clinical Lab Data and Vital Signs, ECG, Physical Exam, Number of patients with treatment-emergent AEs, weekly, up to 7 months
