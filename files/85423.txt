Clinical Study on the Harvesting Lymph Nodes With Carbon Nanoparticles for Advanced Gastric Cancer
Carbon Nanoparticles (CNP),with a mean size of 150 nm,can be taken up selectively by lymphatics after injection into the tissue and draining regional lymph nodes are thereby colored black,which may provide surgeons the guidance to lymph node dissection and help them harvest lymph nodes after surgery,especially some small ones. but there was insufficient evidence to justify its efficacy for those purposes.Therefore,the investigators carried out a prospective randomized controlled trial on lymph node vital staining for lymph node dissection and harvesting in advanced gastric cancer to test this idea.
