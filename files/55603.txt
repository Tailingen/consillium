Immunochemotherapy With Rituximab-Bendamustine-Cytarabine (R-BAC) for Patients With Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The objective of the study is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and activity of Rituximab-Bendamustine-Cytarabine(R-BAC) regimen in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) aged 65 years or more, as well as in younger patients who are not eligible for intensive regimens including/not including autologous transplantation.
Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell
DRUG: Rituximab, Bendamustine, Cytarabine
The safety and tolerability of R-BAC treatment will be tested to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Ara-C when combined with Bendamustine and Rituximab., June 2011
Overall response and freedom from progression after R-BAC treatment, June 2011
Since Bendamustine has recently shown promising safety and efficacy in combination with monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of patients with MCL, the goal of this study is to investigate the possible therapeutic benefit of combining Ara-C with Bendamustine and Rituximab (R-BAC). All three agents exhibit individual and unique mechanisms of action in MCL, and a synergistic or additive effect might be expected when these agents are used in combination, as suggested by the pre-clinical studies.
