Effect of Age, Weight and Sex on Levothyroxine Pharmacokinetics
This study was a prospective, single-center, open-label, non-randomized, pharmacokinetic study using stable isotope carbon-13 labeled levothyroxine

CL/F analysed by age groups, CL/F will be compared in adults (age ≤60 years) versus elderly (age\>60 years) using Wilcoxon signed-rank test using significance level of α = 0.05. Additionally, these PK parameters were regressed against age (as a continuous covariate).

Sex (male or female), weight (as a continuous covariate), and body mass index (BMI) (as a continuous covariate) will be considered using a stepwise linear regression approach., 120 hours|V/F analysed by age groups, V/F will be compared in adults (age ≤60 years) versus elderly (age\>60 years) using Wilcoxon signed-rank test using significance level of α = 0.05.

Setting The study was conducted on the clinical research unit of an academic medical center.

Participants Adults of any age being treated with levothyroxine for hypothyroidism were studied.

Interventions A single dose of 13C- LT4 was administered to hypothyroid subjects taking levothyroxine replacement.

Main Outcomes and Measures Eighteen serial plasma samples were collected. One sample was obtained before the 13C- LT4 dose and the remainder over the 312-hour period post-dosing. 13C- LT4 concentration was quantified using validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods. Pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted using linear log trapezoidal non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix 6.4.
