Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Perfusion to Detect Disease in Prostate Carcinoma
This is a pilot study of 50 patients to establish whether there is a potential role for MRI perfusion in the detection of locally recurrent or persistent prostate carcinoma after previous treatment with radiotherapy. All subjects will be patients who have had localised prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and have already agreed to undergo a biopsy of the prostate to look at local control within the prostate as part of their management. The objective of the study is to establish whether there is a relationship between recurrent or persistent disease within the prostate and increased perfusion on MRI at these sites.
