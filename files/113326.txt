Efficacy and Safety of Fruquintinib in Combination With PD-1 Inhibitors as First-line Maintenance Therapy for Advanced HER-2 Negative Gastric Cancer: a Single-arm, Prospective, Exploratory Clinical Study
Maintenance therapy is very important in advanced HER-2 negative gastric cancer, and immune monotherapy has no obvious benefit in the first-line maintenance treatment of advanced gastric cancer； Fruquintinib is a potent small-molecule VEGFR inhibitor with high kinase selectivity；Studies have shown that immunotherapy combined with antiangiogenic agents is promising for synergistic antitumor effects； The aim of this study was to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib combined with PD-1 inhibitor in the first-line maintenance treatment of advanced HER-2 negative gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib+PD-1
Progression free survival (PFS), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks, until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 2 year
Overall survival (OS), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from randomization until death due to any cause, assessed up to 3 year|Objective response rate (ORR), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 2 year|Disease control rate (DCR), Tumor assessment will be performed using radiography method every 8 weeks until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD), using RECIST v 1.1, from randomization up to progressive disease or EOT due to any cause, assessed up to 2 year|Safety and tolerance evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs, Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 5.0, from first dose to 30 days post the last dose
