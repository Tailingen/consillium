Randomized Controlled Clinical Study of Efficacy and Safety of Initumab Combined with Pyrrotinib and Chemotherapeutic Agents in Neoadjuvant Therapy for HER2-positive Breast Cancer with Different Treatment Cycles
The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy and safety of initumab combined with pyrrotinib and chemotherapy for 4 cycles and 6 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer, and to explore the efficacy and safety of continued use of initumab combined with pyrrotinib in pCR patients.

This study adopted A prospective, randomized controlled, open-label design, and selected eligible subjects to be randomly divided into cohort A and Cohort B. Cohort A will receive initumab at initial load dose of 8mg/kg and maintenance dose of 6mg/kg intravenously on the first day of every three weeks for a total of 4 doses. Pyrrotinib 400mg orally once daily; Combined chemotherapy drugs (not limited, according to the actual clinical selection), a total of 4 cycles of administration. After surgery for breast cancer, initumab + pyrrotinib was selected as adjuvant therapy for pCR patients after surgery for 1 year (neoadjuvant therapy + adjuvant therapy for a total of 1 year, a total of 13 cycles of adjuvant therapy), and non-pCR patients were selected by doctors. Cohort B will receive initumab at initial load dose of 8mg/kg and maintenance dose of 6mg/kg intravenously on the first day of every three weeks. Pyrrotinib 400mg orally once daily; Combined chemotherapy drugs (not limited, according to the actual clinical selection), a total of 6 cycles of administration. After surgery for breast cancer, initumab + pyrrotinib was selected as adjuvant therapy for pCR patients after surgery for 1 year (neoadjuvant therapy + adjuvant therapy for a total of 1 year, and adjuvant therapy for a total of 11 cycles), and non-pCR patients were selected by doctors.
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: Cohort A will receive an initial load dose of 8mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 6mg/kg intravenously on the first day of every three weeks for a total of 4 doses|DRUG: Cohort B will receive an initial load dose of 8mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 6mg/kg intravenously on the first day of every three weeks for a total of 6 doses
total Pathological Complete Response，tpCR, After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, subjects' completely removed breast specimens and all sampled regional lymph nodes were evaluated
Overall Response Rate，ORR, It refers to the percentage of cases that achieved complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) after neoadjuvant therapy as a percentage of the total number of evaluable cases|Event-Free Survival，EFS, Refers to the time from enrollment to the first recorded recurrence of disease, disease progression, or death from any cause after surgery|Invasive Disease-Free Survival，iDFS, Refers to the time from enrollment to the first occurrence of an aggressive ipsilateral tumor recurrence, aggressive countermeasure breast cancer, local/regional aggressive recurrence, distant recurrence, or death from any cause|Overall Survival, Refers to the time from enrollment to death
