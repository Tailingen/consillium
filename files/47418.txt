A First-in-Human Study of JAB-8263 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label study of JAB-8263 to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and assess the DLT. 30 subjects with advanced solid tumor will be enrolled.
Solid Tumors, Adult
DRUG: JAB-8263
Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities, Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the dose escalation phase. A DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first treatment cycle with JAB-8263, Approximately 2.5 years|Find Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of JAB-8263, Measurements of MTD (i.e. the highest dose of JAB-8263 associated with the occurrence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in \<33% of patients) or the RP2D (i.e. the highest tested dose that is declared safe and tolerable by the Investigators and Sponsor), Approximately 2.5 years
Number of participants with adverse events, All patients participating in this study will be assessed for incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs, including changes in laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms, cardiac imaging and ophthalmological assessments, Approximately 2.5 years|Area under the curve, Area under the plasma concentration time curve of JAB-8263, Approximately 2.5 years|Cmax, Highest observed plasma concentration of JAB-8263, Approximately 2.5 years|Tmax, Time of highest observed plasma concentration of JAB-8263, Approximately 2.5 years|T1/2, Half life of JAB-8263, Approximately 2.5 years|Objective response rate ( ORR ), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response or partial response (CR+PR), Approximately 2.5 years|Duration of response ( DOR ), DOR is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response (CR or PR) to study drug therapy, to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 2.5 years
JAB-8263 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the highly conserved bromodomain pockets of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins.

The objectives of this study are:

To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of JAB-8263 as a single agent to adult subjects with advanced solid tumors To assess the safety and tolerability of JAB-8263 To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and pharmacodynamics (PDc) To evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of JAB-8263
