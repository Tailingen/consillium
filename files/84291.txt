Intensive Locoregional Chemoimmunotherapy for Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Plus Intranodal DC Vaccines
This study will evaluate the immunologic and potential clinical effectiveness of intensive locoregional sequential intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin (IPC) with intravenous (iv) paclitaxel followed by peritoneal infusion of a chemokine modulatory (CKM) regimen composed of a cocktail of IP rintatolimod and interferon-alpha (IFNα) for patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer (III-IV) at primary neoadjuvant setting.

In the safety phase I phase, we determined the tolerable dose of IPC-CKM. In this phase 2 we will add intradermal (ID) autologous αDC1 vaccines (known to be nontoxic) to the tolerable IPC-CKM regimen. The effectiveness will be determined by rate of complete pathologic response.

On Phase 1, patients received up to 6 cycles of IPC, with CKM after the 2nd to 6th cycles. On Phase 2, (which opened 8/27/24/ )patients will receive up to 6 -8 cycles of chemotherapy with ID injections of DC1 vaccine with CKM. To optimize the pattern of immunity, all patients will also receive oral celecoxib (COX2 inhibitor).
