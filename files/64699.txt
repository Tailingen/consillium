The efficacy and safety of TareSphere in patients with unresectable HCC remains unknown. This trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase I trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NRT6003 injection.

The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of NRT6003 Injection. While the secondary objectives include the assessments of the antitumoral efficacy, the improvement of patientsÂ´ quality of life, and the distribution characteristics of Yttrium-90 in body.
