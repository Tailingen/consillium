Lymphoma
DEVICE: Endobronchial ultrasound guided miniforceps biopsy and transbronchial needle aspiration
positivity of the procedure in Diagnosis and Subtyping of lymphoma, a sample wil be considered positive if it allows the clinical management of the patient, without additional sampling required., up to 3 years
every adverse effect related to the procedure, infectious process related to the procedure, hemoptysis over 50cc, worsening of respiratory status requiring hospitalization, up to 3 years
