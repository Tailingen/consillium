The investigators reported that perioperative immunonutrition had no additional effects compared with preoperative immunonutrition in patients underwent colorectal surgery (Braga M, Gianotti L, Vignali A, Carlo VD. Preoperative oral arginine and n-3 fatty acid supplementation improves the immunometabolic host response and outcome after colorectal resection for cancer. Surgery. 2002; 132:805-14, PMID: 12464864). Object of this study is to investigate the additional effects of perioperative immunonutrition on cell-mediated immunity and incidence of infectious complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
