ctDNA in CRC Patients Undergoing Curative-intent Surgery for Liver Metastases
This is a prospective multicenter cohort study, was designed to explore the prognostic value of ctDNA as a biomarker of disease response and recurrence or death in patients undergoing curative-intent surgical resection of Colorectal cancer liver metastasis.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer|Circulating Tumor DNA
Disease-free survival (DFS) in patients who undergo curative-intent resection of colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), DFS is defined as the time from complete surgical resection (following first surgery if one-stage surgery or second surgery if two-stage strategy) to first documented event (relapse or death, whichever occurred first), or until last contact if no event occurs., Up to 36 months
Number of event-free survival (EFS) in patients who undergo curative-intent resection of CRLM., EFS is defined as time between inclusion until the occurrence of an event: disease progression, relapse, disease progression, or death from any reason., Up to 4 years|Overall survival (OS) n patients who undergo curative-intent resection of CRLM., OS is defined as the time between inclusion and death. Alive patients will be censored at the last date known to be alive, either during study treatment period or during follow-up period., Up to 4 years|Time to surgical failure (TSF) in patients who undergo curative-intent resection of CRLM., TFS is defined as the time from initial surgery until the first unresectable recurrence or death from any cause or the date of the last follow-up, at which point data are censored., Up to 4 years|Prognostic value of ctDNA, Prognostic value of ctDNA:

* post-operative ctDNA detection,
* relative change in ctDNA level after curative resection of CRLM,
* ctDNA in different subgroups of patients classified according to the type of surgical strategy (standard approach, combined surgery, reverse strategy, two-staged hepatectomy),, Up to 4 years|Prognostic factor(s) for disease recurrence and survival., Prognostic factor(s) for disease recurrence and survival in patients who undergo curative-intent resection of CRLM., Up to 4 years|Association between ctDNA and clinical features., To identify the clinical, biological, and pathological factors associated with the ctDNA level., Up to 4 years
Blood collection times according to specific clinical situations:

* Standard approach
* Combined surgery
* Reverse strategy
* Two-stage hepatectomy
