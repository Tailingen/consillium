Melphalan and Panobinostat (LBH589) for the Treatment of Patients With Recurrent Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Panobinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving melphalan together with panobinostat may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of melphalan when given together with panobinostat in treating patients with recurrent multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Melphalan|DRUG: Panobinostat
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Phase 1: to determine the MTD of panobinostat (LBH589) in combination with melphalan to be used in the Phase 2 portion of the study, 12 months|MTD, Phase 1: to determine MTD of melphalan in combination with panobinostat to be used in the Phase 2 portion of the study, 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) and Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) [ORR= Complete Response (CR) + Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) + Partial Response (PR)]; CBR=ORR + Minimal Response (MR)] Following Treatment With Panobinostat and Melphalan, Responses were evaluated according to criteria modified from those developed by Blade et al., 1998 The reference point for evaluating response improvement is the baseline. This baseline reference point is also valid when a patient has already achieved a response and transitions through into a better response grade., 24 months
Duration of Response, First evidence of PR or better (for overall response) and MR or better (for clinical benefit response) to start of disease progression or death|Time to Progression, Time from the start of treatment to progressive disease
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of panobinostat in combination with melphalan in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I)
* To determine the dose of this regimen to be used in the Phase II portion of the study. (Phase I)
* To determine the efficacy as evidenced by the response rate (combined complete response, very good partial response, partial response, and minimal response) in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

Secondary

* To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of the combination of LBH589 and melphalan for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I)
* To determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)
* To determine time to disease progression, time to response, and duration of response in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)
* To determine progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

Patients receive oral panobinostat once daily on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 and oral melphalan once daily on days 1, 3 and 5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
