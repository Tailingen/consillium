Study of Ponatinib in Patients With Lung Cancer Preselected Using Different Candidate Predictive Biomarkers
This phase II trial studies how well ponatinib hydrochloride works in treating patients with stage III-IV lung cancer. Ponatinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

Biomarker FGFR1 (ISH/SISH) Score (Part A), Biomarker prevalence and its 95% (exact) confidence interval (CI) among the screening patients and for different histologies will be reported. Molecular cohorts for ISH and SISH positivity: FGFR1 ISH+/SISH+, FGFR1 ISH+/SISH-, FGFR1 ISH-/SISH+, and FGFR1 ISH-/SISH-, Baseline|Overlapping Frequency of FGFR1 (ISH/SISH) Biomarkers (Part A), Overlapping frequency and its 95% CI between biomarkers among the screening patients and for different histologies will also be reported., Baseline|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST v1.1 (Part B), Evaluated using Fisher's exact test with a descriptive p-value. Summarized using binomial proportions with 95% exact binomial confidence intervals., From date of first dose until date of Disease Progression or death (up to 153 days), whichever occurred first
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0, Adverse events will be tabulated per participant, per organ, and per visit., From date of first dose until date of Disease Progression (up to 153 days). Assessed at Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 of each 28 day cycle)
This study will look at the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug ponatinib in lung cancer. The investigators hope that ponatinib will work against tumors that have certain biomarkers. Therefore, the study will pre-screen patients for these certain biomarkers before enrolling them into the main treatment study. Different doses of ponatinib may be tested in this study.
