A Study of SDX-7320 in Combination With Eribulin for People With Breast Cancer
The researchers are doing this study to find out whether the study drug, SDX-7320, when combined with the standard chemotherapy eribulin, is an effective treatment for people with TNBC and metabolic dysfunction. The researchers will also look at whether the study treatment (SDX-7320 combined with eribulin) is safe and causes few or mild side effects in participants. The researchers will compare this treatment approach to eribulin alone.
