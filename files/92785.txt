The Clinical Efficacy of Drug Sensitive Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Based on Organoid Versus Traditional Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Advanced Gastric Cancer
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become the mainstream recommended treatment for advanced gastric cancer. However, due to the heterogeneity of gastric cancer, part of some patients fail to benefit from the treatment. This project aims to compare the clinical efficacy of individualized neoadjuvant therapy based on patient-derived organoid drug sensitivity assay and traditional regimen, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of these two treatments. And access the safety and clinical value of the personalized neoadjuvant therapy based on patient-derived organoid drug sensitivity assay in advanced gastric cancer.
