MucoLox Formulation to Mitigate Mucositis Symptoms in Head/Neck Cancer
This study will examine if the administration of prophylactic MucoLox formulation versus sodium bicarbonate mouthwash in subjects with head/neck cancer receiving radiation ± chemotherapy will result in significantly fewer subjects experiencing severe mucositis.
Mucositis Oral|Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: MucoLox|OTHER: Sodium Bicarbonate
AUC for the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire mouth and throat soreness question #2, To compare the area under the curve (AUC) for the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ) mouth and throat soreness (MTS) question 2 (Q2) score over a one-month period in subjects receiving the MucoLox formulation versus sodium bicarbonate rinse (as the control) for the prevention of severe mucositis in subjects with head/neck cancer receiving radiation ± chemotherapy, One month
Time to OMDQ MTS > 2, To compare the time to OMDQ MTS Q2 \> 2 between the two arms, One month|Opioid use (morphine equivalent daily dose), To estimate opioid use defined as the average morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) at each clinic visit: baseline, day 8 ± 2, day 15 ± 2, day 22 ± 2, and the final study visit (day 29 ± 5) and compare between the two arms, Weekly during the one-month study period|Assess remaining OMDQ questions, To assess changes in the remaining OMDQ questions longitudinally throughout study treatment and compare between the two arms., One month|Duration of symptom relief, To evaluate and compare the duration of symptom relief in those who experience any degree of oral mucositis between the two arms, One month|Frequency of chemoradiation delays, To evaluate the frequency of delays in \[chemotherapy and/or radiation\] therapy throughout the study period and compare between the two arms., One month|Oral mucositis grade, To summarize the prevalence and grade of oral mucositis at each clinic visit: baseline, day 8 ± 2, day 15 ± 2, day 22 ± 2, and the final study visit (day 29 ± 5), as assessed by the treating investigator using the WHO criteria for grading, and compare between the two arms., Weekly during the one month study period|Comparison of self-reported OMDQ scores versus investigator-assessed mucositis, The Generalized McNemar's test will be used to analyze correlation between patient report OMDQ Q2 scores and oral mucositis grading assessed by treating investigator using WHO criteria., Weekly during the one month study period
Drug-related adverse events, To summarize the rates of potential side effects related to each oral formulation, including but not limited to mouth discomfort, allergic reactions, exacerbation of mucositis symptoms, mouth ulcers, dry mouth, unpleasant taste or dysgeusia. Safety variables include AEs and SAEs related to the study treatment. Adverse events will be evaluated continuously throughout the study. Safety, tolerability, relationship to study treatment, and intensity will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03., One month
The primary objective of this double-arm, single-blinded, Phase II randomized study is to compare the area under the curve (AUC) for the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ) mouth and throat soreness (MTS) question 2 (Q2) score over a one-month period in subjects receiving the MucoLox formulation versus sodium bicarbonate rinse (as the control) for the prevention of severe mucositis in subjects with head/neck cancer receiving radiation ± chemotherapy. Secondary objectives include comparing the time to OMDQ MTS Q2 \> 2 between the two arms; estimating and comparing opioid use defined as the average morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) at each clinic visit; assessing and comparing changes in the remaining OMDQ questions longitudinally throughout study; evaluating and comparing the duration of symptom relief in those who experience any degree of oral mucositis; evaluating and comparing the frequency of delays in \[chemotherapy and/or radiation\] therapy throughout the study period; and summarizing and comparing the prevalence and grade of oral mucositis at each clinic visit. The safety objective is to summarize the rates of potential side effects related to each oral formulation. A total of 60 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of the treatment arms. Subjects on the control arm (sodium bicarbonate) who experience severe mucositis will have the option to crossover to the Mucolox arm for an additional 7 ± 2 days or until day 29 ± 5 days, whichever is longer.
