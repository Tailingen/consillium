S-1+Oxaliplatin vs.S-1+Cisplatin First-line Treatment of Advanced or Recurrent Non-intestinal Type Gastric Adenocarcinoma Patients
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of S-1+Oxaliplatin vs.S-1+Cisplatin First-line Treatment in Advanced or Recurrent Non-intestinal Gastric Adenocarcinoma or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma Patients.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: S-1|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin
Overall Survival, OS means that from the first dose of treatment drug to death or lost, the follow-up visit will be performed every 12 weeks till death or lost, 1-1.5 year
Objective response rate, The primary endpoint is objective response rate,which equals CR+PR., 1 year|time to treatment failure (TTF), The duration is from the randomized time to treatment termination due to any reason. The reasons may include disease progression, treatment toxicity, patient selection or death., 6 months|progression-free survival (PFS), The duration is from the randomized time to disease progression or death due to any reason., 6 months|Adverse events (AE), 1-1.5 years
The primary endpoint is Overall survival time (OS).Secondary endpoints are overall response rate (ORR), time to treatment failure (TTF),progression free survival (PFS)and the adverse reactions(AE) of the two groups .

Study design:

This is a prospective randomized control study.

Sample size:

Sample size considerations were based on the survival end point. The improvement in median survival from 10 months in the S-1+cisplatin arm to 13 months in the S-1+oxaliplatin arm was considered clinically relevant in this patient population. A total of 576 patients were required for a two-tailed log-rank test at the 5% significance and at least 80% power. The planned enrolled time was 48 months and 1 year of follow up, and a drop-out rate of 5%.
