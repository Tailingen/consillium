A Study of Microwave Ablation Combined With Immunotherapy ± Anti-angiogenic Drugs in the Treatment of Solid Tumors
This is a multi-center, phase Il trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of microwave ablation combined with immunotherapy ± anti-angiogenic drugs in the treatment of advanced second-line and above solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Adebrelimab|DRUG: Apatinib|PROCEDURE: microwave ablation
Objective Response Rate, Determined using RECIST V1.1 criteria, defined as best overall response (CR or PR), up to 24 months
Disease control rate, Disease Control Rate determined usina RECIST V1.1 criteria., up to 24 months|Progression-free Survival, Defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression, up to 36 months|Overall Survival, Defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., up to 36 months|incidence rate of AE, Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to the NCI CCAE, up to 36 months
explore immune resistance mechanisms, to explore immune resistance mechanisms, up to 36 months
This study plans to recruit 60 patients witha dvanced second-line and above solid tumors observe and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of microwave ablation combined with immunotherapy ± anti-angiogenic drugs.
