Detection of Early Gastric Cancers Using Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy
The purpose of this study is to determine whether endomicroscopy can improve the detection of Early Gastric Cancers (EGC).
Stomach Neoplasms|Precancerous Conditions
DEVICE: Endomicroscope (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan)|DEVICE: Gastroscopes (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan)
To compare the rate of EGCs/GCs using CLE versus conventional gastroscopy., one year
To evaluate the efficacy of in vivo CLE on different pathological characteristics of EGCs., one year
Endoscopy is proved to be the best method to achieve early diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC). Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), a new diagnostic modality, has been shown to be valuable in increasing the diagnostic yield of colorectal neoplasias, but it is not clear whether CLE is helpful to find out early gastric cancer (EGC).The aim of the study is to investigate the value of CLE in improving the detection of EGCs.
