Protexa® Versus TiLoopBra® in Immediate Breast Reconstruction- A Pilot Study
Randomized controlled trial to look at early complications, cosmetic outcome, patient satisfaction and thickness of the tissue overlying the implant at the lower pole in immediate implant based breast reconstruction after Skin or Nipple Sparing Mastectomy with either a mesh (TiLOOP Bra) or an ADM (Protexa). Multicenter austrian trial with four breast cancer centers, 50 patients randomized 1:1 in the TiLoop or Protexa group.
