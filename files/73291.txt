A Study of PY314 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, first in human, Phase 1a/1b study of PY314 in subjects with locally advanced (unresectable) and/or metastatic solid tumors that are refractory or relapsed to standard of care (including pembrolizumab, if approved for that indication).

DRUG: PY314|DRUG: Combination Therapy: PY314 + Pembrolizumab
Incidence of Adverse Events (AE), Adverse Events will be summarized by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. Separate tabulations will be produced for all treatment emergent AEs, treatment related AEs, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), discontinuations due to AEs, and AEs of at least NCI CTCAE grade 3 severity., 36 months|(Part A only) Dose Limiting Toxicity of PY314, Evaluation of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)., Assessed during first 21 days of treatment
Measure PY314 concentration at the end of infusion (CEOI), Measure PY314 concentration at the end of infusion (CEOI) after the first dose., 36 months|Measure PY314 concentration at the trough level (Ctrough), Measure PY314 concentration at the trough level (Ctrough). All subjects who received at least 1 dose of PY314 and have at least 1 measured concentration at a scheduled PK time point after start of dosing., 36 months|Determining PY314 time to maximum concentration (Tmax), Determining PY314 time to maximum concentration (Tmax) during Cycle 1., 36 months|Measure PY314 Area under the curve (AUC)0-t, Measure PY314 Area under the curve (AUC)0-t. All subjects who received at least 1 dose of PY314 and have at least 1 measured concentration at a scheduled PK time point after start of dosing for at least 1 PK analyte., 36 months|Measure PY314 half-life (T1/2), Measure PY314 half-life (T1/2). All subjects who received at least 1 dose of PY314 and have at least 1 measured concentration at a scheduled PK time point after start of dosing for at least 1 PK analyte., 36 months|Measure PY314 Clearance (CL), Measure PY314 Clearance (CL). All subjects who received at least 1 dose of PY314 and have at least 1 measured concentration at a scheduled PK time point after start of dosing for at least 1 PK analyte., 36 months|Measure PY314 Volume at Steady State (Vss), Measure PY314 Volume at Steady State (Vss). All subjects who received at least 1 dose of PY314 and have at least 1 measured concentration at a scheduled PK time point after start of dosing for at least 1 PK analyte., 36 months|Measure PY314 maximum concentration (Cmax), Measure PY314 maximum concentration (Cmax) at various time points during Cycle 1. All subjects who received at least 1 dose of PY314 and have at least 1 measured concentration at a scheduled PK time point after start of dosing., 36 months|Incidence of Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) formation to PY314, To evaluate the incidence of anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation to PY314, 36 months|Objective response rate (ORR), The incidents of ORR is defined as either a complete or partial response per RECIST. Subjects with no baseline data will be considered no responders. ORR will be summarized by dose, tumor type, and overall. ORR will be summarized descriptively., 36 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Defined as the percentage of subjects who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease., 36 Months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR will be calculated to determine durability. DOR will be measured from the time by which the criteria for CR or PR-whichever is recorded first-are met until the first date by which recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. DOR will be assessed using KAPLAN-MEIER methods., 36 months
Progress free survival (PFS), PFS will be measure from entry onto the study until disease progression or death from any cause. PFS will be assessed using KAPLAN-MEIER methods., 36 months|Overall survival (OS), The duration of overall survival (OS) will be measured from the time of first study drug administration until the date of death. OS will be assessed using KAPLAN-MEIER methods., 36 months
Part A: Dose escalation of PY314 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab in a standard 3+3 design Part B: Dose expansion of one or more dose levels of PY314 administered alone and in combination with pembrolizumab for predefined tumor histology
