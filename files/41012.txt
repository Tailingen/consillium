Comparison of 20% Mannitol and 3% Hypertonic Saline for Cerebral Relaxation During Elective Supratentorial Craniotomies
Mannitol 20% has long been used to treat elevated intracranial hypertension in trauma and intensive care settings. More recent data indicate that hypertonic saline may be as effective or more effective than mannitol for this purpose, with possible fewer side effects.

This study compares both agents in favoring cerebral relaxation during elective supratentorial procedures for tumor resection.

Study hypothesis: 3% hypertonic saline will provide better cerebral relaxation with fewer side effects than 20% mannitol.
Osmotherapy|Intracranial Pressure
DRUG: 20% mannitol bolus administration|DRUG: Hypertonic saline 3% bolus administration
Sub-dural intracranial pressure, Sub-dural measure of intracranial pressure to evaluate cerebral relaxation, In average 30-60 minutes after intervention, just before dura mater opening
Subjective evaluation of cerebral relaxation, Subjective evaluation by the surgeon of cerebral relaxation on a 4 point scale, In average 30-60 minutes after intervention, just after dura mater opening|Serum lactate, Serum lactate measurement to assess tissue perfusion during the procedure, In average 5-8 hours after intervention, upon arrival in the intensive care unit
