An Observational Study of Patients Receiving T-DXd for Treatment of HER2+, and HER2-low Unresectable and/or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This study will collect real-world clinical and patient reported outcomes (PRO) and diary data from eligible patients with documented Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2+) \[globally\] or HER2-low \[North America only\] in routine clinical practice.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: None (Observational Study)
Real-World Time to Next Treatment (rwTTNT), Real-world time to next treatment will be evaluated. rwTTNT is defined as the length of time from date of first T-Dxd administration to the date the patient received an administration of their next systemic treatment regimen or to their date of death if there is a death prior to having another systemic treatment regimen., From first dose of T-DXd until study discontinuation (approximately 3 years)|T-Dxd treatment patterns for HER2+ cohort, Treatment patterns will be summarised using summary statistics., Approximately 3 years
T-Dxd treatment patterns for HER2-low, Treatment patterns will be summarised using summary statistics., Approximately 3 years|Demographics and clinical charcteristics, Summary statistics will be used to describe the Demographics and clinical characteristics, At Baseline (14 to 30 days prior to T-DXd initiation)|Number of patients with Physician reported Safety Events of Interest (SEIs), The safety and tolerability of T-Dxd through the collection of physician-reported SEIs will be assessed., From first dose of T-DXd until End of T-DXd treatment (40 + 7 days after last T-DXd administration)|Number of patients provided prophylactic and reactive treatment for SEIs management, The management of SEIs will be characterized., From first dose of T-DXd until End of T-DXd treatment (40 + 7 days after last T-DXd administration)|Real-World Time to Discontinuation (rwTTD), Real-World Time to Discontinuation of T-DXd will be evaluated. rwTTD is defined as time from index date to the earliest date of T-DXd discontinuation, or death., From first dose of T-DXd until study discontinuation (approximately 3 years)|Patient-reported overall side effect burden as measured by the Patient's Global Impression of Treatment Tolerability (PGI-TT), Patient-reported tolerability will be evaluated by PGI-TT. Single question asking patients how bothered they were by the side effects of their cancer treatment, ranging from Not at all to Very much., Approximately 3 years|Symptomatic SEI as measured by selected items from National Cancer Institute Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI PRO-CTCAE), Patient-reported tolerability will be evaluated by selected items from the NCI PRO-CTCAE. The following items are selected: nausea, vomiting, bloating of the abdomen, shortness of breath, cough, heart palpitations, hair loss, and fatigue, tiredness or lack of energy., Approximately 3 years|Daily Nausea and Vomiting symptom diary, Nausea and vomiting symptoms diary will be assessed based on severity, interference with appetite and usual activities., From first dose of T-DXd until 3 months
This is a multi-center, observational prospective study that will characterize the demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, effectiveness, tolerability and its management, and patient experience of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd) in a real-world setting. This study is planned to be conducted in several countries and aims to enroll approximately 750 patients eligible patients with HER2+ unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) who has received a prior anti HER2 based regimen in the metastatic setting or in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting and has developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing therapy. Approximately 250 eligible patients with HER2-low unresectable and/or mBC who have received a prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant chemotherapy will be enrolled into the study in North America only.

The planned duration of patient recruitment is approximately 18 months for HER2+ and approximately 12 months for HER2 low.
