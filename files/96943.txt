A Randomized Study of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO) With Daunorubicine and Cytarabine in Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Aged of 50-70 Years Old
The main objective of this study is to compare conventional chemotherapy: daunorubicin and the Aracytine and this chemotherapy in combination with the monoclonal antibody used Mylotarg in divided doses.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: conventional chemotherapy (AraC + Daunorubicin),|DRUG: Mylotarg associated with conventional chemotherapy (AraC + Daunorubicin),
Event Free Survival (EFS), Relapse or death measured from randomization
CR rate, CR after induction|Cumulative incidence of relapse, Relapse from CR|Overall Survival, Survival from randomization|Safety of the combination Mylotarg+chemotherapy, Duration of study|Possible predictors of response to Mylotarg: with respect to MDR (multi drug resistance) status, cytogenetics risk groups and mutational status (FLT3, MLL, CEBPa, NPM), Duration of study|Relationship between minimal residual disease measured on the expression of WT1 gene and relapse of AML., Duration of study
Patients with a morphologically proven diagnosis AML and both the two following criteria:

* Age \> 50 years and Â£ 70 years.
* Not previously treated for their disease.

Randomization will be centralized by phone :
