Phase 2 Trial of Prophylactic Rituximab Therapy for Prevention of CGVHD
To determine if rituximab administered after allogeneic transplantation decreases the incidence of chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGvHD)
Leukemia, Mast-Cell|Mantle-cell Lymphoma
PROCEDURE: Total lymphoid irradiation|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Anti-thymoglobulin, rabbit (ATG, rabbit ATG)|DRUG: Cyclosporine|DRUG: Mycophenylate mofetil|DRUG: Filgrastim|DRUG: Granisetron|DRUG: Solumedrol|DRUG: Acetaminophen|DRUG: Diphenhydramine|DRUG: Hydrocortisone
Chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease (cGvHD), The cumulative percentage of participants who develop chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGvHD). Chronic cGvHD was defined as at least one instance of a clinically-accepted marker for cGvHD (see Filipovich, et al. Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. 2005;11:945-955), 4 years
Incidence of Relapse, Subjects who Relapsed following after Allogeneic HSCT, 4 years|Mortality, Number of participants who died within 100 days and within 1 year, non-relapse and associated with relapse., Day 100 and 1 year|Overall Survival, 4 years
To test if prophylactic anti-B-cell therapy (weekly rituximab) given within 60 to 90 days after allogeneic transplantation will decrease allogeneic donor B-cell immunity and possibly the incidence of chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGvHD).
