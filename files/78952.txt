Evaluation of Clinical Decision Support System for Brain Metastasis Using Brain MR Images
BT-M01 is a software that has been pre-learned based on a brain metastasis detection model using brain MR images, and clinical decision support system for brain metastasis by automatically analyzing brain MR images by assisting the medical team.

The specific aims of this study are to evaluate efficacy of BT-M01 for brain metastasis compared to the sensitivity and false positive rates of radiologists group.
