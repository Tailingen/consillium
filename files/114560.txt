The CATCH Prostate Cancer Trial: Cabazitaxel And Tasquinimod in Men With Prostate Cancer
The standard of care for men with metastatic CRPC in 2010 following progression on docetaxel is cabazitaxel or abiraterone acetate/prednisone. Based on results from two other studies, cabazitaxel and prednisone has become a standard second line chemotherapy regimen and becomes the backbone upon which to improve upon. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to determine the recommended dose of tasquinimod in combination with cabazitaxel and prednisone based on safety and tolerability in men with chemorefractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

DRUG: tasquinimod|DRUG: tasquinimod 0.25 mg; 0.5 mg|DRUG: tasquinimod 0.25 mg; 0.5 mg; 1.0 mg
Number of participants who experience dose limiting toxicities at the highest titrated dose for each dose level, The primary objective is to determine the recommended dose of tasquinimod in combination with cabazitaxel and prednisone based on safety and tolerability in men with chemorefractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)., 6 weeks
Evaluation of progression free survival, Preliminary evidence of durable efficacy will be based on a modified PCWG2-defined radiologic progression-free survival including RECIST 1.1 criteria (PFS)., Every 9 weeks|Evaluation of overall response, Radiologic response criteria using RECIST 1.1 (overall response), Every 9 weeks|Preliminary evidence of response efficacy as measured by the rates of PSA decline (waterfall plot) and benchmarks of reaching a >30% decline within 3 months, a PSA decline >50% and >90%, and PSA normalization. Duration of PSA responses will be measured, Every 3 weeks|Favorable changes in circulating tumor cell number (5 or greater to less than 5) and proportion of men who achieve a reduction in CTC count, Every 3 weeks|Number and percent of participants that are alive, Overall survival, 2 years|Detailed characterization of all NCI CTC v4.0 toxicities over time (per cycle), Detailed characterization of all NCI CTC v4.0 toxicities over time (per cycle), Every 3 weeks|The concentration of tasquinimod and cabazitaxel in blood plasma, Pharmacokinetic analysis of tasquinimod and cabazitaxel (cycle 1-4 only), 12 weeks|Pain response, as measured by percentage of patients with a reduction of at least 2 points on the visual analog scale despite a stable pain regimen. Pain scores over time will be described in an exploratory fashion., Every 3 weeks|Changes in bone alkaline phosphatase and LDH over time, Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize laboratory variables, Every 3 weeks
