Apatinib in Recurrent or Refractory Intracranial Central Nervous System Malignant Tumors
The patient was given a daily dose of apatinib 500mg (or based on weight). Individualized chemotherapy regimens were given based on molecular expression and prior chemotherapy.

Response to treatment, Response were evaluatedevery 1-3 months with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0 (RECIST 1.0) usingdynamic contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of target lesions and maintaining ≥ 4 weeks; partial response (PR): ≥ 30% reduction in maximum diameterof tumor and keepingstable ≥ 4 weeks; progressive disease (PD):\>20% increase in bidimensionalmeasurements of the lesions, or emerging one or more newlesions; stable disease (SD): criteria for CR, PR and PDnot met.PFS was defined as the initial treatment to the disease progression or the date of death., up to 3 months
Median non-progress survival (PFS), Median non-progress survival (PFS), up to 12 months
The patient was given a daily dose of apatinib 500mg (or based on weight). Individualized chemotherapy regimens were given based on molecular expression and prior chemotherapy. Brain MRI+MRS was examined every 3 months; Blood routine, urine routine and liver and kidney function were examined once a week.
