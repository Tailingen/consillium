Autologous Stem Cell Transplant With Pomalidomide (CC-4047®) Maintenance Versus Continuous Clarithromycin/ Pomalidomide / Dexamethasone Salvage Therapy in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to see whether pomalidomide (also known as Pomalyst) reduces the number of myeloma cells in the bones, and to see what is the best way to use pomalidomide in patients with myeloma. To do this, the investigators want to compare two types of treatment using pomalidomde. This is a randomized trial which means that the decision as to which treatment the patient will receive will be made by a computer, much like flipping a coin.

All patients start by receiving 4 cycles of clarithromycin, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (ClaPD). After 4 cycles, half of the patients will undergo an autologous stem cell transplant followed by pomalidomide (Group 1). The other half of the patients will continue to receive ClaPD for 9 cycles to be followed by pomalidomide maintenance. (Group 2).

At the end of the study, the two groups will be compared to see if there is a difference in disease outcome.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Pomalidomide|PROCEDURE: stem cell|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Clarithromycin
overall response rate, Very Good PR or greater will be evaluated nine months postrandomization according to International Uniform Response Criteria., at 9 months after the start of treatment
safety analyses, The frequency of subjects experiencing a specific adverse event will be tabulated overall and by each treatment course. In the by-subject analysis, a subject having the same event more than once will be counted only once. Adverse events will be summarized by worst NCI CTCAE grade. Laboratory data will be graded according to NCI CTCAE severity grade, 3 years|overall survival, 1 year|progression free survival, 1 year|Determine the rates of ≥ Grade 3 toxicities, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 as specified in section 10.0., 1 year
