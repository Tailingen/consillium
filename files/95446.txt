LIver Transplantation for Non-Resectable Intrahepatic CholAngiocarcinoma (LIRICA)
LIRICA is a prospective non-randomized study aimed at exploring the outcome of liver transplantation in selected patients with unresectable iCCA after a downstaging/disease control protocol with standard of care chemotherapy, in terms of overall survival and quality of life. Additionally, the study aims to identify pre-transplant biological markers and clinical factors that can stratify patients with the best post-transplant prognosis. Finally, the study aims to investigate the role of preoperative PET-MR, especially in relation to lymph node locations, by correlating the results with histological examination after iliac lymphadenectomy.
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
PROCEDURE: Liver transplantation
Overall Survival, Survival from time of transplantation to time of death or last follow up, 3 and 5 years
OS comparison with chemotherapy alone, Comparison of 3-year survival between patients enrolled in the LIRICA study and survival of a population balanced for prognostic factors and disease characteristics from the database of the Veneto Oncological Institute (IOV), 3 years|Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Survival from time of transplantation to time of death or first evidence of recurrence fo disease, 3 and 5 years|Overall survival from the time of recurrence, Survival from time of recurrence to time of death or last follow up, 5 years|PFS comparison with chemotherapy alone, Comparison of 3-year Progression-Free Survival (PFS) between the per-protocol population of patients enrolled in the LIRICA study and the PFS of the population from the Veneto Oncological Institute (IOV) database, 3 years|Biological markers, Correlation of overall survival and recurrence with tissue and circulating biological markers (immunohistochemistry, proteomics, circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, new molecular markers), 5 years|Morbidity, Morbidity at 90 days (according to Clavien-Dindo and Comprehensive Complication Index, CCI), 90 days|Cancer-related mortality, Risk of mortality with sole relation to death by tumor progression and, 3 and 5 years|Drop out, Percentage of patients who do not complete the procedure (drop-out) stratified by cause, 5 years|Concordance of surgical and PET_RM staging (number, size, location), Asses if suspicious lymph nodes described at the preoperative PET-RM confirm to be pathological at the histological evaluation after lymphadenectomy of the hepatic hilum and exploratory laparotomy. Lymph nodes will we evaluated by number, size and location, Perioperative|Quality of life assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30, Quality of life assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLG Core Questionnaire) 30 items questionnaire (scale 1-4 or 1-7, 1 being the lowest and 4 or 7 the highest, accordingly), 5 years|Quality of life assessed using FACT-Hep questionnaire, Quality of life assessed using FACT-Hep questionnaire (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Hepatobiliary) questionnaire about quality of life in the last 7 days (scale 0-4, 0 being the lowest and 4 the highest), 5 years
