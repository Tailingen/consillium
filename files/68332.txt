Intraoperative Angiography Using ICG in Rectal Cancer Patients to Prevent Anastamotic Leak After Laparoscopic Anterior Resection of the Rectum
The study enrols patients with operative rectal cancer qualified for laparoscopic anterior resection. Patients are given first dose of indocyanine green iv intraoperatively (ICG) before choosing the appropriate site of the anastomosis, and the second dose after performing the anastomosis to confirm adequate blood supply to the anastomotis. The main outcome assessed is the frequency o anastomotic leak in comparison to the group of patients that do not undergo intraoperative ICG angiography.
