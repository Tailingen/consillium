177Lu-P17-087/177Lu-P17-088 in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
This is a pilot study to assess the safety and measure image-based absorbed dose of 177Lu-P17-087/177Lu-P17-088 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who will undergo radioliagnd therapy using 177Lu-P17-087/177Lu-P17-088. All patients underwent whole-body 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for selection and accepted intravenous injection with single dose 1.1 GBq (30 mCi) of 177Lu-P17-087/177Lu-P17-088 within one week, then monitored at 1.5 hours, 4 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 120 hours and 168 hours after 177Lu-P17-087/177Lu-P17-088 administration with serial whole body planar and SPECT/CT imaging.

Dosimetry of normal organs and tumors, The semiquantitative dosimetry will be performed based on SPECT/CT acquisitions after the administration of 177Lu-P17-087/177Lu-P17-088. The dose delivered to normal organs and tumors will be recorded., Determined using imaging at 1.5 hours, 4 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 120 hours and 168 hours after the first administration of 177Lu-P17-087/088|Hematologic adverse events collection, Hematologic status were performed before and every 2 weeks after administration of radiopharmaceutical. Adverse events were categorized using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0., through study completion, an average of 2 weeks|Hepatic and renal toxic events collection, Liver function, and renal function were performed before and 6 weeks after administration of radiopharmaceutical. Adverse events were categorized using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0., through study completion, an average of 2 weeks
PSA Response, The serum PSA response was documented semimonthly until 6 weeks after the administration of 177Lu-P17-087/177Lu-P17-088. PSA response was classified as the following: partial response (PR) if PSA decrease ≥50%, progressive disease (PD) if PSA increase ≥ 25% and stable disease (SD) if PSA increase \<25% or PSA decrease \<50%., through study completion, an average of 3 weeks
Prostate cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in men worldwide. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), is a surface molecule specifically expressed by prostate tumors which was shown to be a valid target for radiotherapy. 177Lu-PSMA-617, a urea-based compound, provide an effective target for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, a major problem in the therapeutic use of 177Lu-PSMA-617 has been its short half-life and fast rate of clearance. The investigators designed and synthesized a new radiopharmaceutical based on PSMA-11, P16-093. 68Ga-P16-093 showed higher tumor uptake and clear blood clearance than 68Ga-PSMA-617. Then, the investigators shynthesis a new therapeutic radiopharmaceutical based on P16-093, P17-087; and the investigators added a selected albumin binder into P17-088 to synthesis another new radiopharmaceutical, P17-088. This study was designed to investigate the safety, dosimetry and preliminary effects of 177Lu-P17-087/177Lu-P17-088 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
