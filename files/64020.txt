Morbidity and Mortality After Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancer Surgery
Esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer is still one of the main health care issue and esophagectomy with lymph node dissection is the only chance to be cure.

However, esophagectomy for esophageal cancer is a complex procedure which carries high risk of morbidity rate of 24% and a mortality rate of 2% to 5.6%, respectively There is a need to study the differences of 90-day postoperative morbidity and mortality in different clinics and centers of the Russian Federation.

the type of complications and the incidence of it, the types of complication is classified into as follows: gastrointestinal (anastomotic leak, conduit necrosis/failure, pancreatitis, GI Bleeding, delayed conduit emptying); pulmonary (pneumonia, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, respiratory failure, ARDS, acute aspiration, tracheobronchial Injury); cardiac; thromboembolic; urologic; infection (wound infection; intrathoracic/intra-abdominal abscess; generalized sepsis; other infections); neurologic (recurrent nerve injury, acute delirium) and other (thoracic wound dehiscence, diaphragmatic hernia, chyle leak, reoperation other than for anastomotic leak or conduit necrosis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) complications Each complication will be graded according to Clavien-Dindo classification. Re-admission or visiting emergency room will be checked and recorded., within 90 days after operation
Esophageal and esophago-gastric junction cancer is the seventh most common malignancy and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.

Surgery remains the primary treatment for esophageal cancer and is one of the most technically challenging interventions in oncological surgery. In addition, esophagectomy is associated with high risks of postoperative complications, with rates varying from clinic to clinic. Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer is a complex procedure which carries high risk of morbidity rate of 24% and a mortality rate of 2% to 5.6%, respectively.

The problem with the available studies of the course of the postoperative period is the significant heterogeneity of research methods, which does not allow us to obtain a true picture of the results of surgical treatment of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction cancer in the Russian Federation.

To improve the quality of further studies and recommendations on standardization of surgical treatment of esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancer and its morbidity, there is a need to study the differences of 90-day postoperative morbidity and mortality in different clinics and centers of the Russian Federation.
