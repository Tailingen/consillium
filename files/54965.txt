Safety and Immunogenicity of Extended 2-dose Regimens of 9-valent Human Papillomavirus (9vHPV) Vaccine (V503-069)
This is a 96-month safety and immunogenicity study conducted in boys and girls 9 to 14 years of age and in young women 16 to 26 years of age. From this study, the goal is to establish that the investigational extended 2-dose regimens (0, 12 months; 0, 24 months; 0, 36 months; and 0, 60 months) studied in boys and girls 9 to 14 years of age are generally safe and immunogenic, with an antibody response that is not inferior to that observed in young women 16 to 26 years of age who receive the standard 3-dose regimen of 9-valent human papillomavirus (9vHPV) vaccine at 0, 2, and 6 months (i.e., the population and dose regimen used to establish 9vHPV vaccine efficacy).

Geometric Mean Titers of Anti-Human Papilloma Virus Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 as Measured by Competitive Luminex Immunoassay, Serum antibody titers for human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 will be determined using competitive luminex immunoassay (cLIA). The geometric mean titer (GMT) for each HPV type will be reported in milli Merck units/mL (mMU/mL)., 4 weeks post last vaccination (Up to ~Month 61)|Percentage of Participants With at Least 1 Solicited Injection-site Adverse Event, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The percentage of participants with injection-site AEs (erythema/redness, pain and swelling) will be assessed., Up to 5 days post vaccination|Percentage of Participants With at Least 1 Systemic Adverse Event, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. The percentage of participants with a systemic AE will be assessed., Up to 15 days post vaccination|Percentage of Participants With at Least 1 Serious Vaccine-Related Adverse Event, A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as one that results in death, is life threatening, or requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other important medical event that may require medical intervention. An SAE that is judged by the investigator to be related to the study vaccine is defined as a vaccine-related SAE., Entire study period (Up to ~Month 96)
Percentage of Participants (Cohorts 1 to 5) Who Are Seropositive for HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, Serum antibody titers for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 will be determined using cLIA. The percentage of participants who are seropositive (analysis population Cohorts 1 through 5 only) for each HPV type will be assessed., 4 weeks post last vaccination|Geometric Mean Titers (Cohorts 1 to 5) of Anti HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, Serum antibody titers for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 will be determined using cLIA. The GMT for each HPV type (analysis population Cohorts 1 through 5 only) will be reported in mMU/mL., 12 months post last vaccination|Percentage of Participants (Cohorts 1 to 5) Who Are Seropositive for HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, Serum antibody titers for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 will be determined using cLIA. The percentage of participants who are seropositive (analysis population Cohorts 1 through 5 only) for each HPV type will be assessed., 12 months post last vaccination|Geometric Mean Titers ( Cohorts 1 to 5) of Anti HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, Serum antibody titers for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 will be determined using cLIA. The GMT for each HPV type (analysis population Cohorts 1 through 5 only) will be reported in mMU/mL., 24 months post last vaccination|Percentage of Participants (Cohorts 1 to 5) Who Are Seropositive for HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, Serum antibody titers for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 will be determined using cLIA.
