a Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of D-1553 Combined With IN10018 in KRAS G12C Mutant Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1b/II, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activities of D-1553 in combination with IN10018 in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumor with KRAS G12C mutation.

This study includes 2 phases: Phase Ib-Dose Escalation and Phase II-Dose Expansion. Phase Ib-Dose Escalation part will enroll at least 6 subjects to identify the safety and RP2D of D1553 in combination with IN10018 in KRAS G12C mutant solid tumors. Phase II-Dose Expansion part contains 3 cohorts with cohort A to enroll advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) with KRAS G12C mutation, cohort B to enroll advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with KRAS G12C mutation, and cohort C to enroll other advanced solid tumors with KRAS G12C mutation. Phase II study is to evaluate the safety and antitumor activities of D-1553 in combination with IN10018 in KRAS G12C mutant solid tumors. The sample size in each cohort is estimated per Simon's 2-stage design. In Cohort A, when Simon's 2-stage study achieved statistical hypothesis, an open-label, randomized study will be conducted for factorial analysis to evaluate the contribution of IN10018 in the combination regimen.
