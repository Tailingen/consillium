Tumor-directed Radiation Therapy for Patients With the Highest Risk Category of Localized Prostate Cancer
HYPO-RT-PC boost is is an open-label, multicentre, phase II trial evaluating safety and efficacy of real-time image-guided tumor-directed ultra-hypofractionated radiation boost and lymph node irradiation for patients with node-negative high risk localized prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer

A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems, inclusion date - 5 years|Health-related quality of life assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire PR-25 (EORTC QLQ-PR25), It includes subscales assessing urinary symptoms, bowel symptom), treatment-related symptom) and sexual functioning with score from 0 to 4 per item. A high scale score represents a higher response level., inclusion date - 5 years
HYPO-RT-PC boost is is an open-label, multicentre, phase II trial evaluating safety and efficacy of real-time image-guided tumor-directed ultra-hypofractionated radiation boost and lymph node irradiation for patients with node-negative high risk localized prostate cancer. 76 participants will be enrolled in the study.

Specific aims of the study are:

* To study the feasibility of ultra-hypofractionation target lesion boost for node-negative very high-risk prostate cancer together with lymph node irradiation (primary outcome).
* To study the effectiveness of ultra-hypofractionated target lesion boost for high-risk prostate cancer.
* To study the feasibility of defining focal boost during concomitant androgen deprivation therapy with advanced functional imaging methods.
