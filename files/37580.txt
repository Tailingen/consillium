Secondary Victim Awareness of Anesthesiologists
Every professional working in the medical field may encounter medical errors and patient safety issues during their careers. Wu, et al. He coined the term 'second victim', which was used for the first time in 2000. In a patient safety incident, the patient is the first to be affected, while the second to be affected are the healthcare professionals (physicians, assistants, nurses, and medical staff) who are the potential causes of the incident and who are adversely affected by the consequences of this incident. That is, secondary victims are characterized as healthcare professionals who are involved in unexpected adverse patient events and experience occupational or psychological difficulties. Almost half of healthcare professionals have been reported to experience the second victim phenomenon during their professional careers. Medical errors or adverse events can deeply affect healthcare professionals and have long-term effects, leading to permanent consequences. In the medical field, identifying the origins of errors plays a vital role in preventing future errors. Second victims can encourage constructive change by not only criticizing the healthcare system but also contributing to the improvement of healthcare institutions. Burlison and his team developed and validated a tool they called the "Second Victim Experience and Support Tool" (SVEST) to understand the coping process of second victims and identify necessary support resources. Koca and colleagues conducted a validation study of the translation and psychometric evaluation of the SVEST (T-SVEST) in Turkey. Our study aims to evaluate the secondary victim experience of anesthesiologists and the quality of support resources.
