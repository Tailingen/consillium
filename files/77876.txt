A Pilot Study of Perihepatic Phlebotomy During Hepatic Resections
The purpose of this study is to draw blood from vessels near the liver in patients undergoing liver surgery. This will be performed in both patients with cancer in order to learn more about circulating tumor cells, proteins and DNA mutations in the blood.

The blood in patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases will be compared to blood taken from patients that do not have cancer that do not have cancer.

Inclusion of patients with benign pathology will allow for the establishment of "normal" values which currently do not exist. We will then study whether tumor mutations can be used to predict recurrence and survival patterns.

ctDNA differences, to collect preliminary data on perihepatic and peripheral ctDNA differences between prehepatic and posthepatic sites in patients with and without primary colorectal cancers in place., once at the time of surgery
collect preliminary data, to correlate perihepatic and peripheral ctDNA mutation with recurrence and survival patterns. This will be performed by log-ranks tests of recurrence free survival and overall survival for each gene and possibly for the most common combinations of mutations, 1 year
