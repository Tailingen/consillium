A Study of the PD-L1xCD27 Bispecific Antibody CDX-527 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion study in patients with selected solid tumors.

DRUG: CDX-527
Safety and Tolerability of CDX-527 as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, The rates of drug-related adverse events will be summarized and maximum tolerated dose will be determined., From first dose through 28 days after last dose
Objective Response Rate, The percentage of patients who achieve a confirmed immune complete response (iCR) or immune partial response (iPR), Every 8 weeks starting with first dose until disease progression, assessed up to approximately 1-2 years.|Clinical Benefit Rate, The percentage of patients who achieve best response of confirmed iCR or iPR, or immune stable disease (iSD) for at least four months, Every 8 weeks, starting with first dose until disease progression, assessed up to approximately 1-2 years.|Duration of Response, The interval from which measurement criteria are first met for iCR or iPR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented, First occurrence of a documented objective response to disease progression or death (up to approximately 1-2 years)|Progression-free Survival, The time from start of study drug to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, From the first dose to the first occurrence of disease progression or death due to any cause (up to approximately 1-2 years)|Overall Survival, The time from start of study drug to death, The time from start of study drug to death from any cause (up to approximately 1-2 years)|Immunogenicity Evaluation, Serum samples will be obtained for assessment of human anti-CDX-527 antibodies, Prior to the first dose of study treatment, then intermittently before dosing, and up to 60 days after the last dose|Pharmacokinetic Evaluation, CDX-527 serum concentrations will be measured at specified visits., Before and after dosing, with additional timepoints after the first two doses, then intermittently before dosing and up to 60 days after the last dose
This study will determine the safety, tolerability and activity of CDX-527.

Eligible patients that enroll to the dose-escalation portion of the study will be assigned to one of several dose levels of CDX-527. The dose-escalation part of the study will determine the safety profile of CDX-527 and determine which dose(s) of CDX-527 will be studied in the expansion part of the study.

The expansion part of the study will enroll eligible patients with certain solid tumors to be treated at dose(s) identified during dose-escalation

Up to 40 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is a response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.
