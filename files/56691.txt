Standard of Care Therapy With Involved Field Radiation Therapy for Selective Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
This study aims to investigate the effect of involved-field radiotherapy for recurrent ovarian cancer after primary standard treatment. We will investigate whether the addition of involved-field RT improves 2-year PFS in those patients than that of historical data (only with other standard salvage treatments as systemic chemotherapy ± maximum tumor resection).
Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
RADIATION: Involved-field radiotherapy
2-year progression-free survival (PFS), 2 years after radiotherapy
Local control of recurred lesions, 2 years after radiotherapy|Any other new recurrence events, 2 years after radiotherapy|Radiotherapy-related complications, 2 years after radiotherapy|Chemotherapy-free interval (The interval to delay the need for a new chemotherapy regimen for disease progression), It means the interval between the last date performing the previous chemotherapy (before the start of involved-field radiotherapy) and the first date performing the new regimen of chemotherapy (for the disease failures after the involve-field radiotherapy). We want to measure this interval because we want to check the capability of involved-field radiotherapy to delay the need for the new regimen of chemotherapy for the progressive diseases., 2 years after radiotherapy
