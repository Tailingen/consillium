Phase II Study of BKM120 for Subjects With Recurrent Glioblastoma
BKM120 is a newly discovered drug that has been used in other research studies. Information from those other research studies suggests that BKM120 may help to slow or stop the growth of malignant gliomas. The purpose of this study is to see how well BKM120 works in patients with malignant gliomas. Patients on this study will be treated in two groups: patients who are going to receive surgery and those who will not receive surgery. This study is trying to determine how effective BKM120 is in stopping cancer cells from growing. For patients receiving surgery the research will also try to determine if an effective level of BKM120 can penetrate the brain before surgery.

DRUG: BKM120|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Change in pAKT (S473) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Score From Baseline to Surgery [Cohort 1], pAKT response was determined by pathologist-performed semi-quantitative IHC scoring for pAKT using previously established methods for glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Sample staining scored for intensity on a 0-2+ scale (0 none, 1+ weak positive, 2+ strong positive). Change in pAKT IHC score was the difference in score from baseline to surgery. Participants were classified into 3 groups: a reduction of staining score of one degree or more (considered a response), an increase in score and no change in score., Samples were collected at baseline and at surgery (resected surgical tumor specimen) which occurred after up to 12 days of BKM120 treatment.|6-Month Progression-Free Survival (PFS6) [Cohort 2], PFS6 is the proportion of participants remaining alive and progression-free at 6-months from cycle 1 day 1 of BKM120 treatment.

STATISTICAL DESIGN:

Cohort 1

The primary endpoint for Cohort 1 is modulation of PI3 kinase pathway based on change in immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring for pAKT. Modulation in scoring as measured by reduction of staining intensity score of one degree or more was reported as a positive response to drug. This portion of the trial would be considered a success if 9 or more participants of 15 participants showed a response. There was a 94% chance of this occurring if the true response rate was 75% and only a 10% chance of this occurring if the true response rate was 40%.

Cohort 2

The primary endpoint for Cohort 2 is the proportion of participants progression free at 6 months (PFS6). Historical comparison data suggest that ineffective therapies in recurrent GBM have a PFS6 rate of approximately 9-16% (Wong 1999; Lamborn 2008). This trial was sized to differentiate between a 15% versus a 32% PFS6. With a total sample size of 50 participants, this design yields at least 90% power with a one sided alpha \< 0.1 to detect a true PFS6 rate of at least 32%. If the number of successes was ≥ 12, the therapy would be considered worthy of further study.
