Measurements of Sexual Steroids' Concentrations in Prostatic Tissue
In the investigators's previous work, measurements of intra-prostatic concentrations of sex steroids were determined on samples taken from the operating room using a punch.

In order to study the in-vivo intra-prostatic concentrations of sex steroid, it is necessary to validate a measurement technique performed on samples obtained by a biopsy needle used in standard care for prostate biopsy punctures allowing the diagnosis and follow-up of prostate cancer.

The aim of this project is to validate this measurement technique carried out on samples obtained by the biopsy needle and to define the optimal number of carrots obtained by biopsy offering dosage results comparable to the punch.
