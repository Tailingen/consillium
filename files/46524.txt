Resection Versus Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Solitary Huge Tumor
This clinical trial aims to compare hepatectomy with Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) for Hepatic Cellular Cancer With Solitary Huge Tumor (≥5cm). All patients will be divided into two group.One group will receive hepatic resection, while an another equivalent group patients will be treated with Transarterial Chemoembolization.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular|Survival Rate
PROCEDURE: hepatic resection|PROCEDURE: TACE
3-year overall survival, Overall survival rate will be evaluated at 3 years after treatment, 3 years
1-year overall survival, Overall survival rate will be evaluated at 1 year after treatment, 1 years|2-year overall survival, Overall survival rate will be evaluated at 2 years after treatment, 2 years|Recurrence rates, any recurrence detected by CT, MRI and laboratory examination, 3 years
mortality, death within 30 days after surgery, 30 days
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver.For Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B patients，especially those with Solitary Huge Tumor (≥5cm) ，the better therapy between hepatic resection and transarterial chemoembolization remains controversial despite extensive studies。 From now on, we prospectively collected patients with solitary huge HCC who received hepatectomy or TACE. Of the 200 patients，100 patients were surgically treated and the others underwent TACE。After the treatment, patients received routine follow-up with physical examination, serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) level and ultrasonography at 3-month intervals for the first year and then every 6 months.The end of follow-up was determined as either the time of last follow-up (July 2019) or death. The overall survival，including 1, 2 and 3-year overall survival rates，will be analyse. All data are collected prospectively.
