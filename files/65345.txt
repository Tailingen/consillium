Placebo-controlled Trial of F-627 in Women With Breast Cancer Receiving Myelotoxic Chemotherapy
This is a randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of F-627 in women with stage II-IV breast cancer receiving chemotherapy treatment.
Breast Cancer|Neutropenia
DRUG: F-627|DRUG: Placebo
The Duration in Days of Grade 4 (Severe) Neutropenia Observed in Chemotherapy Cycle 1 in Comparison to Placebo, Subjects will be randomized to F-627 or Placebo at 2:1 ratio. About 24 hours after chemotherapy, subjects will either receive 20mg fixed dose F-627 or Placebo. The subject's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) will be monitored each day post chemotherapy administration until the ANC level exceeds 2.0x10\^9/L, then the value will be monitored every three days until the next chemotherapy cycle is entered. The duration of grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \<0.5x10\^9/L) in this cycle is the primary efficacy endpoint., The first of 4, 21 Day Chemotherapy Cycles, an average of 3 weeks
The Duration in Days of Grade 4 (Severe) Neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 × 10^9/L) for Chemotherapy Cycles 2, 3, and 4, and Over All Cycles., The duration of severe neutropenia will be measured for each patient during chemotherapy cycle 2-4 and over all cycles. Each chemotherapy is expected to last 21 days., Over all 4 cycles, about 12 weeks|The Duration in Days of Grade 2 (Mild), Grade 3 (Moderate) and 4 (Severe) Neutropenia Over All Cycles., The duration in days of mild, moderate and severe neutropenia will be recorded for 4 chemotherapy cycles. Grade 2 neutropenia is when a patient's ANC\<1.5x10\^9/L, Grade 3 neutropenia is when a patient's ANC\<1.0x10\^9/L, and Grade 4 neutropenia is when a patient's ANC \<0.5x10\^9/L., 4 chemotherapy cycles, about 12 weeks|Number of Participants With Febrile Neutropenia (FN) for Each Chemotherapy Cycle and Over All Cycles, Febrile neutropenia is defined as a single oral temperature of ≥38.3°C (101°F) or a temperature of \>38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained for \>1 hour and ANC \< 0.5 x 10\^9/L, 4 chemotherapy cycles, about 12 weeks|Number of Participants With Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 Neutropenia for All Chemotherapy Cycles., The number of subjects with grade 2, 3 and 4 neutropenia will be recorded for all 4 chemotherapy cycles., 4 chemotherapy cycles, about 12 weeks|The Time in Days to ANC Recovery Post Nadir for Each Chemotherapy Cycle and Over All Cycles; Recovery Defined as an ANC ≥ 2.0 × 10^9/L After the Expected ANC Nadir., The time to ANC recovery post nadir for each patient, for each of their chemotherapy cycles will be recorded. Recovery for this protocol is defined as achieving an ANC ≥ 2.0 × 10\^9/L after the expected ANC nadir (expected nadir is typically 4-6 days post chemotherapy administration)., 4 chemotherapy cycles, about 12 weeks|The Depth of the ANC Nadir for Each Chemotherapy Cycle and Over All Cycles., The depth of ANC nadir for each cycle is the minimal ANC value (× 10\^9/L ) for a patient in each chemotherapy cycle, 4 chemotherapy cycles, about 12 weeks|Number of Participants With Infections for Each Chemotherapy Cycle and Over All Cycles., The number of subjects with infections for each arm of the study will be recorded for each and all 4 chemotherapy cycles., 4 chemotherapy cycles, about 12 weeks|Number of Participants With Use of Antibiotics and Pain Medications, Antibiotics and pain medications use will be recorded for each chemotherapy cycle and overall cycles, 4 chemotherapy cycles, about 12 weeks
This is a randomized, multi-center, single dose, double-blind, placebo controlled phase III study of the efficacy and safety of once-per-cycle of F-627 in women with stage II-IV breast cancer who are receiving myelotoxic TA chemotherapy treatment (Taxotere (docetaxel) + Adriamycin(doxorubicin)). F-627 is designed to treat neutropenia, an abnormally low number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood. Neutropenia is often seen in cancer patients receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single fixed dose of F-627 in breast cancer patients experiencing myelotoxic chemotherapy in comparison to placebo. F-627 or placebo is to be administered subcutaneously 24 hours after chemotherapy in each 21-day cycle of chemotherapy treatment (up to 4 cycles). Patients randomized to placebo arm will receive F-627 except in cycle 1. The primary endpoint will be the duration of grade 4 (severe) neutropenia - the number of days in which the patient has had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC \< 0.5 x 10\^9/L) observed in chemotherapy cycle 1.
