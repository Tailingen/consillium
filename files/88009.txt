German MPN-Registry for BCR-ABL 1-Negative Myeloid Neoplasms (Study Group Ulm)
To register a large number of patients with the diagnosis of a BCR-ABL 1- negative myeloid neoplasm (according to WHO 2008 / 2016 classification) in participating centers

To store samples from all patients (e.g. bone marrow aspirate, peripheral blood, plasma, and buccal swap, skin biopsy samples in exceptional cases)

To perform morphologic and genetic analyses

To assess clinical characteristics and outcome data using a defined catalogue containing clinically relevant variables

To assess biological disease features and correlate with clinical outcome data (prognostic and predictive markers)

To assess quality of life
