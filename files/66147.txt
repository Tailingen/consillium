Exercise Versus Cognitive Behavioural Therapy on Cancer-related Fatigue
The investigators compare the effects of two interventions, an endurance exercise program and a cognitive behavioural therapy, on the fatigue, quality of life, mood and physical performance of patients with a cancer-related fatigue syndrome. The intervention will be carried out for 4 weeks. Tests will be carried out at the beginning and at the end of the study.
