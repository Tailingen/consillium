A Study of Pharmacodynamic and Genetic Parameters of Abira-DES Study Participants (NCT02217566) - Participants With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated With Abiraterone Acetate Following Unresponsive Treatment With Diethylstilbestrol
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of HSD3B1 (1245C) germline variant and potential pharmacodynamic markers on abiraterone activity in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after unresponsive use of diethylstilbestrol.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Serum and plasma samples analysis
Percentage of Participants with and Without HSD3B1 (1245C) Germline Variant', Percentage of participants with and without HSD3B1 (1245C) germline variant will be determined to evaluate the influence of HSD3B1 (1245C) germline variant on the response to abiraterone as a predictive fact., Up to 12 months
Levels of HSD3B1 (1245C) Germ Variant, Levels of HSD3B1 (1245C) germline variant will be determined to evaluate the response to abiraterone acetate as a predictive factor., Up to 12 months|Levels of Metabolite Delta-(4)-Abiraterone (D4A) During the Abiraterone Acetate During Treatment Phase, Levels of metabolite D4A during the abiraterone acetate during treatment phase will be evaluated., 12 Weeks|Testosterone Levels in Participants Treated with Abiraterone Acetate, Testosterone levels of participants treated with abiraterone acetate will be evaluated by the molecular analyses., Up to 12 months|SDHEA Levels in Participants Treated with Abiraterone Acetate, SDHEA levels of participants treated with abiraterone acetate will be evaluated by the molecular analyses., Up to 12 months|Correlation Between HSD3B1 (1245C) Variant and Testosterone Levels, Correlation between HSD3B1 (1245C) variant and testosterone levels will be reported. The genotyping of the HSD3B1 (1245 A\> C) germline variant will be performed by Sanger sequencing., Up to 12 months|Correlation Between HSD3B1 (1245C) Variant and SDHEA Levels, Correlation between HSD3B1 (1245C) variant and SDHEA levels will be reported. The genotyping of the HSD3B1 (1245 A\> C) germline variant will be performed by Sanger sequencing., Up to 12 months|Correlation Between HSD3B1 (1245C) Variant and Clinical Response, Correlation between HSD3B1 (1245C) variant and clinical response will be performed by univariate and multivariate analyses., Up to 12 months|Correlation Between D4A Levels with Testosterone Dosage, Testosterone ultrasensitive dosages will be performed on participant serum samples. Testosterone dosage will be performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry., Up to 12 months|Correlation Between D4A Levels with SDHEA Dosage, SDHEA ultrasensitive dosages will be performed on participant serum samples. Dosage will be performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry., Up to 12 months|Correlation Between D4A Levels with Clinical Response, Correlation between D4A levels with clinical response will be performed by univariate and multivariate analyses., Up to 12 months
