Safety and Efficacy of Escalating Doses of LEO 43204 Applied Once Daily for Two Consecutive Days on Approximately 250 cm2 on Trunk and Extremities in Subjects With Actinic Keratosis
Part 1: To identify Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) levels of LEO 43204 after once daily treatment for two consecutive days

Part 2: To evaluate the efficacy of LEO 43204 in two doses after once daily treatment for two consecutive days compared to vehicle
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: LEO 43204|DRUG: Placebo
Part 1: Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) Based on Local Skin Responses (LSRs), The number participants experiencing a DLT was used to identify the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) levels of LEO 43204 after once daily treatment for 2 consecutive days.The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which less than 4 out of 12 participants experienced a DLT.

A DLT was defined as one or more of the following three LSRs:

* Crusting Grade 4
* Erosion/Ulceration Grade 4
* Vesiculation/Pustulation Grade 4

or two or more of the following five LSRs:

* Crusting Grade 3
* Swelling Grade 4
* Erosion/Ulceration Grade 3
* Vesiculation/Pustulation Grade 3

or other clinically relevant signs or symptoms observed, which the Investigator judged to be counted as a DLT.

The LSRs consists of the following 6 categories: Erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, erosion/ulceration. Each individual LSR category was given a numeric grade of severity from 0-4. Grade 0 being no presence and Grade 4 being the highest grade of severity., From Day 1 up to and including Day 8|Part 2: Percent Reduction From Baseline in Actinic Keratosis (AK) Count, Percent reduction from baseline in clinically visible actinic keratosis lesions (AKs) identified in the treatment area., From baseline to Week 8
Part 2: Participants With Complete Clearance of AKs (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF]), Complete clearance was defined as a 100% reduction from baseline in AK count., From baseline to Week 8|Part 2: Participants With Partial Clearance of AKs (LOCF), Partial clearance was defined as at least 75% reduction from baseline in AK count., From baseline to Week 8
Part 1: To identify Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) levels of LEO 43204 after once daily treatment for two consecutive days

Part 2: To evaluate the efficacy of LEO 43204 in two doses after once daily treatment for two consecutive days compared to vehicle
