Yoga in Improving Quality of Life in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Treatment
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of yoga (including breathing exercises) on the quality of life in patients, diagnosed and undergoing standard treatments for non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: Yoga|BEHAVIORAL: Support Group Therapy|OTHER: FACT-L|OTHER: Pulmonary function test
Change of the score of the Trial Outcome Index (TOI), To measure health related quality of life (HRQOL), the TOI will be used,sum of the scores on the Lung Cancer Subscales (LCS) and the physical well-being and functional well-being subscales of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) scale. Frequencies, means and standard deviations of the patient characteristics will be compared between groups at baseline to assess the success of the randomization, and whether any baseline values need to be controlled for in analysis. Differences between groups in the change in outcome scores on the FACT-L, LSC, and TOI will be assessed using analysis of covariance, where covariates will include the stratification variable as well as any variables found to differ between groups at baseline., Baseline to up to 12 weeks|Measures of pulmonary function, Objective pulmonary function will be measured on a 3 measure spirometer ((FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)). Since there are 3 measures of pulmonary function, the two groups will be compared using mixed model methods., Baseline to up to 12 weeks
This clinical trial studies yoga in improving quality of life in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing treatment. Yoga may help improve quality of life and pulmonary functional capacity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
