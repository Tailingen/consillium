After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will be evaluated to determine eligibility for study entry. Patients will receive an injection of \[68Ga\]Ga-NOTA-SNA002 (1.0-5.0mCi) in Day1 and will undergo PET/CT scanning to determine uptake of \[68Ga\]Ga-NOTA-SNA002 in tumor lesions and reference tissues.
