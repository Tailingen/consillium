Comparison of Diagnostic Sensitivity Between ctDNA Methylation and CEA in Colorectal Cancer
This is a prospective diagnostic study. This study is to compare the performance between circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in detecting colorectal tumor. Firstly, based on the identification of differential ctDNA methylation biomarkers, the diagnostic model is established and the diagnostic performance was compared with that of CEA. Secondly, the stage stratification model was established preliminarily based on differential ctDNA methylation biomarkers and the performance was also compared with that of CEA.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, the second deadliest cancer. It is reported that patients prefer non-invasive methods rather than invasive methods for the detection of CRC. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is commonly employed in clinical practice for early detection of CRC, but it is limited for its low sensitivity, which is around 30%-40%. DNA methylation is a commonly used biomarker for non-invasive tumor detection in plasma. We aim to develop and validate a ctDNA methylation-based blood test for CRC diagnosis based on genome-wide methylation detection. There are two steps in the study. Firstly, this prospective study aims to identify colorectal tumor differential circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation biomarkers, establish the diagnostic model. Secondly, we performed a preliminary study to stratify early-stage and advanced-stage disease based on the differential biomarkers.
