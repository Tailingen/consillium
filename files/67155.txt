Ruxolitinib Phosphate and Decitabine in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory or Post Myeloproliferative Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ruxolitinib phosphate when given together with decitabine and to see how well they work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back or is not responding to treatment, or has developed from a type of bone marrow diseases called myeloproliferative neoplasms. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving ruxolitinib phosphate together with decitabine may be an effective treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.

Maximum Tolerated Dose of Ruxolitinib Phosphate (Phase I), Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose studied for which the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is less than or equal to 17% (1 out of 6)., Up to 6 weeks|Number of Participants With a Response (Complete Response [CR] + CR With Incomplete Blood Count Recovery) (Phase 2), Complete Response (CR) is defined as - The participant must be free of all symptoms related to leukemia and have an absolute neutrophil count \>/= 1 z 10\^9/L, no need for red blood cell transfusion, platelet count\>/+ 100 x 10\^9/L, and normal marrow differential (\</= 5 % blasts) in a normo- or hypercellular marrow.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the tolerability of the combination of decitabine and ruxolitinib phosphate (ruxolitinib \[DI\]) in patients with leukemia. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of ruxolitinib in increasing and prolonging response induced by decitabine alone in patients with post myeloproliferative neoplasm acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (post MPN-AML) alternatively referred to as (myeloproliferative neoplasm - blast phase; MPN-BP). (Compared to historical response rate with decitabine alone) (Phase II)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare whether there is a difference in response rate patients with post-MPN AML with janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations and patients without JAK2 mutations.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib phosphate followed by a phase II study.

Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4-6 weeks for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
