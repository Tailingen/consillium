Cancer, Nutrition and Taste
Cancer promotes weight loss; it can also lead to particular complications for patients during treatment. A team led by Dr Michael Sawyer, showed the deleterious impact of undernutrition on the benefits of chemotherapy.

Cancer patients are at high risk of undernutrition, which is generally more pronounced for solid tumours (upper digestive tract, ENT, bronchial tubes...). This undernutrition leads to major weight loss and wasting, and may represent the first sign of a call for a diagnosis of cancer. Cancer-related undernutrition is multi-factorial in origin and has multiple consequences; it has its own prognostic value.

Chemotherapy treatments can induce various adverse effects in patients, including sensory disturbances at the beginning of treatment in addition to disturbances that may already be present before any treatment. Altered taste and odour, observed in 86% of patients, can induce a change in food preferences, promote the development of aversions, and therefore, lead to a significant reduction in the pleasure of eating. Loss of appetite, decreased food intake and the development of aversions to certain foods are situations experienced by a large proportion of patients undergoing chemotherapy.

The assessment of taste disorders in patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment is established through the use of questionnaires, interviews and taste tests.

Changes in the perception and identification of salty, sweet, bitter and sour flavours are common in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

The objective of CANUT is to study the effect of pathology and chemotherapy on gustatory and olfactory mechanisms and in particular on interindividual differences in the perception and appreciation of food.

In this study the investigators propose to adapt foods to best respond to sensory disorders related to the disease and/or treatment.
