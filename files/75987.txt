ThisCART19A Bridging to alloHSCT for R/R B-ALL
This is a phase 1, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ThisCART19A (Allogeneic Anti CD19 CAR-T) bridging to HSCT in patients with refractory or relapsed B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL).

This is a phase 1, single-center, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ThisCART19A bridging to HSCT in patients with CD19 positive r/r B-ALL and identify a treatment regimen most likely to result in clinical efficacy while maintaining a favorable safety profile. Before initiating ThisCART19A infusion, subjects will be administered lymphodepletion chemotherapy composed of fludarabine„ÄÅcyclophosphamide and VP-16. At Day 0 of the Treatment Period, subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of ThisCART19A. All subjects are monitored during the treatment period through Day 28. All subjects who receive a dose of ThisCART19A will be followed up to 2 years.
