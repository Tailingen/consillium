Precision Chemotherapy Based on Organoid Drug Sensitivity for Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate whether chemotherapy guided by patient-derived tumor organoid drug test can improve the outcomes of stage IV colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFOX , FOLFIRI or FOLFOXIRI regimens|DRUG: FOLFOX or CapeOX regimens
1. Progression-free survival, the time from randomization to relapse or death, whichever occurred first, up to 1 years
Overall survival, the time from randomization to death from any cause, up to 5 years
Fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for stage IV colorectal cancer patients. However, the effects of chemotherapy remains limited. Patient-derived tumor organoids are increasingly used as tools for drug test and predicting drug response in the clinic, and have been showed to faithfully predict clinical outcomes of patients with CRC. A prospective clinical trial is needed to validate whether the in vitro sensitivity to chemotherapy regimens in organoids drug test is associated with a longer PFS in stage IV colorectal cancer.
