Safety Study of SIC 8000 in Subjects Undergoing Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) of Colonic Lesions Equal to or Larger Than 2 cm
SIC 8000 is indicated for use in gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures for submucosal lift of polyps, adenomas, early-stage cancers or other gastrointestinal mucosal lesions, prior to excision with a snare.
Adenomas
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Mucosal Resection of large colon polyps (greater than or equal to 20 mm in size)
Sydney Resection Quotient (size of polyp in mm divided by number of resection pieces)., At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal resection of polyp (Day 1)|Proportion of subjects with en bloc resection of all endoscopically visible lesion, At V2 day of endoscopy (Day 1)
Effectiveness compared to the reference comparator in terms of injected volume to provide initial polyp lift, At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Reseaction (Day 1)|Injected volume required to complete the procedure, At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Reseaction (Day 1)|Number of re-injections required to complete the procedure, At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (Day 1)|Number of resection pieces, At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Reseaction (Day 1)|Ease of use rated on 5-point scale, At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Reseaction (Day 1)|Time to resect the lesion completely, At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Reseaction (Day 1)|Number of single session complete removal of lesions, At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Reseaction (day 1)|Need for additional treatment modalities (eg coagulation, ablation, avulsion), At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Reseaction (Day 1)|Pathology negative report for lateral and/or deep margins, At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Reseaction (Day 1)|Number of deep resections containing muscularis propria, At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Reseaction (Day 1)|Histologically positive or negative Free margin confirmed in en-bloc resections, Histologist will assess if removed lesions have a free margin or not., At V2 day of Endoscopic Mucosal Reseaction (Day 1)|Recurrent or residual neoplasia confirmed by repeat standard endoscopy and biopsy (if applicable) at the follow up visit, Day 60 follow up visit
SIC 8000 is indicated for use in gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures for submucosal lift of polyps, adenomas, early-stage cancers or other gastrointestinal mucosal lesions, prior to excision with a snare.

The current trial will focus on only colonic polyps â‰¥20 mm removed by snare EMR technique.

Patients with lesions not suitable for EMR because of features strongly suggestive of sub-mucosal invasion will not be included.
