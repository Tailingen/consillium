The side effects are modest, since PARP inhibitors affect cancer cells to a much larger extent than normal cells. The effect of this PARP-inhibiting treatment is evident although the greatest effect is seen in patients with mutations in BRCA genes. The reason for this is that BRCA deficient cancer cells are unable to repair both DNA double strand and single strand breaks and undergo apoptosis to a large extent.
