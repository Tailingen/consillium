Study of Anlotinib After Lenvatinib in Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This clinical study evaluates the efficacy and safety of anlotinib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have progressed on lenvatinib treatment. It is a single arm, open-label clinical trial conducted in China, and plan to recruit 28 patients. Primary endpoint of the study is Progress Free Survival.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Anlotinib
Progress free survival (PFS), Progress free survival is defined as the time from first day of anlotinib treatment until the first date of either objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., each 42 days up to progressive disease (PD) or death (up to 24 months)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from first day of anlotinib treatment until the date of death due to any cause or the date of the last contact, at which the patients will be censored., From first day of anlotinib treatment until death (up to 24 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST1.1)., each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate is defined as the percentage of subjects whose best response was CR, PR or stable disease (SD) according to the RECIST1.1., each 42 days up to intolerance the toxicity or PD (up to 24 months)|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Until 30 day safety follow-up visit
Anlotinib is a novel multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for tumor angiogenesis and proliferative signaling. The prime targets of anlotinib include receptor tyrosine kinases vascular endothelial growth factor receptor1 to 3 (VEGFR1-3), fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 to 4 (FGFR1-4), platelet-derived growth factor receptor α and β (PDGFR α, β), and stem cell factor receptor.
