OPTIMISE is designed to provide knowledge regarding the use of Sunitinib as 1st line treatment and 2nd line treatment selected (Sunitinib-different sequence) with respect to efficacy outcomes, adverse events, and health related QoL in the real life setting.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sunitinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from when the participant received the first dose of sunitinib to the time of progression or death due to any cause, which occurred first. The time of progression was the date of the first tumor assessment where the progression was notified as response to therapy, over the sunitinib treatment. Participants who discontinued the study for any reason, including unacceptable toxicity during the treatment period, who remained alive and without disease progression, were censored at the last disease assessment that verified lack of disease progression. As per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters \[mm\]) in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference smallest sum of the longest dimensions recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions., From date of first dose of sunitinib to date of progression or death or censored date, whichever occurred first (up to maximum of 36 months)|Time to Treatment Failure (TTF), TTF was defined as the time from when the participant received the first dose of sunitinib to the time of sunitinib discontinuation (date completed by the physician). In case of death when the participant was still treated with sunitinib, date of death was considered as date of discontinuation. If no sunitinib discontinuation was reported during the follow-up visits, participants were censored to the last follow-up visit., From date of first dose of sunitinib until the date of discontinuation or censored date (up to maximum of 36 months)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) at Months 3, 6, 9 and 12, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST version 1.1. As per RECIST 1.1 criteria: CR = disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (\<)10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis); PR = at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions taking as reference baseline sum diameters., Months 3, 6, 9 and 12|Number of Participants With Recommended Starting Dose of Sunitinib, The recommended starting dose of sunitinib was 50 milligrams (mg) per day, 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off., At initiation of sunitinib (Day 0)|Number of Participants With Other Starting Doses, Number of participants with other starting doses of sunitinib (50 mg per day, 2 weeks on, 1 week off; 37.5 mg per day for 2 weeks on and 1 week off; 25 mg per day for 2 weeks on and 1 week off; 37.5 mg per day 4 weeks on and 2 weeks off) were reported in this outcome measure., At initiation of sunitinib (Day 0)|Number of Participants With Moderate Chronic Liver Failure, With 2 Milligrams (mg) Twice Daily (BID) as Starting Dose, At initiation of sunitinib (Day 0)|Average Dose Received Over the Sunitinib Treatment Period, During treatment period (up to 12 months)|Dose Intensity of Sunitinib, Dose intensity was defined as defined as the sum of sunitinib daily doses divided by the duration of sunitinib treatment in days (delay between the first sunitinib dose and the last dose, including temporary interruption)., During treatment period (up to 12 months)|Number of Participants With Change in Dose or Schedule of Sunitinib, Number of participants with change in dose or schedule of sunitinib at the specified time points were reported in this outcome measure., Month 3, 6, 9 and 12|Number of Participants With Dose Increase, During treatment period (up to 12 months)|Number of Participants With Temporary Interruption During the Sunitinib Treatment Period, During treatment period (up to 12 months)|Time to First Interruption, During treatment period (up to 12 months)|Time to All Interruptions, During treatment period (up to 12 months)|Number of Participants According to Reasons for Temporary Interruption, Number of participants according to reasons for temporary interruption (adverse events, logistical, personal and intolerant to sunitinib) at specified time points is presented in this outcome measure., Months 3, 6, 9 and 12|Number of Participants With Sunitinib Discontinuation, Number of participants with sunitinib discontinuation at specified time points is presented in this outcome measure., Months 3, 6, 9 and 12|Number of Participants According to Reasons for Sunitinib Discontinuation, Number of participants according to reasons for sunitinib discontinuation (death, intolerability, progression) at specified time points is presented in this outcome measure., Months 3, 6, 9 and 12|Median Duration of Sunitinib Treatment, Median duration of treatment was defined as the time between the sunitinib initiation and the sunitinib discontinuation date or the last follow-up date with sunitinib treatment., From date of first dose of sunitinib until discontinuation or last follow-up date with sunitinib treatment (up to maximum of 36 months)|Combined Progression Free Survival, Combined PFS was defined as the time from when the participants received the first dose of sunitinib as first line, until progression or death due to any cause while on the 2nd line treatment, whichever occurred first during the 2nd line sequence treatment.

OPTIMISE study objectives are dual and aim primarily to increase the knowledge regarding the outcomes from Sunitinib use on one hand; and outcomes from the combined Sunitinib-2nd line sequence on the other hand in real life clinical practice.

This will be addressed in many countries across AfME and in individual country cohorts to understand specificities and differences in use and outcomes
