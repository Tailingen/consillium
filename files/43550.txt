Using Advanced Imaging Studies to Develop a Profile of High-grade Serous Ovarian Cancer
The researchers are doing this study to find out whether the researchers can combine information provided by PET/MRI scans with information from tests on blood and tissue samples to develop a very detailed description (profile) of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), which could improve our ability to treat this disease.

The study researchers will use computers to analyze the combined results of the imaging tests and the genetic and immune system tests on the tumor samples. The study researchers think that this information will help them more accurately predict the way tumors respond to treatment, which may improve their ability to individualize treatments for this disease.

Comparison between radiologist tumor segmentation, Radiologist-defined tumor volumes will be used to train and validate a machine learning algorithm for generating segmentations. The data will be split into 70%-30% of training and test sets, respectively. The comparisons will be performed on a slice-by-slice and lesion-bylesion basis, which should ensure sufficient numbers of examples for testing., 1 year
