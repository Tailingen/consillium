Dual PD-1 and JAK2 Inhibition in Hematological Malignancies
Pembrolizumab will have significant clinical activity in patients with Intermediate and high risk MF, advanced PV who have been resistant, failed or are intolerant to JAK2 inhibitor therapy and the activity may be enhanced in combination with JAK2 inhibition by Ruxolitinib; similarly MDS/MPN and CMML patients for who no standard therapies are available will exhibit responses to PD-1 or dual JAK2 and PD-1 treatment.

Adding JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib to Pembrolizumab will have significant activity in patients with advanced, progressive HL who failed single agent PD-1 inhibition.
