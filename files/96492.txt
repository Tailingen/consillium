Treatment Patterns in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors in the Community Oncology Setting
This is a retrospective medical record abstraction to evaluate the patterns of care for Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) in the community setting. Patient demographics and characteristics along with the treatments received will be described. Investigators will establish the percentage of patients who undergo surgery, the percentage of patients who are treated with kinase inhibitors as well as in what setting (adjuvant or metastatic) as well as the duration of therapy. Physician information will also be collected to assess for differences in treatment based on physician or geographical differences.
