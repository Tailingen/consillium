Combination of PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody and HPV Vaccine in Patients With Cervical Cancer
The investigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Pd-1 Monoclonal Antibody and HPV Vaccine in the patients with cervical cancer who fails in or can not endure the standard treatment
Uterine Cervical Neoplasms|Cervical Cancer|Cervical Neoplasms|Cervix Cancer
DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: quadrivalent HPV vaccine
Objective Response Rate, complete response plus partial response as determined by RECIST 1.1, 24 months
Progression-free survival, Kaplan-Meier median estimates and curves will be used to describe PFS survival functions, Time from study entry to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 42 months|Overall survival, Kaplan-Meier median estimates and curves will be used to describe OS survival functions, Time from study entry to time of death or the date of last contact, assessed up to 42 months|Duration of Response, Kaplan-Meier median estimates and curves will be used to describe DOR survival functions, Time from the first evaluation of the tumor is CR or PR to the first evaluation is PD or death, assessed up to 42 months
The phase II study is a research which treat cervical carcinoma patients who recurred after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen with Sintilimab and HPV Vaccine. The primary endpoint is objective response rate; secondary endpoints are Progression-Free Survival, Overall Survival and duration of response. Efficacy will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1; progression-free survival is the time from study entry to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first; overall survival is the time from study entry to time of death or the date of last contact,. Furthermore, exploratory studies will be performed on archival tumor material (PD-L1 expression, next-generation sequencing).
