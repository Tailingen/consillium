A Study of HS-10241 Combined With Almonertinib Versus Platinum-based Chemotherapy in Treatment of Advanced NSCLC With MET Amplification After Failure of EGFR-TKI Therapy
HS-10241, an oral and highly selective MET-TKI, may contribute to overcoming common acquired MET-based resistance mechanisms following prior EGFR-TKI monotherapy. This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HS-10241 combined with Almonertinib versus platinum-based chemotherapy in NSCLC with MET amplification after failure of EGFR-TKI treatment.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: HS-10241+ Almonertinib|DRUG: Pemetrexed + Cisplatin /Carboplatin
Progression-free Survival (PFS) evaluated by Independent Review Committee (IRC), Progression of tumor was assessed by RECIST 1.1 thereby to evaluate progression free survival. Progression-free survival was deﬁned as the time from date of randomization until the documentation of objective disease progression (PD) or death from any cause in the absence of progression (whichever occurred first), regardless of whether they subsequently received non-study anti-cancer therapy., From the date of randomization to the earliest date of the first objective documentation of radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause, assessed up to 24 months
Objective response rate (ORR) evaluated by Independent Review Committee (IRC), ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that was confirmed at a subsequent scan at least 4 weeks later, as assessed according to RECIST version 1.1, From the date of randomization to disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months.|Disease control rate (DCR) evaluated by Independent Review Committee (IRC), Objective response was assessed by RECIST 1.1 thereby to evaluate disease control rate. Disease control was deﬁned as the percentage of patients who have a best overall response (confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease for at least 5 weeks), From the date of randomization to disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months.|Duration of response (DoR) evaluated by Independent Review Committee (IRC), Duration of response assessed by RECIST 1.1. Duration of response was defined as the time from when the criteria for CR or PR were first met to the occurrence of an objective disease progression (PD) or death., From the date of randomization to disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months.|Overall survival (OS), OS was defined as time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., From the date of randomization up to the date of date of death from any cause，assessed up to 24 months.|Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, Assessed by number and severity of adverse events as recorded on the case report form NCI CTCAE v5.0., From the date of randomization until 28 days after the last dose
This is a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HS-10241 in combination with Almonertinib versus platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with MET-amplified locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed after prior EGFR-TKI therapy.

All eligible patients were randomly assigned to experimental group (HS-10241 combined with Almonertinib) or control group (pemetrexed combined with platinum) at a ratio of 1:1. Patients in experimental group will receive HS-10241 300mg twice daily (BID) combined with Almonertinib 110mg once daily (QD) orally and will continue treatment until disease progression or other criteria for treatment discontinuation will be met. Patients in control group will receive the standard chemotherapy treatment of cisplatin/carboplatin combined with pemetrexed for 4\~6 cycles. Participants will continue receive pemetrexed monotherapy until disease progression or other criteria for treatment discontinuation will be met. The efficacy and safety of the two groups will be evaluated after follow-up.
