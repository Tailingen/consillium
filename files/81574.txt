Study to Evaluate Treatment Customized According to RAP80 and BRCA1 in Patients With Advanced Lung Carcinoma
Primary objective:

Â· Progression free survival.

Secondary objectives:

* Assess Overall survival of both treatment groups.
* Assess Tumor response rate using RECIST criteria
* Assess Toxicity profile of patients enrolled in the study.
* Exploratory evaluation of potential genetic markers of response or resistance to chemotherapy.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|BRCA1 Mutation
DRUG: Cisplatin, Docetaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine, Cisplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel, Cisplatin|DRUG: Docetaxel
Progression Free Survival, Defined as the length of time from the start of treatment to the date of the first documented progression of disease. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, From the day of start of treatment until first documented progression or death due to any cause,up to 18 months.
Overall Survival, Defined as the length of time from the start of the treatment that patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive., From the date of start of the treatment until death or end of follow up, up to 18 months.
Study population:

Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who have not received treatment for the disease at this stage and who have a good performance status (ECOG 0-1) and measurable disease (at least one target lesion according to RECIST criteria).

Duration of treatment:

Six chemotherapy cycles will be given. The duration of every cycle will be 21 days. If the treatment is beneficial, it may be prolonged to a total of 8 cycles at the discretion of the investigator.

Calendar and planned finalization date:

The approximate duration of the study is 3 years of recruitment followed by 1 year of follow-up.
