Neobladder Posterior Wall Suspended With Round Ligament of Uterus
Objective: to evaluate if the Neobladder posterior wall suspended with round ligament of uterus could improve neobladder empty after radical cystectomy in female patients with bladder cancer compared to present standard neobladder
Female|Bladder Cancer|Radical Cystectomy|Neobladder|Posterior Wall Suspended With Round Ligament of Uterus
PROCEDURE: rONB
postvoiding residual urine (PVP), number of patients with postvoiding residual urine (PVP) more than 100ml, 2 years after operation|clean intermittent catheterization(CIC), number of patients required clean intermittent catheterization(CIC), 2 years after operation
rate of complication, number of patients with any complication, through study completion, an average of 2 years|urodynamic profile, urodynamic parameter including peak flow rate, functional urethral length ...etc, 12 months afer operation|rate of continence of neobladder, number of patients with continence at daytime and nighttime, 12 months after operation
The investigators developed a technical modification which to aim to provide an posterior support to the ideal neobladder and obtain the anatomy recovered neobladder by posterior wall of neobladder suspended with round ligament. In this study the investigators designed the prospective random trial to evaluate whether this technique improves the neobladder empty compared to a current standard neobladder reconstruction.
