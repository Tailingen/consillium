Defining Response Criteria for PET Scans for People With Neuroendocrine Tumors
People with neuroendocrine cancer typically have imaging scans before and after treatment, including positron emission tomography (PET) scans. The scans are analyzed using a set of criteria that describes how the disease has responded to treatment. The purpose of this study is to establish new criteria for doctors to use when evaluating these PET scans. Researchers are testing whether these new criteria are useful for predicting whether a person's cancer gets better, gets worse, or stays the same. Researchers will also compare these new criteria to the current standard criteria for evaluating imaging scans.

validate the PRESCIENT criteria, On this prospective validation cohort, the prognostic value of each criteria for the 1-year PFS will be assessed, using a Cox regression model (stratified on the site) and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for time-dependent outcome using inverse probability of censoring weighting., 1 year
