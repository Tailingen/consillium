A Study of Lorigerlimab in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
Study CP-MGD019-03 is an open-label study of lorigerlimab in participants with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) or clear cell gynecologic cancer (CCGC). Approximately 60 participants will be enrolled. The study will assess the efficacy and safety of lorigerlimab in participants with PROC or CCGC.

Participants will receive lorigerlimab by intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of every 21-day treatment cycle. Treatment cycles will continue until progression of cancer, unacceptable side effects, withdrawal of consent by the participant, or the study ends.

Participants will be monitored closely for side effects by physical exam and routine laboratory tests every cycle. Tumor status will be checked approximately every 9 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks for the duration of treatment. Participants will have a safety followup performed within 30 days after treatment discontinuation. Participants who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than progression of cancer, will continue CA-125 and tumor assessments every 12 weeks. Participants who discontinue study treatment for progression of cancer will enter the 6-month survival follow up portion of the study.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria as determined by the investigator, The ORR, is defined as the percentage of patients in the response evaluable population who achieve a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), per RECIST, version 1.1 criteria.

CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease from baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions., Throughout the study up to approximately 2 years
Number of participants with adverse event (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation., Throughout the study, up to approximately 2 years|Median duration of response (DoR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria, The DoR will be calculated per RECIST v1.1 criteria, as determined by the investigator, from the date of initial tumor response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Throughout the study, up to approximately 2.5 years|Median progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 criteria, PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of documented PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Throughout the study, up to 2.5 years|Percent change from baseline in tumor size, Tumor size is defined as the sum of diameters of the target lesions., Throughout the study, up to 2.5 years|Best percent change from baseline in tumor size, Tumor size is defined as the sum of diameters of the target lesions., Throughout the study, up to 2.5 years|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR, per RECIST v1.1 criteria, as determined by the investigator, is defined as the proportion of participants in the response evaluable population who achieve a CR, PR or stable disease for at least 3 months., Throughout the study, up to 2.5 years
