Contribution of F18-FDG PET/CT to the Early Assessment of Pazopanib Therapy Efficacy in Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) is a rare tumor but can grow in different areas, for example, in 60% in limbs and about 20 % in retroperitoneum; and frequently is inoperable. Despite novel therapy in advanced cases survival is still short, approximately 12 month.

Pazopanib oral angiogenesis inhibitor was recently shown as promising drug for advanced pretreated STS.

Functional imaging especially F18-FDG PET/CT is a good modality for FDG avid tumor either for pre- / post- treatment evaluation or follow up.

Early detection of treatment response to therapy by whole body FDG PET/CT allows for change of treatment as early as possible,when the tumor is non-responsive before serious side effects appear or before depletion of body resources.

The aim of the study is to investigate the contribution of FDG PET/CT to assessment of treatment response.
