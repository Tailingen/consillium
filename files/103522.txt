A Phase 1/2, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation, Safety Study of INCAGN01949 in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability and assess preliminary efficacy of INCAGN01949 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Advanced Malignancies|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: INCAGN01949
Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events, Adverse events reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug/treatment, From screening through 60 days after end of treatment, up to 11 months
Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of INCAGN01949 in Plasma, To evaluate the Cmax of INCAGN01949 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors., Pre-infusion for cycles 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7, 10-minutes, 4 hrs, 24 hrs post-infusion, Day 8 for cycles 1 & 6|Area Under the Single-dose Concentration-time Curve (AUC0-t) of INCAGN01949, To evaluate the AUC0-t of INCAGN01949 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, Pre-infusion for cycles 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7, 10-minutes, 4 hrs, 24 hrs post-infusion, Day 8 for cycles 1 & 6|Objective Response Rate Per RECIST and Modified RECIST, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST v1.1. by investigator determination., Baseline and every 8 weeks,up to 11 months|Duration of Response Per RECIST and Modified RECIST, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST v1.1. by investigator determination., Baseline and every 8 weeks, up to 11 months|Progression-free Survival Per RECIST and Modified RECIST, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST v1.1. by investigator determination., Baseline and every 8 weeks, up to 11 months|Duration of Disease Control Per RECIST and Modified RECIST, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST v1.1. by investigator determination., Baseline and every 8 weeks, up to 11 months|Time to Maximum Concentration of INCAGN01949 in Plasma, To evaluate the Tmax of INCAGN01949 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors., Pre-infusion for cycles 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7, 10-minutes, 4 hrs, 24 hrs post-infusion, Day 8 for cycles 1 & 6|Summary of Trough Concentrations(Cmin) of INCAGN01949, To evaluate the Cmin of INCAGN01949 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Cmin is the minimum observed concentration of INCAGN1949, Pre-infusion for cycles 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7, 10-minutes, 4 hrs, 24 hrs post-infusion, Day 8 for cycles 1 & 6
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability and assess preliminary efficacy of INCAGN01949 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
