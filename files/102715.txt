Metronomic Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor With Bone Metastasis and Advanced Pretreated Osteosarcoma
This is a prospective open-labeled phase I trial based on a dose escalating study design assessing two dose levels of sirolimus when prescribed in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide (CP), methotrexate (MT) and zoledronic acid (ZA) followed by an expansion cohort once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is established.
Solid Tumor|Osteosarcoma
DRUG: Sirolimus combined with CP, MT and ZA
Dose Escalation Part: Number of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) at Each Dose Level on Cycle 1, A DLT is defined as an adverse event (AE) or laboratory abnormality that fulfills the criteria below:

* Is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment
* Occurs during the first cycle of treatment
* Is unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications
* Meets one of the criteria below, graded as outlined or according to NCI CTCAEv4.3:

  * Grade 4 non-haematological toxicity (not laboratory)
  * Grade 3 non-haematological toxicity \> 3 days (not laboratory) (except for asthenia, 1rst episode of nausea/vomiting without maximal symptomatic/prophylactic treatment)
  * Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic laboratory value if medical intervention is required to treat the patient, or the abnormality leads to hospitalization, or the abnormality persists for \> 1 week
  * Grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicity \> 3 days (except for lymphopenia)
  * Grade 4 lymphopenia
  * Confirmed febrile neutropenia, During the first cycle (28 days)|Expansion Cohort : Antitumor Activity Observed With Sirolimus Combined With CP, MT and ZA, in Terms of 6-month Non-progression Rate, 6-month non-progression rate defined as the rate of complete or partial response or stable disease at 6 months using RECIST v1.1 :

* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions and also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD
* Unevaluable : patients stopped the treatment before tumor assessment., 6-month non-progression rate as per RECIST v1.1
Dose Escalation Part : Antitumor Activity Observed With Sirolimus Combined With CP, MT and ZA, Best Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Per RECIST v1.1, The best objective response (BOR) is the best response recorded for each patient from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment for progressive disease, death, patient or investigator decision.

BOR is determined by investigator review of tumor assessments using RECIST v1.1 :

* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions and also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm
* Stable Disease (SD)

Tumor assessment were repeated every 8 weeks (±7 days, i.e Week 8, 16, 24, etc.) from start of treatment and at least 4 weeks after the first CR or PR, even if there are treatment delays, average of 4 months, Tumor assessment were repeated every 8 weeks (±7 days, i.e Week 8, 16, 24, etc.) from the start of treatment and at least 4 weeks after the first CR or PR, even if there are treatment delays, an average of 4 months.|Dose Escalation Part : Antitumor Activity Observed With Sirolimus Combined With CP, MT and ZA, 1-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), 1-year Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from study treatment initiation to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by investigator review of tumor assessments using RECIST v1.1, or death from any cause during the study (i.e., within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment).

Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions)., 1-year Progression-free survival (PFS) as per RECIST v1.1|Dose Escalation Part : Antitumor Activity Observed With Sirolimus Combined With CP, MT and ZA, 1-year Overall Survival (OS), 1-year Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from first infusion to death (of any cause), 1-year Overall Survival (OS) as per RECIST v1.1|Expansion Cohort : Antitumor Activity Observed With Sirolimus Combined With CP, MT and ZA, Best Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Per RECIST v1.1, The best objective response (BOR) is the best response recorded for each patient from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment for progressive disease, death, patient or investigator decision.

The dose escalation part of the trial will be concerned on adults with advanced solid tumor with bone metastasis and young and adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic osteosarcoma.

The Expansion cohort will be conducted on young and adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic osteosarcoma.
