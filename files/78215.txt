Visualisation of Indocyanine Green in Primary and Interval Debulking for Ovarian Cancer
Visualise peritoneal lesions of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in both primary and interval debulking surgery by using intravascular indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared (NIR) light. This Trial wants to investigate whether ICG can increase the visibility of peritoneal lesions and can differentiate between peritoneal implants and fibrosis.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Indocyanine green
Rate of correct visualisation during debulking surgery with the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence camera of peritoneal lesions of EOC in vivo by utilising ICG., During debulking surgery
Rate of diagnostic accuracy during debulking surgery with the NIR fluorescence camera of peritoneal lesions of EOC in vivo by utilising ICG., During debulking surgery|Percentage of lesions with positive correlation between pre-operative radiographic examination(s) and the ICG signal in vivo with the NIR fluorescence camera during surgery and immediately after surgery with the pathological examination., During debulking surgery and immediately after debulking surgery, when the pathological examination report is available.|Obtaining the tumour-to-background ratio of fluorescence in peritoneal lesions, lymph nodes and other anatomical structures during debulking surgery by utilising still images captures with the NIR fluorescence camera., During debulking surgery|Assessment of the number and type of adverse effects, severe adverse effects and adverse reactions with the trial dose of the IMP during and immediately after the surgery., During debulking surgery and immediately after the surgery, up to the point in time when the pathological report is available.
