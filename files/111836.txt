Myocardial Pathological Changes in Patients of Type 2 Diabetes With or Without PCOS Using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
The study is prepared to use CMR technology for early screening of myocardial lesions in 561 age-matched women with type 2 diabetes without PCOS, with PCOS without type 2 diabetes and with type 2 diabetes combined with PCOS, compare the differences between the two groups of cardiomyocyte injury changes, and treat and follow-up with type 2 diabetes and PCOS in accordance with the current standard treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes and PCOS, after 3 years of follow-up we will analyse the changes in cardiomyopathy, cardiac serological indicators, and heart function indicators,which can provide theoretical basis for early clinical intervention in the future.

So far, due to the lack of more sensitive noninvasive detection methods and indicators that suggest early cardiomyopathy, it is not clear whether type 2 diabetes combined with PCOS will lead to earlier and more progressive changes in cardiomyopathy, and whether there is a difference with type 2 diabetes alone and early cardiomyopathy in patients with simple PCOS.Compared with women with type 2 diabetes who did not combine polycystic Ovary Syndrome(PCOS) or PCOS did not combine with type 2 diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes who combined PCOS had the characteristics of lower age of onset, longer exposure to high risk factors of CVD, and higher risk of cardiovascular disease on the basis of the dual pathophysiology of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism.The purpose of this study is to find early cardiovascular disease of women with type 2 diabetes and PCOS and conduct early clinical intervention.
