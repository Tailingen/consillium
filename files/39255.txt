Immunotoxin Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer
RATIONALE: Immunotoxins can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. Immunotoxin therapy may be an effective treatment for advanced cancer.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of immunotoxins in treating patients who have advanced cancer.
Cervical Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer|Lung Cancer|Malignant Mesothelioma|Ovarian Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxic effects of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin in patients with advanced malignancies that express mesothelin.

Secondary

* Determine the response in patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the plasma pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

Patients receive SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin IV continuously on days 1-10. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
