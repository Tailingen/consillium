Use of a Patient Preferences Shared Decision-Making Encounter Tool in Clinical Practice for Patients With DLBCL and FL
The goal of this project is to test the feasibility of a Patient Preferences in Shared Decision-Making encounter tool (PPSDM) in the clinical context of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Follicular Lymphoma (FL). This project will evaluate the feasibility of a shared decision-making (SDM) model that employs an "encounter tool"1 to facilitate SDM at the point of a treatment decision for patients with DLBCL and FL.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|Follicular Lymphoma
BEHAVIORAL: Carevive CarePlanning System
Satisfaction of using the Carevive treatment planning system in shared decision making will be collected from both patient and provider perspectives: questionnaires, patient and providers will complete questionnaires at each clinic visit. These questions will determine their satisfaction with the treatment care planning system., 3 months
Evaluation of patient satisfaction and perceived shared decision making utilizing surveys at each clinic visit, Questionnaires answering questions regarding patient satisfaction with the treatment decision, patient activation, and patient perceived achievement of desired role in shared decision making following the technology-facilitated SDM intervention and compare differences in scores between the enrolled subjects. These surveys are part of the Carevive treatment planning platform and collect the information at each clinic visit., 3 months
This project is a single-arm pilot project conducted with 90 patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent DLBCL or FL and their providers at three medical oncology practices. Utilizing the PPSDM tool in the Carevive electronic platform, patients will report their needs, preferences, values and goal prior to the treatment decision-making focused clinical encounter. The treating provider will receive the patient results prior to the visit and can use these to facilitate SDM in treatment selection during the clinical encounter. Post-encounter, patients and providers will complete measures designed to assess feasibility and utility of SDM intervention. Patients will also complete measures to assess patient satisfaction with the treatment decision, patient activation, and patient perceived achievement of desired role in shared decision making and satisfaction with care.
