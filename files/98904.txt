Efficacy of NAC for the Prevention and Relief of PIPN in Women With Ovarian, Tubal, and Peritoneal Cancer
Ovarian cancer is third most common gynecologic cancer in Thai woman, treatment including surgery followed by chemotherapy.

Patient usually received paclitaxel every 3 week for 6 cycles, paclitaxel induce peripheral neuropathy is common dose dependent side effect which can disturb quality of life, result in chemotherapy dose reduction or discontinuation leading to poor prognosis and decreased survival Mechanism of PIPN including inflammation, promotion of microtubule polymerization and inhibition of depolymerization, and oxidative stress N-acetylcysteine is acetylated form of l-cysteine, might reduce oxidative stress. NAC can restore glutathione level, which is potent natural antioxidant. NAC might reduce PIPN
Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy
DRUG: N Acetylcysteine A|DRUG: N Acetylcysteine B
Paclitaxel-induce peripheral neuropathy, Assessment of grade of peripheral neuropathy by CTCAE v.5.0, Day 0 (before chemotherapy administration), at the end of cycle 1, at the end of cycle 2, and at the end of cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)
Severity of paclitaxel-induce peripheral neuropathy, Assessment of severity of peripheral neuropathy by Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ), Day 0 (before chemotherapy administration), at the end of cycle 1, at the end of cycle 2, and at the end of cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)|Quality of life associated paclitaxel-induce peripheral neuropathy, Assessment of quality of life using FACT/GOG-Ntx, Day 0 (before chemotherapy administration), at the end of cycle 1, at the end of cycle 2, and at the end of cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)
Side effects of NAC, Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, allergy, At the end of cycle 1, at the end of cycle 2, and at the end of cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of NAC on the incidence and severity of PIPN in woman with ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancer who treated with paclitaxel for 3 cycles. (PIPPN is developed after cumulative doses 250 mg/m2 or more) Patient in controlled group, received Paclitaxel only. Patient in intervention group divided to two groups. First group received NAC 2400 mg/day for one week after received Paclitaxel each cycle for 3 cycles. Second group received NAC 2400 mg/day for 9 weeks Evaluate incidence and severity of PIPN before start CMT, and every visit after received CMT each cycle using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) ver.5, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT/GOG-Ntx), and Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire (PNQ)
