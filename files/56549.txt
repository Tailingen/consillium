Study of MEDI0562 Prior to Surgical Resection in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) or Melanoma
This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and feasibility of a humanized OX40 agonist, MEDI0562, in the pre-operative setting for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma.

Activation of immune response, The primary objective of this phase Ib clinical trial is to ascertain if there is a difference in immune activation comparing a single dose of MEDI0562 with the equivalent dose divided into a Monday, Wednesday Friday schedule in patients with advanced HNSCC or melanoma. Immune activation will be assessed as a cumulative suppressive index (CSI)., 28 days
Cancer-related clinical outcomes (progression free survival), Cancer-related clinical outcomes in patients receiving MEDI0562 will be compared with historical controls for progression free survival., 5 years|Cancer-related clinical outcomes (overall survival), Cancer-related clinical outcomes in patients receiving MEDI0562 will be compared with historical controls for overall survival., 5 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events in patients with HNSCC or melanoma treated with MEDI0562 (Safety & Tolerability), The safety of MEDI0562 administration in patients with locally advanced HNSCC and melanoma will be monitored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0., 5 years|Surgical complications after MEDI0562, Surgical complications after MEDI0562 administration will be monitored using the Clavien-Dindo grading system., 28 days
This clinical trial is the first to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a humanized OX40 agonist, MEDI0562, in the pre-operative setting for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma.

Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two MEDI0562 administration schedules; initially 5 patients will enroll to each cohort. All patients will have a tumor biopsy before administration of MEDI0562 and surgery will be performed on approximately day 15 (+/- 2 days).

There will be a comparison of a surgical specimen to the original biopsy focusing on the composition and immunologic phenotypes of lymphocyte subsets. Although the primary endpoint of this study is immunological, valuable exploratory data on clinical outcomes will also be obtained.

Both the HNSCC and the melanoma patients to be enrolled on this trial are anticipated to have a 50 - 90% probability of recurrence within 5 years after surgery, even with current state-of-the-art post-surgical adjuvant radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. A recurrence of 25% or less within the 12 months after surgery will be deemed of clinical interest and would inform the design of a larger follow-up study.
