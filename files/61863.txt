Impact of HPV Vaccination on Prevention of Cervical HPV Infection in Sikkim, India
This project aims is to monitor the effectiveness of HPV vaccination in real-word conditions, at least 7 years after initiation of HPV vaccination in Sikkim. This study would give an opportunity to provide rapid feedback to the Indian public health authorities about the impact of the HPV vaccine.
Cervical Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: The study being observational in nature, there is no intervention. The investigators will only collect cervical samples from married women within a specified age range at different intervals.
The reduction in the point prevalence of genotype-specific HPV infection in women within 7 years of initiation of HPV vaccination compared to that at baseline, The investigators will estimate difference in the prevalence of genotype-specific HPV infection based on cervical samples collected from the married women aged 18 to 22 years at baseline (in the year 2020-21) and again in the year 2025-26 (seven years after the initiation of the HPV vaccination program)., 7 years|The difference in the point prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis infection in women within 7 years of initiation of HPV vaccination compared to that at baseline, The investigators will estimate difference in the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis infection based on cervical samples collected from the married women aged 18 to 22 years at baseline (in the year 2020-21) and again in the year 2025-26 (seven years after the initiation of the HPV vaccination program). The estimate will allow the investigators to understand any change in the background risk of sexually transmitted infection in the population over time., 7 years
The investigators would like to estimate the prevalence of HPV infections based on cervical samples collected from the Sikkimese women aged 18 to 22 years at baseline (i.e. when the study participants are expected to have no benefit of vaccination) and seven years after the launch of the HPV vaccination programme, by which time the initial vaccinated cohorts will be aged 18 to 22 years and many of them will be sexually active. If the vaccination programme continues with the current high coverage rate, the cohort of women in the second age group are expected to be protected due to herd immunity, irrespective of whether any individual woman receives the vaccine or not. Overall effectiveness to protect women aged 18-22 years against targeted and non-targeted HPV infections will be monitored through repeated cervical sample -based surveys.
