A Novel Laparoscopic Hepatectomy Posture, Left Lateral Position Plus Jackknife Position
Since the first report of laparoscopic resection of a benign hepatic tumor by Professor H. Reith in 1991, the laparoscope has been widely used in liver disease. Based on its advantages in laparoscopic vision and amplification, laparoscopic hepatectomy (LH) has been well recognized globally. Generally speaking, for lesions located in the left, front or lower part of the liver, corresponding to Couinaud segments II, III, IVb, V and VI, an LH surgery is recommended; however, for lesions located in segments VII and VIII, the surgery is high technically difficult due to poor exposure. Therefore,the investigators employ the left lateral position plus jackknife position to better expose lesions in these segments, hoping to reduce surgical time and bleeding in LH.
