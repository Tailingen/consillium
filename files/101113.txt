Trial of NanoPac Intratumoral Injection in Lung Cancer
This study evaluates the use of NanoPac injected directly into tumors in the lung of people with lung cancer.

DRUG: NanoPac (sterile nanoparticulate paclitaxel) Powder for Suspension
Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, AEs were collected at all study visits from the time of dosing. Subjects were required to spontaneously report any AE. Study personnel asked open-ended questions to obtain information about AEs at every visit., Day 1 to Week 24 (6 Months)
Concentration of Paclitaxel in the Systemic Circulation Post-injection, To characterize the pharmacokinetics of intratumoral NanoPac, plasma samples were taken on days of NanoPac injection prior to injection and at 1, 2, and 4 hours after NanoPac injection, as well as at all other study visits up through Week 24. Plasma paclitaxel concentrations are reported in pg/mL., Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, and 24|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) as assessed using RECIST v1.1, Weeks 24, 38, and 52|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) as determined by survival time following first NanoPac injection, Weeks 24, 38, and 52|Change in Tumor Dimensions (Longest Diameter), Change in longest dimension (cm) as determined by CT imaging compared to baseline (Screening), Weeks 12, 24, 38, and 52
NanoPac is very small (submicron) particles of the chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, which is administered intravenously in a number of types of cancer. These submicron particles are injected directly into solid tumors to target cancer at the site of disease with less systemic exposure than intravenously administered chemotherapy. In this study, the submicron particle paclitaxel will be injected directly into tumors in the lungs of people with small cell or non-small cell lung cancer. All subjects in this study will receive NanoPac and will be evaluated to see if NanoPac is safe and has an effect on the tumor within the lung.
