To Explore the Safety and Efficacy of Intravenous Infusion of Different Doses of Lidocaine in Patients
All patients who met the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into four groups, 30 cases in each group, which were lidocaine group 1, lidocaine group 1.5, lidocaine group 2, and the placebo group In lidocaine group 1, lidocaine group 1.5, and lidocaine group 2, 1% lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg was intravenously infused with a micropump after anesthesia induction, and the infusion was completed within 10 minutes according to the ideal body weight, and then continued for 1% lidocaine was infused at 1 mg/kg.h, 1.5 mg/kg.h and 2 mg/kg.h respectively until the end of the operation. In the placebo group, the same volume of normal saline was used instead.

Immediate postoperative plasma lidocaine concentration, Plasma lidocaine concentration is an important indicator for evaluating the safety of the drug during use, Immediately after surgery
Plasma lidocaine concentration immediately after loading, Plasma lidocaine concentration is an important indicator for evaluating the safety of the drug during use, 30 minutes before surgery|24-hour postoperative plasma lidocaine concentration, Plasma lidocaine concentration is an important indicator for evaluating the safety of the drug during use, 24-hour postoperative|The incidence of lidocaine toxicity within 72 hours after operation, Lidocaine toxicity mainly includes neurological manifestations such as dizziness, tinnitus, convulsions, cardiac manifestations such as bradycardia, new severe atrioventricular block and so on., within 72 hours after operation|The incidence of moderate to severe pain at 24、48 and 72 hours after surgery at rest and during movement;, he pain is evaluated using numerical rating scale（NRS). NRS scores range from 0 to 10 points, with 0 points representing no pain, 1-3 points representing mild pain, 4-6 points representing moderate pain, 7-9 points representing severe pain and 10 points representing the strongest pain., 24，48 and 72 hours after surgery|The cumulative morphine consumption at 24, 48 and 72 hours postoperatively, intra-operative and postoperative opioid use is reported as morphine milligram, At the end of the surgery，24，48 and 72 hours after surgery|Bowel function recovery, defined as the time to first defecation or time to first flatus, At 3 days after surgery|Postoperative hospital stay, The days of hospital stay after the operation were calculated from the first day after the operation to the days of discharge., up to 30 days|Patient satisfaction scores, (satisfaction scores regarding pain control and the overall recovery process were obtained at 72 hours after surgery, using a 11-point Likert scale, with 0 indicating "very dissatisfied"and10 indicating "very satisfied", 72 hours after surgery

In the placebo group, the same volume of normal saline was used instead.Postoperative pain management during the first 72 postoperative hours will involve the use of a PCIA device, which will contain lidocaine 30mg/kg, sufentanil 2 μg/kg, granisetron 12 mg diluted to 200 mL in 0.9 % normal saline. In the placebo group, the same volume of normal saline will be administered during anesthesia. The postoperative PCIA device will contain sufentanil 2 μg/kg, granisetron 12 mg diluted to 200 mL in 0.9% normal saline solution with a total volume of 200 ml. All the background infusions of PCIA will set at 2 ml/h, the bolus volume of each PCIA press is 2 ml and the lockout interval is 15 min.
