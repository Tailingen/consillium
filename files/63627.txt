Total/Subtotal Colectomy in Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and one year disease-free survival of total or subtotal colectomy and proctocolectomy in stage IIIc and stage IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer (EOC, FTC, PPC).
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma|Secondary Malignant Neoplasm of Large Intestine
PROCEDURE: Total or Subtotal Colectomy|PROCEDURE: Other Bowel Resection
Postoperative complications, Assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 up to 30 days after surgery, up to 30 days after surgery
The rate of 12- month- disease non-progression, Number of patients without progression in 12 months (From date of first chemotherapy until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 12 months), up to 12 months|Initiation of the first cycle chemotherapy, To compare the date between surgery and initiation of the first cycle chemo, up to 12 weeks|Hospitalization expenses, the cost during hospital stay, up to 12 weeks|Hospitalization days, length of hospital stay, up to 12 weeks
This trial is to assess the perioperative complications, hospitalization expenses and days, and one year disease-free survival of patients who underwent total or subtotal colectomy as part of the surgical procedures for ovarian cancer, versus partial intestinal resection in the therapy for ovarian cancer.
