Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block for Postdural Puncture Headache
Background: Postdural puncture headache (PDPH), which is one of the complications of spinal anesthesia, is a condition that negatively affects the quality of life of patients, causes late mobilization and prolonged hospital stay. Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SGB) has created a minimally invasive, easy, and safe treatment alternative.

Objective: Evaluating the effectiveness of topical SGB on PDPH treatment. Design: Retrospective observational study Setting: Single center tertiary level of care hospital study. The files of PDPH patients between Jan 2018 and Jan 2020 were scanned.

Patients: PDPH patients aged 18-65 are included and any patients with primary/secondary headache history are excluded.

Main outcome measures: Patients were divided into 2 groups. The group that given only conservative treatment was named as Group C, and the group of patients who had additionally been applied SGB was named as Group SGB. Headache severity was measured with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at the 1st,3rd, 12th and 24th hours of the treatment, in supine and upright position.

OTHER: Conservative Treatment for Postdural Puncture Headache
Headache in Supine Position, Headache severity changes with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0-10, 0: no pain, 10:worst pain), 1st, 3rd, 12th and 24th hours of follow-up
Headache in Prone Position, Headache severity changes with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0-10, 0: no pain, 10:worst pain), 1st, 3rd, 12th and 24th hours of follow-up|Successfully treated patients ratio, At the 24th hour of their follow-up, all patients with a VAS\>3 (Visual Analogue Scale) headache in an upright position are considered as unsuccessful treatment and are directed to the epidural blood patch procedure. Both groups will be compared with successfully treated patients ratios., 24th hour of follow-up
