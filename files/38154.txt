Arsenic Trioxide in Treating Patients With Advanced Neuroblastoma or Other Childhood Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of arsenic trioxide in treating children who have advanced neuroblastoma or other solid tumors.

DRUG: arsenic trioxide
Response Rate After Every 3 Courses During Treatment and Then Every 2-3 Months for 1 Year After Completion of Treatment, 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rates of patients with advanced neuroblastoma or other pediatric solid tumors treated with arsenic trioxide.
* Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of disease (neuroblastoma with progressive disease vs neuroblastoma with stable refractory disease vs other solid tumor).

Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1-4 hours on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed every 2-3 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter.
