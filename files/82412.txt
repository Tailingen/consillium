A Study of LY3321367 Alone or With LY3300054 in Participants With Advanced Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as LY3321367, an anti-T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain domain-containing molecule-3 (TIM-3) antibody administered alone or in combination with LY3300054, an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody, in participants with advanced relapsed/refractory solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: LY3321367|DRUG: LY3300054
Number of Participants with DLTs, Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as an adverse event (AE) that meets protocol defined DLT criteria during cycle 1 and is at least possibly related to study drug., Baseline through Cycle 1 (28 Day Cycle)
PK: Cmax of LY3321367, Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY3321367, Cycle 1 Day 1 through Follow-Up (Estimated up to 6 Months)|PK: Cmax of LY3321367 in Combination with LY3300054, Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY3321367 in Combination with LY3300054, Cycle 1 Day 1 through Follow-Up (Estimated up to 6 Months)|ORR: Percentage of Participants With a CR or PR, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the percentage of participants with confirmed best overall tumor response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)., Baseline to Measured Progressive Disease (Estimated up to 6 Months)|PFS, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the date of the first dose to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease or death from any cause, whichever is earlier., Baseline to Objective Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Estimated Up to 12 Months)|DoR, Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the time from the date of the first CR or PR to the first date of progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause., Date of CR or PR to Date of Objective Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Estimated up to 12 Months)|TTR, Time to Response (TTR) is defined as time from treatment start to first documentation of response., Baseline to Date of CR or PR (Estimated up to 6 Months)|DCR: Percentage of Participants who Exhibit SD, CR or PR, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants with stable disease (SD), confirmed PR or confirmed CR (CR+PR+SD)., Baseline through Measured Progressive Disease (Estimated up to 6 Months)
