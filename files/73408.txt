Disitamab Vedotin Combined With BCG Therapy in HER2-expressing High-risk Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
This is a prospective, open, single-center clinical study of the anti-HER2(Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) ADC(antibody-drug conjugate) drug Disitamab Vedotin in combination with BCG(bacillus Calmette-Guerin) therapy in very high-risk NMIBC(Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer) patients with HER2 expression (IHC 1+/2+/3+), which is being conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice for Pharmaceutical Trials (GCP). Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled in this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Disitamab Vedotin (2.0 mg/kg, administered intravenously every three weeks) in combination with BCG therapy.

DRUG: Disitamab vedotin|DRUG: Bacillus Calmette Guerin Vaccine
Percentage of Participants With CR as Assessed by the Investigator according to Cystoscopy and Urine Cytology at Month 3, CR at the 3-month disease assessment, evaluated by both cystoscopy and cytology., up to 3 months|Event-Free Survival (EFS) rate, as Assessed according to Cystoscopy and Urine Cytology, Percentage of Participants With Event-Free Survival (EFS), as assessed according to Cystoscopy and Urine Cytology ( patients who are alive and free of persistent/recurrent high-grade NMIBC.), up to 6 months
Percentage of Participants With CR as Assessed by the Investigator according to Cystoscopy and Urine Cytology at Month 6, 12, CR at the 6, 12-month disease assessment, evaluated by both cystoscopy and cytology., up to 12 months from the date of randomization as assessed by the investigator according to cystoscopic assessment and urine cytology|Duration of CR will be defined for participants with a CR as the time from the first occurrence of a documented complete response to recurrence of high-grade NMIBC or death from any cause., Duration of CR will be defined for participants with a CR as the time from the first occurrence of a documented complete response to recurrence of high-grade NMIBC or death from any cause., From first occurence of a documented CR until the time of recurrence of NMIBC or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months|Percentage of Participants With Event-Free Survival (EFS), as Assessed according to Cystoscopy and Urine Cytology, EFS rate at 12, 24 months, defined as the proportion of patients who are alive and free of persistent/recurrent high-grade NMIBC., up to 24 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), as Assessed according to Cystoscopy and Urine Cytology, PFS, defined as the time from the first study treatment to the first occurrence of progression to muscle-invasive disease based on cystoscopy and urine cytology or death from any cause., Time from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|Overall Survival, defined as the time from first study treatment to death from any cause, Time from date of randomization to death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, Percentage of participants with at least one adverse event during the study, up to 24 months
The study will include patients with very high risk NMIBC with HER2 expression (IHC 1+/2+/3+) who refuse to undergo cystectomy or do not meet the requirements for cystectomy. Reasons for unsuitability or refusal of cystectomy will be documented on an electronic case report form (eCRF).

Subjects will receive 6 months of Disitamab Vedotin therapy and at least 1 year of BCG therapy. EFS(Event free survival) and CR(Complete response) rates will be evaluated after treatment by cystoscopy, pathologic histology, urine cytology, laboratory tests, and imaging. Cystoscopy and urine cytology every three months for two years, and radiography every six months. Cystoscopy and urine cytology were done every six months and radiography once a year after two years.
