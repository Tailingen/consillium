Lapatinib for Brain Metastases In ErbB2-Positive Breast Cancer
Determine how safe and effective lapatinib is when used to treat patients with ErbB2 overexpressing breast cancer that has spread to the brain and is still progressing there even after radiation treatment using WBRT (whole brain radiotherapy) or SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) to the brain. Lapatinib is an oral drug that will be taken every day. Tests for safety and efficacy will be performed every 4 weeks or 8 weeks (depending on the test) during the course of the study.

The Number of Participants With Central Nervous System (CNS) Best Overall Response, Summary of CNS Objective Response (Lapatinib Monotherapy - MITT Population)

Response to lapatinib in patients with progressive brain metastases from ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer.

The primary indicator of drug efficacy was CNS objective response rate. A CNS objective response was defined as either a Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR), as assessed by volumetric analysis of brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), provided there was no progression of systemic disease outside of the CNS, increasing steroid requirements, or worsening of Neurological signs and symptoms (NSS)

A CNS objective response rate was defined as a 50% volumetric reduction in sum of CNS target lesions, with no new or progressive CNS or non-CNS lesions, no increases in tumor-related steroid requirements and no worsening of neurological signs or symptoms, time from baseline to data cutoff (25 Sept 2007); approximately 2 years|The Percentage of Participants With Central Nervous System (CNS) Objective Response Rate - Response Rate (CR + PR), Summary of CNS Objective Response (the Complete Response + Partial Response), time from baseline to data cutoff (25 Sept 2007); approximately 2 years
Percentage of Participants With Improvement in Neurological Signs and Symptoms (NSS) Measured Using the Neurological Examination Worksheet, Physician-reported NSS worksheet is derived from 13 AEs and measured by NCI CTCAE v3.0 grouped into 7 categories: level of consciousness, neurological symptoms, cranial nerves, language, strength, sensation, \& ataxia. Improvement of NSS required: Decrease by 1 or more grades from baseline of any tumor-related NSS, with confirmation at least 4 wks later, No development or worsening in any tumor-related NSS during interval, No radiographic evidence of CNS progression (assessed by volumetric MRI) or systemic (non-CNS) progression (assessed by RECIST) during interval, Stable or decreasing steroids during interval as defined by GSK equivalent doses of an alternative corticosteroid or a dose increase for non-tumor related reasons didn't constitute a steroid increase. Improvement in any non-tumor associated NSS didn't constitute improvement in NSS. Neurological exam, using Neurological Examination Worksheet was assessed at baseline \& each 4 wks.
