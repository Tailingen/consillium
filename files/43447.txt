Adjuvant Chemotherapy for High-risk Retinoblastoma After Enucleation
The purpose of this study is to determine whether 3 cycles of chemotherapy(CEV) is not inferior to 6 cycles of chemotherapy(CEV) in the treatment of Stage I enucleated retinoblastoma.
Retinoblastoma
DRUG: 3 cycles chemotherapy|DRUG: 6 cycles chemotherapy
disease-free survival, measure the disease-free survival rate for the two groups at five years, five years
overall survival, time from randomization to death as a result of any cause at five years, five years|safety: side effects of chemotherapy in the Treatment of Retinoblastoma, Number of participants with side effects (systemic check-up, audio acuity, ect)before each treatment, at 1,3,6,9,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54,60 months after the treatment., five years|quality of life (PedsQL4.0 scale) in the Treatment of Retinoblastoma, quality of life (PedsQL4.0 scale) before each treatment, at 1,3,6,9,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54,60 months after the treatment. PedsQL 4.0 questionnaire has two modules (reported by parents and children) with 23 items encompassing the physical domains (8 items), emotional (5 items), social (5 items) and school (5 items). A five scores scale is used, after being asked, ''How much, in the last month, your child has had problems with'' (0 = never a problem; 1 = almost never a problem; 2 = sometimes a problem; 3 = is often a problem and 4 = almost always a problem). The items are reverse-score and linearly transformed to a scale from 0 to 100 (0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4 = 0). So high scores indicate better QoL., five years|economic burden due to chemotherapy, All costs, including direct cost and indirect cost, are expressed in Chinese YUAN. Direct costs include the average cost of systemic chemotherapy, operation, supportive treatment, and examination. Indirect costs include accommodation, transportation, diet, and lost income of parents., during chemotherapy (9 weeks for 3-cycle group, and 18 weeks for 6-cycle group)
This study will be a phase â…¢ open label interventional case series. Patients with unilateral Stage I enucleated retinoblastoma will be randomized to receive chemotherapy(CEV) of 3 cycles or 6 cycles every 21 days. Patients will be followed for 60 months.
