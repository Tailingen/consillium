The Rise in Robotic Atypical Segmentectomies
This study investigates the increased rate of robotic atypical segmentectomies. Segmentectomy refers to removing a section of a lobe of the lung. Reviewing patients' data retrospectively may help researchers determine whether robotic surgery has led to an increase in atypical segmentectomy.

Rate of change in robotic segmentectomies, Up to 2 years|Rate of typical and atypical segmentectomies, Up to 2 years|Differences in robotic versus other types of resections such as open and video-assisted thoracic surgery, Up to 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the rate of increase in robotic segmentectomies performed at our institution per year.

II. To evaluate the rate of typical and atypical segmentectomies performed at our institution per year.

III. To characterize the differences in robotic versus other types of resections such as open and VATS (video-assisted thoracic surgery).

OUTLINE:

Patients' medical records are reviewed retrospectively.
