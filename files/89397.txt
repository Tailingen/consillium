POTENT - Tepotinib in Combination with Pembrolizumab in NSCLC
This clinical study is looking at the combination of two experimental drugs called tepotinib and pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab, also known as Keytruda, is licenced and available by prescription to treat a variety of cancers. Tepotinib is currently licensed in the UK for use in non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC) and is being investigated for this purpose.

Cancer immunotherapy drugs hold great promise but still do not work for many patients. Laboratory studies on cancers that do not respond well to immunotherapy reveal that most of these tumours do not have any immune cells. This suggests that the cancer has successfully hidden itself and avoided being recognised by the immune system. This study aims to use a novel approach using a targeted drug, tepotinib, to target the gene involved with NSCLC.

Tepotinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. Kinase inhibitors are a newer type of drug being used to try to treat cancers. They act by blocking some of the chemical messengers that are part of the signalling process within cancer cells that control their growth. Tepotinib is used in adults to treat NSCLC that can have certain abnormal changes in the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor gene (MET) and which has spread and/or cannot be removed by surgery. The changes in the MET gene can make an abnormal protein which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. By blocking this abnormal protein, tepotinib may slow or stop the cancer from growing as well as potentially shrinking the cancer. This study will include patients with and without the MET exon 14 mutations.

In this clinical study, the investigators aim to test our ideas in a small number of people for the first time, specifically in those patients with cancers which do not respond to cancer immunotherapy.

Determination of MTD and RP2D, Establishing the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of tepotinib in combination with pembrolizumab by determining a dose at which no more than one patient out of six patients at the same dose level experience a drug-related dose limiting toxicity (DLT)., 12 Months|Safety and tolerability of the combination of tepotinib with pembrolizumab, Determining causality of each adverse event to the combination of tepotinib with pembrolizumab and grading severity according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0.

Discontinuation rate defined as number of patients discontinuing IMP due to toxicity, 24 Months|Further anti-tumour activity evaluation, Evaluating the further measures of antitumour activity of tepotinib in combination with pembrolizumab. Clinical benefit rate defined as the percentage of patient who have achieved complete response, partial response or stable disease according to iRECIST, 24 Months|Pharmacokinetics of Tepotinib investigating maximum plasma concentration, Determination of the plasma levels of Tepotinib in Part A of the study, using validated assays, 12 Months|Pharmacodynamics investigating the change in markers of target inhibition, Characterising the pharmacodynamics (PD) profile of tepotinib in combination with pembrolizumab.
