A Study to Evaluate the Tolerance, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of TQB3558 Tablets
This is a study to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) , occurrence of all adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) , pharmacokinetic parameters and antitumor effect of TQB3558 tablets in Chinese adult patients with advanced solid tumors .The study is divided into phase Ia and phase Ib. Phase Ia: dose escalation period, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TQB3558 tablets, determine MTD; Phase Ib: effectiveness exploration period, to expand the safe and effective dose group, recommend appropriate dosage and method for subsequent clinical research.
