Up-front CART-BCMA With or Without huCART19 in High-risk Multiple Myeloma
This is an open-label phase 1 study to assess the safety and pharmacodynamics of CART-BCMA, with or without huCART19, in patients responding to first- or second-line therapy for high-risk multiple myeloma. The regimen evaluated in this study is based on established safety of CARTBCMA demonstrated in UPCC 14415/IRB#822756 at dose of 5x108 cells, administered as split infusions, following cyclophosphamide 1.5 g/m2 in patients with relapsed/refractory myeloma. This study tests CART-BCMA (1) as consolidation of early therapy for multiple myeloma, (2) with addition of fludarabine to the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen, (3) in combination with huCART19, and (4) as a single rather than split-dose infusion.

Phase A: Safety Run-in to test the safety of CART-BCMA + huCART19 as split-dose infusions after lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide + fludarabine in patients who have relapsed/refractory myeloma after two prior regimens but who are responding to their current therapy. Phase A Expansion: To occur once safety is demonstrated in Phase A. - Phase B: Randomization Phase in which patients responding to first or second-line therapy will receive either CART-BCMA alone (Cohort

1) or CART-BCMA + huCART19 (Cohort 2) as split-dose infusions after lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide + fludarabine. Phase C: Single-dose infusion phase to test the safety of single-dose infusion of CART-BCMA alone (Cohort 1) and CART-BCMA + huCART19 (Cohort 2) as single-dose infusions after lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide + fludarabine in patients responding to first- or second-line therapy.
