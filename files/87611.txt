Adding Prednisolone During Ovulation Induction With CC in Lean Women With CC Resistant PCOS
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of concomitant administration of prednisolone during use of clomiphene citrate (CC) for induction of ovulation in infertile lean women having CC resistant polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).
Infertility|Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
DRUG: Clomiphene citrate and Prednisolone|DRUG: Clomiphene citrate and folic acid
Ovulation rate, Number of ovulatory cycles divided by the number of stimulation cycles, 3 months
Number of ovarian follicles ≥ 18 mm on day of HCG administration, Number of ovarian follicles ≥ 18 mm by TVS on day of HCG administration, 3 months|Endometrial thickness on day of HCG administration, Endometrial thickness by TVS on day of HCG administration, 3 months|Clinical pregnancy rate, Number of clinical pregnancies (defined as presence of at least one intrauterine gestational sac with fetal pole and cardiac activity on TVS scan at 6-8 weeks gestational age) divided by the number of women, 6-8 weeks gestational age
Women will be randomly divided into two groups; CC-Prednisolone group and CC-placebo group. Women in the CC-Prednisolone group will receive CC (150 mg/day for 5 consecutive days from day 2 of the cycle) and prednisolone tablet (5 mg/day for 10 consecutive days from day 2 of the cycle). Women in the CC-placebo group will receive CC alone (150 mg/day for 5 consecutive days from day 2 of the cycle) and folic acid tablet (0.5 mg/day for 10 consecutive days from day 2 of the cycle). Transvaginal sonography (TVS) scan will be performed regularly for monitoring of follicular growth (folliculometry); starting from day 10 of the stimulation cycle and repeated every 2-3 days. When there will be at least one follicle ≥ 18 mm in diameter, final oocyte maturation will be induced by intramuscular administration of 10000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and timed intercourse will be advised. If there will be no follicle ≥ 12 mm by day 16 of the cycle, monitoring of follicular growth will be discontinued and the cycle will be presumed to be anovulatory. Ovulation will be documented by TVS scan one week after triggering of oocyte maturation and will be confirmed by assessing the mid-luteal serum progesterone level. Each woman will be subjected to ovarian stimulation for a maximum of 3 consecutive cycles except if she gets pregnant in the first or second cycle
