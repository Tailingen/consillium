Study of RP-6306 with FOLFIRI in Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 with FOLFIRI in patients with eligible advanced solid tumors, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and preferred schedule, and assess preliminary anti-tumor activity.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: RP-6306 (oral PKMYT1 inhibitor)
Number of patients with of treatment-related adverse event data per CTCAE v5.0 criteria and frequency of dose limiting toxicities, to determine safety and tolerability of RP-6306 in combination with FOLFIRI., This data will be used to identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule of RP-6306 in combination with FOLFIRI, Up to 90 days after last administration of study intervention|To identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), through evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) at or below a frequency of 25%., Up to 90 days after last administration of study intervention
Best percent change in tumor size from baseline, To assess the preliminary efficacy of RP 6306 in combination with FOLFIRI in patients with molecularly selected, advanced solid tumors, objective response rate, best overall response rate, duration of response, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival at 6 months, and overall survival at 12 months|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time 0 to 8 hours post dose, PK parameters of RP-6306, irinotecan, and SN-38, Through end of study, up to 2 months|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) will be observed directly from data, PK parameters of RP-6306, irinotecan, and SN-38, Through end of study, up to 2 months|Minimum blood plasma concentration (Cmin) will be observed directly from data, PK parameters of RP-6306, irinotecan, and SN-38, Through end of study, up to 2 months|Time take to reach Cmax (Tmax) will be observed directly from data as time of first occurrence, PK parameters of RP-6306, irinotecan, and SN-38, Through end of study, up to 2 months
To assess the safety and tolerability of RP-6306 in combination with FOLFIRI in patients with eligible, advanced solid tumors. Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory assessments, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and use of concomitant medications.
