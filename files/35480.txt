Retrospective analysis of pre- and post-Enhanced Recovery after surgery for total mastectomy pathway implementation in patients at Mount Zion Hospital. We examined perioperative opioid consumption, pain scores, post-operative nausea and vomiting, benzodiazepine use, length of stay for the time period before and after implementation of an Enhanced Recovery after Surgery pathway for Total mastectomy. Pathway features included preoperative acetaminophen and gabapentin, minimizing opioids, postoperative NSAIDs, Pecs blocks, and aggressive postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis.
