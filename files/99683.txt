HuMax-IL8 (Interleukin8) in Patients With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors
A phase Ib, dose escalation, multiple dose trial with HuMax-IL8 in patients with metastatic or unresectable, locally advanced malignant solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: HuMax-IL8
Proportion of patients who experience DLTs (Dose Limiting Toxicity) 28 days following the first dose of HuMax-IL8, as well as all DLTs occurring during the study thereafter., The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of patients who experience DLTs. The MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) will be determined based on the dose escalation cohorts. The evaluation period for DLTs will be 28 days following the first dose of HuMax-IL8, From cycle 1 day 1 up to 28 days
Pharmacokinetic properties of HuMax-IL8 in patients including AUC (Area Under the Curve), From baseline up to 72 hours after infusion
All human subjects with a diagnosis of incurable solid tumors are eligible for the dose-escalation phase of this study. This study consists of two phases, the dose-escalation phase and the expansion phase. Subjects will be treated with the study treatment until any off-treatment criteria are met. The safety and efficacy will be assessed until the end of treatment or for a maximum of 52 weeks. In addition, a separate visit will be performed at the time of disease progression if the patient has a progression between end of treatment and 52 weeks. The patients will be followed up for overall survival until the study closure. The study will be closed when all enrolled patients have been followed up for at least 52 weeks or have died.
