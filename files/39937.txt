Number of Participants According to Real-World Tumor Response, Real world tumor response included complete response (CR), Partial response (PR), Stable disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD), and was determined by physician based on imaging, biopsies, biomarkers, and/or clinical judgment. Response as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria may not be available for all participants. rwTR was derived as the best tumor response recorded from the palbociclib combination treatment start date until the first documentation of progressive disease.
