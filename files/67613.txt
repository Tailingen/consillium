The Study of Microglia/Macrophages Involved Dynamic Evolution of Glioma Microenvironment and the Function and Visualization of Targeted Molecules of Glioma
establishment of glioma microenvironment cell dynamic evolution database reveal the mechanism of GIM promoting malignant transformation of glioma cells reveal the dynamic regulation process of immune cells in the process of glioma evolution
Glioma
PROCEDURE: surgery
Multi-omics characteristics of glioma patients, we aim to describe patient's features about transcriptomics 、Immunomics、Radiomics ，etc., 24 month|expression level of protein，drived from paraffin-embedded specimens， retrospectively collected., different expression level of proteins in Gliomas with different grades and molecular subgroups (500 cases), 24 month
To collect tissue samples from different stages of glioma evolution and establish a high-quality high-throughput sequencing database of immune microenvironment cells, so as to lay a data foundation for later mining the dialogue mechanism and key targets between immune cells and tumor cells in glioma microenvironment.

Based on the analysis results of the above database, the key role of key target molecules in the dialogue between GIM and glioma cells and the regulation ability of immune cells in the immune microenvironment were confirmed through cell and mouse animal experiments, which laid the foundation for later targeted drug research and development.

Combined with fluorescence imaging technology, through in vivo imaging of mice, it can provide more intuitive and effective visual verification for the dynamic infiltration process of GIM and other immune microenvironment cells in the process of glioma evolution, and provide a new theoretical basis for the visualization research of dynamic regulation of glioma immune microenvironment cells.
