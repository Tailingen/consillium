EGFR-TKI Resistance Profile in Chinese Patients With Advanced EGFRm+ NSCLC
A Prospective Multi-center Study to Investigate the EGFR-TKI Resistance Profile in Chinese Patients with Advanced EGFRm+ NSCLC
Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer
The biomarker profile of EGFR-TKI resistance, Baseline
The concordance, sensitivity and specificity in paired blood and tissue samples, Baseline
Patients with EGFR mutation and presented secondary resistance to prior first-generation EGFR-TKI should have received biopsy of at least on progressed lesions and are able to provide tissues for pathological examination and NGS testing.All enrolled patients will be followed up to clinical outcome (treatments, tumor response, survival, etc).
