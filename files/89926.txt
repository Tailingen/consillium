DECAMP-2: Screening of Patients With Early Stage Lung Cancer or at High Risk for Developing Lung Cancer
The goal of this project is to improve lung cancer screening in high-risk individuals by identifying biomarkers of preclinical disease and disease risk that are measured in minimally invasive and non-invasive biospecimens. Existing biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis as well as new biomarkers discovered specifically in this clinical setting will be examined. Biomarkers that identify individuals at highest risk for being diagnosed with lung cancer prior to the appearance of concerning symptoms could increase the utility of lung cancer surveillance and the efficiency of lung cancer chemoprevention clinical trials. Achieving these goals would improve the detection and treatment of early stage and incipient lung cancer, while restricting the risk of these procedures to those individuals who currently exhibit the early molecular warning signs of impending disease.

The Detection of Early lung Cancer Among Military Personnel (DECAMP) consortium is a multidisciplinary and translational research program that includes 7 Veterans Administration Hospitals (VAH), the 4 designated Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) and 4 academic hospitals as clinical study sites, several molecular biomarker laboratories, along with Biostatics, Bioinformatics, Pathology and Biorepository cores. The DECAMP Coordinating Center will facilitate rapid selection, design and execution of clinical studies within this multi-institutional consortium. The ACRIN 4704 study will recruit one cohort to achieve the aims of this study: a longitudinal screening cohort.
