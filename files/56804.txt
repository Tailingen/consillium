Dose-escalation by Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Brain Metastases in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
The objective of this trial is to assess the safety and feasibility of delivering SBRT to patients with limited BMs (less than 10 lesions of lung cancer) by establishing the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of SABR in 5 fractions.
