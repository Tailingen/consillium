Genetic Biomarker Discovery for Metastatic Prostate Cancer
Biomarkers from circulating cell-free tumor DNA in peripheral blood will identify patients with metastatic prostate cancer diagnosed with C11 choline PET/CT who will benefit from metastasis-directed radiation, ablative therapies, and/or surgery. Tissue and blood will be collected before treatment. If patients receive androgen deprivation, then blood will be collected after neoadjuvant androgen deprivation but before radiation, ablative therapies, or surgery. Subsequent samples will be obtained at 3 months and 6 months following treatment, after which no further patient contact will occur.
