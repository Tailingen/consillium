Colorectal Cancer Screening in Average-risk Population: Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Testing Versus Colonoscopy
Aims:

1. To compare the efficacy of biennial immunochemical fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) versus colonoscopy every 10 years for the reduction of colorectal cancer-related mortality at 10 years in average-risk population.
2. To determine the compliance and complications associated with both strategies.

Methods: Multicenter, randomized, controlled study in 8 Spanish regions (Aragón, Canarias, Catalunya, Euskadi, Galicia, Madrid, Murcia and Valencia).

Study groups:

* Group I: iFOBT (OC Sensor®) in one stool sample, followed by colonoscopy when a positive result.
* Group II: colonoscopy.

Sample-size calculation: 27,749 subjects in each study group (total: 55,498).
