Irinotecan, TAS-102 Plus Bevacizumab as a Third-Line or Beyond Therapy in mCRC Patients
Currently, the approved third-line treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) include regorafenib, fruquintinib, and trifluridine/tipiracil(TAS-102). In recent years, several phase I/II studies evaluated the combination of TAS-102 and bevacizumab in mCRC patients who were refractory to standard therapies and showed promising antitumor efficacy and manageable toxicity. In this single-center phase II study, the investigators explored the efficacy and safety of irinotecan, TAS-102, plus bevacizumab in a third-line or beyond therapy for patients with mCRC.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Irinotecan, Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) plus Bevacizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a confirmed complete response or partial response using RECIST 1.1, 36 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from the date of the first administration of this regimen to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, 36 months|Overall Survival (OS), The time from the initiation of the first dose of medication in a patient to death from any cause., 36 months|Safety and tolerability by incidence, severity and outcome of adverse events, Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 5.0, 36 months
The mCRC patients who are refractory to standard therapies and need a third-line or beyond therapy are eligible. Patients who previously received irinotecan while progressing during maintenance therapy are also eligible.

These patients received an intravenous infusion of irinotecan (150mg/m2 on day 1) plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on day 1) and an oral administration of TAS-102(30 mg/m2 given bid on days 1-5), repeated every 14 days.

The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR), and the secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.
