Study of Belantamab Mafodotin With Carfilzomib, Pomalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma
Doctors leading this study hope to learn if the combination of belantamab mafodotin, carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone is effective and safe when given to people who have multiple myeloma that has gotten worse and is not responding to standard drugs that are used for treating multiple myeloma, including chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.

Participation in this research will last about 6 -24 months, but it may be less or more depending on your response to treatment.

The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of belantamab mafodotin, carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone for patients with a history of two or more prior lines of myeloma therapy. This combination is not FDA-approved, although carfilzomib and pomalidomide, are separately FDA-approved agents in combination with dexamethasone.
