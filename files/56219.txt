SpyGlass in Preoperative Diagnostics of Presumed Main Duct IPMNs: Efficacy and Novel Insights on Complications
Distinguishing intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) from other pancreatic cystic lesions is essential as IPMNs bear risk of becoming malignant. Differentiating the main pancreatic duct involving IPMNs (MD-IPMNs) with imaging can be difficult. Single-operator peroral pancreatoscopy (SOPP) has shown to be a promising method offering additional information on suspected lesions in the main pancreatic duct (MD). We aimed to establish the role of SOPP in preoperative diagnostics of presumed MD-IPMNs. A secondary objective was to identify factors that contribute to SOPP-related complications.
Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: SpyGlass pancreatoscopy
Histologic diagnosis given by the collected samples, Pathologists report, 1 year|Influence in decision-making concerning the patients clinical management, Multidisplinary meeting decision after SpyGlass, 1 year
Post procedural complications emerged after SpyGlass pancreatoscopy, According to Cotton criteria, 1 year
In this multicenter, partly prospective, but mostly retrospective cohort study, 101 SOPPs were performed due to presumed MD-IPMNs in three centers. As a key outcome, the rate of how often visual appearance of MD, and/or MD flushing liquid samples and biopsies taken during SOPP affected further clinical care, was determined. Secondly, post-SOPP complications according to Cotton consensus criteria, diameter of MD, use of prophylactic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and pancreatic stents, duration of SOPP and timing of pancreatic sphincterotomy (PS) were documented.
