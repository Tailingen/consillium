Safety Study of AMG 386 to Treat HER2-positive Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if AMG 386 in combination with either paclitaxel and trastuzumab or capecitabine and lapatinib is safe and well tolerated in subjects with HER2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.

This is an open-label phase 1b trial and has 2 study parts. Study part 1 is a dose escalation study to determine a tolerable dose of AMG 386 in combination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab (cohort A) or with capecitabine and lapatinib (cohort B). Study part 2 is cohort expansion of the tolerable doses determined in part 1.

Primary objective is to identify the incidence of adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities defined as a dose limiting toxicity in subjects treated with AMG 386 plus paclitaxel and trastuzumab or with AMG 386 plus capecitabine and lapatinib, 24 months
To evaluate the incidence of adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities not defined as DLTs, 24 months|To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AMG 386, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel (cohort A) or AMG 386, lapatinib, and capecitabine (and its active metabolite, 5-FU; cohort B) when administered in combination, 24 months|To estimate the incidence of anti AMG 386 antibody formation, 24 months|To evaluate the treatment effect as measured by the following: objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), change in tumor burden and progression-free survival (PFS), 23 months
