A Study of a New Investigational Medicinal Product to Treat Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
W0101 combines a cytotoxic compound to a monoclonal antibody targeting a receptor commonly overexpressed in many cancers.

The development of antibody-drug conjugates takes advantage of the specificity of the mAb while augmenting its ability to produce a cytotoxic effect. The expected benefits of antibody-drug conjugation are enhancement of cytotoxicity in target cells and limiting toxicities of cytotoxic drugs in normal tissues.
