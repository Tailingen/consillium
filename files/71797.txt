Ramucirumab and Pembrolizumab vs Pembrolizumab Monotherapy in PD-L1 Positive Head and Neck Squamous-Cell Carcinoma
This is a phase 2 study investigating the efficacy of ramucirumab in combination with pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy. Ramucirumab is a VEGFR-2 inhibitor believed to potentially enhance the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab.

Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the number of patients with a complete response (CR) and a partial response (PR) by RECIST 1.1 criteria. A CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, reduction in pathological lymph nodes to \<10 mm in short axis, and disappearance of all non-target lesions with normalization of tumor marker level. A PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From start of study treatment through completion of treatment (estimated to be 24 months)
Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of overall response is measured from the time criteria are met for a CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. Duration of overall CR is measured from the time criteria are met for a CR per RECIST 1.1 until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented., From time criteria is met for CR or PR through completion of treatment (estimated to be 1 year and 40 weeks)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., From start of study treatment through 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of death, censored at the last follow-up otherwise., From start of study treatment through 5 years|Incidence rate, frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs), AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v4.0 and summarized by arm., From start of study treatment through 30 days after last dose (expected to be 2 years and 1 month)
