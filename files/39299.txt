JAB-21822 Combined With JAB-3312 Compared SOC in the First Line for Treatment of Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With KRAS p.G12C Mutation
This Phase 3 study will evaluate the efficacy of JAB-21822+JAB-3312 versus tislelizumab (PD-1 Ab) combined with pemetrexed+carboplatin as the first line treatment in subjects with KRAS G12C mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Outcome Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until the first documentation of radiologic disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression will be based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)v1.1, per Independent Review Committee (IRC)., From Baseline up to 4 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response is defined as the best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on RECIST v1.1, From Baseline up to 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause, From Baseline up to 4 years|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, From Baseline up to 4 years|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Vital Signs, From Baseline up to 4 years|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Pre-dose Day 1 up to Day 64|Half life (t1/2), Pre-dose Day 1 up to Day 64
