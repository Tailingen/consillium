A Study of IMM-101 in Combination With Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy in Advanced Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of IMM-101 with nivolumab.
Melanoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: IMM-101
Safety and Tolerability of the Combination of IMM-101 + Nivolumab, Incidence, frequency and severity of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) throughout the study., From the point of Informed Consent until end of the study assessment (up to 84 weeks) or until withdrawal from the study.|Overall Response Rate, The primary endpoint of Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the number of subjects with a Best Overall Response (BOR) of confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) divided by the number of subjects in the Intent-to-treat analysis set in each cohort of the study.

The BOR will be determined once all the data up to and including the 12-month assessments for Cohort A or the 6-month assessment for Cohort B are available. It is defined as the best response designation based on confirmed responses determined by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1, recorded between the date of first postscreening scan and the date of last scan at/prior to the assessment at the 12-month assessment (Cohort A) and 6-month assessment/last assessment prior to change of treatment to IMM-101 + ipilimumab whichever is sooner (Cohort B)., From enrollment to end of study (18 months) or withdrawal, whichever was soonest
Best Overall Response (BOR) Using RECIST 1.1, Best Overall Response (BOR) is defined as the best response (complete or partial response, stable disease or progressive disease) designation based on confirmed responses determined by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1, recorded between the date of first postscreening scan and the date of last scan at/prior to the assessment at the 12-month assessment (Cohort A) and 6-month assessment/last assessment prior to change of treatment to IMM-101 + ipilimumab whichever is sooner (Cohort B).) Patients in cohort B who changed therapy without documented progression were censored at their last scan assessment prior to the change of therapy., 18 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival was defined as the time from Visit 1 (week 0) to the first confirmation of progression using RECIST 1.1 (confirmed or unconfirmed), or death from any cause (whichever occurred first). Progression was determined by the investigator using the CT or MRI scan or death due to any cause. Patients who died without reporting progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Progression is defined by RECIST 1.1 guidelines as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression., From Visit 1 (week 0) and the first confirmation of progression using RECIST 1.1 (confirmed or unconfirmed), or death from any cause (whichever occurred first).|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from Visit 1 (week 0) until date of death from any cause. OS was calculated for the entire study duration, where patients without a death date were right censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive. Post-study survival information was collected until database lock, for subjects completing or withdrawing from the study and included in the analysis., Overall survival was defined as the time from Visit 1 (week 0) until the end of the study (80 weeks) or until the date of death from any cause.|Overall Survival (OS) at One Year, Number of patients surviving at leat 12 months, OS at 1 year was calculated after all patients had had the opportunity of 12 months treatment of study
This open-label study will assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of IMM-101 with nivolumab in patients with unresectable stage III, or stage IV melanoma who are either treatment-naive (cohort A) or whose disease has progressed during PD-1 blockade (cohort B). Ipilimumab may be used as a subsequent treatment in place of nivolumab alongside IMM-101 for patients in cohort B if their disease progresses on study. Eighteen patients will be enrolled into cohort A and 8 patients into cohort B.
