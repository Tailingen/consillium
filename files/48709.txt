OSI-774 (Erlotinib, Tarceva) in Elderly Patients
The purpose of this research study is to determine if OSI-774 (Tarceva) is effective in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and to further study its side effects. The investigators would also like to estimate disease-related symptom improvement rates using a questionnaire.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Tarceva
Rate of Response, The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date the recurrent or progressive disease is documented., 1-3 years
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v2.0, 1-3 years|Changes in Quality of Life (QOL): questionnaire, This will involve participant response to a seven-item lung cancer subscale of Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L) questionnaire., through study completion, an average of 3 years|Rate of Progression free survival, Progression free survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression., 1-3 years|Duration of stable disease, Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteris for progression are met., taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started., 1-3 years|Overall Rate of Survival, Up to 5 years
In recent years, it has been shown that the degree of improvement achievable with chemotherapy has plateaued with the use of chemotherapy doublets. The presence of co-morbid conditions and poor performance status may preclude the use of chemotherapy in many elderly patients, which even in the medically fit, has modest benefits. The advent of targeted cancer therapy with the discovery of tyrosine kinases as mediators of tumor growth, with its limited toxicity profile, offers a promising approach to the treatment of NSCLC, in particular to the elderly subset of patients. The encouraging results from the other trials provide a strong rationale to evaluate an oral EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor OSI-774 in patients with advanced and inoperable NSCLC over the age of 70. In vitro and clinical data suggest a dose- dependent response with Tarceva (Genentech, data on file).
