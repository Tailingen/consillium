The Measure CTCAE of Safety, The level of Adverse Event (AE) is described in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) (Version 5.0)., -5, -3, 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 28 weeks
Immune response evaluation (INF-r), The tumor antigen-specific immune response induced after administration compared to before Investigational Product(IP) administration was confirmed by measuring changes in the secretion of cytokines (INF-r) in serum (ELISA)., 0, 2, 8, 16 and 28 weeks|Immune response evaluation (IL-12), The tumor antigen-specific immune response induced after administration compared to before Investigational Product(IP) administration was confirmed by measuring changes in the secretion of cytokines (IL-12) in serum (ELISA)., 0, 2, 8, 16 and 28 weeks|Measurement of changes in tumor marker test results (CA-125), Changes in tumor marker test results (CA-125) are measured at each time point (V4, V5, V6, V7, V8) after administration compared to before (V3) Investigational Product(IP) administration., 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 28 weeks|Evaluation of solid tumor reflection at the time of follow-up observation, Responses of target/non-target lesions evaluated by the solid tumor reflection evaluation criteria (RECIST 1.1) at the time of follow-up (V6, V8), 8 and 28 weeks
