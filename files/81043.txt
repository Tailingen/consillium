A Randomized Phase 2/3 Multi-Center Study of SM-88 in Participants With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
A prospective, open-label phase 2/3 trial in metastatic pancreatic cancer participants who have failed two lines of prior systemic therapy. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SM-88 used with MPS (methoxsalen, phenytoin and sirolimus) in pancreatic cancer and will measure multiple endpoints, including overall survival, progression free survival, relevant biomarkers, quality of life, safety, and overall response rate.

(Part 1 enrollment complete) In the initial stage of the trial (36 participants), two dose levels of SM-88's metyrosine-derivative was evaluated.

(Part 2 actively enrolling) The second part will consist of a subsequent expansion of the trial to further assess safety and efficacy of SM-88 used with MPS containing the selected SM-88 RP2D from Part 1. A total of 250 participants in the second part will be randomized 1:1 either to the SM-88 arm (125 participants) or Physician's Choice of therapy for the Control Arm (125 participants). Participants should have previously received two lines of prior systemic therapy.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: SM-88 used with MPS (methoxsalen, phenytoin, sirolimus)|DRUG: Capecitabine, Gemcitabine, and 5-FU
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the number of days between the first study drug administration and death from any cause. Results are reported in weeks., Up to 12 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression (progressive disease) or death due to any reasons whichever comes first. Disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Results are reported in weeks., Up to 12 months
