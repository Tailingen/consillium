Talquetamab & Lenalidomide as Post Stem Cell Transplant Maintenance in Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogenous plasma cell malignancy characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells and organ damage. Autologous transplantation with high dose chemotherapy is the standard of care in frontline treatment of eligible patients with MM.

This is a phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy of talquetamab with a combination of lenalidomide, and to determine the safety and longitudinal patient reported symptoms and quality of life.

Twenty participants with MM who plan to undergo or who have undergone autologous stem cell transplant as a part of their initial therapy and meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study.
