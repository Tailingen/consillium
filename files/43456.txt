The Prognostic Value of PET/CT for Tumor Progression in Patients With Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer
Investigators retrospectively collected data from consecutive patients treated at the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, from October 2020 to March 2024. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with diagnosis of metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, confirmed by PSA levels, radiographic tests and pathological information; (2) patients who underwent FDG and PSMA PET/CT prior to the initiation of medical treatment. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients who received novel hormone therapy or a prostate biopsy prior to PET/CT; (2) patients with other malignancies; (3) patients received hormone therapy without NHT; (4) patients received chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to or during novel hormone therapy; (5) absence of follow-up data at the hospital.
