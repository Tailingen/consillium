Real-world Evidence Study EvaLuating PAtient-Reported Outcomes With XERMELO
The primary objective of the study is to estimate the proportion of carcinoid syndrome (CS) patients who are satisfied with their overall symptom control, 6 months after initiating treatment with telotristat ethyl (XERMELO).
Carcinoid Syndrome
DRUG: Xermelo
Percentage of Patients Who Are Satisfied With Their Overall Symptom Control, The percentage of CS patients who are satisfied with their overall symptom control, 6 months after initiating treatment with telotristat ethyl (XERMELO). Satisfaction with how Xermelo has controlled diarrhea, flushing, and overall CS symptoms was assessed at the initial 6-month follow-up. The questionnaire allowed participants to choose a response on a 5-level Likert scale ranging from "Very dissatisfied" (level 1) to "Very satisfied" (level 5). For the assessments of satisfaction with control of diarrhea and flushing, "Not applicable" (level 0) was a response option for participants who do not have the particular symptom that is being assessed., Baseline to 6 months
Percentage of Patients Reporting Satisfaction of CS-related Diarrhea Control, Estimate percentage of patients reporting satisfaction with CS-related diarrhea control from Baseline to 6 months after starting Xermelo. At baseline participants were asked, "Currently, how satisfied are you with how your diarrhea is controlled?" At the 6-month follow-up survey, participants were asked, "Currently, how satisfied are you with how Xermelo has controlled your diarrhea?", Baseline to 6 months|Percentage of Patients Reporting Satisfaction of CS- Related Flushing Control, Estimate percentage of patients reporting satisfaction with CS-related flushing control from Baseline to 6 Months. At baseline, participants who had reported flushing as a symptom were asked, "Currently, how satisfied are you with how your flushing is controlled?" At 6 months, participants who had reported flushing as a symptom at Baseline were asked, "Currently, how satisfied are you with how Xermelo has controlled your flushing?", Baseline to 6 months|Number of Patients Reporting Reduction in Rescue SSA Use, Number of participants reporting a reduction in rescue SSA use at 6 months after initiating treatment with Xermelo., Baseline to 6 months|Percentage of Patients Reporting Reduction in the Dose of Long-acting SSA Injection, Percentage of patients reporting a reduction in the dose of long-acting SSA injection 6 months after patients initiated treatment with Xermelo, Baseline to 6 months|Percentage of Patients Reporting Reduction in the Frequency of Long-acting SSA Injection, Estimate Percentage of Patients Reporting Reduction in the Frequency of Long-acting SSA Injection 6 months after patients initiated treatment with Xermelo, Baseline to 6 months|Percentage of Patients Reporting an Overall Improvement in CS Symptom Control Based on Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Estimate percentage of patients reporting an overall improvement in CS symptom control (diarrhea, flushing, frequency of BMs) after initiating Xermelo based on Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Baseline to 6 months|Percentage Change of Patients Who Had Reduction in Work-related Absenteeism, Presenteeism, Activity Impairment, and Overall Productivity Loss From Baseline to 6 Months After Initiating Telotristat Ethyl Based on WPAI-SHP, Estimate of the percentage of patients who had reduction in work-related absenteeism, presenteeism, activity impairment, and overall productivity loss based on Worker Productivity and Activity Impairment: Specific Health Problem v2.0 (WPAI- SHP). The percentage change was measured from baseline to 6 months after treatment with telotristat ethyl., Baseline to 6 months|Percentage of Patients Reporting Weight Gain, Estimate of the percentage of patients reporting weight gain after initiating Xermelo therapy., Baseline to 6 months
This study will evaluate patient-reported outcomes for adults initiating telotristat ethyl (XERMELO) for carcinoid syndrome diarrhea (CSD) not adequately controlled by somatostatin analogs in US clinical practice. The primary objective is satisfaction with overall CS symptom control 6 months after starting XERMELO. Secondary objectives will evaluate satisfaction with control of CSD and flushing, CS symptoms, work productivity and activity impairment, SSA use, and weight. This study will provide real-world patient-reported outcomes in CS with XERMELO treatment for at least 6 months.
