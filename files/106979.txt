Time Restricted Eating in Haematological Malignancies
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if time restricted eating (TRE), a form of intermittent fasting, can impact health outcomes in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The main questions it aims to answer are:

* In patients with CLL, is there a decrease or stabilization in cancer cell counts associated with TRE compared to baseline?
* Is there a decrease in immune cell autophagy (a cellular recycling process) activity associated with TRE compared to baseline?
* Does adherence to a TRE regimen improve patient experience and quality of life?

Immune cell autophagy activity in cancer patients will be compared to a subset of control participants without cancer.

Participants will:

* Adhere to a 16/8 fasting regimen, which involves eating as normal for 8 hours per day and fasting (only consuming water, black coffee or black tea) for the remaining 16 hours. They will follow this intervention for their choice of either 3 or 6 months.
* Complete monthly blood collections
* Complete weekly journal entries to record weekly weight and timing of first and last daily meals
* Complete weekly safety check-ins with a study team member for the first 4 weeks of the study and then bi-weekly thereafter
* Complete 3 quality of life questionnaires
* Provide 3 stool samples (optional component of study)
* Complete an end of study interview (optional component of study)
Cancer|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
BEHAVIORAL: Time-Restricted Eating
Lymphocyte count, Lymphocyte count assessment will be made at pre-intervention (within 3 months of the start of the IF study period), then monthly. If participants opt for a 90-day fast, blood collections will be completed on day 1, 30, 60, 90 and one month after completion of the TRE study period, to examine if TRE had an effect on lymphocyte numbers. Participants who opt for the 180-day fast will complete blood collections on day 1, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180. Blood collected at these time points will be analyzed for autophagy activation and for changes in immune, inflammatory, metabolic and epigenetic parameters., 3 months|Autophagy Flux Analysis, Participants will provide blood samples for autophagy flux analysis., 3 months|Epigenetic Analysis, PBMC Profiling, 3 months|Microbiome Analysis, Optionally, stool samples will be collected for microbiome analysis., 3 months
Participant Experience, Descriptive statistics will characterize study participants and quality of life indicators from questionnaires., 3 months
