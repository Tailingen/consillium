Prognostic Biomarkers of Pancreatic Cancer Based on Proteomics Techniques
In this study, we will use high-throughput proteomics techniques to search for biomarkers of post-operative prognosis of pancreatic cancer in samples of patients who have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer through bioinformatics analysis.
Patients
Differentially expressed proteins in tumor and paracancer tissues, Two dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and other techniques were used to separate and compare pancreatic cancer tissues and normal adjacent tissues to search for differentially expressed proteins., 180 Days
This study plan from the affiliated hospital of Qingdao university collected 20 cases of patients with pancreatic cancer pathological tissue samples and clinical data, including clinical diagnostic information, laboratory tests, imaging examination results and other information data), through high-throughput proteomic technology in pancreatic cancer pathological finding biomarkers, the bioinformatics analysis to explore the prognosis biomarkers.
