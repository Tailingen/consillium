Tolerability/Palatability of TalityTM Synthetic Meal Replacement in Prostate Cancer
This study will find out if a meal replacement of this type is satisfying and tolerable for men with prostate cancer. Participants will receive meal replacements of TalityTM as their expected sole source of nutrition for 4 weeks. The purpose of the study is to test whether TalityTM Synthetic Meal Replacements are suitable to be used in larger studies of patients with prostate or other types of cancer.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Tality
Proportion of Completers, The proportion of participants who complete the 4 week study using TalityTM as their sole source of nutrition at a high level of adherence (75% of days, 21+ days out of the 28 day study)., 4 weeks
Change in weight from baseline, Change in weight will be measured from baseline., 4 weeks|Change in amino acid levels, Change in amino acid levels as compared to baseline will be measured. The following amino acids will be analyzed a-Aminoadipic Acid, a-Aminobutyric Acid, Alanine, Arginine, Asparagine, Aspartic Acid, b-Alanine, b-Aminoisobutyric Acid, Citrulline, Cystathionine, Cystine, Ethanolamine, Glutamic Acid, Glutamine, Glycine, Histidine, Homocystine, Hydroxyproline, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Ornithine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Sarcosine, Serine, Taurine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Tyrosine, Valine. It will be measured in micro-moles per Liter., 4 weeks|Change in Prostate Specific Antigen, Change from baseline in the serum level of prostate specific antigen (PSA)., 4 weeks
Primary Objective: Determine the appeal/tolerability/palatability of a diet consisting solely of TalityTM synthetic meal replacement in participants with prostate cancer Secondary Objective: Evaluate the effect of TalityTM on safety parameters including laboratory tests, nutritional status and adverse effects
