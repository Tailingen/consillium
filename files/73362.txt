Edible Plant Exosome Ability to Prevent Oral Mucositis Associated With Chemoradiation Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer
This study will evaluate the ability of grape exosomes, given to the subject as grape powder, as an important anti-inflammatory agent to reduce the incidence of oral mucositis during radiation and chemotherapy treatment for head and neck tumors.
Head and Neck Cancer|Oral Mucositis
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Grape extract|DRUG: Lortab, Fentanyl patch, mouthwash
Pain caused by oral mucositis, Extent of pain from oral mucositis will be evaluated weekly during treatment (6 to 7 weeks) and for six months following the completion of treatment which will last approximately 30 days., Total followup of six months
Level of immune biomarkers in blood, Levels of immune biomarkers (cytokines, T cells NK Cells CD11cIL12)in the blood at the time of completion of radiation therapy will be compared to baseline levels., Within three days of the completion of radiation therapy which will last approximately 30 days.|Level of immune biomarkers in mucosal tissue, Levels of immune biomarkers (CD3, CD8, CD11b, F4/80, BRDU)in scrapings of mucosal tissue at the time of completion of radiation therapy will be compared to baseline levels., Within three days of the completion of radiation therapy which will last approximately thirty days.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the ability of plant (grape) exosomes to prevent oral mucositis associated with chemoradiation treatment of head and neck cancer. Also, to be evaluated is the effect of grape exosomes on the production of cytokines and immune responses to tumor exosomal antigens, metabolic and molecular markers in these patients.
