Evaluation of the Impact of a Multidimensional ICT Intervention on the Quality of Life of Breast Cancer Survivors
mACMA is a pilot study that is developed for breast cancer survivors of the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. The objective of this study is to evaluate the progress in quality of life through the introduction of a mobile phone App that allows for symptom tracking, physical activity tracking and a calendar of patient-oriented events organized by patient organizations. This study is a two-arm randomized clinical trial.

This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 875351.
