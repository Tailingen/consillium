Endostatin in Combination With Chemotherapy for Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The investigators designed this study to evaluate the efficiency and the acute toxicities of recombinant human endostatin (endostar) combined with chemotherapy in the metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Effects of Chemotherapy|Stage IVC Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Recombinant Human Endostatin plus gemcitabine and cisplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine and cisplatin
progress free survival(PFS), PFS means assignment to the date of any local or distant progress of the disease using Kaplan-Meier calculate the progress free survival rates,and find out is there significant difference between these two groups., 2years after the inception assignment
overall survival(OS), the overall survival denote to assignment to date of death from any cause. Using Kaplan-Meier to calculate the 2-year ,3-year,5-year overall survival rate,and find is there any significant difference between these two groups., 1 year ,2 years and 3 years after the inception of the assignment|Adverse events, observe and record the toxicity profile(including but not limit to mucositis,liver and kidney function,et al.)according NCI-CTCAE(3rd edition) during the neoadjuvant chemotherapy ,chemoradiation and follow-up., participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay,an expected average of 100 days and every 3 months thereafter for 3 years
The quality of life assessment, According to the most commonly used questionnaire EORTC QLQ C30 and H\&N35 35 for evaluation, participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay,an expected average of 100 days and every 6 months thereafter for 3 years
To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), Acute adverse reaction of recombinant human endostatin (endostar) combined with chemotherapy to the metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
