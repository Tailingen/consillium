Multicenter Cohort Study of ESD and Chemo-radiotherapy for High-risk Early-stage Esophageal Cancer
This multicenter, prospective observational cohort study has the potential to optimize individualized chemoradiotherapy regimen for early-stage esophageal cancer patients who have received endoscopic submucosal dissection.
Esophagus Cancer
RADIATION: chemo-radiation
Incidence of toxic events, esophageal stenosis, radiation pneumonitis, etc, 2026.2
3-year overall survival, the time from randomization until death from any cause, 2029.1|3-year local-regional recurrence free survival, the time from randomization until local-regional recurrence, 2029.1
Our study can further improve the local-regional lymph nodes control rate and alleviate the toxicity of chemoradiotherapy.
