Contribution of Salivary Cortisol in the Detection of Infra-clinic Cortisol Adenoma (ACIC)
The main objective of the study is to assess the sensitivity of the salivary cortisol dosage at 23 hours compared to the serum cortisol dosage at 8 am after overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (Suppression of serum cortisol \<1.8 μg/dL ) as the reference method for the detection of ACIC in obese subjects
Obesity
OTHER: Salivary Cortisol
Number of patients with positive salivary cortisol dosage among patients with positive serum cortisol dosage, The main objective of the study is to assess the sensitivity of the salivary cortisol dosage at 23 hours compared to the serum cortisol dosage at 8 am after overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test as the reference method for the detection of ACIC in obese subjects
Number of patients with negative salivary cortisol dosage among patients with negative serum cortisol dosage, To evaluate specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and diagnostic accuracy of salivary cortisol compared to serum cortisol at 8 am after overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test|Comparing the results of salivary cortisol dosage and serum cortisol dosage, To evaluate concordance between salivary cortisol dosage and serum cortisol dosage|Comparing the results of the two salivary samples, To evaluate the concordance of the two salivary samples|Number of patients with metabolic complications of obesity among patients with ACIC, To evaluate the link between ACIC and metabolic complications of obesity (insulin resistance, IFG, type 2 diabetes, NAFLD...)|Number of patients with severe type 2 diabetes among patients with ACIC, To evaluate the relationship between ACIC and severity of type 2 diabetes, if established.
