Radiation Therapy (HB-001) by Alpha-particle Sources for Recurrent Malignant Solid Tumors in Japan
An intratumoral alpha particle based approach for cancer treatment using diffusion alpha-emitting radiation therapy (DaRT)
Breast Cancer|Head and Neck Cancer
DEVICE: HB-001
Tumor response to HB-001, Assessment of tumors response using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (Version 1.1), 9 - 11 weeks after HB-001 seed insertion
Adverse Events, The incidence, frequency, severity and causality of adverse events related to the HB-001, 12 weeks after HB-001 insertion
This will be a prospective, open label, single arm, controlled study, assessing the safety and efficacy of diffusing alpha emitters radiation therapy (DaRT) delivered through radioactive seeds inserted into the tumor. This approach combines the advantages of local intratumoral irradiation of the tumor, as used in conventional brachytherapy, with the power of the alpha radiation emitting atoms, that will be introduced in quantities considerably lower than radiation therapy already used in patients. Superficial lesions with histopathological confirmation of malignancy will be treated using DaRT seeds. Reduction in tumor size 70 days after DaRT insertion will be assessed. Safety will be assessed by the incidence, severity and frequency of all Adverse Events (AE).
