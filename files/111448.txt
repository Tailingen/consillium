A Clinical Study of TQB3107 Tablets in Patients With Malignant Tumors
TQB3107 is a protein inhibitor that induces apoptosis and inhibits the proliferation of various tumor cells. This clinical study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TQB3107 tablets in subjects with advanced malignancies, to determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (if any), and the recommended dose for Phase II (RP2D).
Advanced Cancers
DRUG: TQB3107 Tablets
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT refers to toxicities that are associated with the drug and occur from the first medication administration to the end of the first treatment cycle, as defined by the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 toxicity assessment criteria., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose at which dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred in less than 33% of patients., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Phase II Recommended Dose (RP2D), The recommended dose, determined after initial dose escalation and toxicity assessment, it is used to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug., Baseline up to 24 months
