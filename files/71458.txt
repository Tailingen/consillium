Evaluation of Treatment Efficacy According to Risk Group in Relapsed Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This study is open-label, multi-center, prospective study, which targets childhood patients with relapsed acute lymphostatic leukemia including bone marrow recurrence. Aim of this study is to investigate the outcome of NGS MRD based risk stratified treatment for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children and adolescents.
Acute Lymphoid Leukemia
DRUG: Reinduction(4weeks)|DRUG: Cosolodation 1st(3weeks)|DRUG: Consolidation 2nd(3weeks)|DRUG: Blinatumomab 1st(High Risk Group)_4 Weeks|DRUG: Blinatumomab 2nd (High Risk Group)_4 Weeks|DRUG: Blinatumomab-Salvage 1st (Very High Risk Group)_4 Weeks|DRUG: Blinatumomab-Salvage 2nd (Very High Risk Group)_4 Weeks|DRUG: Intensification course|DRUG: Maintenance(12 Weeks/Cycle)|PROCEDURE: Stem Cell Transplantation
Safety/Efficacy, Patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia are being treated after sorted into groups with their potential risk, and disease-free survival rate will be checked., through study completion, an average of 9 year
Disease-free survival rate (Blinatumomab), Blinatumomab is used before transplantation to patients with high-risk group, and then disease-free survival rate will be compared before and after, through study completion, an average of 9 year|Disease-free survival rate (standard risk), Patients with standard risk who are not eligible for allogenic stem cell transplantation are given consolidation and maintenance therapies, and disease-free survival rate will compared before and after, through study completion, an average of 9 year|Disease-free survival rate (Comparing minimal residual disease), Comparing minimal residual disease negative rate with the study before by adding blinatumomab to patients in high risk group, through study completion, an average of 9 year|Death rate related to treatment, Children and adolescents who have relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia re administered different treatments depending on their assigned groups, and disease-free survival rate will be compared before and after, through study completion, an average of 9 year|Death rate related to toxicity, Comparing remission rate and occurrence rate of toxicity during re-intervention therapy after changed schedules of idarubicin, through study completion, an average of 9 year|Toxicity rate during consolidation therapy, Checking occurence rate of toxicity related to treatment during consolidation for patients in low-risk group, through study completion, an average of 9 year
The Risk Assessment is classified as follows based on the NGS-MRD results evaluated after EOI(End of Induction).

\<Standard Risk\>

* Late (Relapse ≥ 1 year after off treatment) B-ALL marrow or Combined relapse AND
* End of induction MRD \< 0.01%

\<High Risk\>

* T-ALL marrow or combined relapse (any timing)
* All other B-ALL marrow or combined relapse cases

\<Very High Risk\>

• End of Induction BM ≥ M2 AND B -ALL marrow or combined relapse
