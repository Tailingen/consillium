Study of TRPH-222 in Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory B-Cell Lymphoma
This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label study of TRPH-222 monotherapy in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell NHL. The study will be conducted in two Stages: Dose-Escalation, Dose-Expansion.
Lymphoma|Lymphoma, B-Cell|Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin|Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell|Lymphoma, Marginal Zone|Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse|Lymphoma, Follicular
DRUG: TRPH-222
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), To determine the MTD of TRPH-222, 21 days
Evaluate incidence and severity of AEs, serious AEs, TRPH-222-related AEs, AEs leading to death or discontinuation from treatment, Safety, Up to 28 days after last dose of study drug|Tumor Activity, Assess tumor response - ORR for each NHL subtype using Lugano criteria, PFS from first dose to disease progression, OS from first dose to death, DOR for each NHL subtype assessed by Lugano, Up to 2 years|TRPH-222 Pharmacokinetics (PK), Maximum concentration of TRPH-222 (Cmax), time to Cmax, Half-life (t 1/2), Exposure (area under the curve; AUC), Total body clearance (CL), Volume of distribution (Vd), Each Cycle is 21 days. Days 1, 8, 15 of Cycle 1; Day 1 of Cycle 2 and Cycle 3; Day 1 of every third cycle thereafter; up to Day 28 after last dose of study drug; Day 60 after last dose of study drug|TRPH-222 anti-drug antibodies (ADA), Assess the incidence of subjects who develop ADA to the ADC with TRPH-222 monotherapy, Prior to treatment, prior to C3D1 and every 3rd cycle thereafter, EOT60
In Dose Escalation, patients with DLBCL, FL (including transformed FL), MZL, and MCL were to be enrolled per dose cohort. In Dose Expansion, additional response-evaluable patients were to be enrolled in NHL subtype-specific cohorts including DLBCL and FL to confirm the RP2D identified in Escalation. Each stage consisted of screening, baseline, treatment, and follow-up periods. During the treatment period, patients were to be treated indefinitely in 21 day cycles. The EOT assessments were to occur 28 and 60 days after the last study treatment.
