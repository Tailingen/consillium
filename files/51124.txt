A Phase I/II Study of XZP-3287 in Metastasis Solid Tumors
This study includes single agent/combination dose exploration study and the phase II study. The primary purpose of the dose exploration study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD)/recommended phase II dose(RP2D) of XZP-3287 and assess its safety and preliminary efficacy in solid tumor patients. The phase II study aims to explore the efficacy and safety profiles of XZP-3287 as a single- agent in hormone receptor(HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2) negative advanced breast cancer.
