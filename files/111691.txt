Under- and Overdiagnosis in BreastScreen Norway
This PhD project will describe tumour characteristics and survival associated with of under- and overdiagnosed breast cancers, the rate of overdiagnosis in BreastScreen Norway, and whether women and family doctors are aware of, and knowledgeable about, under- and overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening.

Study 1: Survival, - Overall survival, Date of diagnosis until 31 December 2017|Study 1: Survival, - Breast cancer specific survival, Date of diagnosis until 31 December 2017
Study 3: Factors associated with awareness and knowledge of overdiagnosis, Using a self-administered web-based questionnaire designed for this study, the investigators will analyse survey responses to determine whether self-reported age (categorised into 5-year age groups) is associated with awareness and knowledge of overdiagnosis. This will be done separately for women and family doctors., One day (Measurements taken once at time of survey completion)|Study 3: Factors associated with awareness and knowledge of overdiagnosis, Using a self-administered web-based questionnaire designed for this study, the investigators will analyse survey responses to determine whether self-reported formal education (none; primary school; high school; up to 4 years postsecondary; more than 4 years of postsecondary education) is associated with awareness and knowledge of overdiagnosis among women., One day (Measurements taken once at time of survey completion)
Mammographic screening among women aged 50-69 reduces breast cancer mortality but also carries some risk. This PhD project will study under- and overdiagnosis, two risks associated with mammographic screening, in BreastScreen Norway. Underdiagnosis can occur when a tumour is present but not detected as a result of screening, while overdiagnosis can occur when a woman is diagnosed with a slow growing cancer that would not become symptomatic during her lifetime.

This project will address the following topics and research questions using observational study methods.

Study 1: To determine whether tumour histopathology and survival differentially associated with potentially under- or overdiagnosed interval and screen-detected breast cancers.

* Do women with potentially underdiagnosed interval cancers have different tumour histopathology and survival than those whose interval cancers showed no signs at the prior screen?
* Do women with potentially overdiagnosed screen-detected cancer have different tumour histopathology and survival than those whose screen-detected cancer showed no signs at the prior screen?

Study 2: To estimate overdiagnosis in the screening program using individual-level data:

* What was the rate of overdiagnosis for women screened in the program during 1996-2003?
* How does adjusting for sociodemographic factors affect estimates of overdiagnosis?

Study 3: To describe awareness and knowledge about under- and overdiagnosis and breast screening in general:

* Are women aware of and knowledgeable about under- and overdiagnosis in breast screening?
* Are family doctors aware of and knowledgeable about breast screening, and under- and overdiagnosis? Are they confident in their ability to relay this information to their patients?

Study 1 is a quality improvement study and has approval from Personvernombudet (PVO 2016-4696). Study 2 has research ethics board (REK) approval (REK 2013/795), while REK approval will be sought for Study 3.
