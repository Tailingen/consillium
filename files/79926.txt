A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Web-based Platform for Cancer Pain Management
Malignant tumors are one of the major public health problems in China, and cancer pain is a common symptom in tumor patients, affecting the quality of life. In rural areas, cancer pain management is challenging due to insufficient medical resources and limitations in understanding cancer pain. Investigators plan to develop a convenient patient self-reporting applet to help participants report their symptoms to primary care physicians promptly and monitor pain levels and medication in real-time. This project aims to improve the efficiency of cancer pain management, integrate cancer pain into chronic disease management, improve the quality of healthcare services for rural participants, and promote the construction of a healthy China.
Cancer Pain
BEHAVIORAL: a patient self-reporting applet
Patient's average pain level (derived from the Brief Pain Scale), The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a validated tool for assessing pain intensity and impact on daily life.

The BPI consists of two parts: the first part assesses the intensity of pain using a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst pain; the second part assesses the impact of pain on various aspects of the patient's life (e.g., mood, work, sleep, and social activities).

The BPI is simple and easy to use, and can help healthcare professionals to quickly obtain quantitative information about pain and monitor the effectiveness of pain management., From patient enrollment to 3 months, during which time the applet was used once a week
Mood and physical state of the patient (derived from the EQ-5D scale), The EQ-5D is a brief scale used to assess an individual's health status and quality of life.The EQ-5D provides a standardized assessment of a patient's health-related quality of life. The scale consists of two parts: the first part is a self-assessment of five dimensions, including mobility, self-care, activities of daily living, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, each of which is scored on a scale ranging from "no problem," "mild problem," "moderate problem," "moderate problem," "moderate problem," "moderate problem," "moderate problem," "moderate problem," "moderate problem," "moderate problem," "moderate problem," and "moderate problem, "Moderate Problems, Severe Problems, and Extreme Problems. The second part is a visual analog scale (VAS) that assesses general health on a scale from 0 (very poor health) to 100 (optimal health)., From patient enrollment to 3 months, during which time the applet was used twice a week|Burden situation of family members (derived from the Family Support Scale), The Family Support Scale (FSS) is an instrument used to assess the level of support an individual receives in their home environment. The Family Support Scale usually contains items along multiple dimensions, such as emotional support (e.g., care and understanding), material support (e.g., material help), informational support (e.g., advice and guidance), and other relevant family interaction factors. Respondents rate their feelings and experiences of family support, usually on a Likert scale, e.g., from "completely disagree" to "completely agree.", From patient enrollment to 3 months, during which time the applet was used twice a week|Patient quality of life (derived from the QLQ-C30 core quality of life questionnaire), The C30 scale (EORTC QLQ-C30) is an instrument developed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. The scale consists of 30 entries covering the two main dimensions of functioning (e.g., physical, emotional, and social functioning) and symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue), as well as general health. Patients are scored based on how they have felt over the past week, with scores typically ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better quality of life, higher functional status, and less severe symptoms, while lower scores indicate poorer quality of life, limited functioning, and more severe symptoms.The C30 Scale is widely used in cancer research and clinical practice to monitor patients' health status and treatment outcomes., From patient enrollment to 3 months, during which time the applet was used twice a week
