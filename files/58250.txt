ABOD2011 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Progressed After Standard Systemic Therapy
Based on the activation and regulation of immune system by cytokines, mRNA encoding cytokines has become one of the important directions of mRNA tumor drug development. This product (ABOD2011) is a new generation mRNA product for intratumoral injection.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, of ABOD2011 in patients with advanced solid tumors that progressed after standard systemic therapy.
