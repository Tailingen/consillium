Evaluate the Clinical Benefit of a Post-operative Treatment Associating Radiotherapy + Nivolumab + Ipilimumab Versus Radiotherapy + Capecitabine for Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients With Residual Disease
To evaluate the clinical benefit of a post-operative adjuvant therapy combining radiotherapy + Nivolumab + Ipilimumab versus radiotherapy + Capecitabine in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Capecitabine
Disease free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first relapse (local/regional recurrence or distant metastasis) or death (from any cause) whichever comes firsts and regardless of whether the patient withdraws from randomised study treatment or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to disease relapse., At 2 years
Overall survival, Overall survival will be measured from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Local-regional recurrence, Local-regional recurrence (LRR) refers to relapse of the primary tumor site, Up to 2 years|Distant metastasis, Distant metastasis is defined as presence of any non-local metastatic sites., Up to 2 years|Disease recurrence/relapse (local or distant), Rate of patients with recurrence at 1 year and 2 year post-randomisation as well as time to recurrence will be analysed., Up to 2 years|Adverse Event, The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events based on the common toxicity criteria (CTCAE-V5.0) grade., Up to 2 years|EORTC QLQ C30, Patient reported outcomes and quality of life will be assessed using the validated following questionnaire: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ C30). The QLQ-C30 incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale. Several single-item symptom measures are also included. See scoring manual at :https://www.eortc.be/qol/files/SCManualQLQ-C30.pdf., At Baseline, every 12 weeks and 30 days after the last dose|Questionnaire EORTC QLQ BR-23, Patient reported outcomes and quality of life will be assessed using the validated following questionnaire :The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Breast-Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire. See details at :https://www.eortc.be., At Baseline, every 12 weeks and 30 days after the last dose|Questionnaire EORTC QLQ FA-12 Fatigue, Patient reported outcomes and quality of life will be assessed using the validated following questionnaire : EORTC QLQ FA-12 Fatigue.

The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Group has developed a multidimensional instrument measuring cancer-related fatigue to be used in conjunction with the quality of life core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). The module EORTC QLQ-FA12 assesses physical, cognitive, and emotional aspects of cancer-related fatigue. See details at :https://www.eortc.be., At Baseline, every 12 weeks and 30 days after the last dose|Questionnaire patient self-rating mood scale., Patient reported outcomes and quality of life will be assessed using the following questionnaire : patient self-rating mood scale., At Baseline, every 12 weeks and 30 days after the last dose|Mutational profiles, To define the molecular characteristics of the tumor' patients: Mutational profiles of tumors (Whole Exome seq,), At Baseline and in case of disease relapse up to 2 years|Copy Number alterations., To define the molecular characteristics of the tumor' patients: Copy Number alterations., At Baseline and in case of disease relapse up to 2 years|Loss of heterozygosity., To define the molecular characteristics of the tumor' patients: loss of heterozygosity., At Baseline and in case of disease relapse up to 2 years|Circulating tumor DNA, Circulating tumor DNA detection and analysis will be performed on tumor' patients., At Baseline and in case of disease relapse up to 2 years|Molecular Subtyping, To define Molecular Subtyping of TNBC (RNAseq) on tumor' patients., At Baseline and in case of disease relapse up to 2 years|Immune monitoring, To perform Immune monitoring of circulating immune cells and circulating tumor cells on blood sample., At cycle1 (each cycle is 21 days), cycle 2, cycle 5 and 24 months after randomisation or in case of relapse|Circulating growth factors, To assess levels of circulating growth factors and cytokines on blood sample., At cycle1 (each cycle is 21 days), cycle 2, cycle 5 and 24 months after randomisation or in case of relapse|Cytokines, To assess levels of cytokines on blood sample., At cycle1 (each cycle is 21 days), cycle 2, cycle 5 and 24 months after randomisation or in case of relapse|PDL1, To assess the presence in plasma of soluble PDL1., At cycle1 (each cycle is 21 days), cycle 2, cycle 5 and 24 months after randomisation or in case of relapse|PDL2, To assess the presence in plasma of soluble PDL2., At cycle1 (each cycle is 21 days), cycle 2, cycle 5 and 24 months after randomisation or in case of relapse
This trial is an open-label, randomised, multicentric, comparative, Phase II study aiming to evaluate the clinical benefit of a combined treatment associating radiotherapy + Nivolumab + Ipilimumab versus radiotherapy + Capecitabine (standard treatment) in early TNBC patients who have Residual cancer burden (RCB) II or III residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Following validation of eligibility criteria, patients will be randomised (1:1) to receive:

* Arm A: Nivolumab (360 mg IV, every 3 weeks) for 8 doses and Ipilimumab (1 mg/kg, IV, every 6 weeks or every 2 doses of Nivolumab in case of dose delays) for 4 doses.
* Arm B: Capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice a day, Bis In Die \[BID\]), 14 days on / 7 days off for 8 cycles.

In both arms, radiotherapy will be administered as per standard practice and has to be initiated one week before C1D1.
