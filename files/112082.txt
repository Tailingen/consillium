Relative Bioavailability Study of Enzalutamide in Prostate Cancer Patients
A multiple dose relative bioavailability study in patients with prostate cancer comparing a capsule and a tablet formulation of enzalutamide.
Prostate Cancer|Pharmacokinetics of Enzalutamide
DRUG: Enzalutamide tablet|DRUG: Enzalutamide capsule
Pharmacokinetic profile of Enzalutamide under fasted conditions measured by Cmax (Maximum concentration), Day 56 (fasted) Cmax under steady state conditions of enzalutamide, Day1 through Day 56 (12 samples)|Pharmacokinetic profile of Enzalutamide under fasted conditions measured by AUC0-24h (Area under the concentration-time curve 0-24h), Day 56 (fasted) AUC0-24h under steady state conditions of enzalutamide, Day1 through Day 56 (12 samples)
Pharmacokinetic profile of Enzalutamide under fasted and fed conditions, Measured by: Cmax, tmax (Time to attain Cmax), AUC0-24h, Ctrough (Trough concentration), PTR (Peak-trough ratio), CLss/F (Apparent clearance at steady state), Day 1, 8, 29, 55, 56 and 57 (38 samples)|Pharmacokinetic profile of MDPC0001 alone, MDPC0002 alone and sum of Enzalutamide plus MDPC0002, Measured by: Ctrough, Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24h, Ctrough (24h after dosing), PTR, Day 8, 29, 55, 56 and 57 (26 samples)|Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of two oral formulations of Enzalutamide assessed through vital signs, adverse events, electrocardiogram and clinical laboratory assessments, Day 1 through Day 58
