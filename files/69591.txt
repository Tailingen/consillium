Apoptotic Signaling Pathways in Rats With Endometrial Hyperplasia
The purpose of the study is to determine apoptotic signaling pathways such as Survivin, Bcl-2, Bax, c-Myc and caspase-9 expression levels in rats model with iatrogenic endometrial hyperplasia after metformin and medroxyprogesterone acetate administration.
