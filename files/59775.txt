Bevacizumab Alone Versus Dose-dense Temozolomide Followed by Bevacizumab for Recurrent Glioblastoma, Phase III
The aim of this Phase III study is to evaluate the superiority of dose-dense temozolomide (ddTMZ) followed by bevacizumab at ddTMZ failure for glioblastoma at first recurrence or progression, comparing to bevacizumab alone.

Overall survival, Overall survival will be measured from registration until death for any reason. If the patient is alive at last follow-up, the patient will be censored at the last time of confirmation of survival., Time to event. Up to 2 years from the last patient in.
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression free will be measured from registration until the first occurrence of progression or death., Time to event. Up to 2 years from the last patient in.|6-month progression-free survival (6m-PFS), Number of patients without progression at 6 months from registration divided by number of all registered, 6 months from registration|Complete response rate, Complete response rate is defined as the rate of complete response after chemotherapy in cases with measurable lesions through completion/termination of the protocol treatment., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Response rate, Response rate is defined as the rate of complete response/partial response after chemotherapy in cases with measurable lesions through completion/termination of the protocol treatment., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Adverse events, Each adverse event must be graded as the worst grade observed during the entire treatment period of each treatment protocol according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) up to 1 year., Up to 1 year after completion/termination of the protocol treatment.|Serious adverse events, Each serious adverse event must be recorded according to CTCAE v4.0 up to 1 year., Up to 1 year after completion/termination of the protocol treatment.|Progression-free survival (PFS) from bevacizumab (BEV) initiation, Progression free from BEV initiation will be measured from the day of initiation of BEV until the first occurrence of progression or death., Time to event from initiation of BEV. Up to 2 years from the last patient in.|6-month progression-free survival (6m-PFS) after initiation of bevacizumab (BEV) (Experimental Arm Only), Number of patients without progression at 6 months from the day of initiation of BEV divided by number of all second-line (BEV) treated in Experimental Arm, 6 months from initiation of BEV|Overall survival after initiation of bevacizumab (BEV), Overall survival from the day of initiation of BEV until death for any reason.

Up to 2 years from the last patient in.|MMSE non-deterioration rate, The MMSE (Mini Mental Status Examination) non-deterioration rate is calculated from the number of patients who underwent baseline MMSE evaluation prior to initiation of protocol treatment as a denominator and the number of those whose MMSE score (normal (30-24), mild decrease (23-20), intermediate decrease (19-10), severe decrease (9-0)) at 16 weeks improved or maintained from that at baseline as a numerator among all eligible patients., MMSE non-deterioration rates will be calculated at 8 and 24 weeks after initiation of protocol treatment|KPS non-deterioration rate, The KPS non-deterioration rate is calculated from the number of patients whose KPS was recorded prior to initiation of protocol treatment as a denominator and the number of those whose KPS score at 16 weeks improved or maintained from that at baseline as a numerator among all eligible patients. In case KPS is not recorded, it is considered as deterioration., KPS non-deterioration rates will be calculated at 8 and 24 weeks after initiation of protocol treatment
Glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent malignant primary brain tumor, has yet been incurable despite recent progress on its standard of care using TMZ as the main trunk of initial therapy in the newly diagnosed setting. One of the main reasons accounting for the dismal prognosis would attribute to lack of active therapeutic regimens at recurrence.

Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against cardinal angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has recently shown efficacy for recurrent GBM, and has been approved in Japan, thereby being a standard care for recurrent GBM. Since there is no effective drugs or regimens developed at bevacizumab failure, insertion of another active drug prior to bevacizumab induction would enhance survival time for patients with recurrent GBM.

In Japan, there are currently only few chemotherapeutic agents approved and available for GBM. Among them rechallenge with alternating dosing of TMZ have shown certain efficacy with acceptable toxicities for patients with TMZ-pretreated recurrent GBM, thus being a good candidate for the regimen used prior to bevacizumab at recurrence.

The present proposal of sequential administration of dose dense TMZ (7/14d) followed by bevacizumab wishes to define a new standard of care for recurrent disease and hopes to identify the subgroups of patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma that respond particularly well to dose-dense temozolomide regimens.

This study is carried out as a JCOG Brain Tumor Study Group multicenter randomized phase III trial under approval by Advanced Medical Care B system, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan.
