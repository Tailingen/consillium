Follow-up Study of SyB L-0501 in Combination With Rituximab to Treat DLBCL
This study is a follow-up study to update the survival time data (overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of response) of the subjects who received SyB L-0501 at least once in Phase III Study of SyB L-0501 in combination with rituximab to treat recurrent/relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma study (2017002) by reviewing their follow-up information following the study completion of Study 2017002.

In this study, the follow-up information gathered until the end of the investigation period is reviewed after obtaining informed consent from the subjects or their legal representatives. Accordingly, no intervention, such as administration of the investigational product or examination, will be performed.
