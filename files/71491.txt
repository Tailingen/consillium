A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Idecabtagene Vicleucel With Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy Versus Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy Alone in Adult Participants With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Who Have Suboptimal Response After Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ide-cel with lenalidomide (LEN) maintenance to that of LEN maintenance alone in adult participants with Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (NDMM) who have achieved a suboptimal response post autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).
