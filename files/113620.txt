Prospective National Cohort Evaluating Predictive Biomarkers of Resistance to Immunotherapy in Patients With MSI/dMMR Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CORESIM)
The Keynote 117 phase III trial demonstrated the superiority of pembrolizumab (anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody) versus chemotherapy +/- targeted therapy in first-line treatment of dMMR/MSI metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, primary resistance to pembrolizumab was observed in approximately 20-30% of patients treated in the Keynote 177 study. Therefore, the identification of biomarkers predictive of resistance to immunotherapy for dMMR/MSI mCRC is necessary to better select patients who benefit the most from immunotherapy, and those for whom other therapeutic approaches should be favored.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic|Microsatellite Instability-High Colorectal Cancer
Identification of predictive factors of resistance to pembrolizumab in first-line treatment of MSI and/or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer, Primary resistance will be defined as immediate progression of the disease (at the time of the first assessment, excluding pseudoprogression) Secondary resistance will be defined as progression occurring after control of the disease., 2 years
The primary endpoint is the identification of predictive factors of resistance to pembrolizumab in first-line treatment of MSI and/or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer

CORESIM is a retrospective and prospective multicenter national French cohort. National recruitment will be carried out in all French centers, including the FFCD, AGEO, GERCOR, and UNICANCER, representing more than 150 centers and most French sites, public and private hospitals.

In France, pembrolizumab for first-line treatment of patients with MSI mCRC was accessible via its compassionate use in February 2021, then its reimbursement was effective in June 2023 Patients treated with pembrolizumab will be included prospectively on the start date of the study, i.e. on February 2024; patients treated since February 2021 via compassionate use of pembrolizumab will be included retrospectively A total of 600 patients are expected. The theoretical duration of inclusion is set at 2 years. All patients will be followed up for 3 years.
