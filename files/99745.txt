Prostate Cancer Survivors and Exercise and Behavioral Counseling
This study will evaluate the feasibility of delivering a supervised physical activity program plus standard exercise counseling (SPA+EC) versus a supervised physical activity plus motivationally-enhanced behavioral counseling (SPA+BC) in prostate cancer survivors (PCS). Fifty participants (n=25) will be randomized to receiving SPA+EC or SPA+BC (n=25). We hypothesize that PCS receiving the SPA+BC intervention will result in greater increases in objectively-assessed physical activity compared with PCS receiving the SPA+EC intervention.

Objectively assessed physical activity, Objective Physical activity will be measured using an activity device, accelerometry (i.e., Actigraph GTX3+), Change in from baseline at 12 weeks
Self-reported physical activity, Self-reported physical activity will be assessed using the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Physical Function, Mobility-related fitness parameters will be measured through the six-items of the Seniors' Fitness Test., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|General quality of life, Self-reported quality of life measured via the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) for general quality of life., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Prostate-specific quality of life, Self-reported quality of life measured via the FACT-Prostate for prostate-specific quality of life., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Cancer-related fatigue, Self-reported fatigue will be assessed using the FACT-Fatigue, Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|General well-being, Self-reported Short-Form 36 will be used for assessing general well-being., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Body composition, Body composition will be estimated using anthropometric measurements will be taken - height, weight and waist circumference., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Cardiorespiratory fitness, Aerobic endurance capacity will be assessed by using the modified Balke sub-maximual exercise test., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Cognitive function, The primary set of neuropsychological assessments will be assessed using the validated NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery. This battery consists of tests to assess Executive Function, Attention, Episodic Memory, Language, Processing Speed and Working Memory., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Sexual Health, The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) will be used to assess sexual health including erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction and overall satisfaction., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Relationship quality, The Perceived Relationship Quality Components (PRQC) Inventory will be used to assess relationship quality., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Masculine self-esteem, Masculine self-esteem will be assessed using the Masculinity in Chronic Disease Inventory (MCD-I)., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Motivational outcomes, multi-process action control (M-PAC) framework assessing attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, planning, habit, and identity, Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Self-reported sedentary behavior, sitting time as measured by via self-report using the Measuring Older Adults' Sedentary Time (MOST) questionnaire which assesses sitting while watching TV, using the computer, hobbies, socializing, transportation, doing hobbies, and other activities., Change in from baseline at 12 weeks|Objectively assessed sedentary behavior, Objective measures of sitting time will be assessed using an activity device, inclinometers (i.e., ActivPALs), Change in from baseline at 12 weeks
Physical activity (PA) has a positive impact on clinical outcomes such as improvement in overall QoL, cancer-specific mortality, reducing treatment-related toxicities, and reducing fatigue across many cancer survivor groups including PCS. Despite these benefits of regular PA, the majority of PCS are still not meeting public health PA guidelines.

Short-term supervised PA programs have been shown to improve health-related fitness and patient-reported outcomes in PCS, but PA declines significantly after the supervised intervention has been completed. Research examining the effect of short- term supervised exercise programs on motivational outcomes and longer term PA among cancer survivors is limited, especially theoretical approaches to identify key motivational outcomes for behavior change.

This study will pilot a two-armed, single blind, RCT comparing SPA+EC to SPA+BC. The proposed RCT in PCS is noteworthy given that it differs from standard approaches to supervised PA with the addition of a behavioral counseling component. This rigorous comparison condition will provide further evidence that theoretically-informed interventions are needed to adopt long-term PA maintenance.

The program's supervised exercise length will be 6 weeks, followed by a tapered contact throughout the a 6-week home-based component through 'booster' behavioral counseling delivered via telephone. In terms of study measures, objective measures of PA will be used (i.e.,accelerometry, inclinometers), and cardiorespiratory fitness will be evaluated using maximal graded exercise testing via treadmill. Additional secondary outcomes include cognitive function, quality of life, physical function, body composition, motivational outcomes, sexual functioning, masculinity, sedentary behavior, and cardiorespiratory fitness.
