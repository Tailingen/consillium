A Study Comparing Pemetrexed Plus Cisplatin Versus Pemetrexed Alone in NSCLC Patients Who Have Progressed on First Line EGFR-TKI
It has not been established whether platinum-based doublets is better than single agent chemotherapy in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients who failed first-line EGFR TKI.

In this prospective trial, the investigators try to evaluate whether the progression-free survival of pemetrexed/cisplatin (PC) regimen is longer than that of pemetrexed single(P) regimen in NSCLC patients who have progressed after first line treatment of EGFR-TKI.
