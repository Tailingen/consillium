Study of AZD5991 Alone or in Combination With Venetoclax in Relapsed or Refractory Haematologic Malignancies.
This study is a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, sequential group, dose-escalation study to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ascending doses of AZD5991 in subjects with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies Part 1 of the study is monotherapy dose escalation. Closed November 2020 Part 2 of the study is monotherapy expansion groups for relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), AML/ myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and multiple myeloma (MM). Closed November 2020 Part 3 is a sequential, dose-escalation study of the combination of AZD5991 and venetoclax in subjects with relapsed/refractory AML
Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: AZD5991|DRUG: AZD5991 + Venetoclax
Incidence of Adverse Events, Number of subjects with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability including changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), safety and laboratory parameters, At every treatment and follow up visit until disease progression. Expected to be for up to 12 months|Dose limiting toxicities, Minimum observation period is 28 days per cohort|maximum tolerated dose, Minimum observation period is 28 days for the maximum dose cohort
