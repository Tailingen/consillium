The Efficacy and Safety of Lcaritin Combined With Bevacizumab and FOLFIRI in Treatment of Liver Metastases From Colorectal Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination regimen of Icaritin with bevacizumab + FOLFIRI in patients with liver metastases from advanced colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Icaritin Combined With Bevacizumab and FOLFIRI
Progression-free survival(PFS), Time between the start of the trial and the onset of (any aspect of) tumour progression or death (from any cause)., up to 5 years
Objective remission rate (ORR), The proportion of patients whose tumour volume shrinks to a pre-specified value and who are able to maintain the minimum timeframe requirement is the sum of the proportions in complete and partial remission., up to 5 years|Overall survival (OS), Time from start of trial to death (from any cause)., up to 5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Number of cases in remission (PR+CR) and stable lesions (SD) after treatment as a percentage of evaluable cases., up to 5 years|Duration of ongoing remission (DOR), The time from the start of the first assessment of the tumour as CR or PR to the first assessment of PD (Progressive Disease) or death from any cause., up to 5 years|TRAEs, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, up to 5 years|Quality of life of the patients, Quality of life of the patients will be assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Colorectal (FACT-C) questionnaire liscenced from The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy System ("FACIT System"). By using the Manual scoring template, some items are reverse scored. Subscale scores, total scores and TOI scores. The higher the score, the better the QOL., up to 5 years
At present, second-line only targeting combined with chemotherapy is the main treatment option, and the choice of treatment modality is limited, with the immunotherapy rise of immunotherapy, the mode of combining immunotherapy on the basis of existing first- and second-line chemotherapy combined with targeting is also being actively explored, but no positive results of large-scale phase III clinical studies have been reported yet. Meanwhile, there is no solution to the the problem of pro-inflammatory factor release. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the combination of a drug with a better safety profile and target-immunity synergistic effect. A combination of drugs with better safety and target-immunity synergistic effect could be considered as a safer and more effective treatment option for patients with liver metastases from advanced colorectal cancer.
