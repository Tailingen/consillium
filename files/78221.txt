Survey of Optical Values of the Breast Using Radiation-Free Pressure-Free Optical Scanning
The purposes of this study is to establish normal optical values of breast tissue in the general population. This will allow for establishing normals for breast composition, and is expected to be useful in the classification of breast lesions into groups such as cysts, benign growths, inflammatory lesions, and possibly early breast cancer.
