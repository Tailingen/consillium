Alemtuzumab and CHOP in T-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to determine efficacy and safety of the monoclonal antibody MabCampath® (alemtuzumab) combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of T-cell lymphoma.
Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral
DRUG: CHOP14 chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristin, prednison) plus G-CSF, combined with alemtuzumab|DRUG: CHOP14 chemotherapy (see specification under Arm B) plus G-CSF
Event-free Survival, The EFS is defined by the time between day of randomization until an event occurs, up to 96 months
Overall survival, From the time of randomisation to date of last follow-up or death, up to 96 months|Overall response rate, from date of randomization to date of primary response assessment, up to 96 months|Overall response rate related to the CD52 expression, From date of randomization to date of primary response assessment, up to 96 months|Tumor control or time-to-progression, time of randomization to last follow-up or time of disease progression, up to 96 months|Safety measured as number of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), from randomization to closure of study, up to 96 months|Feasibility of successful stem cell harvest i.e. >/=2E6 CD34 positive cells, from start of priming regimen to time of assessment of stem cell harvest, up to 96 months
First International phase III T-cell lymphoma study Indication:Newly diagnosed non-cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma Study objectives:Determination of the efficacy and safety of the monoclonal antibody MabCampath® (alemtuzumab) combined with two-weekly CHOP supported by G-CSF Primary Endpoint: Event-Free-Survival (EFS) Study Design: International open-label, multicentre, randomized Phase III Study

Study Medication: Patients are randomized to six cycles of two-weekly CHOP plus G-CSF with or without alemtuzumab given subcutaneously 30 mg day 1 in combination with chemotherapy cycles 1-4. Patients in CR, CRu and PR after the 6 cycles of CHOP14 combined or not with alemtuzumab will receive a consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.

Patient Population: Patients \> 18 yrs with newly diagnosed non-cutaneous, non-leukemic PTCL, except alk-protein positive and negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma Planned Sample Size: 308 young patients (18-60 yrs) registered and randomized Total Number of Centers: This study will be proposed to main European and Australian Study Groups.
