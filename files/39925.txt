A Study of LGK974 in Patients With Malignancies Dependent on Wnt Ligands
The primary purpose of this study was to find the recommended dose of LGK974 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001 that can be safely given to adult patients with selected solid malignancies that had progressed despite standard therapy or for which no effective standard therapy existed.

DRUG: LGK974|BIOLOGICAL: PDR001
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first cycle of LGK974 treatment and during the first 2 cycles of LGK974 in combination with PDR001, DLT is defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value that is assessed by the investigator as unrelated to disease, disease progression, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medications and that meets the criteria defined in the study protocol.

The objective was to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE) of LGK974 as a single agent and in combination with PDR001 when administered orally to adult patients with malignancies dependent on Wnt ligands., 28 days (LGK974 single agent) and 56 days (LGK974 in combination with PDR001)
Type and category of study drug related adverse events (AE), The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (new or worsening from baseline) will be summarized by primary system organ class, severity based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03, type of AE, relationship to study drug by dose group., 61 months|Absorption and plasma concentrations of LGK974, Evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as AUClast, AUCtau, Cmax, the apparent elimination T1/2 and Racc for LGK974 and its pharmacologically metabolite., 61 months|PD related to the Wnt pathway, Assessing percent change from baseline to post-treatment of PD related to the Wnt pathway., 61 months|Overall response rate of tumor, Patients with an Overall Response Rate(ORR), complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) rate and duration of response (DOR) assessed by RECIST 1.1 for single agent LGK974 and by RECIST1.1 and irRC for LGK974+PDR001., 61 months|Absorportion and plasma concentrations of PDR001, Evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as AUClast, AUCtau, Cmax, the apparent elimination T1/2 and Racc for LGK974, its pharmacologically metabolite and PDR001., 61 months
This open-label multicenter phase 1 dose escalation study was the first to administer LGK974 as a single agent or in combination with PDR001 in humans.

The study comprised of 2 parts: a dose escalation of LGK974 as a single agent, followed by a safety expansion in specific disease indications; and a dose escalation of LGK974 in combination with PDR001, followed by a safety expansion in cutaneous melanoma.
