The goal of this clinical trial is to prove that the combination of acupuncture therapy and standard therapy is more effective in reducing anxiety and improving the quality of life of cancer patients. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Can the combination of manual acupuncture and standard therapy reduce anxiety based on Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) scores in cancer patients compared to the sham acupuncture and standard therapy group?
2. Can the combination of manual acupuncture and standard therapy improve the quality of life of cancer patients based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C-30 (EORTC-QLQ C30) compared to the sham acupuncture and standard therapy group?

Participants will:

Get manual acupuncture therapy and also standard therapy, such as oral Benzodiazepin and supportive psychotherapy or sham acupuncture therapy and the standard therapy (Benzodiazepin and supportive psychotherapy) every day for 6 days.

Researchers will compare the changes of anxiety scores and quality of life between cancer patients who received manual acupuncture therapy and standard therapy, and cancer patients who received sham acupuncture and standard therapy.
