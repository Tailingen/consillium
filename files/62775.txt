GEN-001 (Live Biotherapeutic Product) and Avelumab Combination Study for Patients With Solid Tumors Who Have Progressed on Anti-PD-(L)1 Therapy
This is a phase I/Ib, first-in-human (FIH), open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, biological and clinical activities of GEN-001 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have progressed on at least two lines of approved therapy for their histological subtypes which includes an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 based therapy (as mono or combination), when administered as combined with avelumab.
