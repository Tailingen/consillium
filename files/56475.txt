A Phase III Clinical Study of Napabucasin (GB201) Plus FOLFIRI in Adult Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase III study of Napabucasin plus bi-weekly FOLFIRI (Arm 1) vs. Napabucasin (Arm 2) for adult patients with metastatic CRC who have failed standard chemotherapy regimens. For patients who have failed bevacizumab with irinotecan-based chemotherapies (treatment failure is defined as radiologic progression of disease during or within 3 months following the last dose), bevacizumab maybe administered in combination with FOLFIRI to patients randomized to Arm 1.
Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Napabucasin|DRUG: Fluorouracil|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Irinotecan
Overall Survival (OS), To assess the effect of Napabucasin plus biweekly FOLFIRI versus Napabucasin on the Overall Survival of patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer., 43 months
Progression free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from randomization to the first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause., 43 months|Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response or partial response (CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1., 43 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 1.1., 43 months|Number of Patients with Adverse Events, All patients who have received at least one dose of Napabucasin will be included in the safety analysis according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0. The incidence of adverse events will be summarized by type of adverse event and severity., 43 months|Quality of Life (QoL), QoL will be measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) in patients with pretreated metastatic CRC treated with Napabucasin plus biweekly FOLFIRI versus Napabucasin., 43 months|Overall Survival in biomarker positive patients, To assess the effect of Napabucasin plus FOLFIRI versus Napabucasin on the Overall Survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in biomarker positive patients. This biomarker-positive sub-population is defined as those patients with phospho-STAT3/nuclear β-catenin positivity on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) archival tissue., 43 months|Progression Free Survival in biomarker positive patients, Defined as the time from randomization to the first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. This biomarker-positive sub-population is defined as those patients with nuclear β-catenin and/or phospho-STAT3 positivity on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) archival tissue., 43 months|Objective Response Rate in biomarker positive patients, Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response or partial response (CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1. This biomarker-positive sub-population is defined as those patients with nuclear β-catenin and/or phospho-STAT3 positivity on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) archival tissue.Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response or partial response (CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1.
