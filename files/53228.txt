Correlation Between Elastic Modulus of Ultrasonic Shear Wave and Tumor Stromal Component in Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic cancer is a gastrointestinal tumor with a high degree of malignancy. Currently, there are many first-line chemotherapy regimens in clinical practice, but the individual selection of chemotherapy regimens has not been unanimously recognized.This study is aimed at exploring the correlation between the two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D - SWE) parameters and pancreatic cancer stromal elements proportion through an ultrasound scan for resectable pancreatic cancer cases and postoperative pathological specimen analysis. Then determine if the pancreatic cancer two-dimensional shear wave elastography can guide clinicians selecting chemotherapy scheme by predicting tumor stromal elements .These results are expected to provide an effective non-invasive diagnostic basis for individualized treatment of pancreatic cancer.
