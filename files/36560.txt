Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Avelumab|OTHER: Chemoradiation
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1 (RECIST v1.1) as Assessed by Investigator, PFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the first documentation of objective progressive disease (PD) per modified RECIST v1.1 as assessed by Investigator or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first. Analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier method. PD refers to any of following: 1) Locoregional PD confirmed by pathology to verify radiographic changes represent true tumor progression and not radiation effects or non-malignant contrast enhancement. 2) Locoregional clinically detectable progression confirmed by pathology. 3) Surgical removal (salvage) of primary tumor with tumor present on final pathology. 4) Salvage neck dissection greater than (\>) 20 weeks after completion of CRT with tumor present on final pathology. 5) Metastatic PD. PFS data was censored on date of last adequate tumor assessment for participants with no PFS event., From randomization until documented PD or death, censored date, whichever occurred first (up to 37 months)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants last known to be alive were censored at date of last contact. Analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier method., From randomization to the date of death or censored date, whichever occurred first (up to 37 months)|Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate in Participants With Salvage Surgery at the Primary Site, pCR was defined as the absence of histologically identifiable residual cancer in any resected specimen. The pCR rate at primary site was estimated by dividing the number of participants with pCR recorded at any visit from randomization until PD per modified RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause by the number of participants randomized who had salvage surgery at the primary site., From randomization until PD or death (up to 37 months)|Time to Locoregional Failure Per Modified RECIST v1.1 as Assessed by Investigator, Locoregional failure was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of locoregional recurrence or death due to any cause per modified RECIST v1.1 as assessed by Investigator, whichever occurred first. Analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier method., From the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of locoregional recurrence or death, whichever occurred first (up to 37 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Modified RECIST v1.1 as Assessed by Investigator, Objective response (OR) was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1 recorded from randomization until disease progression per modified RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause. A participant was considered to have achieved an OR if the participant had a CR or PR which did not need to be confirmed at a subsequent assessment. CR for target disease: complete disappearance of all target lesions with the exception of nodal disease. All target nodes must decrease to normal size (short axis less than \[\<\] 10 millimeter \[mm\]). CR for non-target disease: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. All lymph nodes must be 'normal' in size (\<10 mm short axis) . PR: Greater than or equal to (\>=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. The ORR was estimated by dividing the number of participants with OR (CR or PR) by the number of participants randomized., From randomization until disease progression or death, whichever occurred first (up to 37 months)|Time to Distant Metastatic Failure Per Modified RECIST v1.1 as Assessed by Investigator, Time to distant metastatic failure or distant metastasis (DM) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of distant metastatic or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Distant metastatic disease was defined as new tumor identified at a site distant from the head and neck anatomic region or draining lymph nodes. Analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier method., From the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of distant metastatic or death (up to 37 months)|Duration of Response (DOR) Per Modified RECIST v1.1 as Assessed by Investigator, DOR:time from first documentation of objective tumor response (CR/PR) to first documentation of PD/death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.PR:\>=30% decrease under baseline of sum of diameters of all target measurable lesions. CR for target disease:complete disappearance of all target lesions with exception of nodal disease.CR for non-target disease: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels. PD is any of following:1)Locoregional PD confirmed by pathology to verify radiographic changes denote true tumor progression and not radiation effects or non-malignant contrast enhancement.2)Locoregional clinically detectable progression confirmed by pathology.3)Surgical removal of primary tumor with tumor present on final pathology.4)Salvage neck dissection \>20 weeks after completion of CRT with tumor present on final pathology.5)Metastatic PD. DOR data was censored on date of last adequate tumor assessment for participants with no overall response., From the first documentation of objective tumor response to the first documentation of PD or death or censored date, whichever occurred first (up to 37 months)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) as Graded by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTCAE), Version 4.03, Adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. As per NCI-CTCAE version 4.03, severity was graded as Grade 1: asymptomatic/mild symptoms, clinical/diagnostic observations only, intervention not indicated; Grade 2: moderate, minimal, local/noninvasive intervention indicated, limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily life (ADL); Grade 3: severe/medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4: life-threatening consequence, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE.
