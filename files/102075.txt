A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of JCAR017 in Adult Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)
This is a global Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicohort, multicenter study to evaluate efficacy and safety of JCAR017 in adult subjects with r/r FL or MZL.

The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

This study is divided into three periods:

* Pretreatment, which consists of screening assessments, leukapheresis and the Pretreatment evaluation;
* Treatment, which starts with the administration of lymphodepleting (LD) chemotherapy and continues through JCAR017 administration at Day 1 with follow-up through Day 29;
* Posttreatment, which includes follow-up assessments for disease status and safety for 5 years.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: JCAR017
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Is defined as the percentage of participants achieving either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) at any time up to 60 months after JCAR017 treatment as assessed by PET-CT and/or CT using "The Lugano classification", Up to 60 months
Complete response rate (CRR) as assessed but PET-CT and/or CT using "The Lugano Classification", Is defined as the percentage of subjects achieving a CR at any time up to 60 months after JCAR017 treatment, Up to 60 months|Duration of Response (DOR) if Best Overall Response (BOR) is CR, as assessed by PET-CT and/or CT using "The Lugano Classification", is defined for subjects with a BOR of CR as the time from first response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death from any cause up to 60 months after JCAR017 treatment, Up to 60 months|Duration of Response (DOR) as assessed by PET-CT and/or CT using "The Lugano Classification", is defined as the time from first response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first up to 60 months after JCAR017 treatment, Up to 60 months|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by PET-CT and/or CT using "The Lugano Classification", is defined as the time from start of JCAR017 to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first up to 60 months after JCAR017 treatment, Up to 60 months|Overall Survival (OS), is defined as the time from start of JCAR017 to time of death due to any cause up to 60 months after JCAR017 treatment, Up to 60 months|Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE., Up to 60 months|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax, Maximum concentration, Up to 60 months|Pharmacokinetics - Tmax, Time to maximum concentration, Up to 60 months|Pharmacokinetics - AUC, Area under the curve, Up to 60 months|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life C30 questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), is questionnaire that will be used as a measure of health-related quality of life.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single item measures. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scale, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale., Up to 24 months|Functionality Assessment of Cancer Therapy Lymphoma Subscale (FACT-LymS), is a 15-item lymphoma-specific additional concerns subscale. This subscale addresses symptoms and functional limitations are important to lymphoma patients. The FACT-LymS items are scored on a 0 ("Not at all") to 4 ("Very much") response scale. Items are aggregated to a single score on a 0-60 scale. High scores indicate lower symptom burden., Up to 24 months
