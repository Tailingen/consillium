A Single-arm, Multicenter Clinical Study of Fruquintinib Combined With Cadonilimab Injection and Temozolomide in Second-line and Subsequent Treatment of Advanced Melanoma
This single-arm, multicenter clinical study enrolled patients with advanced malignant melanoma who had failed previous first-line therapy (cutaneous melanoma patients were excluded), and patients with BRAF V600 mutations required targeted therapy.
Malignant Melanoma
DRUG: Temozolomide、Fruquintinib、Cadonilimab
ORR（objective response rate）, Defined as percentage of participants achieving assessed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) by the investigator according to the RECIST 1.1., 5 months
OS Overall survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, two years|DCR Disease control rate, From date of randomization until the end of treatment or the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first,, two years|PFS Progression-free survival, PFS were defined as from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, 5 months|Safety, Adverse events as assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0overall incidence of adverse events (AE); incidence of grade 3 or higher AE; incidence of severe adverse events (SAE); incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of drug use; incidence of AEs leading to suspension of drug use, two years
Combination treatment period:

Fruquintinib: 4mg d1-21, po qd q4w;

Cadonilimab 6mg/kg, ivgtt q2w;

Temozolomide: 150\~200mg/m2, poqd, d1-5, q4W;

The combined treatment lasted 6 cycles.

Maintenance treatment:

Fruquintinib: 4mg d1-21, po qd q4w;

Cadonilimab 6mg/kg, ivgtt q2w;

The maximum duration of maintenance treatment is not more than 2 years.

The study was divided into three stages: screening period, treatment period and follow-up period. The treatment period is a treatment cycle every 4 weeks. During the treatment period, imaging methods will be used to evaluate the tumor status every 8 weeks (±7 days) until the patient's disease progresses (RECIST 1.1) or death (during the treatment of the patient) or toxicity becomes intolerable. The tumor treatment status and survival status of the patient after disease progression should be recorded.

Safety indicators include adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and changes in electrocardiogram and cardiac ultrasound.
