First in Human Study of IBI308 in Chinese Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of IBI308 monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with certain types of advanced solid tumors. Another purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of IBI308.

This is a study which consists of phase 1a study (dose escalation stage) and phase 1b study (expansion stage). Phase 1a study will adopt the classical 3+3 dose escalation design, exploring safety and tolerance of 4 dose cohorts (1mg/kg, 3mg/kg, 200mg and 10mg/kg) and determining the recommended dose for phase 1b study. Phase 1b is expansion study of 8 cohorts which will evaluate anti-tumor efficacy and safety of eight IBI308 monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. Cohort A is IBI308 monotherapy for advanced melanoma. Cohort B is IBI308 monotherapy for advanced digestive system carcinoma or neuroendocrine neoplasm after failure or intolerance of first line standard therapy. Cohort C is IBI308 monotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure or intolerance of first line standard therapy. Cohort D is IBI308 in combination with cisplatin and pemetrexed for treatment na誰ve locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. Cohort E is IBI308 in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for treatment-na誰ve locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic squamous NSCLC. Cohort F is IBI308 in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine for treatment na誰ve locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Cohort G is IBI308 in combination with etoposide and cisplatin for treatment na誰ve locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic high grade(G3) neuroendocrine tumor. Cohort H is IBI308 in combination with irinotecan and 5-FU for advanced high grade(G3) neuroendocrine tumor after failure of first line standard therapy. Phase 1a and 1b consist of screening period (28 days before enrollment), treatment period and follow up period (every 3 months until death or the end of study). In phase 1a, dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be recorded for up to 28 days after the 1st dose of IBI308. Efficacy will be evaluated by RECIST v1.1. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Further exploration of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity information will be assessed throughout the trial.
