Efficacy of HAD Induction With Intensified Cytarabine in Newly-diagnosed CEBPA Double Mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Acute myeloid leukemia is a heterogenous hematological malignancy, characterized by different cytogenetic or molecular features. CEBPA double mutation acute myeloid leukemia （CEBPAdm AML）has favourite prognosis, especially in younger adult patients. But cumulative incidence of relapse of this group patients is still high, so the treatment options need to be optimized urgently.HAD(homoharringtonine(HHT)+cytarabine+daunorubicin) with intermediate dose cytarabine improved the survival of AML, especially in patients with CEBPA double mutation.

DRUG: HAD induction with intermediate dose cytarabine
event free survival, Measured from day 1 of randomization to the date of treatment failure, hematologic relapse from CR or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, 5 years|relapse free survival, survival from complete remission to relapse, 5 years
complete remission rate, incidence of complete remission after induction chemotherapy, 2.5 years|early mortality, death during 30 days from induction chemotherapy, 2.5 years|overall survival, duration from enrollment to death or loss of followup, 5 years|RFS cencored at stem cell transplantation, RFS cencored at the date of stem cell transplantation, 5 years
In this phase 2 study, 40 patients will be enrolled and treated with HAD induction regimen. High dose cytarabine will be given after complete remission achieved. The primary endpoint was event-free and relapse-free survival. Genetic mutations and measurable residual disease (MRD) will be detected at diagnosis and after chemotherapy. The risk stratification according to genetic mutations and MRD will also be explored.
