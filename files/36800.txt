Maintenance Therapy for Small-cell Lung Cancer
This study involves patients treated with cisplatin and etoposide (induction therapy), followed by treatment with a drug called S1 (maintenance therapy). The main purpose of this study is to determine if this type of treatment will delay the growth of the tumor and if so, for how long. The primary endpoint is progression free survival and second endpoints are toxicities, overall survival.
Progression Free Survival
DRUG: cis Platinum, etoposide, S1
The progression-free survival in this population of patients, The progression-free survival of the enrolled patients from start the combination treatment with cisplatin, etoposide and S1, 2.5 years
Percentage of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), Adverse events were recorded and classified from start the treatment by grade according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0, 2.5 years|The overall survival in this population of patients., The overall survival of the enrolled patients from start the combination from start the combination treatment with cisplatin, etoposide and S1, 2.5 years
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 20% of lung cancer, has a high degree of malignancy, short doubling time, early and widespread metastasis, is sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and has a high initial response rate, but is prone to secondary drug resistance and relapse. The treatment is mainly based on systemic chemotherapy, and if maintenance therapy with S1 after standard EP regimen induction therapy could prolong progression free survival.
