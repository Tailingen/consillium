A Single-arm, Multicenter Study to Assess the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of P1101 in Adults With ET
A Single-arm, Multicenter Study to Assess the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (P1101) in Adult Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia
Essential Thrombocythemia
DRUG: Ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (P1101)
To assess efficacy of ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (P1101) in adult USA/Canadian patients with ET, Efficacy will be based on peripheral blood count remission as defined by hematocrit (HCT) \<45%, white blood cell (WBC) count ≤10 × 109/L, and platelets (PLT) ≤ 400 × 109/L in at least 80% of bi-weekly measurements for a consecutive 32-wek period during the 52-week core study treatment period., 12 months
PharmaEssentia is developing a pegylated (PEG) IFN-α product, P1101, for the treatment of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) as lack of disease modifying therapies in essential ET constitutes a serious issue in modern hematology.

Ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (P1101) may represent an effective, well-tolerated treatment with the ability to provide a deeper response and superior control of important blood parameters with the potential to alter the course of the disease and prevent progression to post-ET myelofibrosis (MF) and/or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (P1101) is currently being evaluated in comparison to ANA in the ongoing global Phase 3 clinical study, SURPASS ET.

Enrolled patients will receive P1101 over 13 months followed by an extension period.
