Study to Assess the Effect of Itraconazole (a CYP3A4 Inhibitor) on the Pharmacokinetics of AZD9291, in Patients With EGFR Positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. Patients Will be Chosen From Those Who Have Already Been Prescribed an EGFR TKI Medicine (Such as Iressa or Tarceva)
This is a 2 part study in patients with EGFRm+ non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose disease has progressed on an EGFRm TKI, who are refractory or resistant to standard therapy. Part A will assess the effect of multiple oral doses of itraconazole on the single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of AZD9291. On completion of Part A, patients may continue to take AZD9291 tablets (Part B) following the collection of the 216 hour sample on Day 19 if they and the Investigator deem it appropriate, until such time as their disease progresses, the Investigator believes they are no longer deriving clinical benefit, or they stop taking AZD9291 for any other reason
