Bortezomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant
This phase II trial studies how well giving bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone together works in treating patients with multiple myeloma undergoing stem cell transplant. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone together may kill more cancer cells.

CONSOLIDATION: Patients receive bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VLD) therapy comprising bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14, and dexamethasone PO or IV on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. Courses continue for 28 days and repeat every 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

In between courses of VLD, patients receive Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (LD) therapy comprising lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-21 and dexamethasone PO QD or IV every Monday (x3). Courses continue for 28 days.

MAINTENANCE: Starting in the third year of therapy, patients receive lenalidomide PO QD on days 1-14 and dexamethasone PO QD or IV every Monday (x2). Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
