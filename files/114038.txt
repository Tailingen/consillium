Characterization of Methylation Patterns in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study is being performed as part of the development process of the Liver EpiCheck test which includes the identification of different methylation profiles in HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) patients compare to cancer free control in blood samples
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Hepatocellular Cancer|Cirrhosis
PROCEDURE: Blood collection
To collect blood samples and clinical data in order to characterize methylation patterns that will discriminate between HCC and normal hepatic tissue, To collect blood samples and clinical data in order to characterize methylation patterns that will discriminate between HCC and normal hepatic tissue, 60 months|To develop a molecular blood test that will be able to detect HCC based on change in methylation patterns between HCC and normal hepatic tissue, To develop a molecular blood test that will be able to detect HCC based on change in methylation patterns between HCC and normal hepatic tissue, 60 months
Liver EpiCheck Performance, To assess the performance of the Liver EpiCheck in terms of (1) Sensitivity (2) Specificity (3) NPV(negative predictive value) and (4) PPV (positive predictive value), 60 months
This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study aimed to collect blood samples and de-identified clinical data from subjects diagnosed with HCC (cases arm) and subjects with high risk for HCC which are undergoing routine surveillance for HCC.
