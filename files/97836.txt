OS will be captured using summary statistics (mean, SD, median, IQR, minimum and maximum), which will be used to describe time from diagnosis to death, time from enrollment to death, time from index novel MCL treatment to death and time from second treatment (if applicable) to death. Kaplan-Meier curves will be used to graphically show patient survival., 24 to 60 months
The frequency of adverse events (AEs) in patients with MCL, where the term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs., The frequency of patients with AEs will be tabulated from the start of index novel MCL treatment. AEs (both in terms of the MedDRA Preferred Terms (PTs) and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\] grade) will be listed individually by patient and described by System Organ Class (SOC) and PT., 24 to 60 months|The proportion of adverse events (AEs) in patients with MCL, where the term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs., The proportion of patients with AEs will be calculated from the start of index novel MCL treatment.

This study will collect patient perceptions of HRQoL based on PRO measures in patients with MCL by collecting the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) on a quarterly basis. The EORTC QLQ-C30 has a recall/observation period during the past week. The questionnaire uses a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1: "Not at all" to 4: "Very much," and scores by dimension range from 0 to 100., 24 to 60 months|Tabulate HRQoL responses for the three selected, validated PRO-CTCAE PRO measures in patients with MCL, Descriptive statistics for each validated PRO will include continuous measures (mean, median, SD, IQR, minimum, and maximum) or achievement of a particular threshold (frequency and proportion), if applicable. This study will collect patient perceptions of HRQoL by collecting the PRO version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) (3 questions regarding muscle pain, joint pain, heart palpitations) on a quarterly basis. The PRO-CTCAE is intended for individuals 18 years or older and has a recall of the past 7 days. Responses to each question are scored from 0 to 4 (in order of increasing frequency and severity)., 24 to 60 months|Tabulate HRQoL responses for the validated PRO EuroQoL 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) in patients with MCL, Descriptive statistics for each validated PRO will include continuous measures (mean, median, SD, IQR, minimum, and maximum) or achievement of a particular threshold (frequency and proportion), if applicable. This study will collect patient perceptions of HRQoL based on PRO measures in patients with MCL by collecting the EQ-5D-5L on a quarterly basis. This questionnaire is comprised of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) and 1 visual analog scale used to assess a patient's self-rated health. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions. Each health state is referred to in terms of a 5-digit code., 24 to 60 months
Newer targeted therapies (monotherapy or in combination with other agents) have been recently approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least 1 prior therapy. The approval of these newer therapies will have an impact on the treatment patterns, toxicity patterns, and outcomes in the MCL population. A prospective, observational study will help to better understand the evolving real-world treatment outcomes (including treatment patterns, reasons for discontinuation/dose reduction, treatment interruption or treatment switches), physician-reported clinical outcomes, and patient-reported symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients diagnosed with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) who newly initiated a novel therapy in the past 6 months and whose treatment is ongoing at the time of enrollment.
