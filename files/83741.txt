MicroOrganoSphere (MOS) Drug Screen Pilot Trial in Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility of generating sufficient MicroOrganoSpheres (MOS) from a biopsy of a subject's adenocarcinoma of the colon and/or rectum that is metastatic to the liver and completing a drug screen against patient-derived MOS using standard of care drugs used in the treatment of colorectal cancer (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 5-FU/capecitabine (Xeloda), bevacizumab, panitumumab or cetuximab, trifluridine/tipiracil (Lonsurf), regorafenib and pembrolizumab or nivolumab) in ≤ 14 days.
