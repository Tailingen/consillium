Study Comparing Pathological Responses Observed on Colorectal Cancer Metastases Resected After Preoperative Bevacizumab With FOLFOX or FOLFIRI.
The study is designed to analyze the pathological tumor response on resected colorectal cancer metastases after preoperative treatment with bevacizumab combined with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI regimen in a prospective cohort and to correlate this response with patient's outcome.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Metastases resection|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: 5 FU|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Irinotecan
the major pathological response rate, This is at the surgery time. The metastases resection must be process after 6 cycles of randomized chemotherapy + target therapy. It depend but it will be normally 3 months after patient inclusion in the study, After surgery (Metastases resection-average 3 months)
Progression free survival, at 6 months and at 12 months after randomization|Overall Survival, The overall survival will be analyzed at the end of the study (3 years of recruitment and one years of follow-up), At the end of the study|Clinical Response Rate, At time of surgery - average 3 months|Metabolic Response Rate, At time of surgery - Average 3 months|Post operative complication, One month after surgery
This is a phase II , openlabel, randomized study in patients with confirmed diagnosis of resectable metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma , who have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. The study is designed to compare pathological responses observed after pre-operative chemotherapy bevacizumab with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI.
