A Phase 1 Study of CD22-CAR TCell Immunotherapy for CD22+ Leukemia and Lymphoma
Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia often develop resistance to chemotherapy and some patients who relapse following CD19 directed therapy relapse with CD19 negative leukemia. For this reason, the investigators are attempting to use T-cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to CD22, a different protein from CD19, expressed on the surface of the leukemic cell in patients with CD22+ leukemia. The CAR enables the T-cell to recognize and kill the leukemic cell through the recognition of CD22, a protein expressed on the surface of the leukemic cell in patients with CD22+ leukemia. This is a Phase 1 study designed to determine the safety and feasibility of the CAR+ T - cells and the feasibility of making enough to treat patients with CD22+ leukemia.
Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Patient-derived CD22-specific CAR T-cells also expressing an EGFRt
The adverse events associated with one or multiple CAR T-cell product infusions will be assessed, The type, frequency, severity, and duration of adverse events will be summarized, 30 days|The number of successfully and unsuccessfully manufactured and infused CAR T-cell products will be assessed, Proportion of products successfully manufactured and infused, 28 days
