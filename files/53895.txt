Pembrolizumab as Neoadjuvant Treatment in HCC
The aim of this study is to elucidate the utility of the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in preventing the recurrence of HCC when administered before and after curative surgery or ablation.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab
One-year recurrence-free survival rate, One-year recurrence-free survival rate is defined as the recurrence-free survival rate 1year after curative treatment., 1 year after curative treatment
Recurrence free survival, Recurrence-free survival is defined as the length of time from the date of confirmation of complete cure to the earliest of the following: the date when recurrence is diagnosed or the date of death due to any cause., From the date of enrollment until the date of first recurrence or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, up to 72 weeks.|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the length of time from the date of confirmation of complete cure to the date of death due to any cause., From date of enrollment until the date of death from any cause, up to 72 weeks.|Objective response rate after neoadjuvant phase, Tumor assessment in accordance with RECIST1.1 will be performed after neoadjuvant administration., Evaluation period is just before curative treatment, up to 4 weeks.|Tumor markers, Baseline levels of tumor markers including AFP, AFP-L3, and PIVKA-II and changes in their levels will be exploratory investigated in relation to the therapy efficacy., From the date of enrollment until the date of last administration of study drug, up to 72 weeks.|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], The safety endpoints of this study are the safety of pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy in patients with HCC. To determine the safety of the drug, the degree of toxicity is evaluated in accordance with the CTCAE (version 4.0)., From the date of enrollment until the date of last administration of study drug, thereafter up to 4 months
Each subject will participate in the trial from the time he or she signs the informed consent form until the final contact. After a screening phase of up to 28 days, each subject will receive administration of pembrolizumab 200mg IV once only before curative treatment such as hepatic resection or radiofrequency ablation, and will receive curative treatment after administration of pembrolizumab. After curative treatment, each subject will receive pembrolizumab 200mg IV every 3 weeks. Treatment will continue until tumor recurrence, occurrence of an unacceptable adverse event, or the 16th treatment with pembrolizumab.( The setting of 16 times administration is the period of adjuvant therapy of this trial is 12 month(=48weeks), administration of pembrolizumab is Q3W, so 16 times administration comes to 48 weeks.) Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than tumor recurrence will have post-treatment follow-up visits for monitoring disease status until tumor recurrence, until initiation of non-study cancer treatment, until withdrawal of consent for study participation, or until becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed for overall survival until death, withdrawal of consent for study participation, or the end of the study, whichever comes first. After the end of trial treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for adverse event monitoring. Serious adverse events will be collected for 90 days after the end of treatment or for 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.
