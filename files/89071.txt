A Study of Talazoparib With or Without Enzalutamide in People With Prostate Cancer Who Have Previously Received Abiraterone Acetate
The purpose of this study is to find out whether talazoparib in combination with enzalutamide or talazoparib alone delays cancer progression in people with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have homologous recombination repair (HRR) mutations and have previously received abiraterone acetate.

DRUG: Talazoparib with enzalutamide|DRUG: Talazoparib
radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), To compare the efficacy of talazoparib + enzalutamide to talazoparib alone as measured by rPFS as assessed by the Investigator., From treatment initiation until documented disease progression, death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal, administrative censoring at the time of final analysis, assessed at approximately 42 months from the start of enrollment.
Time to PSA50, To compare the efficacy of talazoparib + enzalutamide to talazoparib alone as measured by time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) â‰¥ 50% decline., Time from treatment initiation until observed PSA50, assessed at approximately 42 months from the start of enrollment.|Time to PSA Progression, To compare the efficacy of talazoparib + enzalutamide to talazoparib alone as measured by time to PSA progression., From treatment initiation until documented PSA progression, assessed at approximately 42 months from the start of enrollment.|Quality of Life (QoL) by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), Overall QoL measured by FACT-P. Scales: FACT-P Total score (range 0-156), FACT-General (G) Total score (range 0-108), FACT-P Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score (range 0-104). The higher the score, the better the QOL., From prior to treatment initiation (screening) until treatment discontinuation, assessed at approximately 42 months from the start of enrollment.|Quality of Life (QoL) by Functional Assessment of Cancer Intervention Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue), Fatigue measured by FACIT-Fatigue. Scales: FACIT-F Total score (range 0-160), FACT-General (G) Total score (range 0-108), FACIT-F Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score (range 0-108). The higher the score, the better the QOL., From prior to treatment initiation (screening) until treatment discontinuation, assessed at approximately 42 months from the start of enrollment.|Quality of Life (QoL) by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog), Cognitive function measured by FACT-Cog. Subscales: Perceived Cognitive Impairments (CogPCI) score (range 0-72), Impact of Perceived Cognitive Impairments on Quality of Life (CogQOL) score (range 0-16), Comments from Others (CogOth) score (range 0-16), Perceived Cognitive Abilities (CogPCA) score (range 0-28). The higher the score, the better the QOL., From prior to treatment initiation (screening) until treatment discontinuation, assessed at approximately 42 months from the start of enrollment.|Adverse Events (AE), Evaluate AE occurrence according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 to confirm safety., From treatment initiation through follow up, up to 12 months from end of treatment, assessed at approximately 42 months from the start of enrollment.|Overall Survival (OS), To compare the efficacy of talazoparib + enzalutamide to talazoparib alone as measured by OS., From treatment initiation until death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal, administrative censoring at the time of final analysis, assessed at approximately 42 months from the start of enrollment.
