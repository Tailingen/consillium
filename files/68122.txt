A Study of MGC028 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to characterize the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose of MGC028 (if no MTD is defined). The study will enroll adult participants with relapsed or refractory, unresectable, locally advanced of metastatic solid tumors known to express ADAM9.

The main question the study aims to answer is:

* What types of side effects will participants experience when receiving MGC028?
* Can MGC028 cause cancer to shrink, remain stable, or able to control disease progression of participants with advanced solid tumors?

Participants will

* Undergo screening procedures to determine eligibility
* Receive study treatments initially every 3 weeks.
* Have blood samples taken for routine and research tests
* Have other examinations to check heart and lung function, and general health status
* Be asked about any side effects that may be happening or other medications you are taking. The study doctor will provide treatment for side effects, if necessary.
* Have the study doctor assess your tumor status at regular intervals to determine how you are responding to treatment.

BIOLOGICAL: MGC028
Number and Types of Adverse Events (AEs) in Participants Receiving MGC028, Types of AEs include Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and AEs Leading to Treatment Delay or Discontinuation or Dose Reduction, dose limiting toxicities, and AEs of Special Interest. Observation of side effects determines the highest safe dose for further study, Throughout the study treatment and safety follow up period, up to 25 months
Mean maximum concentration of MGC028 antibody, Measurement of the highest concentration of MGC028 conjugated and total antibody in the bloodstream., Through Cycle 6 of the study, approximately 18 weeks|Mean Area Under the Concentration Time Curve of MGC028 antibody, Measurement of the total exposure of MGC028 conjugated and total antibody in the bloodstream., Through Cycle 6 of the study, approximately 18 weeks|Number of Participants Who Develop Anti-Drug Antibodies to MGC028, Throughout the study treatment period, up to 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 is estimated as the proportion of participants in the Response Evaluable Population who achieve Best Overall Response of Complete Response or Partial Response., Throughout the study and follow up period, up to 2.5 years.|Median Duration of Response, DoR is defined as the time from the date of initial response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Throughout the study and follow up period, up to 2.5 years.|Mean maximum concentration of MGC028 free payload, Measurement of the highest concentration of MGC028 free payload in the bloodstream., Through Cycle 6 of the study, approximately 18 weeks|Mean Area Under the Concentration Time Curve Total exposure of MGC028 payload, Measurement of the total exposure of MGC028 free payload in the bloodstream, Through Cycle 6 of the study, approximately 18 weeks|Change from baseline in the level of ADAM9 expression in tumor specimens, using immunohistochemistry, Baseline and approximately 28 days after the first dose of MGC028.
