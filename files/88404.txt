TACE With or Without Sorafenib in Intermediate Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This multicenter prospective nonrandomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of TACE combined with sorafenib compared with TACE monotherapy in term of overall survival in intermediate-stage HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Sorafenib|PROCEDURE: TACE
Overall survival, Overall survival analysis is measured from the treatment start until death occurred from any cause, The last patient has been on study for 1.5 year
Time to progression, The time to progression is measured from the treatment start to the radiologically confirmed progression, The time to progression will be assessed at the end of the study, up to 3 years|Tumor response, Tumor response will be evaluated according to RECIST, mRECIST and EASL criteria, respectively. Tumor response will be presented in the terms of complete response, partial response, stable disease and progression disease, Tumor response will be assessed at week 4 and week 8 after initiation of treatment and thereafter every 8 weeks (Â±7 days), up to 3 years|Adverse events, The terms and grade of adverse events will be presented according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE:version 4.0), The adverse events will be assessed every 4 weeks, up to 3 years|Prognostic factor, The Cox proportional model will be used to assess the prognostic factors, The analysis will be perfomed when the last patient has been on study for 1.5 year
Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, has been successfully applied for solid tumors such as renal cancer and HCC.

According to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging classification, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been recommended as a first line-therapy for patients at intermediate stage - BCLC B class (multinodular asymptomatic tumors without an invasive pattern).

Because sorafenib may improve the efficacy of locoregional therapy by decreasing post-TACE angiogenesis, sorafenib in combination with TACE has attracted considerable attention as a promising therapy
