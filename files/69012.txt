APG101 in Myelodysplastic Syndrome
It has been shown in preclinical experiments with bone marrow from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome that APG101 rescues erythrocytes from premature cell death. This is expected to translate in an improved erythropoiesis and ameliorated anemia in MDS patients.

APG101 might, therefore, be a valuable addition to current treatments of low- or intermediate MDS patients suffering from anaemia.

Transfusion-dependent patients with low or intermediate risk MDS according to WHO Prognostic Scoring Scale (WPSS) can be included in this study.

Treatment consists of 100mg APG101 intravenous as a weekly treatment over 12 weeks + 6 months follow up phase.

Primary objective of the trial is safety and tolerability of APG101; secondary objectives are

* Hematologic, cytologic and cytogenetic response rate using modified International Working Group (IWG) response criteria
* Incidence and time to leukemic progression at 37 weeks
* OS (Overall survival) at 37 weeks
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: Treatment with APG101|PROCEDURE: Bone marrow collection|PROCEDURE: Blood drawings
Safety and tolerability, Evaluation of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Evaluation of electrocardiograms (ECGs), abdominal ultrasound, anti-drug antibodies (ADA), changes in lymphocyte subpopulations / activation markers and changes in performance status (ECOG).

Any side effects potentially related to the APG101 treatment are evaluated., During the whole study (37 weeks)
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as time from start of study treatment to death from any cause, OS is captured for 37 weeks (during study)|Changes in transfusion frequency, Changes in transfusion frequency will be evaluated as those are early signs of an improval in erythropoiesis, During the whole study. Baseline values are compared to values under treatment with APG101 (e.g baseline compared to week 12 and week 37)|Changes of different parameters (e.g. histologic, cytologic, cytogenetic) in bone marrow according to Chesson criteria, By assessing different parameters (cytologic, hematologic, cytogenetic), safety as well as efficacy of treatment with APG101 can be evaluated, During the study (37 weeks)|Changes in hemoglobin (Hb) level, Changes in Hb level will be evaluated as those are early signs of an improval in erythropoiesis, During the study (37 weeks)
