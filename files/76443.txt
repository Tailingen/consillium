Sitravatinib is a spectrum-selective receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits several closely related RTKs including the TAM family (Tyro3/Axl/MERTK), VEGFR2, KIT, and MET.

The current study is designed to allow continued access to sitravatinib and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sitravatinib alone or in combination with other anticancer therapies in patients who are deriving clinical benefit in a previous parent clinical trial.
