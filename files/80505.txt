An Ascending Dose Study of KW-2449 in Acute Leukemias, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
Non-randomized, open, dose ranging and dose scheduling study of ascending doses of KW-2449 in subjects with AML, ALL, MDS and CML.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: KW-2449
Safety of KW-2449 - Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events (TEAEs) as Assessed by NCI-CTCAE v3.0, In addition to the number of TEAEs, the number of serious TEAEs, the number of related TEAEs, the number of Grade 3-4 TEAEs, and the number of subjects who died or discontinued due to TEAEs were also assessed. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was also to be determined, but it was not actually reached in either arm., Baseline up to Cycle 2, Day 1
Observed Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Days 1 and 14 (and Day 28 for Arm B) of Cycle 1|Time to Peak Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Days 1 and 14 (and Day 28 for Arm B) of Cycle 1|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From 0 to Tau (AUC (0-tau, Tau is the Dosing Interval)), Days 1 and 14 (and Day 28 for Arm B) of Cycle 1|Terminal Half Life (t 1/2), Days 1 and 14 (and Day 28 for Arm B) of Cycle 1|Accumulation Ratio (AUC 0-tau Day 14 or 28 / AUC 0-tau Day 1), Day 1 and either Day 14 or Day 28 of Cycle 1|Disease Response, Disease response (i.e., complete or partial remission) based on standard criteria:

This is a Phase I open-label dose escalation study of KW-2449 in subjects with acute leukemias, high risk MDS, and CML who are not candidates for approved therapy. Over an 18-month period, the investigative sites collectively will enroll up to a total of 96 subjects. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of 7 dose groups to evaluate 2 dosing schedules (Arm A = 14 consecutive days of dosing followed by a 7-28 day rest period as determined by recovery from any acute hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities, or Arm B = 28 consecutive days of dosing followed by a 7-28 day rest period, as determined by recovery from any acute hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities). The safety of a dose level in Arm A (14-day dosing regimen) will be established prior to enrollment of subjects in the same dose level in Arm B (28-day dosing regimen).

In April 2007 the protocol was amended to discontinue Arm B (28 consecutive days of dosing). The protocol will continue as planned for Arm A (14 days of consecutive dosing).

Enrollment will proceed until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established for each study Arm. Once the MTD has been reached, 12 additional subjects, with 1 or more of the hematologic conditions included in this study, may be enrolled at the MTD as an expanded safety cohort.
