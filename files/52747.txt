Gut Microbiota in Liver Cancer (Treated With TKIs In Combination With ICIs)
To evaluate the additional efficacy and safety of oral enterobacterial capsules in patients with intermediate and advanced liver cancer and treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) combined with immunotherapy.
Liver Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Oral enterobacterium capsules|DRUG: Lenvatinib + PD-1 monoclonal antibody|BIOLOGICAL: Oral enterobacterium capsules placebo
Objective Progression-Free Survival (PFS), To analyse the Progression-Free Survival (PFS) of patients, Up to approximately 1 years|Objective Secondary Clinical Endpoints - Overall Growth Phase (OS), To analyse the Secondary Clinical Endpoints - Overall Growth Phase (OS) of patients, Up to approximately 1 years|Objective Objective Response Rate (ORR), To exprole the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of patients, Up to approximately 1 years|ObjectiveDuration of Response (DOR), To analyse the Duration of Response (DOR) of patients, Up to approximately 1 years|Diversity analysis, We will use 16S rRNA sequencing to measure fecal sample. The alpha and beta diversity of gut microbiota will be analyzed, including a series of statistical analysis indexes such as Chao, Shannon, Simpsonace, Simpson and Coverage, in order to reflect the microbial community diversity., Up to approximately 1 years|Species differential analysis, We will use 16S rRNA sequencing to measure fecal sample. Based on the results of species annotation, the PCA、PCoA and NMDS analysis will be used to assess the similarities and differences in species composition., Up to approximately 1 years|Feces Metabolomics, Changes of metabolites in feces measured by metabolomic mass spectrometry, unsupervised PCA (principal component analysis) was performed by statistics function prcomp, identified metabolites were annotated using KEGG Compound database., Up to approximately 1 years|Serum Metabolomics, Changes of metabolites in serum measured by metabolomic mass spectrometry, unsupervised PCA (principal component analysis) was performed by statistics function prcomp, identified metabolites were annotated using KEGG Compound database., Up to approximately 1 years
This is a prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind controlled trial. The clinical study is divided into 2 groups:

Group 1) Patients in the control group were given lenvatinib 8mg (≤ 60 kg body weight) or 12 mg (\> 60 kg body weight) orally once a day, combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody 200mg intravenously once every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or death, and patients in the control group were given intestinal bacteria capsules placebo.

Group 2) Patients in the study group were given lenvatinib 8 mg (≤ 60 kg body weight) or 12 mg (\> 60 kg body weight) orally once a day in combination with PD-1 monoclonal antibody 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or death, and patients in this study group were given intestinal bacteria capsules.

Oral administration of intestinal bacteria capsules 6 capsules/day, after observing no adverse reactions, oral administration for 10 consecutive days, 6 capsules/day from the second day to the tenth day, and then discontinued to the next course of treatment.

Total course of treatment: a total of 4 courses of oral intestinal bacteria capsules, each course of oral administration for 10 days, and a course of 21 days; A course of TKI combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors treatment is 21 days until the disease progresses or intolerable toxicity and side effects appear.

Observe the metrics: Primary Clinical Endpoint - Progression-Free Survival (PFS); Secondary Clinical Endpoints - Overall Growth Phase (OS), Objective Response Rate (ORR), Duration of Response (DOR), and Disease Control Rate (DCR). The new RECIST1.1 criteria were used for the efficacy evaluation system, the CTCAE5.0 grading system was used for the evaluation of common adverse reactions during treatment, and other indicators included imaging including conventional biochemical indexes such as CT and ultrasound, as well as quality of life scores.
