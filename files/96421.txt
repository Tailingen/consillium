Trial of M4344 and Niraparib in Patients With Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out if a new drug, M4344, is safe and has beneficial effects when given in combination with the PARP inhibitor, Niraparib, in women with recurrent ovarian cancer that has progressed while on a PARP inhibitor.
Ovarian Cancer Recurrent
DRUG: M4344+Niraparib|DRUG: M4344+Niraparib
Percentage of patients with treatment emergent adverse events as defined by CTCAE v.4.03, Number and percentage of patients with treatment emergent adverse events and toxicity based upon CTCAE v.4.03 scoring., Baseline through 1 year|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of M4344 and Niraparib as defined by CTCAE 4.03, To determine the MTD of M4344 and Niraparib during the dose escalation as defined by CTCAE v.4.03, Baseline through 1 year
Overall Response Rate (ORR) as defined by RECIST v.1.1, To determine response rate among ovarian cancer patients that have become resistant to PARPi who are treated with ATRi + Niraparib as defined by RECIST v.1.1., Baseline through 6 months|Percentage progression free survival (PFS) as defined by RECIST v.1.1, To determine percentage of patients who remain progression free at 6 months (%PFS) among ovarian cancer patients that have become resistant to PARPi who are treated with ATRi + Niraparib as defined by RECIST v.1.1., Baseline through 6 months
The primary, secondary, and exploratory objective are to assess the safety of the combination of M4344 and Niraparib in a phase 1 trial of patients with PARP resistant recurrent ovarian cancer; to determine the response rate and percentage of participants who remain progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months (%PFS) among ovarian cancer participants that have become resistant to poly (adenosine diphosphate \[ADP\]) ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) who are treated with ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein inhibitors (ATRi) + Niraparib in the dose expansion cohort; and to identify potential biological predictors of response and progression of disease with the combination of M4344 and Niraparib.
