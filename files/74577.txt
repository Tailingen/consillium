Self Reported Pain in Women While Undergoing Treatment for Non-metastatic Breast Cancer
The overall purpose of this study is to investigate whether younger subjects report pain with pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar substitution) more often and/or at higher levels (greater intensity) than older subjects.This study will be carried out throughout the course of your chemotherapy treatment, which will be prescribed by your study doctor. Participation in this study will not affect your cancer treatment.
Breast
DRUG: pegfilgrastim
Frequency of pain, investigate whether younger patients report pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar substitution)-induced pain with greater frequency than older patients., approx 7 months
Intensity of pain, investigate whether younger patients report pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar substitution)-induced pain at a higher intensity than older patients., approx 7 months|White Blood Cell/Absolute Neutrophil Count (WBC/ANC), compare WBC/ANC count nadir between younger and older patients receiving pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar substitution)., On day 7 of each pegfilgrastim or biosimilar substitution cycle (28 day cycle, approx 4-6 cycles) through study completion (one week after last administration of pegfilgrastim or biosimilar substitution)
This study will measure pain using ESAS self-reported pain scores over the course of one week following each dose of pegfilgrastim (or biosimilar substitution). At the end of that week, blood will be drawn from each subject to directly measure the WBC/ANC, which can then be compared to self-reported pain and evaluated for any correlation. Finally, subjects will be divided into two groups by age: 45 years or younger, and over 45 to look for any differences in pain or WBC/ANC measurements based on age.
