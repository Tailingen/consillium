The investigators will be conducting a randomised control trial to test the efficacy of WhatsApp messages to increase receipt of mammography amongst eligible women who are members of the Vitality health promotion programme and are also on the Discovery Health Medical Scheme. The study will test a message that 1) has a link to a platform created by the Radiology Society of South Africa which allow members to select a range of practices to book a mammogram, against 2) a message that gives names and telephone numbers of Radiology practices in a 5 km radius of the members home address, against 3) a group with a link to an online platform as well as telephone numbers of radiology practices, against 4) a group where a standard message reminding to go for mammogram will be sent, but without names and telephone numbers of the radiology practices, against 5) a control group where no messages relating to mammography will be sent.
