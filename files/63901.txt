Number of Participants With 1 or More Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Data presented are the number of participants who experienced 1 or more TEAEs or SAEs regardless of causality.

Immunogenicity (IK): Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Anti-IMC-11F8 Antibodies, Treatment-emergent samples were defined as samples which showed at least 4-fold difference (2 dilution increase) at post-baseline in IK titer over the baseline titer, or participants who tested negative at baseline and positive post-baseline (at titer of ≥1:20)., For Cohorts 1, 2 and 3: Prior to first infusions of Cycles 1, 2, and 4 and at the 30-day follow-up visit (+7 days) after the last dose of study drug
This single center, open-label, single-arm, Phase 1 study will enroll 18 participants at a maximum. The actual size will vary depending on the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed and the resultant sizes of the cohorts. Participants will receive IMC-11F8 administered intravenously, once every 2 weeks or on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for 6 weeks (1 cycle). All infusions can be administered within ± 1 day of the scheduled administration date. After 1 cycle of treatment, participants who have an objective response or stable disease may continue to receive IMC-11F8 at the same dose and schedule until disease progression or other withdrawal criteria are met.

A minimum of 3 participants will be enrolled in each cohort. Dose escalation in successive cohorts will occur once all participants complete 1 cycle of therapy.

Participants will be enrolled sequentially into each cohort. A completed participant will be either a participant who completes the initial 6-week treatment period (Cycle 1) or a participant who discontinues therapy for an IMC-11F8-related toxicity during Cycle 1. Participants who do not complete the first 6 weeks of treatment for reasons other than an IMC-11F8-related toxicity will be replaced. Toxicity data for each cohort will be reviewed prior to dose escalation. Upon completion of all required safety evaluations during the initial 6 weeks, the next cohort of new participants will be treated at the next higher dose level using a dose escalation scheme.
