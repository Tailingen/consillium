Serum-derived Bovine Immunoglobulin Effect on Mucositis
The purpose of this cancer control clinical research study is to evaluate whether nutritional therapy with Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) might reduce mucositis (a condition caused by cancer treatment involving mouth sores, pain and/or bleeding that may cause difficulty eating), improve nutritional status and lessen the symptoms associated with chemo-radiation therapy which may result in quality of life (QOL) improvements during the prescribed treatment for cancer therapy.
