Study of Capecitabine to Treat Recurrent High Grade Gliomas
The purpose of this study is to determine if capecitabine is effective in the treatment of high grade gliomas that have returned after completing treatment.
Malignant Glioma
DRUG: Capecitabine
Percentage of Participants With Progression-free Survival., Gadolinium-contrasted MRIs were used to assess radiographic response every 2 cycles (\~6 weeks). Tumor progression was defined by increasing tumor size, new areas of tumor, or unequivocal neurologic deterioration., From date of first dose of study drug until month 6.
High grade gliomas (HGGs) represent a heterogenous group of primary brain tumors that share WHO grade III or IV classification (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, anaplastic mixed glioma, and glioblastoma multiforme). Despite the upfront use of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, high grade gliomas uniformly result in recurrence and death. Palliative chemotherapy offers an improvement in time to progression, symptom control, quality of life, and potential survival; however, no established chemotherapy regimen for recurrence exists and new treatments are needed. Oral capecitabine is a rationale strategy for therapeutic palliation of recurrent high grade gliomas given its oral administration, its well-known kinetics and toxicities, its non-competitive toxicities to other high grade glioma treatments, its well established management algorithms, its established evidence of entry into the central nervous system, and its evidence of safety and efficacy in malignancies in the central nervous system.
