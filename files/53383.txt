Compare the bioavailability of three veliparib formulations in subjects with solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: veliparib|DRUG: veliparib|DRUG: veliparib|DRUG: veliparib
Assess the oral bioavailability of veliparib, Assess the relative bioavailability of Formulation A, Formulation B and Formulation C with or without food measured using area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), and time to Cmax (Tmax)., Up to 4 weeks.
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of veliparib in patients with solid tumors, Safety and tolerability will be assessed through clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, physical exams and adverse event assessments, Up to 4 weeks
