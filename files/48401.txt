Cabozantinib in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Child Pugh Class B Cirrhosis After First-Line Therapy
The aim of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib in the management of unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with underlying Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis.
Advanced Adult Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Cabozantinib
Number of DLT Events to Occur, MTD/RP2D determined by dose limiting toxicities (DLT) during the first 29 days of therapy. DLTs are outlined in the protocol and assessed per the NCI CTCAE v5.0. The MTD/RP2D will be determined as the dose level with the highest probability of DLT not exceeding 35%., Up to 29 days after initiating treatment
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as time from date of treatment to date of radiological or clinical progressing (leading to withdrawal from the study), or death from any cause, whichever comes first. PFS will be estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier., 1.7 years|Median Time to Progression (TTP), TTP defined as time from date of treatment to date of radiological or clinical progression (leading to withdrawal from the study)., 1.7 years|Overall Survival (OS), Patients will be followed for up to 2 years from treatment discontinuation or until death, whichever comes first, or 3 years after first date of treatment initiation for those that remain on treatment. OS will be estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier., 1.7 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR) (Partial Response + Complete Response), ORR (PR + CR) per RECIST v1.1 criteria during active study treatment., 1.7 years|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile: Elimination Clearance (L/hr), Blood draws pre-dose, every 2 weeks until the start of cycle 3, Up to 2 months
