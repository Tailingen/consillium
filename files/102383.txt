A Study of Paclitaxel With GDC-0941 Versus Paclitaxel With Placebo in Participants With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This multicenter, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, two arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of paclitaxel with GDC-0941 versus paclitaxel with placebo in participants with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.
