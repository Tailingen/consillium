The randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the efficacy of Complement Theory's (CT) personalized and interactive, evidence-backed lifestyle program in reducing healthcare costs and improving health outcomes for survivors across all major cancer types.

Distinct from conventional interventions, CT's program offers live 1:1 coaching through a mobile app, concentrating on Exercise and Meditation, and is enriched with evidence-based advice on Diet, Sleep, and comprehensive lifestyle modifications. This trial is pivotal in assessing the program's effectiveness against an active comparator- expert-recommended lifestyle modification resources suitable for cancer survivors--to isolate the impact of coaching and personalization.

The primary objective is to investigate whether CT's novel approach can more effectively reduce healthcare utilization, through reduction of hospitalizations, urgent care visits, and outpatient visits. Furthermore, the trial seeks to measure adherence to treatment, and significant health outcomes, including improvements in Quality of Life Scores (QoLS) to provide a holistic evaluation of the program's impact on patient care and well-being. As an exploratory effort, the trial will also measure cancer progression, recurrence in Prostate and Colorectal cancer survivors alone.
