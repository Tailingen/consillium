Study of Bevacizumab Alone or Combined With Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin as Support Therapy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to compare the free time to disease progression of combination therapy with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab until disease progression versus capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab for 6 cycles followed by bevacizumab until disease progression or a premature drop out of the study.
