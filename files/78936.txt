A Study of Xevinapant (Debio 1143) in Combination With Platinum-Based Chemotherapy and Standard Fractionation Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy in Participants With Locally Advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck, Suitable for Definitive Chemoradiotherapy (TrilynX)
The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate superior efficacy of Xevinapant (Debio 1143) vs placebo when added to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN).
