Tadalafil in Preventing Erectile Dysfunction in Patients With Prostate Cancer Treated With Radiation Therapy
RATIONALE: Tadalafil may help prevent erectile dysfunction (ED) in patients with prostate cancer that has been treated with radiation therapy. It is not yet known whether tadalafil is more effective than a placebo in preventing erectile dysfunction.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying tadalafil to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing erectile dysfunction in patients with prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy.
Prostate Cancer|Sexual Dysfunction
DRUG: Tadalafil|OTHER: Placebo
Percentage of Patients Maintaining Spontaneous (Off-drug) Erectile Function (EF) at Weeks 28-30 After Initiation of Radiation Therapy (RT), EF is measured by Question 1 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). The IIEF is a validated 15-item for measuring patient-reported erectile function. Question 1 asks "How often were you able to get an erection during sexual activity?" Responses ranged from 0=no sexual activity, to 5=Almost always or always. Higher scores indicated better functioning. All patients have erectile function prior to initiation of RT, indicated by a score of 3, 4, or 5 on IIEF Q1. Patients with a lower IIEF Q1 score at weeks 28-30 than at baseline will have less erectile function and be categorized as nonresponders. Patients with similar or improved erectile function will be categorized as responders (maintaining). Patient-related predictors of at erectile function at this time point are also reported with this outcome measure., Baseline and 30 weeks from the start of radiation therapy

Question 1 asks "How often were you able to get an erection during sexual activity?" Responses ranged from 0=no sexual activity, to 5=Almost always or always. Higher scores indicated better functioning. All patients have erectile function prior to initiation of RT, indicated by a score of 3, 4, or 5. Patients with a lower IIEF Q1 score at weeks 28-30 than at baseline will have less erectile function and be categorized as nonresponders. Patients with similar or improved erectile function will be categorized as responders (maintaining). Patient-related predictors of at erectile function at Years 1 and 2 are also reported with this outcome measure., Baseline, 1 and 2 years from the start of tadalafil or placebo|Overall Sexual Function as Measured by Change From Baseline in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), The IIEF is a validated 15-item for measuring patient-reported erectile function. A score of 0-5 is given to each of the 15 questions that examine 5 main domains of male sexual function: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction. Domain scores are the sum of each item. The erectile function domain has 5 items with a score range of 1-30, orgasmic function has 2 items with a score range of 0-10, sexual desire has 2 items with a score range of 0-10, intercourse satisfaction has 3 items with a score range of 0-15, and overall satisfaction has 2 items with a score range of 2-10. Total score ranges from 0-70, with higher scores indicated better functioning. Change from baseline is calculated by subtracting baseline score from score at the time point of interest., Baseline, week 30, and years 1 and 2 from start of treatment|Overall Patient Sexual Satisfaction as Measured by Change From Baseline in the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire (SAQ) Score, The Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire (SAQ) is a 20-item questionnaire with an overall score range between 8 and 100 including the following domains: desire, ranging between 5 and 30; dysfunction, 0 and 25; activity, 0 and 10; satisfaction, 1 and 10; and fatigue, 1 and 5. The change in SAQ score is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the follow-up score. A positive change indicates an improvement in sexual well-being., Baseline, week 30 and years 1 and 2 after the start of treatment|Overall Partner Sexual Satisfaction as Measured by Change From Baseline in the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire-Partner (SAQ-P) Score, The SAQ-P is an 18-item questionnaire with an overall score range between 0 and 90 including the following domains: desire, dysfunction, activity, satisfaction, and fatigue. The change in SAQ score is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the follow-up score. A positive change indicates an improvement in sexual well-being., Baseline, week 30 and years 1 and 2 after the start of treatment|Patient Marital Adjustment as Measured by the Locke's Marital Adjustment Test, The Locke Marital Adjustment Test (LMAT) is a 16-item questionnaire with scores ranging from 48 to 138 for participants. Higher scores indicate greater sexual function, sexual wellbeing, or marital adjustment. The change in LMAT score is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the follow-up score., Baseline, week 30 and years 1 and 2 after the start of treatment|Partner Marital Adjustment as Measured by the Locke's Marital Adjustment Test, The Locke Marital Adjustment Test (LMAT) is a 16-item questionnaire with scores ranging from 48 to 138 for participants. Higher scores indicate greater sexual function, sexual wellbeing, or marital adjustment. The change in LMAT score is calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the follow-up score., Baseline, week 30 and years 1 and 2 after the start of treatment

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine whether tadalafil maintains spontaneous (off-drug) erectile function, as measured by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) as compared to placebo at weeks 28-30 after initiation of radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer.

Secondary

* Determine the difference in spontaneous (off-drug) erectile function between tadalafil and placebo at 1 and 2 years.
* Determine the difference in overall sexual function as measured by the IIEF between tadalafil and placebo at weeks 28-30 and at 1 and 2 years.
* Determine differences in patient and partner overall sexual satisfaction as measured by the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire (SAQ) between tadalafil and placebo at weeks 28-30 and at 1 and 2 years.
* Determine differences in patient and partner marital adjustment as measured by Locke's Marital Adjustment Test (LMAT) between tadalafil and placebo at weeks 28-30 and at 1 and 2 years.
* Determine associations between patient and partner overall sexual satisfaction as measured by SAQ and patient and partner marital adjustment as measured by LMAT at weeks 28-30 and at 1 and 2 years.
* Determine patient-related factors (i.e., age, pretreatment sexual response, tobacco use, and comorbidities) that may predict response to tadalafil therapy at weeks 28-30 and at 1 and 2 years.
* Determine the difference in adverse events between tadalafil and placebo as assessed by Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v3.0 criteria.

Tertiary

* Characterization of preference and erectile function among patients who choose to stay on (or if on placebo, to start) tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor other than tadalafil, a non-PDE5-inhibitor erectile aide, or no PDE5 inhibitor or erectile aide at 28-30 weeks and at 1 and 2 years.
* Identification of radiotherapy factors (i.e., modality, prescribed total dose, planning target volume margin, penile bulb dose-volume parameters) associated with erectile function.
* Evaluation of the number of patients screened for eligibility, the number eligible that are presented the study, the number who refuse, and the number who are accrued.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (≤ 65 years vs \> 65 years) and radiotherapy treatment (external beam radiation therapy vs brachytherapy\*). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

Note: \* Radiotherapy start date for brachytherapy patients is the date of the procedure.

All patients undergo either external beam radiotherapy alone to the prostate ± seminal vesicles only or low-dose rate permanent brachytherapy alone.

* Arm I: Beginning ≤ 7 days after the start of radiotherapy, patients receive oral tadalafil once daily for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Beginning ≤ 7 days after the start of radiotherapy, patients receive oral placebo once daily for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients complete the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), the Sexual Adjustment Questionnaire (SAQ), the Locke's Marital Adjustment Test (LMAT) (if applicable), and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Sexual Medications and Devices Evaluations Supplement questionnaires periodically. Partners or spouses complete the SAQ-Partner, LMAT (if applicable), and IIEF questionnaires periodically.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 28-30 weeks, and annually for up to 2 years.
