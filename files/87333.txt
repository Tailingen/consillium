Vaccination With 6MHP, With or Without Systemic CDX-1127, in Patients With Stage II-IV Melanoma
This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a peptide vaccine (6MHP) with adjuvants and the CDX-1127 monoclonal antibody, and whether the adjuvants and the CDX-1127 monoclonal antibody boost immune responses to the vaccine. In this study, the adjuvants are Montanide ISA-51 and polyICLC. The investigators will monitor these effects by performing tests in the laboratory on participants' blood and tissue from a vaccine site.
