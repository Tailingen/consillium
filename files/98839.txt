Association Between Autologous Transfusion and Recurrence-free Survival in Patients With HCC After Resection
This prospective non-randomized controlled trial aims to determine whether autotransfusion of red blood cells salvaged before liver resection is associated with the recurrence-free survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Preoperative and intraoperative blood salvage autotransfusion is used in various surgical procedures. However, because of the risk of reinfusion of salvaged blood contaminated by tumor cells, the use of autotransfusion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing liver resection is controversial. The critical points include whether tumor cells can be cleared by autotransfusion, whether autotransfusion increases the risk of recurrence or metastasis, and what are the indications for autotransfusion. Moreover, some other issues are still not addressed. For example, is it warranted to take the risk of tumor dissemination by using autotransfusion to avoid allogeneic blood transfusion? Do the remaining tumor cells after additional filtration by leukocyte depletion filters still possess potential tumorigenicity?
