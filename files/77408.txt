Observation of Young Patients With Localized Neuroblastoma Who Have Undergone Surgery Only
RATIONALE: Observation is closely monitoring a patient's condition and not giving treatment until symptoms appear or change. Observation may help doctors see how effective surgery is in treating neuroblastoma.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well surgery alone works in treating young patients with localized neuroblastoma.
Long-term Effects Secondary to Cancer Therapy in Children|Neuroblastoma
OTHER: clinical observation
Safety and efficacy
Predictive factors of relapse and survival
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the safety and efficacy of surgical treatment alone in young patients with stage 2 neuroblastoma without N-myc amplification (NMA).

Secondary

* Determine predictive factors of relapse and survival of patients with stage 1, 2A, or 2B neuroblastoma without NMA who have undergone surgery only.

OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

Patients with stage 1 or 2 disease and no N-myc amplification (NMA) undergo observation comprising clinical evaluation, ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen, and chest x-ray periodically for up to 5 years. All other patients undergo additional therapy and follow-up according to national standards. Patients who develop recurrent disease or disease progression may undergo surgical resection, preceded or followed by chemotherapy, according to national standards.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients will be accrued for this study.
