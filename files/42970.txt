A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study of AK127 in Combination With AK112 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
A Phase Ib/II Open-label Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Preliminary Efficacy of AK127 in combination with AK112 in Patients with Advanced Malignant Tumors
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: AK127 in combination with AK112
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment, From the subject signs the ICF to 30 days (AE) and 90 days (SAE) after the last dose of study treatment or initiation of other anti-tumor therapy, whichever occurs first|Number of participants with a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLTs will be assessed during the first 3 weeks of treatment for dose-escalation Ib phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria, and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug, and unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurs within the first cycle (3 weeks) of treatment, During the first 3 weeks|Number of participants with ORR, Efficacy measures such as overall response rate (ORR), which is the proportion of subjects with CR or PR by investigator based on RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 years|Progression-Free Survival, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first assessed by investigator Per RECIST 1.1., Up to 2 years
Disease control rate, DCR, which is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR, PR, or SD, based on RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 years|Duration of response, DoR, which is defined as the duration from the first documentation of objective response to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Time to Progress, TTR is defined as the time to response base on RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 years|AUC of AK127 and AK112, Area under the curve (AUC) of AK127 and AK112, Up to 2 years|PK of AK127 and AK112, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK127 and AK112 include serum concentrations of AK127 and AK112 at different timepoints after AK127 and AK112 administration, Up to 2 years|Cmax of AK127 and AK112, Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of AK127 and AK112, Up to 2 years|Cmin of AK127 and AK112 at steady state, Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of AK127 and AK112 at steady state, Up to 2 years|The immunogenicity of AK127 and AK112, The immunogenicity of AK127 and AK112 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), Up to 2 years
The study consisted of two parts. The first part, Phase Ib is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity of AK127 in combination with AK112 in adult subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The part, as a dose escalation phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for AK127 in combination with AK112, and describe Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT).The second part, Phase II is to Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of AK127 in combination with AK112 in different tumor species cohorts.
