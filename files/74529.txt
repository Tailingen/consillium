A Study to Compare Tissue and Liquid Biopsies in People With Different Types of Cancer
In study, liquid biopsy samples will be obtained from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) including Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients who undergo treatment according to established standards of care (SoC) at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH).

This study will observe the overall Variant Allele Frequency (VAF) of circulating tumour Desoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) levels over the patient therapeutic treatment course and will correlate these findings with tumour response as well as Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)mutation status.
Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma|Colorectal Cancer|Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Liquid biopsy
Mean variant allele frequency (VAF) of mutations in circulating tumour Desoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) samples over the timescale of the patient's treatment course, up to 5 years
Tumour growth/tumour marker changes for each therapeutic treatment regimen at each biopsy sampling time point as compared to baseline, up to 5 years|Correlation of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation status and objective response, up to 5 years
