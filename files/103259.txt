Reirradiation and Niraparib in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate a drug called niraparib in patients with glioblastoma that was previously treated but has returned (called recurrent glioblastoma, or rGBM).

Through this study, investigators would like to find out the best dose of niraparib to give to treat the disease when given together with radiotherapy (known in this study as reirradiation, or re-RT).

Patients receive 10 doses of reirradiation over approximately 2 weeks. At the same time, niraparib capsules are taken orally at home, every day. Niraparib treatment continues until the patient is required to stop either because the treatment stops working or because of side-effects.

Participants will come into clinic weekly for blood tests and clinical examinations in the first month of treatment. After this, the assessments will be done monthly.

Once the patient has finished niraparib treatment, the patient will enter follow-up and be seen once a year to see if there are any late side-effects from trial treatment, how the disease is doing, and if further treatments have been received for it. This follow-up continues until the end of the trial.
Recurrent Glioblastoma
DRUG: Niraparib|RADIATION: Re-irradiation (re-RT)
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, DLTs will be assessed in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of niraparib given concurrently with re-RT., DLTs with an onset date within the first cycle of treatment (typically 28 days) will be assessed.
Safety and tolerability of niraparib given concurrently with re-RT., Safety and tolerability of niraparib given concurrently with re-RT, characterised in terms of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., Adverse events will be reported until 30 calendar days post last niraparib and/or post last investigational treatment (re-RT) administration.|Overall survival (OS), Death, From trial treatment start date until date of death, assessed at 9 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), Disease progression or death, From trial treatment start date until disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 9 months.|Best Overall Objective Response Rate, Frequency and percentage of patients who experienced a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) and Progressive Disease (PD), From trial treatment start date through to end of trial, assessed at 12 months|Time to treatment failure (TTF), Treatment failure classified as early treatment discontinuation, progression, starting further treatment or death., From trial treatment start date until early treatment discontinuation, progression, starting further treatment or death, whichever occurs first assessed up to 9 months.|Duration on Treatment, Median time on trial treatment will be presented., From trial treatment start date until treatment discontinuation, assessed at 12 months|Treatment Compliance, Reasons for treatment delays, dose omissions, dose reductions and treatment discontinuation., From trial treatment start date until treatment discontinuation, assessed at 12 months|Health-related Quality of life (HRQoL): QLQ-C30, HRQoL assessed by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, scored according to EORTC manual guideline. Score range is 0-100, with 100 being the highest response level., From screening up to 9 months, at specific time points|Health-related Quality of life (HRQoL): QLQ-BN20, HRQoL assessed by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-BN20, scored according to EORTC manual guidelines., From screening up to 9 months, at specific time points
