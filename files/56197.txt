QOL Assessment in Breast Cancer Patients With Radiation-Induced Telangiectasias Treated With the Pulsed Dye Laser
The purpose of this study is to see how the look of telangiectasias (small dilated blood vessels) on radiated breast skin when altered by the pulsed dye laser affects a patient's overall well being.

Patients will have a set of treatments with a pulsed dye laser. This is a laser that targets red blood vessels and delivers heat causing the telangiectasias to become smaller and less visible. The laser has been used safely to treat telangiectasias on the skin of patients who received radiation for breast cancer.

Patients in the study will be asked to complete a questionnaire asking how they feel about the telangiectasias, their radiated skin and its effect on their daily lives. The questionnaire will be given at every visit. The improvement in the look of patients' radiated skin will also be compared to answers to the questionnaire. We hope the study will improve our understanding of how patients feel about the long term effects of radiation on their skin.
Breast Cancer|Radiation-Induced Telangiectasias
BEHAVIORAL: questionnaires
evaluate quality-of-life (QoL), in breast cancer survivors with chronic radiation-induced telangiectasias who are undergoing pulsed dye laser treatment. To assess quality of life in relation to the radiation-induced telangiectasias, two pre-existing validated scales will be utilized. The Skindex-16 and BREAST-Q are scales that have been validated to assess quality of life., 2 years
