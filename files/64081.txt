Tiragolumab Plus Atezolizumab Versus Atezolizumab in the Treatment of Stage II Melanoma Patients Who Are ctDNA-positive Following Resection
This study's hypothesis is that patients with stage II melanoma who test positive for circulating tumor DNA are at a higher risk for recurrence and therefore adjuvant treatment is justified. In this study, the blood of consenting and eligible patients will be tested for ctDNA and those patients who test positive will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either treatment with atezolizumab and tiragolumab or atezolizumab alone during Stage 1 of the study. If at least 3 patients in the atezolizumab + tiragolumab arm are shown to be ctDNA negative at C3D1, stage 2 of the study will begin enrollment. Stage 2 consists of 25 patients all enrolled to the atezolizumab + tiragolumab arm (no randomization and no atezolizumab monotherapy arm).Patients who test negative for ctDNA will be observed off protocol.
Stage II Melanoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Tiragolumab|DEVICE: Signatera Assay
ctDNA Clearance Rate, -Defined as the proportion of ctDNA-positive participants having a ctDNA-negative test at Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1 (estimated to be 8 weeks)
Proportion of ctDNA-positive Participants Having a ctDNA-negative Test at Two Consecutive Measures, From baseline to end of treatment (estimated to be 12 months)|Relapse-free Survival (RFS), -Defined as the duration of time from the date of randomization to the date of earliest disease relapse or death, whichever occurs first., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 48 months)|Distant Metastasis-free Survival (DMFS), -Defined as as the duration of time from the date of positive ctDNA being confirmed to the date of appearance of a distant metastasis or death, whichever occurs first., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 48 months)|Overall Survival (OS), -Defined as the duration of time from the date of positive ctDNA being confirmed to death from any cause., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 48 months)|Number of Treatment-related Grade 3 or Greater Adverse Events, From start of treatment through 90 days after end of treatment (estimated to be 15 months)|Number of Treatment Discontinuations Due to Treatment-related Adverse Events, From start of treatment through completion of treatment (estimated to be 12 months)|Assess the Impact of ctDNA Kinetics on Relapse-free Survival, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 48 months)|Assess the Impact of ctDNA Kinetics on Distant Metastasis-free Survival, Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 48 months)
