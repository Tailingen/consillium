Histology of Functional Density in Premenopausal Breast
The investigators hypothesize that knowledge of the functional behavior of areas of mammographic density will enable more specific identification of dense tissue at-risk for breast cancer, ultimately providing predictive information on an individual's risk of developing breast cancer.
Dense Breasts|Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: breast biopsy
proportion of epithelium vs stroma, within 3 days of functional density assessment on MBI
Degree of lobular involution, Degree of lobular involution as assessed through qualitative and quantitative measurements will be compared between dense tissue which appears photopenic on MBI and dense tissue which appears functionally active on MBI., within 3 days of functional density assessment on MBI|Ki-67 cellular proliferation index, Degree of cellular proliferation as assessed through Ki-67 index will be compared between dense tissue which appears photopenic on MBI and dense tissue which appears functionally active on MBI., within 3 days of functional density assessment on MBI
The specific aims are:

* In women with increased mammographic density (MD), determine the histological characteristics of functionally dense tissue compared to that of non-functionally dense tissue via core-needle biopsy of the breast.
* In women with increased mammographic density (MD), determine the correlations between the total percent area of functional density (FD) on MBI, percent density of MD on mammogram, and histological characteristics of dense tissue
