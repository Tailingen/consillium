Investigation of Desmoplastic Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Aim of the study is to verify wether it is possible to have a more sensitive diagnostic tool using pancytokeratin immunohistochemistry for desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma compared to regular H\&E staining. The investigators therefore plan to include 73 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma and do regular follow up.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin
PROCEDURE: Immunohistochemistry using Pancytokeratin Staining
