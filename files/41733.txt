Pharmacokinetic Study of Topically Applied Veregen 15% Compared With Oral Intake of Green Tea Beverage
This open, monocentric study is designed to investigate plasma concentrations of certain catechins after topical application of Veregen 15% ointment to genital or perianal warts in comparison to catechin plasma concentrations after oral intake of a defined dose of green tea beverage. The study is intended to demonstrate that topical administration of Veregen 15% induces catechin plasma concentrations lower or equivalent to those that can be reached with normal consumption of green tea.
Genital Warts|Perianal Warts
DRUG: Polyphenon E (Veregen) 15% ointment|OTHER: Green Tea Beverage with defined catechin content
