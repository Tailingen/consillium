Impact of Breast Cancer Treatment on Joint Health, Cartilage Composition, and Bone Structure in the Knee and Hand
This study investigates the impact of breast cancer treatment on joint health, cartilage, composition, and bone structure in the knee and hand in patients with hormone-receptor positive stage I-III breast cancer and healthy patients. The investigators will use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess the quality of hand and knee joints. This study may help doctors learn more about hand and knee joint pain that occurs during aromatase inhibitor treatment.

PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Mean differences in hyaline cartilage biochemical composition, Will determine differences in hyaline cartilage biochemical composition (using magnetic resonance imaging) between breast cancer patients under aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment. Linear regression models will be used to assess differences in joint parameters outcomes between healthy controls, AI patients with pain, and AI patients without pain (predictors)., Up to 6 months|Differences in morphological joint abnormalities, Will determine differences in morphological joint abnormalities (using semi-quantitative magnetic resonance-based scores) between breast cancer patients under aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment. Linear regression models will be used to assess differences in joint parameters outcomes between healthy controls, AI patients with pain, and AI patients without pain (predictors)., Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To investigate pathological alterations in cartilage and joints in breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitor (AI)s with and without pain and in healthy control patients.

OUTLINE:

Patients complete a series of questionnaires over 15 minutes about knee function and pain, as well as physical activity. Patients also undergo an MRI of about 60 minutes.

After completion of study, a subset of patients are followed up at 6 months.
