ProAgio in Combination With Gemcitabine in Patients With Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is a Phase I/II Trial Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of ProAgio, an anti- αvβ3 Integrin Cytotoxin, in Combination with Gemcitabine in Patients with Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: ProAgio Dose Levels (DL) 1,2,3,4|DRUG: ProAgio Dose Expansion
Part 1 (Dose Escalation), To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ProAgio in combination with gemcitabine in patients with metastatic TNBC who have been previously treated with at least two prior lines of therapy., 2 Years|Part 2 (Dose Expansion), To estimate the objective response rate (ORR) of ProAgio in combination with gemcitabine in patients with metastatic TNBC who have been previously treated with at least two prior lines of therapy., 2 Years
Clinical Benefit Rate, To describe the clinical benefit rate (CBR) in patients with metastatic TNBC treated with ProAgio in combination with gemcitabine., 2 Years|Estimate the mean change from baseline in tumor stromal collagen, To estimate the mean change from baseline in tumor stromal collagen following treatment with ProAgio and gemcitabine., 2 Years|Progression free survival (PFS), To describe the progression free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic TNBC treated with ProAgio in combination with gemcitabine., 2 Years
This is a single-arm, Phase I/II study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of ProAgio with gemcitabine in patients with previously treated, metastatic triple negative breast cancer.

Dose escalation will proceed using the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design, with a target toxicity rate of 0.25, a maximum sample size of 20, and a cohort size of 2.

There are four dose levels considered in the dose escalation phase, and we start at the lowest dose level (Dose Level 1).
