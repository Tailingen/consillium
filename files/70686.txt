CAREFOR: Precision Medicine Driving Precision Nutrition for the Treatment of NeoAdjuvant Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to determine if a targeted dietary change can enhance the effect of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
Breast Carcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: Behavioral Dietary Intervention
Pathologic complete response assessed in tissue, The portion of patients who adhere to the diet restriction will be computed along with a 95% exact confidence. An exact binomial test (with a onesided alpha of 0.05) will also be used to test whether adherence is greater than 60%., At time of definitive breast surgery|Incidence of adverse events evaluated by CTCAE version 4.0, Up to 24 months
Number of study participants who receive the dietary intervention to the historical controls, Will be compared to historical controls. Will be based on logistic regression, which will control for patient characteristics and clinical factors. The study has 81% power to detect an odds ratio of about 0.25 using a 2-sided alpha of 0.05, Up to 24 months|Weight changes, Will be assessed by modeling body mass index as a function of time via mixed-effects regression., Up to 24 months|Change in insulin, Will be assessed as a function of time via mixed-effects regression., Up to 24 months|Change in serum, Will be assessed as a function of time via mixed-effects regression., Up to 24 months|Distant metastases, Will be analyzed via the Kaplan-Meier method and the logrank test., Up to 24 months|Progression-free survival, Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated and a log-rank value will be calculated., Up to 24 months|Overall survival, Will be analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression., Up to 24 months
Primary objective:

I To determine if dietary alternations designed to downregulate the dominate molecular drivers of an individuals' breast cancer will enhance the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and allow for an increase in the pathologic complete response rate.

Secondary objectives

I) Investigator measurable changes to molecular and patient characteristics from precision nutrition to determine a metric for evaluation this treatment in future studies.
