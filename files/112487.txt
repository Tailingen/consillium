Surgery Versus Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer
This prospective, open randomized phase III surgical trial seeks to study whether radical prostatectomy (with or without the combination of external radiation) improves prostate-cancer specific survival in comparison with primary radiation treatment and hormonal treatment among patients diagnosed with locally advanced (T3) prostate cancer. Untreated or conservatively treated locally advanced prostate cancer is associated with high mortality. Modern curative treatment for advanced solid malign tumors include surgery and/or radiation plus attempted chemotherapy if available to achieve both local control and elimination of potential micro metastases. Whereas there is evidence that surgery can cure localized prostate cancer, there are no clinical trials of multi-modal treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer that includes surgical removal of the prostate.

One potential advantage of adding prostatectomy to the treatment of LAPC is that removing the prostate enables a full pathological assessment of the tumor characteristics and thus a better estimation of the risk of recurrence. Surgical treatment could thus reduce the numbers needed to treat with chemotherapy and radiation, and thus improve quality of life after treatment. In addition, evidence indicate that residual cancer in the prostate occurs in 25% after radiation treatment (56) and surgical removal of the prostate may improve survival beyond what can be achieved by radiation and ADT. On the other hand, patients treated with surgery, radiation and hormones will experience side effects of all three treatment modalities and might fare better if radiotherapy plus hormones can provide oncological control without prior surgery.

A randomized clinical trial comparing two multimodal treatment regimens of which one includes a radical prostatectomy is therefore warranted.

Cause specific survival, Cause-specific survival (CSS) will be calculated as "1-cause specific mortality. Mortality and mortality causes will be ascertained from the nationwide Cause-of-Death Register. In the absence of a functioning Cause-of-Death register, an endpoint committee of at least 2 medical doctors will determine the cause of death., Up to 10 years
Metastasis free survival, Composite endpoint of time to metastasis and survival, Up to 10 years|Quality of life - general psychological, urinary, bowel and sexual health, Questionnaire-based evaluation of general psychological health, urinary health, bowel health, and sexual health.

Questions about self Questions about quality of life in the past month (scale 1 to 7; 1=no quality, 7=the best quality) Depression and anxiety (scale 1 to 7; 1=no, 7=very) Symptom Form (EPIC-26) (scale 1 to 5; 1= no problem, 5=major problem) Questions about the urinary tract Questions about sexual function Questions about bowel function Questions about prostate cancer - diagnosis and treatment Questions about prostate cancer check-ups Questions about hormone/castration therapy and its significance Questions about pain and lymph swelling, At 1,2,5 and 10 years after randomization|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) will be calculated as "1-overall mortality. Mortality data will be ascertained through the nationwide Cause-of-Death Register., Up to 10 years|Time to castration-resistant prostate cancer, Ascertained at follow-up visits, Up to 10 years|Time to biochemical progression, Ascertained at follow-up visits, Up to 10 years|Adverse events, Ascertained at visits, Up to 10 years|Cardiovascular disease, Data from national PcBaSe-register (https://snd.gu.se/en/catalogue/study/ext0014), a registry where the national prostate cancer registry (NPCR, www.npcr.se) has been linked to the Swedish National Cancer Register, the Cause of Death Register, the Prescribed Drug Register, the National Patient Register, and the Acute Myocardial Infarction Register, the Register of the Total Population, the Longitudinal Integration database for health insurance and labour market studies (LISA), the Multi-Generatioon Register and several other population-based registers., Up to 10 years
