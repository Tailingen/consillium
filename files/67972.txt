ERCC1 Targeted Trial
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the UK, leading to 34 000 deaths each year (22% of cancer deaths). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common histology, accounting for approximately 80% of cases and most present with advanced, stage IIIb or IV disease. The recommended treatment for advanced disease is a doublet platinum-based chemotherapy, although the survival benefits are modest. Even among those fit enough for chemotherapy, the response rate is only 20-40%, and median survival averages 9-10 months with the newer platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen (Schiller et al, 2002; Rudd et al, 2005; Lee et al, 2007). Only 11% of patients went on to survive 2 years when treated with the newer gemcitabine/carboplatin regimen established by the London Lung Cancer Group (Rudd et al, 2005; Lee et al, 2007). New strategies are needed to further improve the prognosis of this disease.

TRIAL OBJECTIVES

Primary objective

The trial will have two main objectives:

* To detect an improvement in survival for ERCC1+ve patients treated with a non-platinum chemotherapy compared to platinum-based treatment.
* To establish non-inferiority or improvement in survival for ERCC1-ve patients treated with a platinum-based chemotherapy compared to non-platinum treatment.

Secondary objectives

* To examine progression-free survival, response rate and quality of life between the two treatment regimens, according to ERCC1 status.
* To investigate whether the treatment effect differs according to histology (squamous vs. nonsquamous);gender (males vs. females); performance status
* To undertake a cost-effectiveness analysis based on all patients, and according to ERCC1 status.
