Randomized Study of HLA-mismatched DSI to Treat Relapse Leukemia After HLA- Matched Transplantation
The relapse leukemia patients after transplantation were divided into two groups randomly. Group D1: patients received first-donor stem cells infusion(DSI) treatment with or without chemotherapy; group D2: patients received second-donor DSI treatment with or without chemotherapy. The second donors were preferably donors who were genetically related and had more HLA-match locus. The re-induction chemotherapy regimen was primarily MAT(mitoxantrone, cytarabine, Teniposide ) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and VMCLD(vincristine, Teniposide, cyclophosphamide, L-Asparaginase, Dexamethasone) for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and no graft versus host disease(GVHD) prevention was conducted pre- and post- therapy.
Relapse Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: the first donor's stem cell|BIOLOGICAL: the second donor's stem cell
Number of Participants with graft versus host diseases, 100 days
Time to Disease Progression, 2 years
Evaluation indications include bone marrow morphology,hematopoietic recovery (neutrophil and platelet), 100-day transplantation-related mortality (TRM), donor chimerism, acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). The cut-time of the follow-up was Oct, 2013. DFS was defined as the time between the date of transplantation to the death or relapse. OS was defined as the time from diagnosis to death or to the last date of follow-up until Oct. 2013.
