This is an Early Study to Investigate the Effect of Gimatecan速 in Adults With Solid Tumor
Gimatecan速 is sigma-tau Research's new, potent, oral Topoisomerase I inhibitor. Drugs in this class play a crucial role in destroying DNA replication in tumors. We are conducting this study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of our compound, when given as a capsule, rather than by intravenous injection.
