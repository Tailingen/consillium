The Molecular Epidemiology of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutations in Patients With Advanced EGFR Mutation-positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Afatinib
This is an observational, non-interventional, single-country, multi center, retrospective cohort study, based on real world data collection, of patients with locally advanced or metastatic Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who had been treated with Afatinib at any line.

This is an observational, non-interventional, single-country, multicenter, retrospective cohort study, based on real world data collection, of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC who had been treated with Afatinib s at any line.

The study is carried out by hospital-based oncologists/pneumonologists specializing in lung cancer under real-world conditions of daily clinical practice. Investigators were selected through a documented and structured feasibility process which accounted for physicians' qualifications, previous participation and experience in similar clinical studies, recruitment potential, and retention capability. In addition, in order to represent variations in current real-world patterns of care, research sites were recruited from various geographic regions in Greece, also taking into consideration the regional setting and type of healthcare site/institution (publicly/privately owned, specialized oncology/pulmonology clinic, university clinic).
