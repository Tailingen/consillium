Prediction of the Risk of Biochemical Relapse After Radical Prostatectomy for Prostate Cancer Using Radomics on Pre-therapeutic MRI
With 50% of post-operative biochemical failure, efficient predictive models are needed to guide post-operative management.

Radiomic features are quantitative features extracted from medical imaging, supposed to be correlated with tumor heterogeneity.

We aim to build and test three predictive models (clinical, radiomic and combined models).
Prostatic Adenocarcinoma
Prediction of biochemical failure, Comparison of AUCs between each predictive model, From the date of surgery until data collection (up to 100 months)
Prediction of survival without biochemical failure, Survival analysis: comparison of Kaplan-Meier curves, From the date of surgery until data collection (up to 100 months)
With 50% of post-operative biochemical failure, efficient predictive models are needed to guide post-operative management.
