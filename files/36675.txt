ITGA6 Targeting NIR-II Fluorescence Image Guided Surgery
In this study, the investigators will detect hepatocellular carcinoma lesions using fluoescence imaging with ITGA6 targeting probes during tumor resection surgery. The aim is to evaluate wether intraoperative fluorescence imaging targeting ITGA6 can help to improve the detction effect of hepatocellular carcinoma, and finally help the accurate surgical resection.

The main purposes of this study include:

1. To raise the detection rate of hepatocellular carcinoma intraoperatively using the novel NIR-II fluorescence molecular imaging and the ITGA6 targeting probe.
2. To validate the safety and effectiveness of the proposed ITGA6 targeting probes for clinical application.
