Allogeneic Cellular Vaccine 1650-G for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Rationale: Vaccines made from allogeneic tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

The Purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a lung cancer vaccine in patients with Stage I or Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) after completion of initial definitive therapies.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: 1650-G Vaccine
Number of Participants Responding to the Vaccine, The endpoint is immunologic response measured by IFN-ELISPOT. It will be reported as the percent of patients responding to vaccine (\>2 Standard Deviation increase from baseline levels pre-vaccine). The number of individuals responding (\> 2 SD change from baseline vaccine) will provide an approximation of biologic efficacy of the vaccine., 16 weeks after vaccination
The study is an open label investigation of the cellular vaccine called 1650-G. Patients receive 2 vaccine injections intradermally in the thigh given 4 weeks apart. Patients will be followed weekly after each vaccine injection and then monthly for 4 months. Patient follow-up continues with evaluations at 6 months and 1 year after receiving the first vaccine injection. Immunologic responses to the vaccine will be assessed from blood samples obtained at each visit following immunizations.
