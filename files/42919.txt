A Study of TAR-200 in Combination With Cetrelimab, TAR-200 Alone, or Cetrelimab Alone in Participants With Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) Unresponsive to Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin Who Are Ineligible for or Elected Not to Undergo Radical Cystectomy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall complete response (CR) rate in participants treated with TAR-200 in combination with cetrelimab (Cohort 1), or TAR-200 alone (Cohort 2), or cetrelimab alone (Cohort 3) with Carcinoma in Situ (CIS), with or without concomitant high-grade Ta or T1 papillary disease; and disease-free survival (DFS) in participants treated with TAR-200 alone with papillary disease only (Cohort 4).
Urinary Bladder Neoplasms
DRUG: TAR-200|BIOLOGICAL: Cetrelimab
Cohort 1, 2, and 3: Overall Complete Response (CR) Rate, Overall CR rate is defined as the percentage of participants achieving a CR at any time post-treatment. It will be measured by determining the percentage of participants without presence of high-grade disease using results from cystoscopy and centrally read urine cytology at any time point., Up to 5 years|Cohort 4: Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS will be measured as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to either the time of the first recurrence of high-risk disease, progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years
Cohort 1, 2, and 3: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined from the date of first CR achieved to the date of first evidence of recurrence or progression or death (whichever is earlier) for participants who achieve a CR., Up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to death; if a participant has not died at the time of analysis, the participant will be censored at the date last known alive., Up to 5 years|Cohort 1, 2, and 4: Concentrations of Gemcitabine and 2',2' difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) in Urine and Plasma, Concentrations of gemcitabine and its metabolite dFdU in urine and plasma will be assessed., Up to Week 21|Cohort 1 and 3: Serum Concentration of Anti-cetrelimab Antibodies, Serum concentration of anti-cetrelimab antibodies will be assessed using a validated immunoassay for anti-drug antibody (ADA) analysis., Predose, up to 3 years|Number of Participants with Anti-cetrelimab Antibodies, Number of participants with anti-cetrelimab antibodies will be reported., Predose, up to 3 years|Change from Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ) -C30 Scores, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a core 30-item questionnaire for evaluating the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of participants participating in cancer clinical studies. It incorporates 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea or vomiting), and a global health status or HRQoL scale. Ratings for each item range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much)., Baseline, up to 3 years and 4 months|Change from Baseline in EORTC QLQ- Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) 24 Scores, EORTC QLQ-NMIBC24 is a 24-item questionnaire for evaluating the HRQoL of participants with superficial (non-muscle-invasive) bladder cancer. The questionnaire is designed to supplement the QLQ-C30 and incorporates 6 multi-item scales and 5 single items. Ratings for each item range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much)., Baseline, up to 3 years and 4 months|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity Grades, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Severity grades ranges from Grade 1 (Mild) to Grade 5 (Death). Grade 1= Mild, Grade 2= Moderate, Grade 3= Severe, Grade 4= Life-threatening and Grade 5= Death related to adverse event., Up to 5 years
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall complete response (CR) rate in participants treated with TAR-200 in combination with cetrelimab (Cohort 1), or TAR-200 alone (Cohort 2), or cetrelimab alone (Cohort 3) with Carcinoma in Situ (CIS), with or without concomitant high-grade Ta or T1 papillary disease; and disease-free survival (DFS) in participants treated with TAR-200 alone with papillary disease only (Cohort 4).
