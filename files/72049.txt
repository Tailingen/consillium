Photodynamic Therapy of Primary Localized Prostate Cancer With the SpectraCure P18 System
The goal of this study is to obtain safety data, establish dose parameters, and effectiveness of treatment for the SpectraCure P18 System with IDOSE®, together with verteporfin for injection (VFI) as photosensitizer, for the treatment of primary localized prostate cancer.

The study will be divided into two parts, with Phase I, dose-escalation, to study safety and establish an effective light dose, followed by Phase II, cohort expansion, to evaluate clinical efficacy and confirm safety/tolerability. The subjects will be followed for a period of 18 months to determine the primary outcome. The long-term follow-up is an additional 18 months, i.e. a total of 36 months.

Interstitial Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) will be performed during general anesthesia. Optical fibers will be inserted into the prostate with a transperineal approach using transrectal ultrasound guidance. The intent is to deliver an adequate light dose throughout the prostate. Subjects will receive VFI intravenously, approximately 60-90 minutes prior to light delivery.

DEVICE: Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)|DRUG: Verteporfin Injection
Safety of treatment, Number of participants with treatment related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0 related to therapy per protocol.

Dose limiting toxicities are defined as grade 3 non-hematologic or grade 4 hematologic toxicities that are possibly, probably or definitely related to PDT., Within 4 weeks of treatment in each cohort.|Safety - Damage to the periprostatic tissue mediated by PDT, Potential damage to the periprostatic tissue will be evaluated by contrast-enhanced and not-contrast enhanced MRI., 5-9 days following PDT|Treatment efficacy, Percentage of subjects with negative in-field biopsies (histopathologically tumor-free), 6 and 18 months post PDT
Adequacy of effectiveness, Extent of quantifiable treatment effect in the prostate evaluated by MRI to determine the extent of necrosis in the prostate, Within 1 week following PDT|Treatment efficacy, Rate of negative in-field biopsy as defined by the Delphi consensus criterion (≤ 3 mm of Gleason ≤ 6 disease in any biopsy core is insignificant)., 6 and 18 months post PDT|Device performance, Light dose coverage \>90% of the target volume; evaluated by dose-volume histograms in \>80% of subjects, Day of PDT|Percentage of subjects with biochemical failure, Failure defined as a rise in PSA level of 2.0 ng/mL or more, over and above the nadir, 6 and 10 weeks, 6, 18, 24 and 36 months post PDT|Percentage of subjects with extra prostatic or distant disease, Remaining localized tumour will be evaluated by MRI, 6 and 18 months post PDT
