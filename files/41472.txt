18F-FDG Uptake Heterogeneity Predicts Pyrotinib Response
Heterogeneity of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake is a promising marker for predicting response to treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of pretreatment positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) 18F-FDG-based heterogeneity to predict the response to pyrotinib in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
