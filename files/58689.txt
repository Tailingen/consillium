Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of the PARP Inhibitor CEP-9722 in Participants With Solid Tumors
CEP-9722 is an inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase -1 and -2 (PARP). The primary purpose of this study is to (Part 1) determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CEP-9722 administered daily to participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, (Part 2) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of that dose, and to investigate whether CEP-9722 has antitumor activity as a single agent.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: CEP-9722
Part 1: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Oral CEP-9722, MTD was defined as the highest dose level with 0 or 1 participant experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1. DLT was defined as any adverse event (AE) that was considered by the investigator as related or potentially related to CEP-9722 as follows: 1) hematologic: grade 4 hematologic adverse events, grade 3 or greater febrile neutropenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting 7 days or more, grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; 2) nonhematologic: grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic AEs; grade 4 vomiting or diarrhea; grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that persisted for 48 hours or more despite optimal medical intervention; QTcF (QTc by Fridericia's cube root formula) greater than 500 milliseconds (msec) (confirmed by a repeat measurement on the same visit). During Cycle 1 of Part 1, any toxicity possibly related to treatment with CEP-9722 that caused a cumulative interruption of dosing for 7 or more days was considered dose limiting., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Part 2: Number of Participants With Adverse Events, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAEs were defined as death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all serious AEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section., Up to 8 months
Part 1: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of CEP-8983 (the Active Moiety of CEP-9722), Predose (0 hour), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1|Part 1: Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero to the Time of Last Measurable Drug Concentration (AUC0-t) of CEP-8983 (the Active Moiety of CEP-9722), Predose (0 hour), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours postdose on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1|Poly Adenosine Diphosphate-ribose (PAR) Concentration in Peripheral Blood Monocyte or Mononuclear Cells of CEP-8983 (the Active Moiety of CEP-9722), Predose (0 hour), 2 and 6 hours postdose on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1|Part 1: Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Percentage of Participants With the Best Tumor Response, ORR was assessed by the best tumor response (complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\], stable disease \[SD\], and progressive disease \[PD\]) during the study using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions., From the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (up to 168 days)|Part 2: Change in QT Interval, Day 1 and Day 15, Cycle 1
