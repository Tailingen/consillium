Transversus Abdominis Plane Blocks for Patients Undergoing Robotic Gynecologic Oncology Surgery
This study is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of pre-operative transverses abdominis plane (TAP) blocks on post-operative analgesia in patients undergoing robotic surgery for gynecologic cancers.
Gynecologic Cancer|Post-operative Pain
DRUG: Bupivicaine|DRUG: Placebo
24 Hour Post Operative Opioid Consumption, Converted to Intravenous Morphine Equivalents, 24 hours
Pain Scores, Pain scores by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) \[0-5, where 0 is no pain and 5 is extreme\] and Wisconsin Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) \[where 0 is no pain and 10 is the most painful\], will be collected 3 times post-operatively (once the day of surgery (at least 2 hours post-op) and both the morning and afternoon/evening on post-operative day #1). Pain scores will be analyzed individually using the chi-squared test and linear regression. All statistical calculations used a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and were calculated using the R Project for Statistical Computing. VAS and BPI scores for each subject were averaged to provide a resultant VAS and BPI score., from 2 hours post-op to the afternoon/evening of post-op day #1
