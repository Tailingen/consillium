Study of Lifileucel (LN-144), Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
Prospective, interventional multicenter study evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT) via infusion of LN-144 (autologous TIL) followed by interleukin 2 (IL-2) after a nonmyeloablative lymphodepletion (NMA LD) preconditioning regimen.
Metastatic Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Lifileucel
Disease Assessment for Objective Response Rate, Evaluate the efficacy of LN-144 in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma using the objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by the Blinded Independent Review Committee (BIRC) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, Every 6 weeks for 6 months, then every 3 months for a maximum of 60 months
Disease Assessment for Duration of Response, Evaluate the efficacy endpoints of duration of response (DOR) by the BIRC and by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Every 6 weeks for 6 months, then every 3 months for a maximum of 60 months|Disease Assessment for Disease Control Rate, Evaluate the efficacy endpoints of disease control rate (DCR) as assessed by the BIRC and by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Every 6 weeks for 6 months, then every 3 months for a maximum of 60 months|Disease Assessment for Progression-Free Survival, Evaluate the efficacy endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the BIRC and by the investigator per RECIST v1.1, Every 6 weeks for 6 months, then every 3 months for a maximum of 60 months|Overall Survival, Evaluate overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) by the investigator, Until death or up to 60 months|Adverse Events, Incidence rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs by severity and relationship to Lifileucel (LN-144)., Maximum 60 months
Lifileucel is an autologous adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes a TIL manufacturing process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. The adoptive cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a lymphocyte depleting preconditioning regimen, prior to infusion of autologous TIL, followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.
