Phase 2 Study of CA102N Combined With TAS-102 Compared to Bevacizumab Combined With TAS-102 in Subjects With Relapsed and/or Refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
HS-CA102N-103 is a Phase 2, randomized, open label study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CA102N combined with trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) compared to bevacizumab combined with TAS-102 in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who failed the standard treatment (for eg, cancer that has relapsed after or is refractory to fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy).

To evaluate the efficacy of CA102N in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) by progression free survival (PFS) rate., 16 weeks after first treatment.|Number of subjects with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, one year after first treatment.
Disease control rate (DCR), To evaluate the efficacy of CA102N in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) by disease control rate., 16 weeks after first treatment.|Overall response rate (ORR), To evaluate the efficacy of CA102N in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) by overall response rate., 16 weeks after first treatment.|Maximum Plasma Concentration [Cmax] of CA102N when used in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102), 16 weeks after first treatment.|To evaluate the efficacy of CA102N in combination with trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) by overall survival (OS)., one year after first treatment.
Protein expression level of pharmacodynamic biomarkers, 16 weeks after first treatment.|Quality of life measured by European Organization for the research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)., one year after first treatment.
HS-CA102N-103 is a Phase 2, randomized, open label study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CA102N combined with trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102) compared to bevacizumab combined with TAS-102 in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who failed the standard treatment (for eg, cancer that has relapsed after or is refractory to fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy).

In this study, the safety, tolerability, and PFS of CA102N in combination with TAS-102 compared to bevacizumab combined with TAS-102 will be evaluated in up to 100 subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) biological therapy, and if RAS wild-type mCRC, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy.
