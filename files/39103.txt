L218CAR19 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
L218CAR19 is a kind of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy targeting CD19 on B cells. The goal of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of L218CAR19 in patients with B-cell lymphomas who have received at least two lines of systemic treatment.
Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Lymphomas
DRUG: L218CAR19
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Occurrence of DLTs, Up to 4 weeks|Treatment-emergent adverse event (AE), Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs, Up to 1 year
Quantification of L218CAR19 in peripheral blood, To quantify L218CAR19 in a patient's peripheral blood at different time points, Up to 1 year|Time to reach Cmax (Tmax) of L218CAR19, To identify the time point when the concentration of L218CAR19 reaches maximum in a patient's peripheral blood, Up to 3 months|Area under the curve (AUC) of L218CAR19, To quantify the cumulative amount of L218CAR19 in a patient's peripheral blood over time, Up to 3 months|Clearance (CL) of L218CAR19, To determine the clearance factor of L218CAR19 in a patient's peripheral blood, Up to 3 months|Immunogenic response to L218CAR19, To evaluate the anti-drug antibodies in response to L218CAR19 administration in a patient's peripheral blood, Up to 1 year|Serum cytokine concentrations, To measure the cytokine levels (e.g. TNFa, IL-6, IL-1, IL-2, etc.) in a patient's peripheral blood at different time points, Up to 3 months|ORR, To determine the overall (best) objective anti-cancer response by Lugano criteria, Up to 1 year|PFS, To evaluate the duration of patient's progression-free survival, Up to 1 year|OS, To evaluate the overall duration of patient's survival, Up to 1 year
