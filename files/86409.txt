Trial of Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib in Patients With Advanced BRAFV600 Mutant Melanoma
This trial explores the immunologic effects of vemurafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor), administered alone and in combination, to patients with advanced BRAF V600E/K mutant melanoma.
Melanoma
DRUG: Cobimetinib|DRUG: Vemurafenib
Safety and tolerability of cobimetinib monotherapy and combination vemurafenib/cobimetinib in subjects with advanced melanoma., compare immunologic changes described above with the development of study treatment-related adverse events. For example, severity or extent of rash from cobimetinib (a well-described dermatologic toxicity of MEK inhibitors) may be compared to levels of intratumoral immune activation assessed by one or more of the parameters., 2 years
Anti-tumor activity of cobimetinib monotherapy and combination vemurafenib/cobimetinib in subjects with advanced melanoma., compare immunologic changes described above with therapeutic outcomes, including CR, PR, SD, and PD measured by RECIST 1.1. For example, tumor regression may be correlated with levels of intratumoral immune activation or expression of immune checkpoints assessed by one or more of the parameters, 2 years
