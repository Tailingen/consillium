Azacitidine in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Previously Untreated or Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia Who Are Unsuitable For Intensive Chemotherapy
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well azacitidine works in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia who are unsuitable for treatment with intensive chemotherapy.
Leukemia
DRUG: azacytidine
Best response (complete or partial response), within 6 months
Time to response, is defined as the time from trial registration until the date the criteria for either CR or PR are first met|Response duration, is defined as the time from the date when the criteria for either CR or PR were first met until the date of relapse or death from any cause.|Best response status, within 6 months|Time to hematological improvement (HI), is calculated for patients with HI and is defined as the time from trial registration until the date the criteria for HI are first met.|Duration of HI, is defined as the time from the date when the criteria for HI were first met until the date of relapse or death from any cause.|Event-free survival, is defined as the time from trial registration until progression, relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.|Overall survival, is defined as the time from trial registration until death from any cause.|Adverse events according to NCI CTCAE v3.0, according to NCI CTCAE v3.0|Adjusted hospitalization time, is defined as the time (nights) spent in hospital as a proportion of treatment duration (days).
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To evaluate the efficacy of azacitidine in patients with newly diagnosed or untreated acute myeloid leukemia who are unsuitable for induction type chemotherapy because of age or relevant comorbidities.

Secondary

* To evaluate survival and adverse events.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.
