The Safety and Efficacy of Zoledronic Acid in the Prevention of Cancer Therapy Induced Bone Loss
This study examines the safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid 4 mg., given every 3 months over 24 months (infusion at month 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21) in improving bone mineral density in premenopausal women with hormone receptor negative breast cancer and adjuvant chemotherapeutic treatment

Change in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Measured by Dual (Energy) X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at Lumbar Spine (L2-L4) From Baseline to Month 24, Bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA at lumbar spine (L2-L4); DXA assessments of the BMD at dual hips. (BMD). Two X-ray beams with different energy levels are aimed at the patient's bones. When soft tissue absorption is subtracted out, the BMD can be determined from the absorption of each beam by bone., baseline, month 24|Change in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Lumbar Spine (L2-L4) From Baseline to Month 24 or Last Visit Measure by T-score, Bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine (L2-L4) by T-score. Your T-score is the number of units that your bone density is above or below the average. -1 and above-bone density is considered normal; Between -1 and -2.5-is a sign of osteopenia, a condition in which bone density is below normal and may lead to osteoporosis. -2.5 and below-indicates that it is likely osteoporosis., baseline, month 24|Change in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Lumbar Spine (L2-L4) From Baseline to Month 24 or Last Visit Measure by Z-score, Bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine (L2-L4) measured by Z-score. If Z-score is -2 or lower, it may suggest that something other than aging is causing abnormal bone loss., baseline, month 24|Percent Change in Bone Mineral Density for L2-L4 From Baseline to Month 24 or Last Visit, Bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine (L2-L4) measured by using Lunar or Hologic dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) Instruments. Measurements were done in the lumbar vertebrae (L2-L4), baseline, month 24
Percentage Change in Bone Mineral Density for Femoral Neck (Right and Left Side) From Baseline to Month 24, Bone mineral density (BMD) for femoral neck (right and left side) is measured by using Lunar or Hologic dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) Instruments. Measurements were done on femoral neck (right and left side), baseline, month 24|Percentage Change in Bone Mineral Density for Total Femoral Neck (Right and Left Side) From Baseline to Month 24, Bone mineral density (BMD) for total femoral neck (right and left side) is measured by using Lunar or Hologic dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) Instruments. Measurements were done on femoral neck (right and left side), baseline, month 24|Change in Bone Mineral Density Os Calcis (Right and Left Side) From Baseline to Month 24 as Measured by Speed of Sound (SOS), Bone mineral density (BMD) for Os calcis (right and left side) is measured by SOS; SOS is a Quantitative ultrasonography scanning and measures bone mass and strength and assesses bone microarchitecture by detecting the transmission of high-frequency sound waves through bone., baseline, month 24|Change in Bone Mineral Density Os Calcis (Right and Left Side) From Baseline to Month 24 as Measured by Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (BUA), Bone mineral density (BMD) for Os calcis (right and left side) is measured by BUA; BUA is a Quantitative ultrasonography scanning and measures bone mass and strength and assesses bone microarchitecture by detecting the transmission of high-frequency sound waves through bone., baseline, month 24|Change in Bone Mineral Density Phalanges II, III, IV, and V From Baseline to Month 24 or Last Visit as Measured by Amplitude-dependent Speed of Sound (ADSOS), Bone mineral density (BMD) for Phalanges II, III, IV, and V is measured by ADSOS; ADSOS is a Quantitative ultrasonography scanning and measures bone mass and strength and assesses bone microarchitecture by detecting the transmission of high-frequency sound waves through bone., baseline, month 24|Change in Serum CTX-carboxy-terminal Collagen Crosslinks From Baseline to Month 24, CTX is a telopeptide that can be used as a biomarker in the serum to measure the rate of bone turnover. The test used to detect the CTX marker is specific to bone resorption., baseline, month 24|Change in Aminoterminal Propeptide on Type I Procollagen (P1NP) From Baseline to Month 24, Change in Aminoterminal propeptide on type I procollagen (P1NP) from baseline to month 24. P1NP is a marker for bone formation. It is a specific indicator of type 1 collagen deposition. P1NP is increased in states of high bone turnover, baseline, month 24|Change in Estradiol (E2) From Baseline to Month 24, Change in Estradiol from baseline to month 24, baseline, month 24|Change in Follicle- Stimulating Hormone (FSH) From Baseline to Month 24, Change in Follicle- Stimulating Hormone (FSH) from baseline to month 24, baseline, month 24|Change in Testosterone From Baseline to Month 24, Change in Testosterone from baseline to month 24, baseline, month 24|Change in Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHGB) From Baseline to Month 24, Change in Sex Hormone binding globulin (SHGB) from baseline to month 24, baseline, month 24|Change in Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) From Baseline to Month 24, Change in Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) from baseline to month 24, baseline, month 24|Change in Vitamine D From Baseline to Month 24, Change in Vitamine D from baseline to month 24, baseline, month 24|Change in Anti-Mueller Hormone (AMH) From Baseline to Month 24, Change in anti-Mueller hormone (AMH) from baseline to month 24, baseline, month 24|Change in Inhibin A and Inhibin B From Baseline to Month 24, Change in Inhibin A and Inhibin B from baseline to month 24, baseline, month 24
