Intermittent Fasting Using a Fasting-Mimicking Diet to Improve Prostate Cancer Control and Metabolic Outcomes
This is a Phase 2, randomized two-armed, multi-site study of 138 patients with metastatic castrate sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive the fasting mimicking diet, or usual diet. All patients will receive standard of care treatment for their prostate cancer. The fasting mimicking diet will be consumed for 5 days per month for a total of 6 months and will be monitored by trained research dietitians.

This study aims to examine the effects of a fasting mimicking diet (5 days per month eating L-Nutra products only for 6 months) vs. usual diet on response to cancer treatment of metastatic castrate sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma.
Prostate Adenocarcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: Fasting Mimicking Diet (FMD)|BEHAVIORAL: Standard Anti-Cancer Diet
Response to cancer treatment, Will be measured by the proportion of patients who achieved PSA nadir â‰¤0.2 ng/dL at any time point within the 6-month study and absolute PSA nadir., 6 Month visit
Castration resistance 1, will be measured by Testosterone (ng/dl), 6 Month visit|Castration resistance 2, will be measured by PSA levels (ng/mL), 6 Month visit|Metabolic Toxicity 1, Will be measured by the changes in HbA1c, Change from Baseline to 6 Month visit|Metabolic Toxicity 2, Will be measured by the changes in waist circumference, Change from Baseline to 6 Month visit|Metabolic Toxicity 3, Will be measured by the changes in fat mass (assessed via bioelectrical expedience), Change from Baseline to 6 Month visit|Metabolic Toxicity 4, Will be measured by the changes in body weight, Change from Baseline to 6 Month visit|Self-reported overall well-being, will be measured in changes in the scores calculated from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) questionnaire. Scores can range from 12-56 with a higher score indicating a better outcome., Change from Baseline to 6 Month visit|Self-reported energy levels, will be measured in changes in the scores calculated from the Godin leisure-time physical activity questionnaire. Scores can range from 0 and above, with a higher score indicating a better physical activity outcome., Change from Baseline to 6 Month visit
