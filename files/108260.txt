Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) for Treatment of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases
Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is a naturally occuring omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid found in oily fish. EPA has anti-colorectal (bowel) cancer activity in experimental models. This trial will test whether EPA reduces markers of tumour growth, and is safe and well tolerated,in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases awaiting surgery.
