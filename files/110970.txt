Study to Evaluate Ibudilast and TMZ Combo Treatment in Newly Diagnosed and Recurrent Glioblastoma
Part 1 is an open-label, single-arm, dose escalation study of MN-166 (ibudilast) and temozolomide (TMZ) combination treatment. Evaluate safety and tolerability of ibudilast (MN-166) and TMZ combination treatment for 1 cycle (28 days); determine dosage in dose-finding study. Part 2 will evaluate efficacy of fixed-dose MN-166 (ibudilast) and TMZ combination treatment for 6 cycles (\~6 months) until disease progression, unacceptable tolerability and/or toxicity or loss of life.

This is a single-center open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of MN-166 (ibudilast) and Temozolomide combination treatment in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma. To be eligible, subjects are histologically confirmed glioblastoma or gliosarcoma, or astrocytomas with molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO Grade 4. Recurrent glioblastoma patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥70 or Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Patients having newly diagnosed glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, or astrocytomas with molecular features of glioblastoma must have a KPS ≥60 and ECOG score 0-1. This is divided into a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) followed by a fixed-dose phase (Part 2).

Part 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of MN-166 when given in combination with temozolomide, and determine the dose of MN-166 to be used in Part 2 of the study. Up to 18 adult subjects are planned to be enrolled in Part 1.

Part 2 will evaluate the efficacy of MN-166 and temozolomide combination treatment as measured by the proportion of subjects who are progression-free at 6 months. Other outcome measures include the evaluation of overall survival, response rate, and median six-month progression-free survival up to 2 years and up to 50 subjects are planned to be enrolled in Part 2.
