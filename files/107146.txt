FOLFOXIRI Plus Bevacizumab With or Without Atezolizumab as 1st Line Treatment of pMMR and IS IC-High Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the addition of Atezolizumab to FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab as first line treatment of patients with pMMR and Immunoscore IC-high metastatic colorectal cancer in terms of Progression Free Survival (PFS).
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Irinotecan (CPT-11)|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Fluorouracil (5-FU)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive, on study and progression free at the time of the analysis. Alive patients having no tumor assessments after baseline will have time to event censored on the date of randomization., 24 months
Overall Toxicity Rate, Overall Toxicity Rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, experiencing any adverse event, according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 5.0), during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment., 24 months|Toxicity Rate, Toxicity Rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, experiencing a specific adverse event of grade 3/4, according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 5.0), during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment., 24 months|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment. The determination of clinical response will be based on investigator reported measurements. Responses will be evaluated every 8 weeks., 24 months|Immuno-related Objective Response Rate, Immuno-related Objective Response Rate (irORR) is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, according to immune-modified RECIST criteria, during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment. The determination of clinical response will be based on investigator reported measurements. Responses will be evaluated every 8 weeks., 24 months|Early Objective Response Rate, Early Objective Response Rate (EOR) is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of the enrolled subjects, achieving a â‰¥20% decrease in the sum of diameters of RECIST target lesions at week 8 compared to baseline., up to 2 months from randomization|Depth of Response, Depth of Response (DpR) is defined as the relative change in the sum of longest diameters of RECIST target lesions at the nadir, in the absence of new lesions or progression of non-target lesions, when compared with baseline., 24 months|R0 Resection Rate, R0 Resection Rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, undergoing secondary R0 resection of metastases. Secondary R0 surgery is defined as microscopically margin free complete surgical removal of all residual disease, performed during treatment or after its completion, allowed by tumoral shrinkage and/or disappearance of one or more lesions., 24 months|Duration of Response, Duration of Response (DoR) is defined as the time from first documentation of objective response (complete \[CR\] or partial \[PR\] response, per RECIST 1.11) to the first documentation of PD (per RECIST 1.1) or to death to any cause, whichever comes first., 24 months|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. For patients still alive at the time of analysis, the OS time will be censored on the last date the patients were known to be alive., 48 months|Quality of Life as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains functional scales, symptom scales, single items scale and a global health status/QoL scale. Raw scores are standardized and converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent better functioning on the functional scales and a higher level of symptoms on the symptom scales. Quality of life will be evaluated for patients who will have completed at least one questionnaire item at baseline and during the study period through descriptive summary statistics., Questionnaires will be administered at baseline, every 4 weeks during induction treatment, every 8 weeks thereafter, at the time of evidence of disease progression, after 30 days following end of study treatment/disease progression.|Quality of Life as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Module for Colorectal cancer 29 (EORTC QLQ-CR29)., The EORTC QLQ-CR29 includes 29 items that evaluate symptoms (gastrointestinal, urinary, pain and others) and functional areas (sexual, body image and others) that are associated with CRC and its treatments. There are separate items for patients with and without a stoma and separate items to evaluate the sexual function of men and women. Raw scores are standardized and converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores represent better functioning on the functional scales and a higher level of symptoms on the symptom scales. Quality of life will be evaluated for patients who will have completed at least one questionnaire item at baseline and during the study period through descriptive summary statistics., Questionnaires will be administered at baseline, every 4 weeks during induction treatment, every 8 weeks thereafter, at the time of evidence of disease progression, after 30 days following end of study treatment/disease progression.|Time To Deterioration in Quality of Life (TTD), The time from baseline to the first onset of a 10-point or greater decrease from baseline for functional scales or a 10-point or greater increase for symptom scales or death., 24 months
This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter phase III randomized trial in which patients with initially unresectable, previously untreated pMMR and Immunoscore IC-high mCRC will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive induction treatment with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab up to 8 cycles followed by maintenance with 5-FU/LV plus bevacizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal (arm A) or FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab plus atezolizumab up to 8 cycles followed by maintenance with 5-FU/LV plus bevacizumab plus atezolizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal (arm B).

Stratification factors will be ECOG Performance Status (0 versus 1, 2), primary tumour location (right versus left/rectum) and liver metastases (yes versus no).

The second- and subsequent lines of treatment will be at investigators' choice.
