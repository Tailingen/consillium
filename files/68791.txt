Quality Control Study of Laparoscopic Sentinel Node Biopsy in Early Gastric Cancer
Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy and stomach preserving surgery in ealry gastric cancer is less invasive method which can increase quality of life. Multicenter phase III trial is requred to validate this method. In this study all items which are necessary for laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy are identified according to checklist and evaluated the performance completement.
Early Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy
Completement of performance of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy, Investigators will make out a checklist after operation for evaluating the completement of performance of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy. The checklist will be made out within 24 hours., within 24 hours after operation
Detection rate of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node, learning curve, Detection rate of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node is evaluated within 7 days after operation by pathological examination. Learning curve can be drawn after all cases' data are collected, so it takes upto 2 years., upto 2 years
