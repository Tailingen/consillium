This phase 1 clinical study is an open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation, dose-expansion, safety, PK, PD study of BR105. The phase 1 protocol will have 2 parts: a single agent dose escalation phase (Part 1) and dose expansion phase (Part 2). Approximately 40-162 adult patients are expected to be enrolled in the study.

The starting dose for phase I is 0.2 mg/kg, followed by 6 dose cohorts (1, 3, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg/kg). Duration of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) observation is 21 days. Each subject will receive an intravenous infusion of BR105 on day 1 and be observed for 21 days after a single dose. Then Each subject will receive BR105 weekly.
