Efficacy and Safety of Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Treatment +/- UV1 Vaccination in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
A Randomized, Multicenter Study Investigating Efficacy and Safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1-treatment +/- UV1 vaccination as first line treatment in patients with inoperable advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The objective of the phase 2 study is to induce a meaningful Progression-Free Survival (PFS) benefit in patients with stage IIIB/IIIC or stage IV NSCLC by treating with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and UV1 vaccination versus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment alone.

Progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1) as determined by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Evaluate and compare the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1-treatment with or without UV1 vaccination in patients with stage IIIB/IIIC or stage IV NSCLC., Up to 2 years
Response evaluation, Comparison of response rate according to RECIST v1.1 in patients who receive anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and patients who receive anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in combination with UV1., Throughout trial (up to 2 years)|monitoring AE, evaluate safety and tolerability in patients who receive anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and patients who receive anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in combination with UV1., continously and until 4 months after discontinuation of study treatment
molecular characterization and analyses, investigate for possible biological markers for response, resistance and toxicity, up to 2 years|immunophenotyping or characterization of the immune cell subsets in the periphery, Investigate immunological responses., In biological samples collected at screening, visit 5/6, end-of-treatment, safety visit and first follow-up visit.|To investigate the role of PET/CT in early response evaluation, PET-CT will be taken at predefined time-points for a subset of patients, up to 2 years
The objective of the phase 2 study is to induce a meaningful Progression-Free Survival (PFS) benefit in patients with stage IIIB/IIIC or stage IV NSCLC by treating with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and UV1 vaccination versus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment alone.

Patients are randomized to receive anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment until progression or unacceptable toxicity, for a maximum of 2 years, with or without 8 injections of 300 μg UV1 and 75 μg GM-CSF (UV1 vaccination). Patients randomized to UV1 vaccination, will start UV1 vaccination the same day as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment is initiated, followed by three vaccinations over the next ten days. Thereafter, one vaccination per anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment cycle (c2-5), totaling to 8 UV1 vaccinations
