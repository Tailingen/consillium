Dendritic Cell Vaccine for Children and Adults With Sarcoma
The purpose if this study is to evaluate an investigational vaccine using patient-derived dendritic cells (DC), a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections in the body, (DC) (a vaccine made out of participants' own cells and tumor) to treat sarcoma.

BIOLOGICAL: Dendritic Cells Vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: Lysate of Tumor|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Imiquimod|PROCEDURE: Leukapheresis
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, To demonstrate that DC vaccination loaded with tumor lysate is feasible and that therapy with the vaccine with topical imiquimod (as final step in vaccine maturation), with or without the inhibition of MDSC by gemcitabine pre-treatment, is safe in pediatric and adult subjects with metastatic and refractory sarcoma., From Day 1 to 30 Days Post-Treatment, about 9 months
Measurement levels of Myeloid Derived Supressor Cells before and after treatment, To explore biomarkers of immune response. Assessment will include measurement of levels of Myeloid Derived Supressor Cells before and after treatment and T and B cell subsets before and after treatment., From Baseline to 3 Months Post-Treatment, up to 12 months|Progression-free survival, To obtain preliminary clinical benefit by evaluating progression-free survival (PFS)in patients receiving this DC vaccine with or without gemcitabine pre-treatment. PFS is defined as the time elapsed from the start of treatment to the date of documented progression or death, whichever comes first. For surviving patients without progression who begin alternative treatment, PFS will be censored at the last date of documented progression-free status prior to starting alternative treatment. Similarly, losses to follow up will be censored at the last date of documented progression-free status., Up to 24 months Post-Treatment|Overall Survival, To obtain preliminary clinical benefit by evaluating overall survival in patients receiving this DC vaccine with or without gemcitabine pre-treatment. Overall survival is defined as the time elapsed from the start of treatment until death. For surviving patients, follow-up will be censored at the date of last contact., Up to 5 years Post-Treatment|The rate of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) in subjects receiving treatment, To obtain preliminary clinical benefit by evaluating response rate (RR) in patients receiving this DC vaccine with or without gemcitabine pre-treatment. Response will be assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria, version 1.1., Up to 24 months Post-Treatment|Measurement levels of Myeloid Derived Supressor Cells after Gemcitabine treatment, To determine if gemcitabine is effective in the inhibition and depletion of Myeloid Derived Supressor Cells in the study patients., From Baseline to End of Treatment, about 10 months
