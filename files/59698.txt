Evaluating 18F-FDG PET/CT With Liver SUVmax-based Criteria for Prognosis of Patients With Natural Killer/T-cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative interpretation using the liver SUVmax as reference can better interpret 18F- FDG PET/CT and predict disease progression during chemotherapy or survival in NK/T-cell lymphoma.
Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell
DEVICE: 18F-FDG PET/CT
Change from baseline in summed standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of lesion after 2 or 4 cycles, baseline(diagnosed by pathology and before chemotherapy) and 2 or 4 cycles after starting chemotherapy (each cycle 21days)]
3 year progression-free survival, up to 3 years after initial diagnosis
In this study investigators develope a semi-quantitative interpretation using the liver SUVmax as reference to interpret 18F-FDG PET/CT. Positive lesions in PET were indicated as SUVmax of residues higher than the threshold or new 18F-FDG avid lesions. Investigators compare the prognostic accuracy of the liver SUVmax-based criteria with the 5-PS criteria and Î”SUVmax interpretation with respect to predicting disease progression during chemotherapy or survival in NK/T-cell lymphoma. Furthermore,investigators improve the prognostic ability of interim PET/CT by comparing the results to the clinical prognostic factors.
