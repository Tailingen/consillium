Prognostic Relevance of Biological Subtype in Breast Cancer
Recently, the investigators face "on the edges" for treatment decision to decide adjuvant systemic treatment, especially for patients who show discordance between stage and tumor biology. The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic relevance of the TNM staging system and intrinsic subtype in breast cancer patients who received curative surgery.
Breast Cancer
Overall survival, was measured from the first date of diagnosis of breast cancer to the date of death or the last follow-up visit, 1 year
Recurrence-free survival, was defined as the time from the date of curative resection to the date when breast cancer recurred, irrespective of locoregional recurrences including ipsilateral and contralateral breast recurrences or distant metastases., 1 Year
Identified patients who received curative surgery for stage I-III breast cancer and had available data on immunohistochemistry profiles including hormone receptor status (HR) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and Ki 67 staining at Samsung Medical Center from January 2004 to September 2008. Primary outcomes were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).
