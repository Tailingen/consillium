A Safety, PK and Efficacy Study of CC-92480 Monotherapy and in Combination With Dexamethasone in Subjects With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM)
This is an open-label, multi-center, international, Phase 1/2 study to assess the safety, PK and efficacy of CC-92480 monotherapy and in combination with dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).

All eligible subjects must be previously treated with at least 3 prior regimens including lenalidomide, pomalidomide, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and be refractory to their last line of therapy.
