MRS and 11C-methionine PET/CT in the Diagnosis of Glioma
MET PET and MRS are often performed as imaging tool for the differential diagnosis of gliomas. But both techniques have limitations causing misdiagnosis; thus, the investigators tried to combine these two imaging tools to study whether the combination of MET PET and MRS could raise the diagnosis ability of the radiological diagnosis of gliomas.
