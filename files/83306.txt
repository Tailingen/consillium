Post-Marketing Assessment of Immunogenicity and Safety of UnituxinÂ® in High-Risk Neuroblastoma Patients
The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) in high-risk neuroblastoma patients treated with Unituxin combination therapy.
Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Dinutuximab
To Determine the Incidence of Human Anti-chimeric Antibody (HACA) in High-risk Neuroblastoma Patients Treated With Unituxin Combination Therapy., Seven blood samples were collected at the following time points for the evaluation of HACA levels:

* Course 1- Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
* Course 2- Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
* Course 3- Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
* Course 4- Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
* Course 5- Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
* Course 6- Prior to the first dose of 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA)
* Study termination (approximately 2 weeks following the final 13-cis-retinoic acid dose), Approximately 6 months
To Determine the Incidence of Targeted Immune-related Adverse Events (AEs) During Treatment With Dinutuximab Combination Therapy in High-risk Neuroblastoma Subjects., The incidence of targeted immune-related adverse events (AEs) during treatment with dinutuximab combination therapy in high-risk neuroblastoma subjects were summarized and listed., Approximately 6 months|To Determine the Incidence of Neutralizing Antibody (NAb) in Patients With Human Anti-chimeric Antibody (HACA) Positive Samples., Incidence of neutralizing antibody (NAb) in patients with human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) positive samples was summarized and listed., Approximately 6 months|To Determine the Effect of HACA on Dinutuximab Plasma Concentrations., Ten blood samples were collected at the following time points for the evaluation of dinutuximab plasma concentrations:

* Course 1- Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
* Course 2- Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
* Course 3- Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
* Course 4- Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
* Course 5- Prior to the first Unituxin infusion
* Course 6- Prior to the first dose of 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA)
* Study termination (approximately 2 weeks following the final 13-cis-retinoic acid dose).

An additional 3 blood samples were obtained for the evaluation of dinutuximab plasma concentrations. Each of these blood samples was obtained immediately following the fourth dinutuximab infusion in Courses 1, 3, and 5., Approximately 6 months
This was a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label study in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma to assess the immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of Unituxin combination therapy. Patients enrolled in the study were prescribed Unituxin for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma.
