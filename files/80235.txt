Consultation data will be analysed from up to 24 cancer patients in remission receiving routine treatment at Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution. Each participant will visit the institution in accordance with the protocol which includes up to 9 months of FL Nourish capsule (FLNC) use and up to 8 consultation visits. Participants will be evaluated based on consultation data, questionnaire data, routine blood test data and self-reporting of adverse events or severe adverse events. As this is a non-interventional observational study, all participants would have received FLNC prescriptions according to routine diagnostic and prescribing standards, and there were no additional visits required aside from routine follow up consultations.
