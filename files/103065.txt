Hepatectomy|Hepatecellular Carcinoma|Cirrhosis
PROCEDURE: Hepatectomy
Safety of surgery for HCC, The primary endpoint was the validation of our selection criteria for safe hepatectomy for HCC in regards to postoperative complications. The role of total bilirubin and cholinesterases was analzyed together with other clinical parameters., 90 days
Score systems HCC, The secondary endpoint was the testing of the most common score systems for HCC, which are the CPT score, the MELD score, and the APRI score., 90 days
All consecutive patients submitted to hepatectomy for HCC based on the same preoperative selection criteria from our prospectively-maintained liver unit database. Such criteria included the value of bilirubin (BIL), the value of cholinesterases (CHE), the presence of ascites, the presence of esophageal varices, and the rate of residual liver volume.
