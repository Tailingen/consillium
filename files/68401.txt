Dose-escalation Study of Ultra-high Dose Ablative Radiosurgery With Immunotherapy for Bulky Metastatic Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine whether cytoreduction of bulky metastatic disease using ultra high dose SBRT in combination with immunotherapy is tolerable and feasible In patients who have exhausted SoC treatment options.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Atezolizumab|RADIATION: Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SBRT)
Maximum tolerated dose of ultra-high dose Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SBRT) for 3 different body sites, Maximum tolerated dose of ultra-high dose SBRT for 3 different body sites (i.e., peripheral lung, mediastinum-central lung, and abdomen-pelvis), 1 Month
Evaluate the number of participants receiving ultra-high dose ablative radiosurgery with immunotherapy who develop treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To assess the safety of ultra-high dose SBRT with concurrent and adjuvant atezolizumab in participants with cancer who have exhausted standard of care treatment options, Enrollment to 1 month after end of SBRT treatment (approximately 2 months)|Overall tumor response rate to ultra-high dose SBRT for 3 different body sites, To assess the overall tumor response rate of participants receiving ultra-high dose SBRT with concurrent and adjuvant atezolizumab, Pre-treatment to 3 and 6 months after SBRT (approximately 7 months)|Progression-Free Survival of participants receiving ultra-high dose Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SBRT) with concurrent and adjuvant atezolizumab, To assess the progression-free survival of participants receiving ultra-high dose SBRT with concurrent and adjuvant atezolizumab in participants with cancer who have exhausted standard of care treatment options., Up to 2 years|Overall Survival of participants receiving ultra-high dose Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SBRT) with concurrent and adjuvant atezolizumab, To assess the overall survival of participants receiving ultra-high dose SBRT with concurrent and adjuvant atezolizumab in participants with cancer who have exhausted standard of care treatment options, Up to 2 years
Patients that provide informed consent will undergo a 30-day screening period to determine eligibility for the trial. If eligible, patients will begin treatment on SBRT (delivered to metastases over 3-5 fractions within 1-2 weeks) with concurrent and adjuvant atezolizumab (1680 mg on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle) immunotherapy regimen for up to one year.
