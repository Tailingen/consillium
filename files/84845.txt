Role of FAPI PET/MR Combined With Gadoxetate Disodium in Assessing Hepatic Malignancies
This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the utility of fibroblast activation protein inhibitor (FAPI) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) combined with gadoxetate disodium in patients with clinical suspected hepatic malignancies (lesion diameter â‰¤ 3.0cm), with histopathological findings obtained from biopsy or resected surgical specimens, or follow-up results as reference standards.
Hepatic Malignancies
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: FAPI PET/MR combined with gadoxetate disodium
Diagnostic performance, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values, through study completion, an average of 2 years
Quantitative parameters of PET/MR, the maximum standardized uptake value and tumour-to-background ratios, completed within one week after the PET examination
1. Clinical and biological data, including the course of disease, underlying liver disease (hepatitis or cirrhosis), serum alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels were collected from each patient.
2. PET image analysis: Each patient underwent both FAPI and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/MR, including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MRI. Record and evaluate the following indicators: the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of lesions, the target-to-background ratio (TBR) which was calculated by dividing the SUVmax of the lesion by the background SUVmean obtained from nontumor liver tissue.
3. Pathological analysis: Hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical analyses will be performed. Immunohistochemical analysis will be used to investigate the expression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP).
