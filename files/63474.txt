Study of Crenolanib in Recurrent/Refractory Glioblastoma With PDGFRA Gene Amplification
This is a proof of concept, single-arm study to investigate crenolanib monotherapy in patients with recurrent/refractory glioblastoma with PDGFRA gene amplification by assessing the progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months. Crenolanib will be given orally starting at 100 mg TID continuously until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.
Recurrent/Refractory Glioblastoma

This is a proof of concept, single-arm study to investigate crenolanib monotherapy in patients with recurrent/refractory glioblastoma with PDGFRA gene amplification. Eligible patients include those with recurrent/refractory glioblastoma after prior therapy including surgery, radiation, and temozolomide. The trial is designed to assess the anti-tumor activity of crenolanib in recurrent/refractory glioblastoma with PDGFRA gene amplification based on the estimation of progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months. Symptom burden will be evaluated using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor (MDASI-BT).

Crenolanib will be administered orally continuously at 100 mg TID on a 28-day cycle basis . Patients are allowed to receive crenolanib for a maximum of 26 cycles if clinical benefit has been observed.
