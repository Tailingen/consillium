Efficacy and Safety of Chemotherapy With XELOX (Oxaliplatin + Capecitabine) and Bevacizumab in Combination With Adebrelimab in First-line Treatment of Microsatellite Stable (MSS) Initially Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chemotherapy With XELOX (Oxaliplatin + Capecitabine) and Bevacizumab in Combination With Adebrelimab in First-line Treatment of Microsatellite Stable (MSS) Initially Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Adebrelimab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) denotes the chances of staying free of disease progression for a group of individuals suffering from a cancer after a particular treatment., Up to 2 years
Organ retention rate, The proportion of patients who achieved pre-specified tumor volume reduction and maintained the minimum time limit was the sum of complete and partial responses., Up to 2 years|Overall survival, The proportion of participants who remain survival at 2 years, Up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate, The percentage of patients with advanced cancer whose therapeutic intervention has led to a complete response, partial response, or stable disease., Up to 2 years|Surgical conversion rate, The rate of conversion to surgery., Up to 2 years|TRAEs, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 2 years
At present, the survival benefit of MSS mCRC patients is limited, and the general survival time is only about 3-4 months. Up to now, the standard treatment plan is FOLFOX combined with bevacizumab. AtezoTRIBE study shows that compared with FOLFOXIRI+ bevacizumab, the standard treatment plan is better than the standard treatment plan. The combination of PD-L1 monomone attillizumab extended mPFS from 11.4 months to 12.9 months, showing certain efficacy, and the combination of Attillizumab did not increase adverse reactions. Based on the above, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy with XELOX (oxaliplatin + capecitabine) regimen and bevacizumab combined with adbelizumab in first-line treatment of microsatellite stable (MSS) type of initial unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.
