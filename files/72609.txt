A Study of Anti-Cancer Therapies Targeting the MAPK Pathway in Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 in combination with other cancer therapies in study participants with hematologic malignancies.
* To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Dose (RD) of ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 administered in combination with other cancer therapies.
* To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 in combination with other cancer therapies in study participants with hematologic malignancies.
* To evaluate the PK profiles of ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 and other cancer therapies when administered in combination.

This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, multicenter master protocol evaluating safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 in combination with other cancer therapies in study participants with hematologic malignancies. The study will commence with dose escalation cohorts (ERAS-007 plus gilteritinib and ERAS-601 plus gilteritinib) in study participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) Feline McDonough sarcoma (FMS)-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Dose expansion will follow and will evaluate ERAS-007 or ERAS-601 drug combinations administered at the RD identified from each respective dose escalation cohort in study participants with R/R FLT-3 mutated AML.
