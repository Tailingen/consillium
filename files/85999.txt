Comparison of Robot Assisted Thoracic Surgery With Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery in Case of Lung Cancer
In this study the investigator will compare the effectiveness of robot assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) with video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in case of lung cancer.

The perioperative circumstances and postoperative outcome will be compared.
Lung Cancer|Postoperative Pain|Blood Loss|Inflammatory Response
PROCEDURE: Robot assited thoracic surgery|PROCEDURE: Video assited thoracic surgery
Postoperative pain, 0 = no pain 10 = unbearable pain: VASscore, 2 months
blood loss, ml, up to 4 hours|operative time, duration of surgery, up to 4 hours|conversion to spreading of the ribs/thoracotomy, 0 = no 1 = yes, up to 4 hours|lymph node dissection, number of lymph nodes, up to 4 hours|prolonged air leak, chest tube present longer than usual, up to 7 days|chest tube drainage, ml, up to 7 days|length of stay, duration of hospitalisation after surgery, up to 7 days|pulmonary function, recovery of function of the operated lung, 2 months|Inflammatory reaction, these inflammatory parameters will be determined: C-reactive protein; IL-3; IL-6; TNF, 48 hours
Participants are randomly subdivided (1:1) to either undergo robot assisted lobectomy or video assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy in case of lung cancer. At the end of both surgical interventions the anaesthesiologist administers the same technique of pain relief: paravertebral blockage.

The data that are going to be investigated are: operative time, conversion to spreading of the ribs/thoracotomy, blood loss, lymph node dissection, prolonged air leak, chest tube drainage, length of stay, inflammatory reaction (through inflammatory parameters CRP, IL-3, IL-6, TNF), lung recuperation (through a lung function test) and postoperative pain (VAS score questionnaire).
