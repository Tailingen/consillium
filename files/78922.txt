A Pilot Study to Explore the Role of Gut Flora in Metastatic Mesothelioma
This study seeks to correlate microbiome sequencing data with information provided by patients and their medical records.
Mesothelioma|Mesothelioma Malignant|Mesothelioma; Lung|Mesotheliomas Pleural|Mesothelioma Peritoneum|Mesothelioma; Liver|Mesothelioma; Omentum
OTHER: No intervention
Correlation of Microbiome to Disease via Relative Abundance Found in Microbiome Sequencing, Relative abundance of bacterial classes within taxonomic phyla and, more broadly, within their domain will be analyzed by sequencing the gut microbiome. These data will then be categorized with metastatic mesothelioma, Three years
The goal of this Research Study is to better understand how the genetic information in subject's microbiome correlates to Metastatic Mesothelioma
