Measurement of Implant Stability by Resonance Frequency Analysis in Patients Treated for an Upper Aero-digestive Tract Cancer
The primary objective is to describe the evolution of implant stability between the date of implant placement and 3 months later when the implant is implementated in patients treated for cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract
Cancer
DEVICE: Implant placement
Evolution of implant stability in patients treated for cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract between placement and 3 months after placement, Measure with Osstell Beacon device (Implant Stability Quotient : value from 1 to 100), At 3 months after implant placement
Evaluation of the association between the type of bone (maxilla/mandible and fibula) and implant stability, Correlation between the type of bone (maxilla / mandible and fibula) and implant stability, At 3 months after implant placement|Evaluation of the correlation between the irradiation dose received at the implant site and implant stability, Correlation between the irradiation dose received at the implant site and implant stability, At 3 months after implant placement
Oral implantology is widely used during prosthetic rehabilitation in healthy patients but also in patients presenting cancers of the upper aero-digestive tract.

Systems for measuring implant stability using resonance frequency analysis exist and are used clinically by some practitioners, such as the OstellÂ® system from W\&H. These systems make it possible to determine the osseointegration of the implant, and thus the appropriate time to insert the implant, by comparing the value obtained with average values.

Implant survival rates are lower for implants placed in irradiated bone, with an implant stability quotient value identical to implant placement but lower after osseointegration. Only one study shows implant stability quotient values\> 60 with a success rate of 100% at 41 months on implants placed in patients having received radiotherapy. However, no clinical study has investigated the kinetics of osseointegration and the stability of implants placed on a microanastomosis fibula flap as part of aesthetic and prosthetic reconstruction after cancer of the upper aero-digestive tract.
