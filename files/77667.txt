An Open-label Dose Escalation/Expansion Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Anti-tumor Activity of TEV-56278 Alone or in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The primary objectives of this trial are to:

* Characterize the safety and tolerability of TEV-56278
* Determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)
* Evaluate antitumor activity of TEV-56278
* Determine the safety and tolerability of TEV-56278 in combination with pembrolizumab
* Determine a RP2D of TEV-56278 in combination with pembrolizumab

The secondary objectives of this trial are to:

* Characterize the serum pharmacokinetics of TEV-56278
* Evaluate the antitumor activity of TEV-56278
* Determine the safety and tolerability of TEV-56278
* Evaluate other measures of antitumor activity of TEV-56278
* Evaluate anti-tumor activity

Participants will be treated up to 12 months with a follow-up period of up to 12 months after last infusion. The total duration of the trial will be up to 25 months for individual participants.
