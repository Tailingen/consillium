Impact of Endocrine Therapy and Abemaciclib on Host and Tumor Immune Cell Repertoire/Function in Advanced ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to perform an in depth analysis of changes in the tumor immune microenvironment in patients undergoing treatment with standard of care endocrine therapy and abemaciclib in the advanced setting via singe cell RNA sequencing. The investigators will also correlate changes in serum estrogen levels to changes in tumor and peripheral immune cell repertoire and function (including regulatory T cell populations, B cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations, T cell activation and T cell exhaustion).This study has two cohorts with 15 patients in each cohort.

Changes in serum estrogen (E1 and E2) levels compared to changes in tumor immune cell repertoire and function in response to endocrine therapy and CDK 4/6 inhibition, Estrogen levels in the blood will be assessed to correlate with changes in immune cell populations within the tumor., Through study completion, approximately 2 years|Changes in serum estrogen (E1 and E2) levels compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cell repertoire and function in response to endocrine therapy and CDK 4/6 inhibition, Estrogen levels in the blood will be assessed to correlate with changes in the characterization and functionality of peripheral blood mononuclear cells including regulatory T cell populations, B cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations, T cell activation and T cell exhaustion., Through study completion, approximately 2 years
Changes in tumor immune cell populations in response to fulvestrant and aromatase inhibitor therapy plus abemaciclib, measured by sequential biopsies, Changes in tumor immune cell populations will be assessed by sequential biopsies via single cell RNA sequencing analysis of fresh tissue, Baseline, 4 weeks|Differences in tumor immune cell infiltrate and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to fulvestrant versus aromatase inhibition plus CDK4/6 inhibition, measured by sequential biopsies and blood collection, Tumor immune cell and peripheral blood monoclonal cell changes assessed by sequential biopsies via single cell RNA sequencing analysis of fresh tissue, Baseline, 4 weeks|To correlate unique immune cell populations identified with progression free survival in the overall population, Unique immune cell populations will be identified via single cell RNA sequencing and correlated to progression free survival measured by RECIST1.1., Through study completion, approximately 2 years|Best overall response rate of abemaciclib and endocrine therapy in both treatment arms, Best overall response rate to both treatment arms measured by RECIST 1.1, Through study completion, approximately 2 years|Progression free survival in response to abemaciclib and endocrine therapy in both treatment arms, Progression free survival rate to both treatment arms measured by RECIST 1.1, Through study completion, approximately 2 years|Number of participants with at least one serious adverse event, Serious adverse events will include only those related to abemaciclib, endocrine therapy, and/or study-related biopsies, Through study completion, approximately 2 years
