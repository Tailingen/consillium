A Prospective, Multi-center Trial for Reinforced Staple During Distal Pancreatectomy
The aim of this study is to evaluate if the Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple Technology reduce incidence of pancreatic fistula (ISGPF grade B and C) after distal pancreatectomy by a prospective, multi-center trial.

Reducing the incidence of pancreatic fistula is the most important issue in pancreatectomy. There is no certain view on the pancreatic resection method to reduce pancreatic fistula in distal pancreatectomy.This study will be conducted to scientifically investigate the impact of Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple Technology in distal pancreatectomy. The aim of this study is to evaluate if the Endo GIA Reinforced Reload with Tri-Staple Technology reduce incidence of pancreatic fistula (ISGPF grade B and C) after distal pancreatectomy by a prospective, multi-center trial.
