Phase 1/2 Trial of Gavo-cel (TC-210) in Patients With Advanced Mesothelin-Expressing Cancer
Gavocabtagene autoleucel (gavo-cel; TC-210) is a novel cell therapy that consists of autologous genetically engineered T cells expressing a single-domain antibody that recognizes human Mesothelin, fused to the CD3-epsilon subunit which, upon expression, is incorporated into the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) complex.

This Phase 1/2 study aims to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and subsequently evaluate the efficacy of gavo-cel, with and without immuno-oncology agents, in patients with advanced mesothelin-expressing cancers, with overall response rate and disease control rate as the primary Phase 2 endpoints.
