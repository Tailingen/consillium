The Efficacy and Safety of Short-course Radiation Combined With Adebrelimab and CAPEOX Neo-adjuvant Therapy for Organ-retention in Patients With MSS/pMMR Ultra Low Rectal Adenocarcinoma
To evaluate the efficacy, safety and organ retention rate of short-course radiation combined with Adebrelimab and CAPEOX neoadjuvant therapy in patients with MSS/pMMR ultra low rectal adenocarcinoma.
Rectal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Adebrelimab|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|RADIATION: Short-course Radiation|PROCEDURE: Biopsy
Organ retention rate, population who achieve complete clinical response after total neoadjuvant therapy, After 2 weeks (once biopsy or local excision is done)
Total mesorectal excision rate, population who not achieve complete clinical response after total neoadjuvant therapy, After 2 weeks (once biopsy or local excision is done)|Total mesorectal excision rate after recurrence, population who recurrent and have Salvage total mesorectal excision after achieving complete clinical response after total neoadjuvant therapy, from primary evaluation at 2 weeks after total neoadjuvant therapy finished|Tumor regression grade, Tumor regression grade following short-course radiation then Envafolimab Plus CAPEOX as assessed by AJCC/CAP TRG system, After 2 weeks (once biopsy or local excision is done)|Overall survival, The proportion of participants who remain survival at 3 years, Up to 3 years|Disease free survival, The time from randomization to the first event of either recurrent disease or death, Up to 3 years|TRAEs, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 3 years|QoL, Quality of life of the patients in total neoadjuvant settings of short-course radiation followed with Adebrelimab Plus CAPEOX as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Colorectal (FACT-C) questionnaire liscenced from The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy System ("FACIT System"). By using the Manual scoring template, some items are reverse scored. Subscale scores, total scores and TOI scores. The higher the score, the better the QOL., Up to 3 years
At present, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) combined with total mesorectal excision (TME) is the main standard treatment, and the choice of treatment modalities is limited. The emergence of immunotherapy has provided a new direction for the exploration of neoadjuvant therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma. At the same time, a number of studies have also shown that appropriate radiotherapy intensity can promote immune response. Therefore, the investigators intend to conduct the clinical trail to explore the effect of short-course radiotherapy combined with PD-L1 combined and chemotherapy as TNT (total neoadjuvant therapy) on organ retention rate in patients with With MSS/pMMR Ultra Low Rectal Adenocarcinoma.
