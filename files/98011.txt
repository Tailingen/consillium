Pembrolizumab and Brentuximab Vedotin vs GDP and Stem Cell Transplant for Relapsed/Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study is being done to determine if two new drugs can shrink or eliminate classical Hodgkins lymphoma.
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Brentuximab vedotin|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Complete response rate by PET Deauville criteria (score 1-3) of pembrolizumab and brentuximab vedotin compared to standard GDP (gemcitabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin) given as salvage therapy, 52 months
Progression-free survival, 52 months|Event-free survival, 52 months|Overall survival, 52 months|Successful stem cell collection rate, 52 months|Transplantation rate, 52 months|Number and severity of adverse events, 52 months|Participant-reported Quality of Life utilizing EORTC QLQ-C30, 52 months|Participant-reported toxicity utilizing PRO-CTCAE, 52 months|Participant-reported Quality of Life utilizing FACT-LYM evaluating symptoms and concerns associated specifically with the lymphoma disease and/or disease treatment., 52 months|Participant-reported Quality of Life utilizing FACT/GOG-Ntx-Subscale specifically with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, 52 months|Health Economics utilizing EQ-5D-5L, 52 months|Health Economics financial toxicity utilizing FACIT-COST, 52 months
Treatment given to participants whose disease has not responded to (refractory) or returned (relapsed) after previous treatment is known as salvage treatment.

The standard of care for participants who are not in a study is salvage treatment with gemcitabine, dexamethasone and cisplatin (GDP). This treatment can reduce symptoms and may stop the lymphoma from growing for a few months or longer. This standard treatment is approved by Health Canada

We are doing this study because we want to find out if treatment with Pembrolizumab and Brentuximab vedotin is better or worse than the standard of care for this type of cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The standard of care is defined as care most people get for your cancer.
