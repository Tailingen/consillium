Prostate Ablation Registry and Database for Information, Surveillance, and Evaluation (PARADISE)
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer of men in the world. In 2023 alone, it is estimated that 288,300 US men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 34,700 will die from the disease despite the approval of multiple systemic agents. Due to advances in screening and imaging technology, PCa is now detected much earlier in its disease course. Prostate gland ablation for prostate cancer might provide the option for a "middle" ground between active surveillance (AS) and radical therapy by destroying prostate cancer in a minimally invasive or non-invasive fashion and thus limiting the morbidity. This treatment strategy is increasingly being offered to patients due to low morbidity but the data on long term oncologic efficacy and side effect profile is lacking for such a treatment strategy.

The purpose of this study is to create a database and prospective registry for data collection on patients with prostate cancer undergoing prostate ablation for the management of prostate cancer. Patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer of any Gleason Grade will be entered into the registry as long as prostate ablation is used as the prostate cancer management modality. Historical data from 2017 to the present time will be added through chart review. Current and future patient data will be collected through chart review during the subject's clinical care. Only data available in the electronic medical record will be collected and no additional data will be collected for research purposes. No biospecimens will be collected, and there are no physical risks from study participation.
