Reducing Breast Cancer Risk in Korean American Women
The goals of the study are to develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention to reduce SHS exposure for LEP Korean women using a family-focused intervention approach targeting Korean Americans ages 18 and above in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, CA, and to evaluate efficacy of the proposed intervention. The study is a single group feasibility trial targeting a total of 4 lay health workers (LHW) and 24 dyads of LEP Korean women with self-reported SHS exposure at home and a male household smoker. The hypothesis is:

H. Can a family-based intervention approach reduce SHS exposure among Korean American women who live with a current smoker?
