Duration of Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitor and ADT With Metastasis Directed Therapy in Oligometastatic Cancer of the Prostate (DIRECT)
This is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, two-arm, randomized trial to investigate the addition on androgen receptor pathway inhibitor to standard of care radiation and hormone therapy improve quality of life.

Participants will either receive standard of care radiation and hormone (ADT) therapy (Arm 1) or standard of care radiation and hormone (ADT) therapy plus oral abiraterone for 8-9 months (Arm 3). Participants will be routinely follow-up in clinic or remotely for up to 5 years.

Progression free survival, Determine if progression free survival improves with the addition of intermittent enzalutamide to standard of care treatment., 5 years
Patient-reported quality of life, Determine if the addition of intermittent enzalutamide to standard of care treatment results in a patient-reported quality of life difference compared to standard of care treatment alone using quality of life questionnaires (EPIC-26)., 5 years|Patient-reported quality of life, Determine if the addition of intermittent enzalutamide to standard of care treatment results in a patient-reported quality of life difference compared to standard of care treatment alone using quality of life questionnaires (FACT-P)., 5 years|Patient-reported quality of life, Determine if the addition of intermittent enzalutamide to standard of care treatment results in a patient-reported quality of life difference compared to standard of care treatment alone using quality of life questionnaires (FACT-Fatigue)., 5 years|Physician-reported toxicity, Determine if the addition of intermittent enzalutamide to standard of care treatment results in a physician-reported difference in acute and late toxicities compared to standard of care treatment alone assessed by CTCAE Toxicity 5.0., 5 years
