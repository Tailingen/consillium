Testing the Feasibility of a Simplified Workflow for Lung Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to see if adding an "extra" check by formal radiology review is possible without disrupting the normal processes that take place to develop and prepare a safe radiation treatment plan for patients.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: CT Simulation
Number of Completed Radiation Treatment Plans Reviewed, Completed initial radiology review within 4 business days after the date of CT simulation will be calculated using summary statistics including count (frequency) using a 95% confidence interval., Within four days after CT simulation
Number of Patients Whose Radiation Treatment Plans Changed, Will be calculated using summary statistics including count (frequency) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals., 4 days|Changes in Volumes After Radiation Treatment Changes - Gross Tumor Volume, For patients whose radiation therapy plans are changed, the change in volume (in centimeters cubed) of gross tumor volume (GVT) before and after the recommended change is made will be summarized using mean and standard deviation and median range., 4 days|Changes in Volumes After Radiation Treatment Changes - Clinical Tumor Volume, For patients whose radiation therapy plans are changed, the change in volume (in centimeters cubed) of clinical target volume (CTV) before and after the recommended change is made will be summarized using mean and standard deviation and median range., 4 days|Changes in Volumes After Radiation Treatment Changes - Planning Tumor Volume, For patients whose radiation therapy plans are changed, the change in volume (in centimeters cubed) of planning target volume (PTV) before and after the recommended change is made will be summarized using mean and standard deviation and median range., 4 days|Changes in Dose Delivered After Radiation Treatment Changes to the Lungs, For patients whose RT plans are changed, the change in the dose delivered to the lungs (V5, V10, V20) will be summarized using mean (standard deviation) and median (range)., 4 days|Changes in Dose Delivered After Radiation Treatment Changes to the Esophagus, For patients whose RT plans are changed, the change in the dose delivered to the and esophagus (mean, V60) will be summarized using mean (standard deviation) and median (range)., 4 days|Number of Patients Who's Treatment Starts are Delayed, For patients whose radiation therapy plans are changed: the proportion of treatment starts that are delayed from the initial planned start day due to the application of recommended changes will be calculated using summary statistics including count (frequency), 4 days|Number of Changes Recommended by the Radiation Therapy Quality Assurance Conference (RT QAC), Will be calculated using summary statistics including count (frequency) and will also be captured in full qualitative form., 4 days|Number of Patients with Acute Esophagitis, Will be reported using descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviations, proportions, and 95% confidence intervals) and will also be compared to the historical institutional control incidence and severity of esophagitis using 1-sample z-tests and 1-sample tests of proportions (considering historical control as "population parameter."), 4 weeks after completion of therapy|Cancer Response, Will be assessed by radiology on imaging and will be summarized using frequencies and proportions. Proportion of those with positive response will be compared to historical institution control using a 1-sample test of proportions (considering historical control as "population parameter.")., 1 month after completion of therapy
Primary Objectives: The primary objective will be to demonstrate the feasibility of radiology completing real time review of radiation oncology treatment plans within 4 business days of the date of CT simulation (defined as day = 0). If 50% of plans can be reviewed by any member of the thoracic radiology team (Includes radiology PI and co-investigators) and feedback is submitted to radiation oncology with Appendix D within 4 business days of the date of simulation, then we will consider this workflow feasible.

Secondary Objectives:

* Our primary secondary objective will be to estimate the proportion of patients whose RT plans are changed as a result this workflow.
* For patients whose radiation therapy plans are changed as a result this workflow, determine the absolute and percentage volume changes in the gross tumor volume, clinical target volume and planning target volume as a result of these changes implemented.
* For patients whose radiation therapy plans are changed as a result of this workflow: determine if recommended changes in the gross tumor volume resulted in improved dosimetry to surrounding normal structures. Specifically, determine the absolute and percentage changes in the dose delivered to the lungs (V5, V10, V20) and esophagus (mean, V60) as a result of changes in the gross tumor volume.
* For patients whose radiation therapy plans are changed as a result of this workflow, determine if changes led to treatment delays from their standard planned start date.
* For patients whose radiation therapy plans are changed as a result of this workflow, to describe the most common types of changes recommended (i.e. modification of parenchymal lung volumes, missing involved lymph nodes, covering too much normal tissue in the gross tumor volume).
* Determine whether acute esophagitis incidence changed in our entire sample as a result of this review during treatment and within 4 weeks following treatment, compared to institutional historical control databases of patients treated without formal radiology review.
* Determine whether tumor response at 4 weeks post treatment differs in our entire sample compared to institutional historical control databases of patients treated without formal radiology review.
