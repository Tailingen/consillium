Prospective Observational Study on the Management of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma (OLYMPE)
This French national, multicenter, prospective, longitudinal, observational study will describe the treatment modalities of a cohort of patients with relapsed or refractory follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with evaluation of the cohort overall and according to the presence or not of MabThera® (rituximab) maintenance therapy. Actively participating physicians will enroll patients and collect therapeutic management data in a real-life setting up to 5 years.

One participant could receive more than one infection prophylaxis treatment., Maintenance/observation Phase: 67.8 months|Percentage of Participants With Modalities of the Therapeutic Decision at First Study Disease Progression, The therapeutic management of participants was decided by either "pluri-disciplinary consultation meeting," "Only the physician in charge of the participant," "Discussion between physicians," or "Punctual consultation of an external physician." Percentage of participants with each of these modalities of therapeutic decision was reported., Up to 6 years|Number of Participants With Therapeutic Management After the First Study Disease Progression, After the first disease progression the participants received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radio immunotherapy, stem cell transplantation, or radiation therapy for therapeutic management of the refractory/relapsed follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. One participant could receive more than one type of treatment after the first study disease progression., Up to 6 years
Percentage of Participants With Last Induction Treatment Response, Last Induction treatment response: the last response assessment over the first study induction treatment (complete response \[CR\]: complete disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease and disappearance of all disease-related symptoms if present before therapy; CR unconfirmed: CR along with regression in lymph node mass by more than \[\>\]75% in the sum of the products of greatest diameters \[SPD\]; Partial Response \[PR\]: greater than or equal to \[\>=\] 50% decrease in SPD of 6 largest dominant nodes or nodal masses; Progression was 1 of the following: 1) lymphadenopathy; 2) a \>=50% increase in previously noted or new appearance of hepato/splenomegaly; 3) \>=50% increase in blood lymphocyte count with at least 5000 B lymphocytes/μL; 4) transformation to Richter's syndrome; or 5) occurrence of cytopenia; Stable disease \[SD\]: absence of necessary criteria to achieve CR or PR, but no advancement to progression) was described at the end of first study induction., Induction Phase: 18.7 months|Percentage of Participants With Number of Disease Progressions, Participants with at least one disease progression after the first study induction period were reported., Up to 6 years|Percentage of Participants With Disease Characteristics at First Study Disease Progression, Disease characteristics included (tumor burden, measured from whole body computed tomography (CT) scan. Groupe d'Etudes des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) criteria defined as parameters to initiate treatment in participants with untreated follicular lymphoma, grade 1,2,or 3A; having just one of the criteria justified treatment: 1. involvement of \>=3 nodal sites, each with diameter of \>=3 centimeter(cm); 2. any nodal/extranodal tumor mass with diameter of \>=7cm; 3.

One participant could present with more than 1 GELF criterion. Ann Arbor staging was used as staging system for lymphomas (Stage I to IV); stage depended upon the place where malignant tissue was located (through biopsy, CT scan, or positron emission tomography) and on systemic symptoms due to lymphoma)., Up to 6 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), The PFS was defined as the time from the date of first induction treatment over the study (first treatment administration of first cycle) to the date of first disease progression or participants death or date of lymphoma transformation diagnosis., Up to 6 years|Time to Next Treatment, Time to next treatment was calculated from the date of the end of first induction treatment administration over the study to the date of the start of next treatment after disease progression., Up to 6 years|Overall Survival (OS), The overall survival was defined as the time from the date of first induction treatment administration over the study to the date of participants' death or early study withdrawal. OS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 6 years|Number of Participants Who Used MabThera, Up to Induction phase (18.7 months), Maintenance phase/observation phase (67.8 months)|MabThera Regimen: Dose of MabThera, All participants who received MabThera treatment before the first disease progression were reported., Up to Induction phase (18.7 months), Maintenance phase/observation phase (67.8 months)|MabThera Regimen: Infusion Duration, Up to Induction phase (18.7 months), Maintenance phase/observation phase (67.8 months)|MabThera Regimen: Number of Cycles of MabThera, Up to Induction phase (18.7 months), Maintenance phase/observation phase (67.8 months)|MabThera Regimen: Time Between Cycles, Up to Induction phase (18.7 months), Maintenance phase/observation phase (67.8 months)|Percentage of Participants With Discontinuations and Modifications of MabThera During Maintenance Phase, Maintenance phase : 67.8 months|Function Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-General (FACT-G) With Lymphoma-Specific Additional Concerns Subscale (Lym) Total Score, The FACT-G with Lymphoma-Specific Additional Concerns Subscale (Lym) total score was calculated by adding the score obtained on the FACT-G (physical well-being, scored 0-28; social well-being, scored 0-28; functional well-being, scored 0-28; emotional well-being, scored 0-24), to the score obtained on the LYM subscale (15 items; responses to each item range from 0, "Not at all" to 4, "Very much"). Total score ranges from 0 to 168. Higher scores indicated a better participant-reported outcome/quality of life over the past week when responding to the items., Up to 6 years (assessed at start, mid and end of induction [induction: 18.7 months], at each infusion during maintenance [maintenance phase: 67.8 months], and at disease progression [maximum up to 6 years])|Number and Type of Hospitalization Associated With MabThera Perfusion, Number and type of hospitalization (a day hospitalization, short-lasting hospitalization, and short-stay hospitalization) was reported., Up to 6 years
