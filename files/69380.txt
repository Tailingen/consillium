Safety and Tolerability of ODM-203 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours
The purpose of this first-in-human study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of ODM-203 in subjects with advanced solid tumours and to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities.
Solid Tumours
DRUG: ODM 203|DRUG: ODM 203
Number of adverse events, Number of adverse event counts, From the date of informed consent to the date of the end of study visit estimated to be 6 months
Frequency of responders to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST), The frequency of responders according to RECIST will be evaluated by dose level., Subjects will be followed for the duration of time in the study, expected to be an average of 6 months|Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status, The ECOG performance status and the change from baseline will be reported by dose level., Subjects will be followed for the duration of time in the study, expected to be an average of 6 months|Area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC), Area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of ODM-203 will be measured to evaluate the relationship between ODM-203 dose, plasma exposure, pharmacodynamics and safety, 0 to 24hours post dose Day 1 and Day 15|Peak plasma concentration (Cmax), Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of ODM-203 will be measured to evaluate the relationship between ODM-203 dose, plasma exposure, pharmacodynamics and safety, After first dose administration to 24 hours Day 1 and Day 15
The safety profile of ODM-203 will be explored together with the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumour response to treatment with ODM-203 to recommend the dosing regimen for further clinical studies. The pharmacokinetic properties of ODM 203 will be evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations at different dose levels
