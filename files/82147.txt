Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy for HCC Involving Type I PVTT
The rate of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involving portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is up to 50% in Guangxi province, China. Some of them will receive hepatic resection, especially those with type I or II PVTT. However, 5-years recurrence rate is up to 75% after surgery. Some retrospective studies found postoperative radiotherapy may reduce the rate of recurrence. Moreover, few retrospective studies also found neoadjuvant radiotherapy (PMID: 27317960) may improve overall survival for HCC patients involving type II/III PVTT. However, the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant raidotherapy for HCC involving type I PVTT is unknown.
