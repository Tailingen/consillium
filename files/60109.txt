A double blind prospective randomized controlled pilot study with cross over.

To assess the effectiveness of EA in improving pain and function for chronic chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) 30 participants will be recruited 6 months post-completion of chemotherapy. Fifteen participants will be randomized to the true EA group and 15 to the sham EA group. Those participants randomized to the sham group will cross over to receive true EA after the trial is complete.

Treatment consists of EA or sham EA 1 x per week x 6 weeks. Re-assessment visits occur after the 6 week intervention and again 2 months post trial.

Each assessment visit quantifies the sensory experience of CIPN at that moment in time using Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) which includes; thermal detection and thermal pain thresholds, light touch detection using nylon monofilament hairs (Semmes Weinstein Monofilaments (SWMF)), static 2-point discrimination, pressure algometry and vibration thresholds. Patient reported outcome measures including the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Lower extremity functional score (LEFS), the Self report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic signs and symptoms (S-LANSS) pain questionaire will also be used.
