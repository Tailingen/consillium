CtDNA Based MRD Testing for NAC Monitoring in TNBC
A prospective, multicenter, observational study to evaluate the correlation of Molecular Residual Disease (MRD) detection using circulating tumor DNA guided test to pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in stage I-III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Results from this study aim to improve MRD detection and disease outcomes for future patients.
TNBC - Triple-Negative Breast Cancer|Minimal Residual Disease
Evaluate the correlation of MRD to pCR after NAC in TNBC, Evaluate the correlation of MRD detection by NeXT Personal CTA to pathological Complete Response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in stage I-III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy., through study completion, an average of 6 months
Evaluate the trajectory of changes in MRD to pCR or non pCR in TNBC, Evaluate the trajectory of changes in MRD detected by NeXT Personal CTA during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to pathological Complete Response (pCR) or non pCR in stage I-III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)., through study completion, an average of 6 months
Stratification based on NAC therapy regimen, NeXT Personal CTA clinical accuracy may be evaluated as compared to other clinically available tests. Stratification based on NAC therapy regimen, genomic profiles and biomarker analysis., through study completion, an average of 6 months|Evaluate genomic profiles, Evaluate genomic profile for specific biomarkers during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), through study completion, an average of 6 months
NeXT Personal CTA (Clinical Trial Assay) is a patient-specific, tumor-informed device which allows for detection of MRD from cfDNA. By using next generation sequencing technology, whole genome sequencing (WGS) is conducted from DNA derived from patient tumor and normal samples. A tumor informed personalized panel is then constructed that uses only a selection of DNA targets from the WGS by applying bioinformatic filters. The targeted personalized panel is then sequenced using NGS and DNA derived from cfDNA from plasma samples. The data from the cfDNA NGS are then further analyzed using bioinformatics filters to report the MRD status.
