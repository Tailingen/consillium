A Whole-food, Plant-Based Nutrition Intervention in Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer
This research will examine the feasibility of conducting a strict whole-food, plant-based dietary intervention in women with stable metastatic breast cancer currently undergoing conventional treatments. In addition, this research will provide preliminary data on dietary intakes and the effect of plant-based nutrition on numerous outcomes reflecting cancer prognosis and overall health using advanced imaging, various blood biomarkers linked to cancer progression, and numerous symptom questionnaires.
