Bipolar RFA Using Twin ICW Electrodes vs. Switching Monopolar RFA for Recurrent HCC
This study was conducted to provide preliminary data for the main trial to compare efficacy between bipolar radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using twin internally cooled-wet electrodes and switching monopolar RFA using separable clustered electrodes in the treatment of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after locoregional treatment.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: Bipolar RFA|DEVICE: SM-RFA|DEVICE: Twin internally cooled-wet electrodes|DEVICE: Separable clustered electrodes
Minimum diameter of ablation zone per unit time, Minimum diameter of ablative zone per unit time on post-RFA CT or MRI in a mm., 3 days after RFA
Technique efficacy, Technical success on 1 month follow-up imaging after RFA (no residual/progressed tumor), 1 month after RFA|IDR rate, Cumulative intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR) rate over 2 years after RFA, 12 months, 24 months after RFA|EM rate, Cumulative extrahepatic metastasis (EM) rate over 2 years after RFA, 12 months, 24 months after RFA|Local tumor progression (LTP), Cumulative LTP rates in two groups in 2 years after RFA, 12 months, 24 months after RFA
Complication, Description and comparison of the type and incidence of major complication after RFA are assessed according to Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) grading system in two groups., 1 month after RFA|Volume of ablative zone, Volume of ablative zone on post-RFA CT or MRI in a mm3, 3 days after RFA|Ablation time, RFA procedure time in each patient., 1 day
