Trial of Chewing Gum to Reduce Post Operative Ileus in Elective Colorectal Surgery
It is unknown whether post operative chewing gum will reduce post operative ileus. This study is a randomised controlled trial that will determine whether chewing gum three times a day following surgery will reduce post operative ileus. Time to passage of flatus will be used to determine that incidence of ileus.

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Chewing gum
Bowel function (as assessed by questionnaire), Time to passage of flatus, Minutes (end of surgery to first passage of flatus, measured up to 4 weeks)
Diet (as assessed by questionnaire), Time to tolerating full diet, Minutes (end of surgery to first solid food, assessed by patient questionnaire up to 4 weeks from randomisation)|Length of stay, Days (till successful discharge from secondary care to home or respite care measured up to first 31 days)|Post op nausea and vomiting score (as recorded by visual analogue scale), Post op nausea and vomiting score (PONV), Recorded daily for first 5 days|Morbidity, Post operative morbidity, Days (recorded up to 30 days and defined by Clavien-Dindo scale)
Patients will be randomised to one of two arms, the experimental arm will be chewing gum and the control arm will be normal post operative care.

The primary endpoint is time to passage of flatus (defined as end of operation to first passage of flatus, in minutes).

The trial will be unblinded to patients and observers and has been powered to demonstrate a 15% reduction in passage to flatus (130 patients required)
