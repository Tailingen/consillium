Laboratory Study of Early Tumor Markers in the Peripheral Blood of Glioblastoma Multiforme Patients
The purpose of this study is to determine if tumor cells can be detected in the blood of patients diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Glioblastoma Multiforme|Healthy Volunteers
OTHER: GBM Patients|OTHER: Normal Controls
Identification of Human GBM CD Antigen Signature., Already established and stored GBM cell lines will be screened for CD antigens to confirm that a selective cell surface antigen can be identified., 3 Years
Identification & Isolation of Human GBM Cells in Seeded Normal Control Human Blood., Frozen and fresh human blood will be seeded with human GBM cells from established stored GBM cell lines and subjected to antibody-based cell identification and isolation procedures., 3 Years|Prospective Isolation of GBM Tumor Cells in GBM Patient Blood., Circulating tumor cells will be isolated from blood drawn from GBM patients., 3 Years|Prospective Evaluation of the Routine Medical History of GBM Patients., Medical records of GBM patients will be used to determine how circulating tumor cells impact outcome., 3 Years
Despite aggressive therapies, Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is rapidly fatal. GBMs are increasingly recognized for occasionally metastasizing through the peripheral blood to distant locations. This research study involves the detection and novel characterization of human GBM (hGBM) circulating tumor cells (CTCs) within the peripheral blood of brain tumor patients by identifying their unique cell surface antigen profile, determining an optimal isolation protocol, and quantitatively and qualitatively reporting the yield and characteristics.
