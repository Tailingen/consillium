Total-body PET / CT in the Evaluation of Treatment and Prognosis of Lymphoma
The prospective study aims to explore the value of total-body PET/CT dynamic imaging (uExplorer) in assessing the treatments and prognosis in patients affected with lymphoma. Total-body 18F-FDG PET/CT scans are being performed before treatment, after three cycles of chemotherapy and six weeks after the end of treatment. The plan of this study involves to evaluate the clinical application of total-body PET / CT in patients histopathologically-diagnosed as lymphoma, and to optimize the dynamic acquisition protocols with total-body 18F-FDG PET/CT.

PFS, Progress-free survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first progress at any site or death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., three years after last patient recruited|OS, The duration from the date of random assignment to the date of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., three years after last patient recruited
100 cases of lymphoma patients are enrolled in this study. Participation in this study involves three dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT exams, which occur before the treatments start, two or three days before the fourth cycle of chemotherapy, and then six weeks after the end of last treatments. Progress Free Survival(PFS) and Overall Survival(OS) are used as the end points to study the value of metabolic parameters obtained from the dynamic PET/CT imaging. The differences of dynamic metabolic parameters and static SUV value are evaluated in patients with lymphoma from the perspective of diagnosis, staging, treatment and prognosis.
