Clinical Trial of the TQB2102 Injection in Patients With Advanced Cancers
TQB2102 is an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of a humanised antibody against Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), a enzyme-cleavable linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, which combine the ability of antibodies to specifically target tumour cells with the highly potent killing activity of drugs with payloads too toxic for systemic administration. This is a phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of TQB102 injection in subjects with advanced malignancies.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: TQB2102 injection
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v5.0) toxicity assessment criteria), and assessed as having a suspected relationship to study drug that occurred within the first cycle (21 days) of treatment., During the first treatment cycle (21 days).|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD was defined as the highest dose at which dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred in less than 33% of patients., During the first treatment cycle (21 days).|The occurrence rate of all adverse events (AEs), The occurrence of adverse events defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v5.0), From date of the first dose until 28 days after last dose or new anti-tumor treatment, whichever came first.|Dose escalation: recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), The RP2D of DT-9081 is determined using pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety data of the dose escalation part of the study., Up to 2 years
