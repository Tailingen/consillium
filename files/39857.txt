Trial of Dichloroacetate (DCA) in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
Conduct a multicenter, open label Phase IIA trial of oral DCA in 40 surgical patients with recurrent GBM who have clinically indicated debulking surgery planned. No patients will be recruited at UF. Patients will be genotyped to establish safe dosing regimens and will be randomized to receive DCA (N=20) or no DCA (N=20) for one week prior to surgery. Deidentified blood and tumor tissue obtained at surgery will be assessed at UF for biochemical markers of DCA dynamics.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Dichloroacetate (DCA)|GENETIC: Genotype
Level of phosphorylated PDC protein expressed in surgical tissue, The efficacy of dichloroacetate will be determined by the level of phosphorylated PDC protein expressed in surgical tissue., Within 4 weeks post surgery
Evaluate effects of dichloroacetate (DCA) on tumor PDC phosphorylation.
