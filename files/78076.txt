EB virus (EBV) infection after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is common and can be lethal without prompt treatment. In this prospective study, HLA-A\*02:01/11:01/24:02-restricted EBV-specific T cell receptor (TCR) will be introduced into the T cells of HSCT donors by ex vivo lentiviral transduction to generate EBV-TCR-T cells. An escalated dose ranging from 3×10\^5/kg to 1×10\^6/kg of EBV-TCR-T cells will be infused into patients with EBV infection. The safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and cytokine levels of allogenic EBV-TCR-T cell therapy will be evaluated.
