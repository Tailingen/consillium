Relationship Between FGF19 Overexpression and Disease Prognosis
A real-world study of FGF19 overexpression status and treatment outcome and prognosis in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
OTHER
PFS, PFS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression, with no time constraints involved, marked by the appearance of disease progression, Enrollment until disease progression|OS, Observation until death from the beginning of participation in the study observation until death from any cause, no time frame limitations were involved. Calculation of OS based on time of death, Start of enrollment until death (from any cause)
ORR, Proportion of patients whose tumor volume shrinks to a preset value and remains unchanged for a given period of time, total study duration 36 months, ORR observation period within 36 months, Time to enrollment until disease downsizing
This is a real-world, single-arm, observational study to collect information on the diagnosis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients with previous tissue samples in routine clinical practice, and to detect the expression of FGF19 expression in tissue samples, with a view to discovering prognostic and predictive markers for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma The treatment protocol of this study follows the clinical practice and does not set any limitations on the interventions for patients.

In this study, real-world liver tissue samples will be collected from patients with hepatocellular liver cancer after surgical resection, and the samples will be sent to a third-party pathology slice reviewer for review, and a report on the FGF19 expression results will be returned to the project team. Simultaneously collect clinical data of the patient.

According to the principle of clinical routine diagnosis and treatment, the patient's imaging data were collected, and the imaging of the 2-month period was evaluated, and whether the disease progressed was judged according to the RESCIST v1.1 standard. Every two months will be an observation cycle. Each subject will be followed from the first treatment until disease progression or change of drug regimen.
