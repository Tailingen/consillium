Carfilzomib, Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone Re-induction Followed by the 2nd ASCT in Multiple Myeloma Patients Relapsed After the 1st ASCT
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of salvage treatment with carfilzomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone (KRD) followed by 2nd autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and lenalidomide maintenance in patients with relapsed myeloma after 1st ASCT.

This is a single-arm phase II study to assess the efficacy and safety of KRD followed by 2nd ASCT - lenalidomide maintenance for 18 months in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma after 1st ASCT who are 70 years of age or younger. A total of 58 participants will be recruited. As a re-induction therapy 6 cycles of KRD (K, 27mg/m2, D1,2,8,9,15,16; R, 25 mg, D1-21; D, 40mg weekly, every 28 days) will be administered. If a patient achieves at least partial response, 2nd ASCT + lenalidomide 10mg for 18 months will be proceeded. Study will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of pre-planned schedule. Response will be assessed using the International Myeloma Working Group(IMWG) response criteria and the safety profiles will be described using the NCI-CTCAE v5.0. Participants who discontinue therapy will be followed every 3 months for 3 years if they are on subsequent treatment, disease-free or dead.
