Clinical Study on PEG-rhG-CSF in Mobilizing Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cells
This study is a randomized controlled, open and multi-center clinical study. Patients who meet the selection criteria and do not meet the exclusion criteria are randomly given PEG-rhG-CSF with a fixed dose of 12mg when white blood cells reach the lowest point, or given rhG-CSF with a daily mobilization of 5-10μ g/kg until the collection is completed, so as to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PEG-rhG-CSF in mobilizing autologous stem cells for lymphoma and multiple myeloma.
