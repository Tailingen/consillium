BCG for Therapeutic Use Phase Ⅲ Clinical Trial
Research topic: A randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter phase III clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of therapeutic BCG for the prevention of postoperative recurrence of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in people aged 18 years and older.

The name of the drug: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin for treatment(BCG). Clinical indications: It is used for the treatment of bladder carcinoma in situ and the prevention of recurrence, and for the prevention of recurrence of bladder papilloma after transurethral resection in Ta or T1 stage. This product is not used for papillomas beyond the T1 stage.

Study population: Patients aged 18 years and above with intermediate- and high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who have undergone transurethral bladder tumor resection.

Objectives: Primary Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of BCG for therapeutic use in the adjuvant treatment of intermediate- and high-risk NMIBC after transurethral resection of bladder tumors. Secondary Purpose: To assess the safety of the therapeutic BCG vaccine in the adjuvant treatment of intermediate- and high-risk NMIBC after transurethral resection of bladder tumors. Other purposes: To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of BCG for therapeutic use in the adjuvant treatment of intermediate- and high-risk NMIBC after transurethral resection of bladder tumors.

Study design: This study adopts a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multi-center trial design, including three phases: screening period, treatment period and follow-up period. In this study, 438 subjects will be randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group in a 1:1 ratio, with 219 patients in both the experimental group and the control group, and stratified according to the baseline risk level (high-risk/intermediate-risk) and whether or not to perform urine PD sample collection (yes/no).

Research topic: A randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter phase III clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of therapeutic BCG for the prevention of postoperative recurrence of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in people aged 18 years and older.

Study endpoints: Endpoint efficacy: Main efficacy measures: 1-year recurrence-free survival rate (1-year RFS%): To assess the proportion of participants who are relapse-free or die from randomization up to 1 year, whichever occurs first. Secondary efficacy endpoint: 2-year recurrence-free survival rate (2-year RFS%): Assessing the proportion of subjects who have not experienced recurrence or death (whichever occurs first) from randomization until 2 years. 1-year progression-free survival rate (1-year PFS%): Assessing the proportion of subjects experiencing tumor progression or death from randomization until 1 year. The 2-year progression-free survival rate (2-year PFS%) assesses the proportion of subjects experiencing tumor progression or death from the time of randomization until 2 years. Security endpoint: Incidence of all AEs and SAEs; Any clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs or physical examinations during the trial period; Any clinically significant abnormalities found during the trial period laboratory examinations or electrocardiogram examinations. Other destinations: Changes in the levels of interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-12 (IL-12), interferon γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in urine excreted at 4 h±1 h, 8 h±, 2 h, and 24 h±3 h after the 1st (V1), 6th (V6), 9th (V9), and 10th (V10) administration.

Overall design: This study adopts a randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled, multicenter trial design, including three phases: screening, treatment, and follow-up. A total of 438 subjects will be enrolled in this study, with a 1:1 random allocation to the experimental group and the control group, both consisting of 219 subjects. Stratification will be based on baseline risk level (high risk/medium risk) and whether urine PD samples are collected (yes/no). Selection period: During the first 28 days prior to administration, the subjects will undergo eligibility confirmation for enrollment. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will enter the treatment phase and receive the investigational drug infusion.

Treatment period (Year 1): The treatment period includes the induction phase, consolidation phase, and maintenance phase.

After undergoing transurethral bladder tumor resection, eligible subjects are screened and randomly assigned to the study. Within 2 to 12 weeks after surgery, subjects receive bladder instillation therapy: once a week during the induction phase for a total of 6 times, once every two weeks during the consolidation phase for a total of 3 times, and once every 4 weeks during the maintenance phase for a total of 19 times, continuing until 1 year after surgery.

During the first year of the study, subjects undergo imaging examinations every 12 months, urine cytology examinations every 3 months, and cystoscopy. If a subject shows positive results in either cystoscopy or urine cytology, the researcher may decide to perform additional imaging examinations.

Follow-up period (Year 2): After completing one year of intravesical therapy, or if treatment is discontinued early without tumor recurrence or progression, or if the subject continues treatment into the second year, participants meeting the above criteria should undergo imaging examinations every 12 months, urine cytology and cystoscopy every 3 months, until tumor recurrence or progression, withdrawal of informed consent, loss to follow-up, study termination by the sponsor, initiation of new anti-tumor treatment, or death (whichever occurs first). If a participant has a positive cystoscopy or urine cytology result, the investigator may decide to perform imaging examinations.
