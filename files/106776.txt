Evaluation of IRDye800CW-nimotuzumab in Lung Cancer Surgery
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, optimal dose and imaging time of the investigational product, IRDye800CW-nimotuzumab for use as a near infrared imaging probe for image-guided surgery during lung cancer resection. IRDye800CW-nimotuzumab targets cancer cells over-expressing EGFR, allowing tumors to be visualized and may help surgeons better identify cancer during surgery.
