GAPP Induction and Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Toripalimab Maintenance for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.
In order to explore the efficacy and safety of targeted therapy and immunotherapy combined with GP chemotherapy in the treatment of high risk advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the investigators design a single-arm, Phase II clinical trial targeted high-risk patients with local stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (stage IVa: TanyN3M0/T4N0-2M0,8th AJCC/UICC staging) for Toripalimab Plus Anlotinib Combined With GP Induction Chemotherapy and Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Toripalimab Maintenance Therapy.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Toripalimab|DRUG: Anlotinib|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: radiation
2-year progression-free survival, 2-year progression-free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years.
