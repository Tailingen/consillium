Bendamustine Combined With Rituximab for Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
A phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. It is hypothesized that the BR combination will produce at least a 70% overall response rate.
