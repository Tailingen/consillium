Combining Radiotherapy and Temozolomide With Dichloroacetate in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma
This is a study to see whether radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (Temozolomide) plus Dichloroacetate (DCA) improves overall survival and offers better control of the disease in patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme Tumours.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: Dichloroacetate (DCA)
Safety and tolerability of DCA in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide in an adjuvant setting for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients., 2 years
To determine if there is a correlation between MGMT promoter methylation status and progression-free survival for newly diagnosed GBM patients undergoing concurrent TMZ, DCA and RT followed by six monthly cycles of TMZ and DCA, 2 years
Patients with newly diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme Tumours, once consented to the study, would undergo standard treatment of radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (TMZ) with DCA in pill form (twice a day) during the radiation phase of the study and then with TMZ for six months after. Other elements of the clinical trial include pharmacokinetics and MGMT genetic testing.
