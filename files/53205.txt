NM-IL-12 (rHuIL-12) In Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B- Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Undergoing Salvage Chemotherapy
NM-IL-12 is being evaluated as an immunotherapeutic with concomitant hematopoietic regenerating properties for treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL, an aggressive type of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for NM-IL-12 is not planned in this study, rather, a pre-defined dose of 150 ng/kg will be explored; this dose is based on two safety and tolerability studies of NM-IL-12 in healthy volunteers.
Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse (DLBCL)
BIOLOGICAL: NM-IL-12
Safety and tolerability, General safety: Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate) and physical examination.

• Toxicity according to the NCI CTCAE (v4.03) for AEs and clinical laboratory profile; AEs will be collected for all patients who received at least one dose of NM-IL-12 and up to one month post last NM-IL-12 dose., 4 months|Immunogenicity of NM-IL-12, Immunogenicity of NM-IL-12 will be evaluated by the presence of anti-drug antibody (ADA), 4 months
Response rate (Complete Response or Partial Response) as assessed by PET/CT, Comparison will be made between the status before salvage regimen initiation, after the second chemotherapy cycle, and after completion of all salvage chemotherapy cycles. CR and PR will be assessed according to the revised International Working Group Criteria for non-Hodgkin Lymphoma., 4 months|Time to neutrophil recovery, Time to neutrophil recovery, as defined by first day of ANC ≥ 500/μL, 4 months|Time to platelet count recovery, Time to platelet count recovery, as defined by first day of self-sustained platelet count ≥ 20,000/μL, 4 months|Incidence of systemic infections, 4 months|Incidence and duration of neutropenic fever, 4 months|Need for RBC and platelet transfusion, 4 months|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of NM-IL-12, 2 months|Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of NM-IL-12, 2 months|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of IFN-g and IP-10, 2 months
This is a single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study with NM-IL-12 dosed in combination with salvage chemotherapy regimens (R-ICE = rituximab plus ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide, R-DHAP = rituximab plus cytosine arabinoside-cisplatin-dexamethasone) for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL.

NM-IL-12 (150 ng/kg) will be administered subcutaneously. Patients will be monitored as routinely practiced; in addition, approximately 1 day after NM-IL-12 injection, patients will have a home visit by a nurse for blood sampling related to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) evaluation.

Twelve patients are planned to be enrolled into the study; initially 6 patients will be enrolled. The decision to continue and recruit the remaining six patients will be made by Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after review of relevant safety data, clinical laboratory evaluations, and vital signs collected up to 21 days post enrollment of the last patient in the first treated group. Common Terminology Grades for Adverse Events (CTCAE) guidelines will be used to determine dose-modifying criteria (DMC).
