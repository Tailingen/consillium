Pembrolizumab Plus Lenvatinib in Previously Treated Classic Kaposi Sarcoma
Phase II study of Pembrolizumab plus Lenvatinib in relapsed/refractory Classic Kaposi Sarcoma (CKS). After a screening phase of up to 28 days, each participant will receive study intervention of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib until reaching a discontinuation criterion: disease progression; unacceptable adverse event(s) (AEs); intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment; participant withdraws consent; pregnancy of participant; non-compliance with study intervention or procedure requirements; or administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment.

After the end of treatment, each participant will be followed for the occurrence of AEs and spontaneously reported pregnancy.

Participants who discontinue for reasons other than PD will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until PD is documented clinically by a team of committed dermatologists, and/or radiographically per RECIST 1.1, a non-study anticancer treatment is initiated, consent is withdrawn, or the participant becomes lost to follow-up.

All participants will be followed for overall survival (OS) until death, withdrawal of consent,lost to follow-up, or the end of the study. The end of the study will be when the last participant completes the last study-related telephone call or visit,withdraws from the study, or is lost to follow-up.
