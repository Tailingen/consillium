Pilot Study Evaluating the Role of Histopathology Correlation in Treatment Planning
This clinical research study tests the Uronav system. Patients with prostate cancer will be asked to take part in this study.

Uronav system is an investigational device that is used on this study to help place markers in the patient. These are called fiducial markers and they are placed in the patient to help plan radiation treatment. Radiation therapy treatment will be planned by the treating physician and will not be experimental or part of this research study.

This study will also test the similarities and differences of biopsy tissue structures and the findings from the intraprostatic MRI (internally guided MRI).

Study Objectives

Specific Aim 1: Evaluate final pathology post-operatively for histopathology confirmation of multiparametric MRI targets detected during treatment planning. This will be accomplished by using transperineal biopsies obtained prior to interstitial brachytherapy during the procedure, while under anesthetic just prior to the placement of the brachytherapy needles and sources.

Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the ability of the Uronav system in a transperineal setting to guide biopsy needle placement using the electromagnetic guidance system and transperineal ultrasound probe stabilization device and stepper.
