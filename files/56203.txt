A Phase I, First-in-Human Study of GB268 (PD-1/CTLA-4/VEGF Trispecific Antibody) in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, First-in-Human, Open-Label, Multicenter Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of a Trispecific PD-1/CTLA-4/VEGF Antibody GB268 in Participants with Advanced Solid Tumors. The study will consist of a dose-escalation stage and an dose-expansion stage.
