Microscopic-spectroscopic Examination for Urothelial Tissue Characterization
To evaluate the possibility to properly discriminate between healthy bladder tissue and BCa with a multimodal fiber optic spectroscopy (MFOS) technique, in order to possibly introduce a more objective way to detect BCa, thus reducing inter-observer variability and maybe to determine urothelial carcinoma stage and grade with a comparable accuracy, specificity and sensibility of the current gold standard histopathological analysis
Bladder Tumor
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Multimodal spectroscopic analysis
diagnostic concordance, concordance in identifying healthy and tumor tissue between multimodal fiberoptic spectroscopy and pathology, considered as gold standard, 30 minutes from resection
grading concordance, concordance in discriminating low vs high grade tumor between multimodal fiberoptic spectroscopy and pathology, considered as gold standard, 30 minutes from resection|staging concordance, concordance in discriminating Ta vs T1 vs T2 tumors between multimodal fiberoptic spectroscopy and pathology, considered as gold standard, 30 minutes from resection
Observational single center study on human biological samples to evaluate the possibility to discriminate between healthy and tumor tissue on urothelial bladder samples. Aim of the study is to provide a fast, reliable and label free aid/alternative to current histopathology
