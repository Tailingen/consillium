Optimizing Endobronchial Ultrasound Sampling for Molecular Markers for NSCLC
In this monocentric randomized controlled trial, 120 potential non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients for which tissue diagnosis and material for next generation sequencing (NGS) is required for clinical management will be approached the day of their endobronchial ultrasound to participate in the study. They will be randomized to 2 vs 3 passes/lymph node and will all undergo liquid biopsy. The co-primary outcomes are 1)the rate of obtention of adequate material for NGS testing with 2 vs 3 passes/lymph node and 2)the percentage of patients for which liquid biopsy allows to identify clinically pertinent findings not available from tissue biopsy
Lung Cancer|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Circulating Tumor Cell
PROCEDURE: Endobronchial ultrasound
Rate of obtention of adequate material for NGS testing with 2 vs 3 passes/lymph node, Cell block will be reviewed by a blinded pathologist to determine the percentage of tumor cells within the sample by increment of 5%. More than 10% of tumor cell will be considered adequate., At recruitment completion (expected time 2 years), all cell blocks will be reviewed by the blinded pathologist to assess adequacy rate for NGS testing|Percentage of patients for which liquid biopsy allowed to identify genetic alterations not identified from tissue biopsy, A case for which liquid biopsy NGS testing allows to identify a genetic alteration not identified by matched tissue biopsy (tissue inadequate, insufficient for molecular testing or adequate but genetic alteration not found) will be considered a case for which liquid biopsy provided additional clinical findings, At 1 month
