Study of Inupadenant (EOS100850) with Chemotherapy As Second Line Treatment for Nonsquamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The study will first determine the optimal dose of inupadenant to be given in combination with carboplatin and pemetrexed to patients that progressed after receiving first line anti-PD(L)1 treatment for locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The efficacy and safety of the combination is then compared to standard of care carboplatin and pemetrexed in the same populations.

The study is composed of two parts. Part 1 follows an open-label, dose-finding design where individual cohorts are treated with various dose levels of inupadenant combined with standard of care dosing of carboplatin and pemetrexed. The recommended phase 2 dose is determined prior to initiation of Part 2 which then compares inupadenant to placebo with both arms treated in combination with standard of care carboplatin and pemetrexed.

Participants in both parts are enrolled from two populations of patients with nonsquamous NSCLC that have progressed after first line treatment as follows: non-resectable patients treated with chemoradiotherapy followed by anti-PD-(L)1 or metastatic patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy without chemotherapy.

Imaging, safety and PRO assessments are performed during the treatment and follow-up phase as well as pharmacokinetic and other exploratory analyses.
