Neoadjuvant FOLFOX Plus Bevacizumab Chemotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Colon Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see if giving chemo-therapy for colon cancer before surgery can shrink the cancer and lead to a higher rate of cure than operating first and then giving chemotherapy. Standard treatment for colon cancer is to first operate, and then, if the tumor is advanced, give chemotherapy for about 6 months. However, surgery delays the time until chemotherapy can start, since the body needs time to heal from the operation. During this time any cancer cells that remain in the body that were not removed by the operation may be allowed to grow. Giving chemotherapy first could attack the cancer cells right from the start, not only at the tumor site that we know of, but also at the site of any cancer cells that may have spread to other parts of the body. Another possible reason why giving chemo therapy first might work better is that the blood vessels that feed the cancer cells are intact before surgery and thus chemotherapy can travel directly to the cancer.

This study will also use the drug bevacizumab, in addition to the standard chemotherapy. Bevacizumab has been on the market since 2004 for colon cancer that has spread to other organs, but its use in earlier stage colon cancer, as planned in this trial, is still under study.
