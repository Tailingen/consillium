MTD, Safety, and Efficacy of Pomalidomide (CC-4047) Alone or With Low-dose Dexamethasone in Patients With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and effectiveness of the study drug (CC-4047) Alone Or in Combination With Low-dose Dexamethasone as treatment for patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Aspirin
Phase 1: Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT) in Cycle 1, The maximum tolerated dose was defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 participants experiences a DLT within the first 28-day cycle.

DLTs were defined as:

* Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia
* Febrile neutropenia
* Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea despite optimal symptomatic treatment
* Serum transaminase \> 20 \* upper limit of normal (ULN)
* Serum transaminase \> 5 \* ULN for \>= 7 days
* Delay of the start of cycle 2 by \>7 days due to pomalidomide-related adverse event, Up to Day 28 (Cycle 1)|Phase 2: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Progression-free Survival (PFS) as of the 01 April 2011 Cut-off, Progression free survival (PFS) is the time from randomization to the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause during study, whichever occurs earlier. Disease progression was assessed by the Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC).

For the primary PFS analysis, participants who withdrew for any reason or received another antimyeloma therapy (except adding dexamethasone to the Phase 2: Pomalidomide arm) without documented PD (as determined by the IRAC review) were censored on the date of their last adequate response assessment, prior to receiving any other anti-myeloma therapy. Subjects who were still active at the time of the data cut-off date without PD (as determined by the IRAC) were censored on the date of their last adequate response assessment.

* Complete Response (CR)-absence of serum and urine monoclonal paraprotein for 6 weeks, plus no increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions, plus other factors)
* Partial Response (PR)-not all CR criteria, plus \>=50% reduction in serum monoclonal paraprotein plus others
* Minimal Response (MR)- 25-49% reduction in serum monoclonal paraprotein plus others
* Stable Disease (SD)- not MR or progressive disease (PD)
* Progressive Disease (PD)- reappearance of monoclonal paraprotein, lytic bone lesions, other
* Not Evaluable (NE).

Data collection is ongoing and future data results will be included as available., up to 70 weeks|Phase 2: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Duration of Response as of the 01 April 2011 Cut-off, Duration of myeloma response is defined as the time from when the response criteria are first met for partial response (PR) or better, until the first date the response criteria are met for progressive disease (PD) or until the participant dies from any cause, whichever occurs first. Duration of response for participants last known to be alive with no progression after a complete response (CR) or PR was censored at the date of last adequate response assessment. Participants with confirmed responses that occur after receiving any other anti-myeloma therapy (except for adding dexamethasone to the pomalidomide treatment arm), including radiation therapy initiated after baseline, was censored at the last adequate assessment prior to the initiation of such treatment.

Response was assessed by the Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC) using European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant (EBMT) criteria as described in the previous outcome., up to 70 weeks|Phase 2: Time to Response as of the 01 April 2011 Cut-off, Time to myeloma response is defined as the time from randomization to the time the response criteria for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) are first met.

Response was assessed by the Independent Response Adjudication Committee (IRAC) using European Group for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant (EBMT) criteria as described previously.

Participants who die, regardless of the cause of the death, were considered to have had an event. All participants who were lost to follow-up prior to the end of the trial or who were withdrawn from the trial were censored at the time of last contact. Participants who were still being treated were censored at the last available date the subject was known to be alive, or clinical cut-off date if it was earlier.

The Phase 1 segment of the study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single-agent pomalidomide, which was to be determined in the first cycle of treatment. Following completion of the first cycle, participants were allowed to continue the study at their assigned dose of pomalidomide.

Participants who developed progressive disease (PD) at any time, or who had not achieved at least a 25% reduction of serum myeloma (M)-protein levels (if measurable) and a 50% reduction of urine M-protein (if measurable) compared with baseline after completion of 4 cycles of pomalidomide, had the option to receive oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day treatment cycle in addition to their current dose of pomalidomide. Participants with PD who chose not to add dexamethasone to pomalidomide therapy were to be discontinued from the study. Participants who chose to add dexamethasone were allowed to continue study treatment until PD developed again, unacceptable toxicity or participant withdrew consent, at which time they were to be discontinued.

Based on results from the phase 1 portion, the Data Monitoring Committee confirmed 4 mg/day as MTD of pomalidomide. Therefore, the recommended starting dose of pomalidomide for Phase 2 was 4 mg/day on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. In the combination treatment arm, the starting dose of dexamethasone was 40 mg once per day. For subjects who were \> 75 years of age, the starting dose of dexamethasone was 20 mg once per day. To prevent blood clots, all participants were to be given aspirin 81-100 mg daily (commercial supply) unless contraindicated. If contraindicated, another form of anti-thrombotic therapy was provided.

Participants in the Phase II combination treatment arm could continue study treatment until PD developed, at which time they were to be discontinued. Participants in the single agent pomalidomide treatment arm who developed PD, confirmed by the IRAC, at any time had the option to receive oral dexamethasone in addition to their current dose of pomalidomide at the starting dose described above. Participants with PD who chose not to add dexamethasone to pomalidomide therapy were discontinued from study treatment. Participants who chose to add dexamethasone to pomalidomide therapy could continue study treatment until PD developed again, unacceptable toxicity or participant withdrew consent, at which point they were discontinued.

Upon discontinuation from study treatment for PD or any other reason, participants were to be assessed two times per year, up to five years, for survival, second primary malignancy and subsequent anti-myeloma therapies.

Two analyses were planned during the course of the Phase 2 segment: one interim analysis (at 50% information of progression-free survival (PFS) events) and one final analysis. The Data Monitoring Commmittee recommended that Celgene personnel be unblinded based on the strength of the data. Subsequently, Celgene decided to file an application based on more current study data. The product was approved by the FDA in February 2013.

Since no further analyses are required per protocol nor to support the marketing application, the study was amended to remove undue burden from patients who remain on active treatment by ending the treatment segments of this study and transferring all active patients tothe Long-term Follow-up Phase. These patients who continue to be treated with pomalidomide will be provided Pomalyst through the Celgene Patient Support Program (Pomalyst REMSTM) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, the investigator decides to change therapy or patient decision. Investigators will treat their patients according to the local standard of care and follow the assessments required for patients in the Long-term Follow-up Phase. These assessments include subsequent myeloma therapies, second primary malignancies and survival.

The study continues. A final analysis will be performed when the study is completed and results reported as available.
