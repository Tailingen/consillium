Efficacy and Safety of Different Initial Doses of Oral Propranolol in the Treatment of Ulcerated Infantile Hemangioma
The main objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of different doses of propranolol in the treatment of ulcerattion infantile hemangioma (IH).
Infantile Hemangioma
DRUG: propranolol
Time to ulcer healing, Time from the start of treatment with propranolol to complete ulcer healing, 1.5 years
The resolution of IH at month 6 after treatment, complete resolution/complete resolution/partial resolution/no effect/withdrawal from treatment, 1.5 years|adverse events, The incidence of adverse events in the two groups after oral propranolol at different doses, 1.5 years
Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common benign tumor in infants, with an estimated prevalence of 4%-5%. Although most IH resolves over time without serious sequelae, a significant proportion can lead to serious complications such as ulcers. Propranolol is considered to be an effective treatment modality for ulceration IH, and there are retrospective studies suggesting that starting treatment at a low dose is safe and effective. However, due to the lack of prospective study, the effectiveness of different doses of propranolol for initiating treatment of ulceration IH is unknown. Therefore, a prospective study of ulceration IHs in Chinese children was conducted to clarify its efficacy.
