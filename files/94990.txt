Exploring the Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors and Perceived Barriers of Hepatologists Towards Non-invasive Hepatocellular Carcinoma Prediction Models in Hepatitis C Patients Who Achieved Sustained Virological Response Following Direct Acting Antivirals Therapy
This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KAB) of hepatologists regarding different models used to predict hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) who achieved sustained virological response (SVR) after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. The study will use a structured questionnaire targeting hepatologists globally to evaluate their familiarity with, confidence in, and clinical application of various predictive models. The primary outcome is the proportion of hepatologists who incorporate prediction models in clinical practice, while secondary outcomes include the level of knowledge about different models, perceived reliability, and barriers to their implementation the aim of the study 1) To evaluate the level of knowledge among hepatologists regarding existing HCC prediction models for post-SVR HCV patients.

2) To assess hepatologists' attitudes toward the utility, reliability, and clinical value of these models.

3) To identify the extent to which hepatologists incorporate predictive models into their clinical decision-making.

4) To determine perceived barriers to the adoption of these models in clinical practice.

5) To explore the factors associated with poor adoption of these predictive models.
