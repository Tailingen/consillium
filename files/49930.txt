Nectin-4 Specific LMW PET Probe Imaging in Urothelial Carcinoma
To evaluate the ability of \[68Ga\]N188 to detect nectin-4 overexpression in patients with urothelial carcinoma, especially in patients with recurrent or advanced bladder cancer.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: 18F-FDG
Standardized uptake value（SUV）, SUV is a semi-quantitative analysis index to describe the radioactive uptake of lesions, which has certain reference value for differentiating benign and malignant lesions。 The uptake of the tracer （68Ga-N188） in urothelial carcinoma tumor lesions by measuring SUV on PET/CT., 2 years
