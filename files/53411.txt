Mammosite Breast Brachytherapy Optimization in the Treatment of Breast Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine if Mammosite Catheter optimization using multiple dwell position delivery decreases skin toxicity over historically reported skin toxicity with the single dwell delivery method.
Breast Neoplasms
RADIATION: Mammosite brachytherapy radiation
Skin Toxicity the First Year Following Treatment With the Multiple Dwell Mammosite Delivery Method., Evaluation of skin toxicity the first year following treatment with the multiple dwell Mammosite delivery method. The number of participants with a grade 2 skin toxicity (or higher) at 1 year follow up are reported. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and the European organization for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema were used to assess toxicity., one year
Information of Treatment Parameters in Order to Define Parameters Most Predictive of Skin Toxicity, These data were not collected and were not summarized in this study. Results are not available., Upon completion of study
The purpose of this study is to determine if Mammosite Catheter optimization using multiple dwell position delivery decreases skin toxicity over historically reported skin toxicity with the single dwell delivery method.
