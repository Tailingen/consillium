Clinical Study of Oral PI3K/mTOR Inhibitor in Patients With Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors
Clinical study of oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor P7170 in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor P7170 in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors
Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors
DRUG: P7170
Maximum tolerated dose, Patients will receive study drug on a daily basis for twenty-one days according to the dose and schedule specified for a particular cohort of therapy. Toxicities observed in Cycle 1 will be considered for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)determination., End of Cycle 1 (i.e. 21 Days)
Number of subject with adverse events, The toxic effects of the drug would be assessed from adverse events, vital signs and by clinically significant changes in the laboratory evaluations., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (expected to be 4-6 months)|Pharmacokinetic profile(Cmax,Tmax and AUC), The effect of dose for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf and Cmax. Tmax and T1/2 will be given as patient-wise narratives at each dose level., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (expected to be 4-6 months)|Activity of P7170 based on selected biomarkers, Plasma samples will be used for analysis of exploratory biomarkers that are found in plasma and levels of which are likely to change in response to P7170 administration, Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (expected to be 4-6 months)|Objective response, Evaluation of Response: Clinical responses will be presented patient wise for different dose levels., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (expected to be 4-6 months)
An open label multicentric Phase 1 study of oral PI3K/mTOR inhibitor P7170 in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.The study will follow an Accelerated Titration Design (ATD) with 100% dose increments until significant toxicity as described below; followed by standard dose titration with 40% dose increments. Dose and schedule (alternate dosing regimen eg. OD, BID, intermittent) will be determined by the dose escalation outlined in the protocol and considering pharmacokinetics of the study drug determined from earlier cohorts.
