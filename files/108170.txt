Study of Acute Peripheral Vascular Effects, Safety and Tolerability in Subjects With Raynaud's Phenomenon Secondary to Systemic Sclerosis
The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacodynamics (PD) in adult subjects with a diagnosis of Raynaud's Phenomenon secondary to Systemic Sclerosis (SSc).
Raynaud's Phenomenon Secondary to Systemic Sclerosis
DRUG: Alprostadil|OTHER: Placebo
Pharmacodynamic evaluation: digital perfusion by laser Doppler capillary velocimetry and on digital temperature recovery with thermography., two hours (intermittently) after cold-challenge and post-dose|Safety assessments based on review of adverse events, vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests., One month
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of topical Alprostadil on digital perfusion by laser Doppler capillary velocimetry and digital temperature recovery with thermography following standardized cold challenge and to assess the safety and tolerability of 3 doses of Alprostadil topical cream and placebo cream in adult subjects with a diagnosis of Raynaud's Phenomenon secondary to Systemic Sclerosis (SSc).
