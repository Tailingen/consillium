The TG01 Study With TG01/QS-21 Vaccine in Patients With High-risk Smouldering Multiple Myeloma and Multiple Myeloma
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TG01 vaccination in patients with KRAS or NRAS mutation on codon 12/13 mutation who has multiple myeloma or high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma. The main question it aims to answer are:

Is TG01/QS-21 vaccination safe and tolerable for this patient group? Is TG01/QS-21 vaccination treatment efficient in this group in terms of increased overall response rate, overall survival rate, progression-free survival, and time til next treatment? Is there an immunological response to the vaccine? Participants will be given TG01/QS-21 vaccination treatment. Treatment consists of 12 doses of TG01/QS-21 vaccine given every two weeks in the first 12 weeks, followed by every eight weeks until week 52.
Multiple Myeloma|Smoldering Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: TG01
Percentage of participants with adverse events (AEs), An Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Baseline until 30 days after last dose of study drug, up to approximately 3 years|Percentage of participants discontinuing treatment secondary to treatment-related adverse events, Percentage of participants discontinuing treatment secondary to treatment-related adverse events, Up to approximately 3 years
Number of patients with Progression Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from study treatment start to disease progression for every patient, Baseline to 11 years|Concentration of TG01-specific T-cell specific cytokine production, The immune response to TG01 will be measured by IFNg/TNFa ELISPOT or FluoroSpot quantifying the TG01 T-cell specific cytokine production. A positive immune response will be defined as a 2-fold higher mean spot number in experimental wells (with vaccine peptides) compared to control wells (medium), Baseline until end of study, assessed up to 11 years|Overall response rate per patient, The proportion of patients who achieve partial response (PR) or better following at least one dose of study treatment, Baseline to approximately 3 years|Overall Survival (OS) per patient, The OS rate of patients receiving 1 or more study treatments, Baseline until the end of study, assessed up to 11 years|Time to next treatment (TTNT) per patient, defined as the time between the start date of the current treatment line and the start date of the next treatment line, Baseline until the end of study, assessed up to 11 years
