A Multicenter Clinical Study of the Sonablate®450 for the TreAtment of Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer With HIFU (STAR Trial)
For the treatment of locally recurrent prostate cancer following failed external beam radiation therapy (EBRT)
Recurrent Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: High Intensity Focused Ultrasound
absence of biochemical failure, defined as achieving a PSA nadir of ≤ 0.5 ng/mL within 12 months of treatment, 12 months post treatment
negative prostate biopsy at the 12 month time point, 12 months post treatment
The proposed study is a non-randomized, prospective, single arm study. The safety and effectiveness of the Sonablate treatment in subjects with locally recurrent prostate cancer will be evaluated with regard to freedom from biochemical failure and disease recurrence following HIFU treatment.

Men with histologically confirmed, locally recurrent, organ-confined, non-metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma two or more years following EBRT, PSA ≥0.5 ng/mL and ≤10 ng/mL, 40 to 85 years of age, and with initial staging of T1c-T2 prior to radiation, who meet the criteria for salvage treatment, will be enrolled.

This pivotal study will cover pre-treatment through the 12-month post-treatment follow-up visit (8 visits).

A 5 year extended follow-up study will be conducted annually for the 2nd-5th years post treatment (4 additional visits).
