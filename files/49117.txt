Protocol for Primary Fractionated Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Stage T1 - T3N0 Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma.
The study population will exist of patients with a histological diagnosis of NSCLC, stage T1, T2 or T3NO who are not fit for or who refuse surgery. A prospective data analysis will be performed on tumor response, potential acute and late toxicity and survival. A radiotherapy dose of 4x15Gy or 3x 20Gy will be given over 2 weeks with dynamic 3D-conformal arc therapy (Novalis TM)
Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
RADIATION: Fractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy
To monitor potential acute and late toxicity in patients with stage T1,T2,T3N0 non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), treated with primary stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)., Every 3 months for the first 2 years. From 3 to 5 years every 6 months. After 5 years follow-up will happen yearly.
Local control at 2 years. Overall survival, local progression free survival, disease free survival, time to progression and local,regional or disseminated recurrence.Quality of life. Internal and Intra-fractional tumor motion. Biopsy samples., Every 3 months for the first 2 years. From 3 to 5 years every 6 months. After 5 years follow-up will happen yearly.
