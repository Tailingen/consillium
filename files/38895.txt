Study of Crenolanib Combined With Chemotherapy in FLT3-mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients
This is an open label, two-arm, Phase I-II trial, non-randomized. Arm 1: crenolanib with standard chemotherapy (Idarubicin/Cytarabine, MEC;Mitoxantrone/Etoposide/Cytarabine, FLAG-Ida: Fludarabine/Cytarabine/G-CSF/Idarubicin) Arm 2: crenolanib with 5-azacitidine
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Crenolanib besylate|DRUG: Idarubicin|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Azacytidine|DRUG: Mitoxantrone|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: G-CSF
Response Rate of Crenolanib Besylate Combination Therapy, To determine the response rate to crenolanib. CR Complete remission (CR) response criteria include a post-baseline bone marrow (BM) biopsy or aspiration % blasts \<5%, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>1×10\^9/L and platelet count \>100×10\^9/L. CRi response included all CR criteria met, except participant did not experience either platelet recovery or ANC recovery. Morphologic Leukemia-Free State (MLFS) response included ≤5% in % blasts in the BM aspirate or biopsy. Resistant Disease (RD) was defined as the absence of CR, CRi, CRp, PR or MLFS. Death in aplasia response include deaths occurring following chemotherapy while cytopenic with an aplastic or hypoplastic BM prior to death without evidence of persistent leukemia., Baseline up to first documented response, persistent disease, or death (whichever occurs first), 1 year.
For each arm:

The phase I with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) determination will use 3+3 design.

Phase II total of 52 patients (26 per arm) will be treated at established phase I dose.

Enrollment to be simultaneous to each arm.
