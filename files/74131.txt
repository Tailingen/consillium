First-line Apatinib Combined With Tislelizumab and Chemotherapy for Advanced GC
In this clinical study, investigators explore the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy regimen with antiangiogenic agent (apatinib), ICI (tislelizumab), and chemotherapy (capecitabine+ Oxaliplatin, XELOX) as first-line treatment for HER2-negative, advanced G/GEJ cancer patients with signet ring cell carcinoma or peritoneal metastasis.
Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Apatinib Combined With Tislelizumab and Chemotherapy
PFS, progression-free survival, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Patients received 8 cycles of apatinib (250 mg, qd, d1-14), tislelizumab (200 mg d1), and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2, d1) plus oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m2, bid, d1-14) every 3 weeks, with a maintenance therapy with apatinib plus tislelizumab for a maximum of 1 year. Homogeneous patients receiving ICIs combined with chemotherapy at the same time were deemed as the control group for efficacy.
