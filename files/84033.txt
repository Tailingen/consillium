All patients will answer at the baseline and at the end of the intervention EORTC QLQ-C30 (30 items). The scoring will be performed according to the EORTC scoring manual. All scores will be linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale., Baseline and at the end of the 12-week programme|Change from Baseline in Fatigue related-Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) scores, Cancer related fatigue score; European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-FA12).

All patients will answer at the baseline and at the end of the intervention, week 12. All scores will be linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale., Baseline and at the end of the 12-week programme|Change from Baseline in weight., The dietitian will perform physical assessments of each patient at the baseline and at the end of the study. The dietitian will record the weight in kg., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Change from Baseline in muscle strength and mass., The physiotherapist will perform physical assessments of each patient at the baseline and at the end of the study. The physiotherapist will measure the muscle strength and mass through leg extension and biceps curl in kg., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Change from Baseline in 6-minute walk test., The physiotherapist will perform 6-minute walk test and measure it in metres (m)., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Change from Baseline in muscle strength scores on handgrip measurements, The dietitian will perform physical assessments to each patient at the baseline and at the end of the study. Muscle strength will be measured using hand grip strength (HGS) based on the Jamar Dynamometer (Model 091011725)., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Change from Baseline in Diet intake scores from multiple 24-hour recalls, complemented by a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), All patients will answer at the baseline and at the end of the intervention the FFQ. All patients will answer at the baseline and at the end of the intervention the Food Frequency Questionnaire. Data will be entered in to the FFQ European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Tool for Analysis (FETA). FETA calculates the average daily intake of 46 nutrients and 14 food groups, for each individual. The default nutrients list provides a description of each nutrient/food group and the units used. The nutrient data for the FFQ foods have come from McCance and Widdowson's "The Composition of Foods (5th edition)" and its associated supplements., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Change from Baseline in Diet quality scores from The World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) standardised scoring system (Shams-White et al 2019)., All patients will answer at the baseline and at the end of the intervention the WCRF/AICR. The higher the score, the better Diet quality., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Change from Baseline in BMI scores., The dietitian will perform physical assessments of each patient at the baseline and at the end of the study. Weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m\^2. Weight will be reported in kg., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Change from Baseline in Lean Body Mass (LBM) scores., The dietitian will perform physical assessments of each patient at the baseline and at the end of the study. Weight and body fat will be combined to report LBM in kg\*(Percentage body/100)., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Change from Baseline in waist circumference scores., The dietitian will perform physical assessments of each patient at the baseline and at the end of the study. Waist circumference will be measured in cm., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Change from Baseline in Segmental Body Composition scores assessed measured by Body Composition Monitor bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS)., The dietitian will perform physical assessments on each patient at the baseline and at the end of the study. Weight (Kg) and body fat (%) and Total Body Water (TBW) will be combined to report the Body Composition score., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Change from Baseline in Nutritional risk scores assessed by the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST), All patients will complete the MST at the baseline and at the end of the intervention. The higher the score, the higher risk of malnutrition., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|Self-care agency and its relationship to quality of life and symptoms experienced, * Instruments to measure self-care agency include the ASAS-R
* Additional Assessments as identified by the scoping review will be included in the Expansion Phase. The higher the score, the better the self-care agency., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks).|The resource utilisation of signposted services among participants in the 12-week intervention programme, Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (EQ-5D-5L). A high score represents high functionality problems., Baseline and the programme endpoint (12 weeks). A high score represents high functionality problems.|Satisfaction of participants and Health Care Professionals with the programme and their perceptions of the systems usability., Qualitative analysis of Usability, Satisfaction and Feasibility Questionnaire Participants, health care professionals and the broader team involved in the development and implementation of the programme will be invited to provide feedback after the completion of their involvement in the study.

Study design: Sequential Cohorts/ Parallel Sampling Groups Specific Aim: To assess the feasibility of a comprehensive multidisciplinary interventional programme for men living with advanced/metastatic genitourinary cancers Sample size: 72

Entry criteria: Advanced / metastatic genitourinary cancer (including prostate, kidney, urothelial tract, testicular and/or penile cancers), provided they meet the following conditions:

* Prostate cancer - Histologically confirmed prostate cancer and must have commenced Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) in the form of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or a GnRH receptor antagonist and/or an androgen receptor antagonist and/or undergone bilateral orchidectomy for prostate cancer.
* Urothelial tract cancer - Stage II - IV urothelial tract cancer after completion of primary treatment with systemic therapy
* Kidney cancer - Stage II - III renal cell cancer
* Testicular cancer - Stage II - III testicular cancer after completion of primary treatment
* Penile cancer - â€¢ Stage III - IV penile cancer after completion of primary treatment with systemic therapy
* Currently on active surveillance (i.e. no active systemic therapies at present) or continuing on maintenance systemic therapy, provided they do not have ongoing adverse events which will impact their participation at the time of commencing the 12-week intervention.
* Note: Men with resected disease (adjuvant setting) are eligible if they have commenced or completed adjuvant systemic therapy within the past 12 months and have recovered from these treatments at the time of commencing the 12-week programme from ongoing systemic therapy.
