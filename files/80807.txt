Effectiveness and Safety Study of TACE Plus Oral Sorafenib for Unresectable HCC
The purpose of this study is to determine if TACE plus Sorafenib will improve outcome in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) not amenable to surgery.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: TACE
Determine Progression-free Survival in This Patient Population Treated With the Proposed Combination Treatment Modality, Progression free survival (PFS) is calculated as the time interval between the date on which a patient first received protocol treatment and the documented date of disease progression or death. For a surviving and progression-free patient, PFS is censored by the last follow-up date when that patient is documented to be progression free. Progression is defined using RECIST v1.0, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measureable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Up to 24 months (from initial treatment through 12 months follow-up)
Determine the Overall Survival in Patients Treated With This Combination Regimen, Overall survival (OS) is calculated as the time interval between the date on which a patient first received protocol treatment and the documented date of death. For a surviving patient, OS is censored by the last follow-up date when that patient is documented to be alive., From date of initial treatment until the date of death from any cause
The proposed study will make an important contribution to understanding not only the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in addition to TACE in patients diagnosed with unresectable HCC, but this will also be the first clinical trial with sorafenib to assess the effects of this novel therapy on HRQL. Understanding the effects of sorafenib on HRQL is critical in the treatment of HCC secondary to the modest benefits in survival that have been reported with conventional therapies. Our team has one of the largest experiences in evaluating HRQL in patients diagnosed with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We have previously reported on alternative methods of evaluating HRQL, solutions for missing data in clinical trials as well as tested statistical and clinically meaningful differences, within and between treatment groups, in clinical trials with patients diagnosed with hepatobiliary carcinoma.
