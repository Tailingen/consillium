Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Omacetaxine mepesuccinate
Percentage of Participants Achieving an Overall Hematologic Response by Subpopulation and Total Population, Subpopulations reflect chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) phases at the time of enrollment: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Primary endpoints as adjudicated by the Data Monitoring Committee were used for the primary analyses.

Overall hematologic response for chronic phase participants includes confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR). Overall hematologic response for accelerated or blast phase participants includes confirmed complete hematologic response (CHR), no evidence of leukemia (NEL), or return to chronic phase (RCP). Hematologic response must last \>= 8 weeks to be considered meaningful.

Response rates by disease phase were examined relative to an a priori value of 2.5% using a one-sided lower 95% exact binomial confidence limit. If the lower limit from the one-sided lower 95% confidence limit exceeds 2.5%, the observed response rate will have exceeded the minimum threshold required to demonstrate efficacy., Day 1 up to 6 months|Percentage of Participants Achieving a Major Cytogenetic Response by Subpopulation and Total Population, Subpopulations reflect chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) phases at the time of enrollment: chronic, accelerated, and blast phase. Primary endpoints as adjudicated by the Data Monitoring Committee were used for the primary analyses.

Major cytogenetic response includes complete or partial response. Both confirmed and unconfirmed major cytogenetic response is considered meaningful.

Unconfirmed response is based on a single bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation for participants where a confirmatory evaluation is not available.

Complete response shows 0% Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) cells. A partial response shows \>0% - 35% Ph+ cells.

Treatment related toxicity was considered by the investigator to be unrelated, possibly, probably or unknown related to study drug.

Severity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0 on the following scale: Grade 1 = mild, Grade 2 = moderate, Grade 3 = severe, Grade 4 = life-threatening, Grade 5 = death.

A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that is fatal or life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; requires or prolongs in-patient hospitalization; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient; and conditions not included in the above that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

A participant is only counted once in each category (at worst severity or strongest relationship)., up to 3 years

Point mutations within the ABL kinase domain of the BCR-ABL gene are emerging as the most frequent mechanism for resistance to imatinib and resultant reactivation of kinase activity. The risk of mutation development is particularly high in patients who are beyond chronic phase, as well as those with a long duration of disease prior to imatinib therapy.

The T315I kinase domain (KD) point mutation has merited particular attention, as T315I expressing CML cells are markedly resistant to imatinib. CML patients with the T315I KD mutation, therefore, do not respond to continued treatment with imatinib, and preliminary clinical data indicate that neither of two newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors will have activity in patients with T315I KD mutation either.

Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (HHT) is a potent inducer of apoptosis (programmed cell death) in myeloid cells and inhibits angiogenesis (blood vessel formation). In Phase 2 studies, HHT has demonstrated clinical activity in patients with CML, both as a single agent and in-combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs. HHT works via a different mechanism than imatinib or other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI's), and HHT has been shown to inhibit in vitro CML cell lines which harbor the T315I KD mutation and are highly resistant to imatinib. Therefore, CML patients who have the T315I KD mutation may still respond to treatment with HHT. HHT may therefore be an attractive therapeutic option for patients with the T315I KD mutation.

On this basis, a multicenter clinical trial is being conducted of HHT therapy for CML patients who have failed prior imatinib therapy and have the T315I KD mutation.

Patients will be treated with an induction course consisting of subcutaneous (SC) HHT twice daily for 14 consecutive days every 28 days. Patients who demonstrate a response, may receive maintenance therapy for up to 24 months, consisting of subcutaneous (SC) HHT twice daily for 7 days every 28 days.
