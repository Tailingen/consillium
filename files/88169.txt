A Study Of AL101In Patients With Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) Bearing Activating Notch Mutations
This is a Phase 2, non comparative, open label, multicenter study of AL101 in patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC who harbor NOTCH 1,2,3,4 activating mutations.
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
DRUG: AL101
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as partial response (PR) + complete response (CR) as assessed by the investigator based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 for target lesions assessed by MRI.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., 3 years and 7 months
Clinical Benefit Response Rate (CBR), Clinical benefit response rate (CBR) is defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) by investigator review based on RECIST v1.1 for target lesions assessed by MRI.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage (at least 30%) to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase (more than 20%) to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters., 3 years and 7 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined at the time from first infusion of investigational product to death due to any cause. Subjects with no documentation of death were censored at the last known date known to be alive., 3 years and 5 months
This is a Phase 2, non-comparative, open-label, multicenter study of AL101 in patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC who harbor NOTCH 1,2,3,4 activating mutations.

The study includes 2 cohorts, ran in a sequential fashion:

Cohort 1 - AL101 4 mg once weekly (QW) intravenously (IV) Cohort 2 - AL101 6 mg QW IV
