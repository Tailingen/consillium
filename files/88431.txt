DRUG: Loncastuximab Tesirine|DRUG: Idelalisib
Complete Response Rate (CRR), CRR was defined as the percentage of participants who experienced a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) assessed prior to any subsequent anticancer treatment., Up to the end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a BOR of CR or partial response (PR) assessed prior to any subsequent anticancer treatment., Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time between the randomization date and the first documentation of recurrence, progression, or death., Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time between the randomization date and death from any cause., Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the documentation of tumor response to disease progression or death., Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAEs were defined as an AE that occurs or worsens in the period extending from the first dose of study treatment until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or start of new anti-cancer therapy, whichever is earlier.

Any clinically significant changes from baseline in the safety laboratory values, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status were reported as TEAEs., Day 1 to 30 days after end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Average Concentration of Loncastuximab Tesirine Before Infusion, Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Average Concentration of Loncastuximab Tesirine at the End of Infusion, Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Clearance Rate of Loncastuximab Tesirine, Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Volume of Distribution of Loncastuximab Tesirine, Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Number of Participants With Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA) Titers to Loncastuximab Tesirine, Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Measured by the EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Change From Baseline in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) as Measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-Lym), Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Number of Participants With Specific Symptomatic Adverse Event Symptoms As Selected From Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), The specific symptomatic adverse events includes fatigue, swelling, rash, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cough., Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days|Treatment-Related Symptoms as Assessed by Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), The specific symptoms assessed include fatigue, swelling, rash, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cough. The severity is assessed from "None" to "Very severe" and the interference level is assessed from "Not at all" to "Very much.", Up to end of treatment, maximum time on treatment was 333 days
