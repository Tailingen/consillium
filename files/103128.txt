Dose Escalation Pan-FGFR (Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor) Inhibitor (Rogaratinib)
* This was the first study where BAY1163877 was given to humans. Impact of the study was to evaluate if patients with advanced solid cancers show advanced clinical benefit under the treatment with the pan FGFR inhibitor. Patients (all comers) received the study drug treatment in a dose-escalation scheme (no placebo group) to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BAY1163877. The relative bioavailability of liquid service formulation and tablets was determined.
* After the MTD was defined patients with solid tumors (all comers), lung cancer (lung adenocarcinoma \& squamous non-small cell lung cancer), head and neck cancer or bladder cancer was enrolled according to their FGFR expression profile (biomarker stratification).
* The study also assessed the pharmacokinetics, biomarker status, pharmacodynamic parameters and tumor response of BAY1163877.
* BAY1163877 was given twice daily as oral application. Treatment was stopped if the tumor continued to grow, if side effects, which the patient cannot tolerate, occurred or if the patient decided to exit treatment.

Response Rate as Defined by RECIST Version 1.1 Reported as Number of Participants With Different Response Type, Response as defined by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) version 1.1: complete response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions), partial response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions taking as the reference the baseline sum of diameters), stable disease (SD: steady state of disease. Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters while in the trial), progressive disease (PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as a references the smallest sum on study)., Up to 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time (days) from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first observed disease progression (radiological or clinical) or death due to any cause, if death occurred before progression was documented. PFS for participants without tumor progression at the time of analysis was censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., Up to 2 years|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from start of study treatment until first observed disease progression (radiological or clinical). Progression is defined using RECIST v1.0, as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions, taking as a references the smallest sum on study., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR (for partial and complete response (PR/CR)) was defined as the time (days) from the first documented objective response of PR or CR, whichever was noted earlier, to disease progression or death (if death occurred before progression was documented).

Based on these analyses, point estimates (LS-means) and exploratory 90% confidence intervals for the ratios (tablet/solution) of Cmax/D, AUC(0- tlast)/D, and AUC/D were calculated by re-transformation of the logarithmic data using the intra-individual standard deviation of the ANOVA., On Cycle 1, Day -3 and Cycle 1, Day 1|Tmax (Time to Reach Maximum Drug Concentration in Plasma) of BAY1163877 After Single Dose Administration on Cycle 1, Day -3 and Cycle 1, Day 1, Tmax (time to reach maximum drug concentration in plasma) of BAY1163877 after single dose administration on Cycle 1, Day -3 and Cycle 1, Day 1.
