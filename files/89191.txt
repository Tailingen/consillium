VNP40101M in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent, Progressive, or Refractory Primary Brain Tumors
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as VNP40101M, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of VNP40101M in treating young patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: laromustine
Estimate the maximum tolerated dose, First 6 weeks of therapy|Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities, First 6 weeks of therapy
Pharmacokinetics, Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic studies will be collected with the first dose of the study drug pre-infusion, and 5, 15, and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours after the end of infusion. VNP40101M plasma concentration-time data will be modeled and the individual pharmacokinetic pararmeters volume of the central compartment, elimination rate constant, and half-life will be estimated., Day 1 of therapy|Tumor response to VNP40101M, MRI of the brain will be obtained prior to couses 3, 5, and 7 and at the end of therapy, Prior to course 3, 5, and 7 and end of therapy
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of VNP40101M in pediatric patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary brain tumors.

Secondary

* Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug and its active metabolite VNP4090CE in these patients.
* Determine the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to receiving â‰¥ 1 of the following prior therapies: craniospinal irradiation (yes vs no), autologous bone marrow transplant (yes vs no), and \> 2 myelosuppressive chemotherapy or myelosuppressive biologic therapy regimens (yes vs no).

Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 2-6 patients per stratum receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 25% of patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 12 patients are treated at the MTD.

Patients are followed for 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-60 patients (2-30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
