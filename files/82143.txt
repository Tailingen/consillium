Therapeutic Strategies in Patients With Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Brain Metastases
The patients carrying a complicated primary lung cancer brain metastases die in less than 3 months of delay disease in the absence of treatment. The median survival of these patients is approximately six months when the treatment associated with radiotherapy chemotherapy based on cisplatin is now the standard treatment. In most studies the patients die of their brain disease in one case only two, so it is likely that some patients do not require brain irradiation (prognosis in this case is linked to extra-cerebral disease ). The benefits for patients in group B (without systematic irradiation) are not to suffer the side effects of this radiation. The risks are in the same group to see brain metastases become symptomatic.

The role of cerebral radiotherapy in the patients treated with chemotherapy is unclear: should all patients be irradiated systematically (since the "reference" treatment is involved and with the aim of obtaining better control of the brain lesions and maintaining a better neurological status) or should only the patients showing cerebral progression be irradiated (avoidance of possibly useless brain radiotherapy and its side effects). The aim of this study is to better determine the position of cerebral radiotherapy in this context.

Main objective:

determine whether there is a difference in terms of progression-free survival between a therapeutic strategy with initial systematic brain radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy cis-platine/alimta + / - Bevacizumab and strategy with an initial chemotherapy cis-platine/alimta + / - Bevacizumab associated with brain radiotherapy only in cases of cerebral progression in patients with NSCLC with asymptomatic brain metastases

DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Bevacizumab|RADIATION: Cerebral Radiotherapy
To compare the progression-free survival rate in both arms, Whether there is a difference in terms of progression-free survival between a therapeutic strategy with initial brain radiotherapy followed by systematic chemotherapy with cis-platinum / alimta and a strategy with initial chemotherapy with cis-platinum / alimta with brain radiotherapy only if brain progression in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases asymptomatic., From date of the randomization until the date of first detection of progression, or until the date of death, assessed up to up to approximately 90 months
Overall survival, After 4 cycles of chemotherapy with platinum salt-pemetrexed (with or without bevacizumab) possibly followed, in case of control of the disease and if the patient's condition allows, by pemetrexed (alone or with bevacizumab if the latter was part of the initial treatment) as maintenance treatment until progression., From the date of randomization until the date of patient death, assessed up to 90 months|Disease control rate (response + stability), Repeat examinations to assess the measurable lesions or initials and examination necessary to confirm the appearance of a new lesion in case of clinical suspicion of disease progression (minimum CT scan and MRI).The radiological treatment response will be measured according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria, Baseline, between 21 and 28 days, then every 6 weeks, up to approximately 24 months|Tolerance of treatment, The safety of the induction combination of cisplatin or carboplatin plus pemetrexed (Alimta®) +/- bevacizumab, the maintenance treatment with pemetrexed (Alimta®) +/- bevacizumab and the pancerebral radiotherapy will be assessed based on the CTC toxicity criteria v3.0., Every 3 weeks, up to approximately 24 months|Quality of life assessment, The quality of life assessment measurement will be performed by self-questionnaire. The EURO-QOL questionnaire will be used., Baseline, between 21 and 28 days, then every 6 weeks, up to approximately 24 months|Neurological assessment, The neurological assessment measurement will be performed by self-questionnaire. The MOCA questionnaires will be used., Baseline, between 21 and 28 days, then every 6 weeks, up to approximately 24 months
This is a trial comparing two strategies with the aim to determine the best place for cerebral radiotherapy (initially or only systematic progression).

Arm A: Initial cerebral radiotherapy and chemotherapy, standard arm Arm B: Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy brain if clinical or radiological cerebral progression , experimental arm (The chemotherapy treatments are standard treatments using drugs with authorization in this indication)
