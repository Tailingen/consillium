Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been successfully used for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancy. In recent years, non-myeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (NST) has been introduced to treat solid tumors due to the Graft-versus tumor effect. In this study, the investigators try to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NST in the treatment of unresectable pancreatic cancer patients.
