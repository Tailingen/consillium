Expression of Ku70/XRCC6 in Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia
Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is a rare disease whose pathophysiology remains at present poorly understood, although a recurrent mutation (L265P MYD88) has recently been described. Unlike other lymphoproliferative disorders, there is a defect in isotype switching, mechanism involving AID and NHEJ complex. Using a two-dimensional electrophoresis technology, our group showed that MW had a specific proteomic profile, and one of the differentially expressed proteins is Ku70 (encoded by XRCC6 belonging to NHEJ complex) .

The investigators purpose to explore the mechanisms of underexpression of Ku70/XRCC6 (genetic or epigenetic modification) in comparison with other lymphoid malignancies and normal B cells.
Waldenström Macroglobulinemia
BIOLOGICAL: Blood or bone marrow samples
Measure of ratio Ku70/XRCC6, Comparing the average level of expression of Ku70 in B cells measured in patients of WM, in patients other SLP and in healthy subjects (without MW and other SLP) , matched for age ( +/- 5 years) and sex, Baseline
