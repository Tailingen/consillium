Correlation Between Psychological Stress and Disease Progression in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients
It is a single-center, prospective, observational，non-randomized study of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients conducted in a tertiary hospital. The investigators examine the psychological stress, immune biomarker changes, quality of life, and disease progression of patients with glioblastoma at five-time points.

The study had two cohorts, a high-stress cohort and a low-stress cohort, which are grouped after initial recruitment. Both groups undergo total resection of tumors and received 3 months of standardized treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Neither participants nor doctors but the researcher can choose which group participants are in. No one knows if one study group is better or worse than the other.

Tumor mutation burden（TMB）, The proportion of tumor mutational burden ≥10 Mut/MB in the population who remain progression-free after diagnosis., From the time of diagnosis to 12 months|The proportion of patients with high-level psychological stress, The self-report questionnaire of Perceived Stress Scale（PSS）is used to measure the psychological stress level of patients, with 43 as the critical value, more than or equal to 43 as the high level of psychological stress, less than 43 as the low level of psychological stress., From the time of diagnosis to 12 months
The Short Form-36 (SF-36), The questionnaire of Short Form-36 (SF-36) is used health-related quality-of-life measure in participants outcomes. The scale contains 9 dimensions with a total score of 100 points., From the time of diagnosis to 12 months|Progression-free survival at 6 months, The proportion of participants in the analysis population who remain progression-free for at least six months after diagnosis., From the time of diagnosis to 12 months
Overall survival rate at 12 months, OS-12 is the proportion of participants in the analysis population who remain alive for at least twelve months after diagnosis., From the time of diagnosis to 12 months|Progression-free survival, Median time from allocation to first documented disease progression as per RANO or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years after diagnosis
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumor affecting adults, with a median survival of 12-16 months after diagnosis. The diagnosis of a malignant tumor has a huge impact on patients' psychology, which is easy to lead to patients in a state of stress.

The high-stress level can lead to a change in patients' health behaviors and correlates with the prognosis outcome. In addition, psychological stress can lead to changes in the immune microenvironment, but disease progression and quality of life in glioblastoma have not been adequately demonstrated.

Grouping process: 60 patients are expected to be enrolled. After enrollment, participants will receive regular tumor in situ fluid (fluid within the surgical cavity, TISF) sampling for tumor mutation burden（TMB) analysis and recceive regular MRI. Under the standard of care, participants will receive psychological stress assessment after being diagnosed. according to five psychological scales, and the patients were grouped according to the cut-off value of each scale, the psychological stress of the patients is measured by distress thermometer (DT), perceived stress scale (PSS), anxiety/depression (HADS), VAS stress, and fear of disease progression scale（PoP-Q-SF).

Primary study objectives:

• To evaluate the changes in immune markers of acute and chronic psychological stress in patients with glioblastoma after diagnosis.

Secondary study objectives:

* To evaluate the quality of life of patients with different psychological stress levels.
* To evaluate the progression-free survival of patients with different psychological stress levels.

Exploratory objectives:

* To evaluate the effect of managing the patient's psychological stress on the patient's immune microenvironment.
* To evaluate the incidence of mental illness.
* To evaluate the patient treatment compliance.
