This is a dose escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BDC-4182 to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Participants will be enrolled in each dose cohort until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Additional participants may be enrolled into backfill cohorts at dose levels that have been cleared to collect additional safety and tolerability data. Additional participants may be enrolled at the determined RP2D in an expansion portion of the study.
