Value of Dynamic Monitoring of Early Recurrence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma After Radical Resection Based on CTCS
On the basis of previous retrospective studies, the Task Force will further optimize the CTCs longitudinal surveillance model and initially validate the subclonal origin (CTC-DNA) of recurrent/metastatic foci derived from CTCs at the molecular level in hepatocellular carcinoma, prospective clinical trials will be conducted to further validate the predictive value of the CTCS longitudinal monitoring model in predicting postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and to verify whether it is earlier than imaging to indicate recurrence, to explore the clinical feasibility of CTCs in guiding postoperative adjuvant therapy of liver cancer, and to provide new ideas for early intervention strategy of liver cancer after operation, to establish a set of standardized clinical scheme of auxiliary treatment for patients with liver cancer after operation for accurate and individualized"Early diagnosis and treatment".

The recurrence rate of HCC after radical resection is high. MRD is the root cause of HCC recurrence, and the MRD result is an important basis for auxiliary treatment decision-making after radical resection. On the basis of previous retrospective studies, the Task Force will further optimize the CTCs longitudinal surveillance model and initially validate the subclonal origin (CTC-DNA) of recurrent/metastatic foci derived from CTCs at the molecular level in hepatocellular carcinoma, prospective clinical trials will be conducted to further validate the predictive value of the CTCS longitudinal monitoring model in predicting postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and to verify whether it is earlier than imaging to indicate recurrence, to explore the clinical feasibility of CTCs in guiding postoperative adjuvant therapy of liver cancer, and to provide new ideas for early intervention strategy of liver cancer after operation, to establish a set of standardized clinical scheme of auxiliary treatment for patients with liver cancer after operation for accurate and individualized"Early diagnosis and treatment", to provide high-quality evidence-based medicine for the clinical practice of preventing recurrence after radical hepatectomy
