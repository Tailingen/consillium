A Study of CC-95251, a Monoclonal Antibody Directed Against SIRPÎ±, in Participants With Advanced Solid and Hematologic Cancers
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary clinical activity of CC-95251 as a single agent and in combination with cetuximab and rituximab in participants with advanced solid and hematologic cancers.
