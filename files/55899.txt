Short Course Radiotherapy, Unresectable Rectal Cancer, Liver Metastasis
The purpose of this study is the increase of resection rate of primary cancer in rectal after short course radiotherapy without interrupt chemotherapy schedule during the period of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is followed by additional chemotherapy to prevent the progression of systemic metastasis, and to reduce the incidence of rectal carcinoma including metastasis.
