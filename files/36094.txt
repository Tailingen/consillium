Characterization of Proliferating Compartment in B-Cell Patients and in Healthy Aging Subjects
By ingesting a non-radioactive and non-toxic compound "heavy water" for 6 weeks, the DNA of newly developed cells in the body of subjects with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia can be labeled and followed by performing routine blood draws at specified time intervals. By using mass spectrometric analysis we can measure how quickly new B-CLL cells are generated in the bone marrow and how quickly they leave the blood, a measure of cell turnover. This will help us to better understand the unique characteristics of this disease process.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
Characterization of the Proliferating Compartment in B-CLL Patients and in Healthy Aging Subjects, B-CLL is a dx of accumulation rather than proliferation. Evidence for various forms of clonal evolution suggests that B-CLL clones may be more dynamic than previously assumed. A non-radioactive, stable isotopic labeling method to measure B-CLL cell kinetics in vivo. Subjects drank an aliquot of 2H2O daily for 84 days, and 2H incorporation into the deoxyribose moiety of DNA of their newly divided B-CLL cells, measured by gc/ms, during the labeling period. Birth rates were calculated from the kinetic profiles. Death rates were defined as the difference between calculated birth and growth rates., 1 year
