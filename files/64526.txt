Screening Single-operator Cholangioscopy for Neoplastic Bile Duct Lesions
This is the prospective observational study to explore whether the SpyGlass DS II system could be used to screen early-stage neoplastic bile duct lesions in selected patients.
Cholangiocarcinoma|Bile Duct Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Single-operator cholangioscopy
detection rate, detection rate of intraductal neoplastic lesions in patients with bile duct stones who underwent single-operator cholangioscopy, Until the end of the single-operator cholangioscopy session (up to 20 minutes)
Technical success of cholangioscopy, successful insertion of the cholangioscope through the ampulla of Vater and advancement up to the bifurcation of the biliary tree, Up to 15 minutes from the time the endoscope passes through the oral cavity|Technical success of cholangioscopy-guided biopsy, successful tissue sampling of intraductal superficial lesions under direct visualization, Until the end of the single-operator cholangioscopy session (up to 20 minutes)|Adverse events, all adverse events including cholangitis, pancreatitis, perforation, bleeding, and air embolism based on ASGE criteria, From the start of endoscopy to the end of the study observation period (at least 12 months)|Number needed to screen, the number of persons who would need to be screened to diagnose one neoplastic bile duct lesion in selected patients, From the start of endoscopy to the end of the study observation period (at least 12 months)
It is difficult to diagnose neoplastic bile duct lesions (including cholangiocarcinomas) via direct endoscopic evaluation of the bile duct. Most evaluations of biliary lesions have used indirect imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, or ERCP. However, CT and MRI do not yield tissue diagnoses, unlike ERCP, although the diagnostic accuracy for the latter remains unsatisfactory. Recently, remarkable advances in cholangioscopic systems have been made. Of the currently available cholangioscopic systems, the SpyGlass (Boston Scientific Co, Natick, Mass, USA) is a disposable cholangioscope permitting 4-way deflected steering by a single operator. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of single-operator cholangioscopy (SpyGlass DS II system) to screen for neoplastic bile duct lesions in patients with bile duct stones, which is one of the risk factor of cholangiocarcinoma.
