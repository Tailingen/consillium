Study of Magrolimab and Pembrolizumab in Relapsed or Refractory Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of magrolimab in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

DRUG: Magrolimab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|PROCEDURE: PET/CT
Complete Response (CR), Each participant's response to treatment will be assessed per the Lugano criteria. The criteria are:

* Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of all lesions, evidence, and effects of disease
* Partial Response (PR): ≥50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest lesions with no increase in the size of the other nodes; splenic / hepatic nodules regress ≥50%, and with no new sites of disease
* Stable disease (SD): less than PR.
* Progressive disease (PD): sum of the product of dimensions (SPD) of lesions increased ≥50% from smallest value The outcome will be reported as the number of participants with a CR after 4 and 8 cycles of treatment (4 and 8 months), and if CR is achieved anytime within 2 years ("overall")., 2 years
Magrolimab related Adverse Events, Magrolimab safety and tolerability will be assessed on the basis of magrolimab related adverse events occurring within 4 cycles of treatment (4 months). The outcome will be reported as the number of magrolimab related adverse events judged mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), life threatening (Grade 4), or fatal (Grade 5), numbers without dispersion., 4 months
Overall Response (OR), Overall response (OR) is defined as the sum of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) plus the number of participants who achieve a partial response (PR). Treatment response will be assessed per the Lugano criteria (aka the Cheson criteria). The criteria are:

* CR: Complete disappearance of all lesions, evidence, and effects of disease
* PR: ≥50% decrease in SPD of the 6 largest lesions with no increase in the size of the other nodes; splenic / hepatic nodules regress ≥50%, and with no new sites of disease
* Stable disease (SD): less than PR.
* Progressive disease (PD): sum of the product of dimensions (SPD) of lesions increased ≥50% from smallest value The outcome will be reported as the number of participants with either a CR or a PR after 4 and 8 cycles of treatment (4 and 8 months). For participants who undergo a subsequent stem cell transplant, the value will be recorded as the time to transplant (censored)., 8 months
Primary Objectives:

- To assess the complete remission (CR) rate of magrolimab in combination with pembrolizumab in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory cHL

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the safety and tolerability of magrolimab in combination with pembrolizumab in adult subjects with relapsed or refractory cHL
* To assess the overall response rate (ORR)
