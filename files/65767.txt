progression free survival-6, defined as the percentage of patients who are alive and progression free at 6 months after the randomization, after 6 months after randomization
progression free survival, defined for each patient as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first progression, second primary malignancy or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Subjects not progressed or died at the time of the analysis will be censored at the last disease assessment date, after 9 months of follow-up for each patient|Overall survival-9, defined as the percentage of patients who are alive at 9 months after the randomization., 9 months after randomization|Objective response rate, defined as the percentage of patients who are judged by the Investigators to have an objective response as determined by the RANO criteria, after 9 months of follow-up for each patient|Number of patients with AEs, SAEs, SADRs, SUSARs, * Incidence, nature, severity and seriousness of AEs, according of National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0
* Maximum toxicity grade experienced by each patient for each specific toxicity
* Percentage of patients experiencing grade 3-4 toxicity for each specific toxicity
* Patients with at least a SAE
* Patients with at least a serious adverse drug reaction (SADR)
* Patients with at least a suspect unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR)., after 9 months of follow-up for each patient|treatment compliance, -Dose-intensity, -percentage of patients with dose and/or time modifications, - Percentage of premature withdrawals, 9 months after randomization
In this phase II study, adult patients with histologically confirmed GBM in recurrence after surgery or biopsy, standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide were eligible. Patients included were treated with ortataxel 75 mg/mÂ² i.v. every 3 weeks until disease progression. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of ortataxel in terms of progression free survival at six months after the enrolment (PFS-6).
