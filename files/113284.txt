Inpatient Screening Mammography for Non-adherent and High Risk Women
The investigators propose to pilot a program that will evaluate the feasibility of an inpatient screening mammography for non-adherent and high risk hospitalized women age 52-74 admitted to the medicine services at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center and Howard County General Hospital. The two key activities include: inpatient breast care education with educational handouts and offering inpatient screening mammography. Inpatient screening mammography will be offered to non-adherent (last screening mammogram more than 24 months ago) and high risk (Gail 5-year risk of breast cancer 1.6 or greater) women. This pilot program will thus evaluate the feasibility of an inpatient screening mammography as an innovative approach to increase breast cancer screening among non-adherent and high risk women.
