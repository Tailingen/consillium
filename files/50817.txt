PD-L1 is positive by a MSD Combined Positive Score (CPS) of â‰¥ 10., At screening|Identify potential biomarkers of response - Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), Stromal Tumour Infiltrating Lymphocyte percentage (TIL%) will be recorded as per www.tilsinbreastcancer.org. Objective responses will be assessed as a function of TILs adjusted for other clinico-pathological factors, the hypothesis being that high levels of TILs will be associated with a higher rate of objective responses in this study., At baseline and 3 weeks after starting study treatment.|Identify potential biomarkers of response - DNA and RNA, To understand the molecular landscape (mutations, rearrangements and copy number changes) associated with HER2-positive, PD-L1 expressing tumours as well as response or resistance to the investigational study treatment., At baseline|Identify potential biomarkers of response - ctDNA, To track and monitor tumour dynamics during treatment., Before first dose of study drug, before dose at Cycle 3 and Cycle 8 (each Cycle is 21 days), 30 days after stopping study treatment and/or at disease progression, assessed at 24 months|Identify potential biomarkers of response - peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), To determine evidence of immune activation., At Baseline, every 6 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 9 weeks until disease progression, 30 days after stopping study treatment and/or at progression, assessed at 24 months
Despite significant advances in systemic treatment options, advanced HER2-positive breast cancer post treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and T-DM1 still remains incurable, with brain metastases remaining a major cause of patient morbidity and mortality.

HER2-positive breast cancers have relatively high tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that may be targeted with immune checkpoint blockade. Studies in metastatic breast cancer with PD1 or PD-L1 inhibition have shown an overall survival (OS) benefit for those that are enriched for pre-existing immunity, such as positive expression of PD-L1 protein or TILs present.

One of the main areas of disease progression in HER2 positive disease is in the central nervous system (CNS), supporting the need to find an effective combination for patients with brain metastases.

Tucatinib (ONT-380) is a potent, highly selective, oral HER2 small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with demonstrated clinical benefit notable for its minimal inducement of EGFR-type toxicities when administered in combination-type studies including proven intra-cranial efficacy in studies of patients with brain metastases.

The investigators hypothesise that the combination of tucatinib with trastuzumab and PD-1 inhibition will result in a similar ORR as that seen in HER2CLIMB, along with comparable PFS and duration of response, particularly through prevention and treatment of CNS metastases. The potential advantage of adding PD-1 inhibition and omitting capecitabine in the PD-L1 positive group is to increase the durability of the response, with hopefully less added toxicity for patients. The investigators believe this regimen will result in comparable outcomes as those seen in HER2CLIMB, with fewer adverse events. Importantly, the side effect profiles of all agents in our proposed combination are non-overlapping and this combination provides a unique opportunity for excellent tolerability and durable disease control in this patient group. The study design initially included two treatment cohorts, with the PD-L1 negative/unknown cohort being treated with the HER2CLIMB regimen with the addition of pembrolizumab (MK-3475), under the hypothesis that the anti-tumour activity of this regimen will overcome the lower immunogenicity of this subgroup. However, Protocol Amendment 2 will omit capecitabine in the PD-L1 negative/unknown cohort due to a high frequency of liver test abnormalities within the first seven participants in this cohort.
