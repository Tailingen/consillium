High-intensity Focused Ultrasound Study
Conventional treatment options for localized prostate cancer include prostatectomy, radiotherapy and active surveillance. However, prostatectomy and radiotherapy carry certain degree of morbidity, including the risks of urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and injury to the structures in the proximity. Active surveillance carries the risk of disease progression and psychological distress to the patients. Focal therapy employs the concept of only destroying the significant lesion, resulting in disease cure and improved functional outcome. Among the different options of focal therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is one of the most commonly employed energy sources. It exerts its effect through thermal and mechanical destruction of cancer tissue. This study aims at assess the effectiveness of such treatment in prostate cancer management.

In this study, investigators evaluate the early oncological outcome and objective functional outcome of patients undergoing HIFU for the treatment of localized intermediate risk prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: High-intensity focused ultrasound
Absence of Prostate Cancer on Biopsy, Oncological outcome 1: percentage in absence of prostate cancer on biopsy, 3 months
Change in Urodynamic, Functional outcome 1: change in urodynamic function assessed by flowrate, 3 months and 6 months|Change in Urinating Symptom Score, Functional outcome 2: change in total scores in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaires, 3 months and 6 months|Presence of Significant Prostate Cancer, Oncological outcome 2: presence of significant prostate cancer, defined by presence of Gleason score (ranges from 6 to 10) equals or more than 7, 3 months|Change in Prostate specific antigen (PSA), Oncological outcome 3: PSA change after treatment, 3 months and 6 months|Pain score, Post-treatment pain score ranges from 1 to 10, Post treatment (day 1)|Change in Prostate Symptom Score, Functional outcome 3: change in symptom scores in EPIC-26 questionnaire, 3 months and 6 months
