Ex Vivo Intra-arterial Indigo Carmine Injection After Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision
Background: An exact lymph node staging is essential in the treatment of rectal cancer.

Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of indigo carmine injection on the number of retrieved and positive lymph nodes after transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME).

Design: This is a retrospective, non-randomised study. Settings: This study was conducted at a tertiary hospital by a multidisciplinary team.

Patients: Between 2013 and 2019, patients undergoing transanal total mesorectal excision were analysed. Patients with indigo carmine injection (intervention group) were compared to those without (control group).

Interventions: Transanal total mesorectal excision was performed with or without ex vivo intra-arterial indigo carmine injection.

Main Outcome Measures: The number of retrieved and positive lymph nodes was the primary outcome measure.
Rectal Neoplasms
OTHER: injection of indigo carmine
retrieved lymph nodes, number of lymph nodes retrieved by pathologist from the specimen, 1 - 7 days after surgery
positive lymph nodes, number of lymph nodes with microscopic tumor infiltration, 1 - 7 days after surgery|N stage, N stage according TNM version 7, 1 - 7 days after surgery|survival, overall survival, 5 years
