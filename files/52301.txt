Cytomegalovirus Reactivation in Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects most of the world population. This study is to understand if chemotherapy will increase the chance of reactivating CMV. The results may help us in determining when treatment is needed and perhaps Why is it needed.

Despite CMV reactivation has been clearly described in patients underwent transplantation, this phenomenon has not been studied in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Our purpose is to understand if CMV number increases in monocytic leukocytes during chemotherapy and how is the host response to that changes.

Virus load will be studied by quantitative PCR, host response will be studied by measuring patient's anti-CMV IgG, CMV-associated symptoms, serum IFN-r and TNF-a.
