Continuous administration of oral vinorelbine, given three times a week (metronomic) is feasible and exceptionally well tolerated at doses up to 50 mg. Early results show activity against refractory tumors and provide evidence towards clinical proof of efficacy for metronomic chemotherapy. Recently, lapatinib plus capecitabine was proven superior to capecitabine alone in women with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer that has progressed after treatment with regimens that included an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab.
