Effect of Chemotherapy on PD-L1 in NSCLC
PD-L1 is identified as an important biomarkers for predicting PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Several previous clinical trials have demonstrated that chemotherapy could enhance the efficacy of PD-1/L1 immunotherapy in NSCLC such as Checkmate-227, Impower-150, Keynote-189, etc. Pre-clincial experiment shows that chemotherapy could increase CD8 TIL infiltration in tumor microenvironment, activate T cell immune reaction. However, it remains unclear whether chemotherapy could affect PD-L1 in advanced NSCLC patients. The present study aims to evaluate whether PD-L1 will change after receiving chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients.
