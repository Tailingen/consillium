G-CSF for the Prevention of Febrile Neutropenia in Gynecologic Cancer Patients
This study aims to analyze the effects of long-acting granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) on the prevention febrile neutropenia (FN) in gynecologic cancer patients. Patients all accepted platinum-based chemotherapy 3-4 weeks once per course. The primary end is the incidence of FN in every course of chemotherapy. After the chemotherapy, patients accepted long-acting G-CSF and/or short-acting G-CSF. The secondary ends include: the incidences of myelosuppression, doses of G-CSF and its expenses, visits to outpatient and emergency clinics, adverse events related to G-CSF.
