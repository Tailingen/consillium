Radiotherapy Dose De-escalation in HPV-Associated Cancers of the Oropharynx
The purpose of this study is to use intra-treatment 18FDG-PET/CT during definitive radiation therapy for human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) as an imaging biomarker to identify and select patients with a favorable response for chemoradiation dose de-escalation. This study will prospectively evaluate the clinical outcomes for patients undergoing dose de-escalation.
Oropharynx Cancer
RADIATION: De-escalated radiation dose|RADIATION: Standard radiation dose|OTHER: 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)-Computed Tomography (CT)
Progression-free survival, defined as the time between initiation of radiation treatment and the first documented recurrence of disease or death due to any cause as measured by medical record abstraction, from initiation of radiation therapy through study completion, an average of 2 years
locoregional progression-free survival, as measured by abstraction from the medical record, from initiation of radiation therapy through study completion, an average of 2 years|distant disease-free survival, as measured by abstraction from the medical record, from initiation of radiation therapy through study completion, an average of 2 years|overall survival, as measured by abstraction from the medical record, from initiation of radiation therapy through study completion, an average of 2 years|progression free survival correlation in PET/CT responders versus PET/CT non-responders, as measured by the difference in median Kaplan-Meyer values, 2 years|Acute adverse events, as measured by the number of participants who experience dermatitis, mucositis, xerostomia, dysphagia, dysgeusia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, renal toxicity, and hearing loss, 7 weeks|Long term adverse events, as measured by the number of participants who experience xerostomia, dysphagia, dysgeusia, trismus, lymphedema, superficial soft tissue fibrosis, hypothyroidism and periodontal disease, 2 years
