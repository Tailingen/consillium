ThoHSpEkt Thoracoscopic Ectomy of Radioactively Marked Pulmonary Nodules With Free-hand SPECT
Title ThoHSpEkt

Study Design Pilot Study concerning the technical operative methods and a phase II study concerning the radiopharmaceutical (therapeutic-explorative study with an approved drug in a new indication)

Location Kantonsspital St.Gallen

Aim Proof of feasibility of thoracoscopic ectomy of radioactively marked pulmonary nodules with the help of free-hand SPECT.

Background In the Cantonal Hospital of St.Gallen an average of 30 - 40 patients will be operated with thoracoscopic ectomy for a pulmonary nodule. When localisation of the nodule is not possible a switch to minithoracotomy is performed.

Study intervention Marking of pulmonary nodules with radioactivity. Free-hand SPECT guided surgery

Risks Risks of bronchoscopic or CT-intervention Radiation risk (minimal)

Rational for patient number 10 patients for each group are enough to prove the feasibility, to manage difficulties and to record complications

Duration approximately 24 months.
