ACE1831 in Adult Subjects With Relapsed/ Refractory CD20-expressing B-cell Malignancies
ACE1831 is an off-the-shelf, allogeneic gamma delta T (gdT) cell therapy derived from healthy donors, that is under investigation for the treatment of CD20-expressing B-cell malignancies.

The ACE1831-001 study is an open-label, Phase I, first-in-human (FIH) study that aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of ACE1831 in patients with CD20-expressing Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
