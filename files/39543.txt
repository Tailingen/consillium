Long-term Survival Outcomes According to the Pathologic Response After Neoadjuvant Treatment in PDAC and the Fate of the Patients with Good CAP Grade
1. Neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) is increasingly used in managing pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), necessitating dependable methods to evaluate tumor response.
2. Among various pathological tumor regression grading systems, the College of American Pathologists (CAP) system is commonly used to predict chemo-responsiveness and survival.
3. This study aimed to analyze long-term survival outcomes based on pathologic response using the CAP grade after NAT in PDAC and to identify clinicopathologic factors that influence a favorable pathologic response.
