HSCT for Patients With Fanconi Anemia Using Risk-Adjusted Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of lower doses of busulfan and the elimination of cyclosporine will further reduce transplant-related side effects for patients with Fanconi Anemia (FA). Patients will undergo a transplant utilizing mis-matched related or matched unrelated donors following a preparative regimen of busulfan, fludarabine, anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclophosphamide.
Fanconi Anemia|Severe Marrow Failure|Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)|Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: Busulfan|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: rabbit ATG|DRUG: G-CSF|BIOLOGICAL: Peripheral blood stem cell
Graft Failure or Rejection, Primary non-engraftment is diagnosed when the patient fails to achieve an ANC \>=500/mm3 at any time in the first 28 days post-transplant. If (1) after achievement of an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>=500/mm3, the ANC declines to \<500/mm3 for more than 3 consecutive days in the absence of relapse, or, (2) there is absence of donor cells in the marrow and/or blood as demonstrated by chimerism assay in the absence of relapse, a diagnosis of secondary graft failure is made. The patient is not evaluable for graft failure or rejection if recurrence of host MDS is detected concurrently., 5 years
Post-transplant severe morbidity and mortality, The occurrence of severe post-transplant regimen-related severe morbidity (grade IV toxicity) and/or mortality will be the second endpoint of this study. In the context of the agents or agent-combination used for cytoreduction used, particular attention will be given to toxicity involving (1) the liver, (2) the lungs, (3) the oral mucosa and gastrointestinal tract, and (4) the central nervous system., 2 years post-transplant
Graft Versus Host Disease, Patients will be observed for acute and/or chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD). Standard clinical criteria for the grading of acute and chronic GvHD will be done according to IBMTR guidelines., One year|Leukemic Relapse, For patients with MDS or AML, relapse will be analyzed as to type and genetic origin of the MDS/leukemic cells., 5 years|Secondary malignancies, Patients will be followed for 5 years through annual contact with their treatment center in order to track the risk of developing a secondary malignancy., 5 years
The trial proposed is a three arm phase II treatment protocol designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of risk-adjusted chemotherapy-based cytoreductive regimen plus a CD34+ selected T-cell depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) stem cell transplant for the treatment of patients with Fanconi anemia and severe hematologic disease. Candidates for this trial will include patients with Fanconi anemia presenting with severe marrow failure (transfusion dependent) or myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myelogenous leukemia for whom an allogeneic stem cell transplant is indicated.
