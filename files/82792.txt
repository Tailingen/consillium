A Study of the Safety and Effects of ADH-1 Given Intravenously as a Single Agent
N-cadherin, a protein involved in blood vessel cell binding, is increased as cancer progresses, and is on the surface of many tumor cells. ADH-1 blocks N-cadherin. This study will test the safety and effects of ADH-1 in subjects with specific incurable, solid tumors with a protein biomarker called N-cadherin. This study will examine the clinical activity of ADH-1.
