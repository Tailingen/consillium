Perioperative Specimen Imaging Using High-resolution 18F-FDG-PET-CT During Thoracic Surgery: a Pilot Study
In this pilot study the investigators propose the intraoperative use of a high-resolution PET-CT imaging system which can assess resection margins and lymph node status in the operating room. This will allow for a faster and stepwise assessment (estimated to be under 10 minutes per specimen), enabling the surgeon to decide on subsequent surgical steps after each previous assessment.
