A Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of MUC1 Peptide Vaccine and hGM-CSF in Patients With MUC1-positive Tumor Malignancies
The scientific approach behind this study is to develop novel anti-cancer therapeutic vaccine to induce a robust cellular immune response mediated via both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes populations and can be be applicable to the majority of the target population.
Multiple Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: ImMucin, hGM-CSF
Safety of intradermal or subcutaneous administration of the ImMucin peptide, Determine the safety and initial feasibility of intradermal or subcutaneous administration of the ImMucin peptide combined with hGM-CSF for maximal stimulation of T cell response.

The patients will receive six or twelve biweekly injections of Imucin (3 or 6 months). Post Treatment visit will be performed 4 weeks after administration of last vaccination. FU telephone calls will be made up to 6 months following the last vaccination in order to assess the status of the disease., 6 months
Assess efficacy of study treatment, Assessment of respose to treatment during treatment period (3 or 6 months).Post Treatment visit will be performed 4 weeks after administration of last vaccination. FU telephone calls will be made up to 6 months following the last vaccination in order to assess the status of the disease., 6 months
