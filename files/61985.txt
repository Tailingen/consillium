JUdicious Surveillance for Trastuzumab Induced Cardiotoxicity in the First Year
This study focuses on male and female patients being treated for breast cancer that is positive for the HER2 receptor which requires special treatments targeting that receptor. The problem is that these treatments, while effective for the cancer, can sometimes harm the heart. Because of this, patients have to undergo heart tests every three months during treatment, even if they have no history of heart disease or feel fine.

The guidelines for these regular heart tests were established decades ago when these treatments were first introduced, but research shows that most of these tests don't actually change the treatment plan. This suggests that many patients are going through unnecessary tests, which can cause stress, delay treatments, and increase healthcare costs.

To address this, the researchers propose a new study with 300 patients with HER2 positive breast cancer to test a more personalized approach to cardiac surveillance. Participants will be classified based on their risk of heart problems: low or intermediate. Instead of testing every patient every three months, those in the intermediate group will be tested every 4 months, and those in the low-risk group will be tested every 6 months. The researchers will compare this new approach to the current system to see if fewer tests are just as safe and effective.

The researchers will measure heart health, how well cancer treatments are completed, and how patients feel about having fewer tests. If this new approach works, it could save money and reduce the burden on female patients without risking their health.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Intervention - Low Risk Group OR Intermediate Risk Group
Hierarchical composite endpoint encompassing heart health, patient well-being, treatment completion, and imaging frequency in combination, while assessing priority to more important measures., The primary outcome is a hierarchical composite endpoint for patients with BC receiving HER2-targeted therapy (HER2TT). Participant in the intervention group is compared to participants in the control group based on the following outcomes, in order:

1. Clinically overt heart failure (determined as a binary event Y/N, per standardized definition)
2. Premature discontinuation of HER2TT (determined as a binary event Y/N, per clinical records)
3. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROM) of anxiety/depression, stress and treatment burden: desirable outcome is a better scores in â‰¥2 of 3 PROMs-Treatment Burden Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale
4. Asymptomatic cardiotoxicity at end of HER2TT (per criteria, based on LVEF change from baseline to 12 months echocardiograms)
5. Time to complete HER2TT (shorter is better)-number of weeks between 1st and last HER2TT
6. Total cardiac imaging tests during HER2TT (fewer is better)-total assessments of LVEF, From enrollment to the end of treatment at 48 weeks
