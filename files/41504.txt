Linking Obesity and Estrogen-responsive Genes in Endometrial Cancer
The objective is to develop an organotypic model to assess the effects of obesity on the expression and methylation status of estrogen-responsive genes in endometrial cancer. Omental fat samples will be removed from participants during surgery and these fat samples will be used in laboratory analyses.
Endometrial Cancer
Identify estrogen-response genes in endometrial cancer, Omental fat will be collected from 6 lean patients, 6 obese patients and 4 controls (male patients) and co-cultured with endometrial cancer cell lines, Baseline
Examine how expression of estrogen response genes are altered in obesity, Compare gene response in tissue from lean and obese individuals, Baseline
