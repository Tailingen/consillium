Gene Expression in Tumor Tissue From Women Undergoing Surgery for Breast Cancer or Core Biopsy of the Breast
RATIONALE: Studying samples of breast tissue in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about the genes and proteins found in breast tissue.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying genes and proteins in breast tissue from women undergoing surgery for breast cancer or core biopsy of the breast.
Breast Cancer
GENETIC: microarray analysis|PROCEDURE: breast biopsy
Tumor Gene Expression as Assessed by RNA Microarray Analysis, Concentration of RNA recovered from breast needle biopsies, 1 day
OBJECTIVES:

* Assess tumor gene expression information from women undergoing surgery for breast cancer or core biopsy sampling of the breast.

OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

Tumor tissue is collected and analyzed for tumor gene expression by DNA microarray analysis for research studies.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
