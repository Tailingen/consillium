A Study of Samuraciclib in Combination With Fulvestrant in Metastatic or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer in Adult Participants
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of samuraciclib in combination with fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone in adult participants with metastatic or locally advanced Hormone Receptor (HR) positive and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER)2-negative breast cancer.

Clinical Benefit Response (CBR), CBR is defined as the overall complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) â‰¥ 24 weeks according to RECIST version 1.1 recorded from randomization until disease progression, or death due to any cause., From randomization until Week 24
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a best overall Response (BOR) of CR or PR per RECIST Version 1.1 from randomization until disease progression, or death due to any cause., Time from the date of first dose of study intervention until the first documentation of disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or start of new anticancer therapy (assessed up to week 48)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from the date of first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the earliest documented disease progression per RECIST version 1.1, or death due to any cause., Time from the date of first dose of study intervention until the first documentation of disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or start of new anticancer therapy (assessed up to week 48)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from the date of randomization to the earliest documented disease progression per RECIST version 1.1, or death due to any cause., Time from the date of first dose of study intervention until the first documentation of disease progression, death, withdrawal of consent, or start of new anticancer therapy (assessed up to week 48)|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) as assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5.0, Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events and clinically relevant changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory results., From first dose of any study intervention through 28 days after the last dose of any study intervention|Samuraciclib plasma exposure: Cmax, Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3 (each cycle is 28 days)|Samuraciclib plasma exposure: Ctrough, Cycle 1 Days 8 and 15; Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; and within 28 days of last dose (each cycle is 28 days)|Fulvestrant plasma exposure: Ctrough, Cycle 1 Days 8 and 15; Day 1 of Cycles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6; and within 28 days of last dose (each cycle is 28 days)
