Study consists of three arms, Arm A is a Phase Ib/II study of TT-00420 tablet monotherapy, Arm B is a Phase Ib/II study of TT-00420 tablet in combination with nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) and Arm C is a PK run-in study of TT-00420 tablet.

Arm A: TT-00420 Tablet Monotherapy Phase Ib will enroll patients with preferred indications including metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, HER2-negative breast cancer including TNBC, bladder cancer, small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, sarcoma, gastric cancer, gallbladder cancer and other advanced solid tumors to receive TT-00420 monotherapy. Based on preliminary efficacy results, Phase II will enroll additional patients in select indications to evaluate the efficacy of TT-00420 monotherapy.

Arm B: TT-00420 tablet in combination with nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) Arm B will enroll patients with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Phase Ib will be a dose escalation study of TT-00420 in combination with nab-paclitaxel, guided by 3+3 design, to determine a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D). Phase II will enroll additional patients with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancers to further evaluate the efficacy of the combination regimen.

Arm C: PK Run-in Study of TT-00420 Tablet Arm C will enroll patients with preferred indications including cholangiocarcinoma, TNBC/HER2- negative breast cancer, prostate cancer, sarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), bladder cancer, small cell lung cancer, thyroid cancer, gastric cancer, gallbladder cancer and other advanced solid tumors to receive TT-00420 monotherapy administered as once daily (q.d.) or twice daily (b.i.d.).
