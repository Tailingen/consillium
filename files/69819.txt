Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of TJ107 in Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a two-part study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TJ107 in Chinese patients with advanced solid tumors. Approximately a total of 36 \~ 60 patients will be enrolled into the dose escalation cohorts (Part A), and expansion cohorts (Part B).
