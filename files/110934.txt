A Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of BCL2 Inhibitor Sonrotoclax as Monotherapy and in Combination With Zanubrutinib in Adults With Waldenström Macroglobulinemia
This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the BCL2 inhibitor sonrotoclax (BGB-11417) in participants with relapsed/refractory Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (R/R WM) and in combination with zanubrutinib in adult participants with previously untreated WM.

The questionnaire contains 18 items, each of which utilizes a Likert scale with 5 possible responses ranging from 0 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much' and is divided into a total score., Baseline and approximately months 7, 13, 19, and 25
This study will test whether sonrotoclax (BGB-11417) can be used to improve outcomes in participants with Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM) both when used alone in those who have not responded well to conventional treatments and when used in combination with zanubrutinib in those who have not yet received treatment. The main goals of the study are to determine how many participants no longer have evidence of cancer or have some improvement in the signs and symptoms of cancer after treatment, and to determine what adverse events, or side effects, participants might experience.

BCL2 is a key protein involved in cell death, and abnormal levels of BCL2 are associated with many cancers. Blocking the action of BCL2 proteins is a promising approach with potential therapeutic benefits in participants with different types of cancers, including WM. This study will enroll approximately 105 participants. All participants will receive sonrotoclax orally as a tablet.

The study will take place at multiple centers worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 5 years.
