High Dose Carfilzomib for Newly Diagnosed Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to test whether giving high doses of carfilzomib along with the other drugs (lenalidomide and dexamethasone) is safe and which dose is best tolerated by patients. In addition, the study is designed to test the amount of remaining myeloma cells in the body after treatment with higher carfilzomib doses which is known as minimal residual disease (MRD).

Number of patients with dose limiting toxicity, To find the maximum tolerated dose.A DLT is defined as any of the below toxicities with attribution to one or more of the study drugs that occur during Cycle 1. All AEs should be considered relevant to determining dose-limiting toxicities and to reporting unless the event can clearly be determined to be UNRELATED to the drug.
