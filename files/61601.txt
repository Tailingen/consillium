A Dose-escalation Study of MK-8776 (SCH 900776) With and Without Gemcitabine in Participants With Solid Tumors or Lymphoma (MK-8776-002/P05248)
This study of MK-8776 (SCH 900776) will evaluate its safety and tolerability when given as monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine to participants with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma. Participants will be enrolled in cohorts that will receive sequentially higher doses of MK-8776 in combination with standard doses of gemcitabine The recommended combination doses for a Phase 2 trial (combination-RP2D) will be determined based on safety and biological activity. Up to 10 to 15 additional participants may be studied at the combination-RP2D.
Hodgkin Disease|Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin|Neoplasms
DRUG: MK-8776|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) During Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 Based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (CTCAE v 3.0), During Cycle 0, a DLT was defined as: CTCAE v 3.0 Grade 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting ≥3 days; any CTCAE v 3.0 Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia; neutropenic fever; any CTCAE v. 3.0 ≥ Grade 3 QT interval corrected by Fridericia (QTcF) prolongation of any duration; any other CTCAE v 3.0 Grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity; or Grade 3 elevation of transaminases that resolved prior to administration of next dose(s) of study drug(s); delay in Cycle 1 Day 1 beyond 3 weeks due to continuing toxicity. During Cycle 1, a DLT was defined as: CTCAE v 3.0 Grade 4 neutropenia that persists for ≥7 days; neutropenic fever; CTCAE v 3.0 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; CTCAE v 3.0 ≥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; any CTCAE v 3.0 QTc ≥ Grade 3 QTcF prolongation of any duration; any other CTCAE v 3.0 Grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity; or Grade 3 elevation of transaminases that resolved prior to administration of next dose(s) of study drug(s)., Through Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 (Up to 42 days)|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to study treatment. The number of participants who experienced an AE is presented., Up to approximately 72 weeks (Up to approximately 6 weeks after last dose of study treatment)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to study treatment. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE is presented., Up to approximatey 66 weeks
MK-8776 Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), The Cmax of MK-8776 was assessed in Cycle 0 and in Cycle 1. On Day 1 of Cycle 0 and Cycle 1, plasma samples were obtained from all participants before infusion, at end of infusion of MK-8776 (Cycle 0) or gemcitabine (Cycle 1), and at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours after completion of MK-8776 infusion., At end of infusion of MK-8776 (Cycle 0) or gemcitabine (Cycle 1), and at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours after completion of MK-8776 infusion|MK-8776 Area Under the Curve of the Plasma Concentration Versus Time From Time Zero to the Time of the Last Analytically Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-last), AUC0-last was assessed in Cycle 0 and in Cycle 1. On Day 1 of Cycle 0 and Cycle 1, plasma samples were obtained from all participants before infusion, at end of infusion of MK-8776 (Cycle 0) or gemcitabine (Cycle 1), and at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours after completion of MK-8776 infusion. AUC0-last was calculated by the linear trapezoidal method., At end of infusion of MK-8776 (Cycle 0) or gemcitabine (Cycle 1), and at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours after completion of MK-8776 infusion|Time of MK-8776 Cmax (Tmax), The time of Cmax of MK-8776 was assessed in Cycle 0 and in Cycle 1. On Day 1 of Cycle 0 and Cycle 1, plasma samples were obtained from all participants before infusion, at end of infusion of MK-8776 (Cycle 0) or gemcitabine (Cycle 1), and at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours after completion of MK-8776 infusion., At end of infusion of MK-8776 (Cycle 0) or gemcitabine (Cycle 1), and at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours after completion of MK-8776 infusion|MK-8776 Terminal Phase Half-Life (t1/2), The t1/2 of MK-8776 was assessed in Cycle 0 and in Cycle 1. On Day 1 of Cycle 0 and Cycle 1, plasma samples were obtained from all participants before infusion, at end of infusion of MK-8776 (Cycle 0) or gemcitabine (Cycle 1), and at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours after completion of MK-8776 infusion., At end of infusion of MK-8776 (Cycle 0) or gemcitabine (Cycle 1), and at 0.25, 1, 3, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours after completion of MK-8776 infusion
