Efficacy of Second Forward-view Examination of Left Colon for Adenoma Detection During Colonoscopy
The incidence of colorectal cancer in China is increasing year by year. Studies have shown that colorectal cancer is more common in the left colon，especially in the China. Our previous study also showed a higher rate of missed adenoma in the left colon than the right colon during colonoscopy. Additionally, prolonging withdrawal time could only improve the ADR of right colon, but had limited effect on the ADR of left colon in our previous research. Our aim is to evaluate the effect of a second forward view examination of the left colon on the detection of adenoma detection during colonoscopy.
Colon Adenoma
BEHAVIORAL: re-examination|BEHAVIORAL: extended withdraw time
Left colon adenoma detection rate (LCADR), LCADR is the number of patients with at least one adenoma in the left colon, divided by the total number of patients., 60 minutes
adenoma detection rate(ADR), ADR is the number of patients with at least one adenoma, divided by the total number of patients., 60 minutes|left colon adenomas per colonoscopy (LCAPC), LCAPC was calculated as the number of adenomas detected during in left colon colonoscopy withdraw divided by the number of colonoscopies., 60 minutes
