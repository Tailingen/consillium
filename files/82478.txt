Impact of Immunoscore Colon Test on Adjuvant Therapeutic Strategy in Non-Metastatic Colon Cancer
Immunoscore Colon Test (ICT) will be applied on tumor samples from curative surgery. In the Multidisciplinary Meeting (MM) evaluating the participant adjuvant strategy, a first decision will be taken, based on the participant medical record only. ICT will then be disclosed and the MM will take a second decision. The aim of the study is to observe if the ICT result modifies the treatment decision.
Colonic Neoplasms
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Immunoscore Colon Test
Modification rate of adjuvant therapeutic strategy, Modifications of adjuvant therapy, type and/or duration, At the multidisciplinary meeting, up to 6 weeks after the cancer surgery
On previous studies, Immunoscore Colon test identified subgroups of stage II and III colon cancer patients whose Chemotherapy could be adjusted.

The study hypothesis is that Immunoscore Colon Test will modify the therapeutic decision in MM.

With Alpha and Beta at 5% and p0=10% modification rate, the participating investigators need to include 280 participants, 140 in each cohort (stage II and stage III).

Participants will have tumor samples from their curative surgery tested with Immunoscore Colon. When the patients are evaluated in MM, a first therapeutic decision will be taken before disclosing the test result. ICT result will then be communicated and a second decision will be taken.
