Carbon Dioxide Laser and Cryotherapy in Treatment of Warts
Viral warts are common skin conditions seen in both children and adults. Human papilloma virus is responsible for verrucae. Cutaneous manifestation of the human papillomavirus, are extremely common particularly on the hands and feet. Warts can induce hard, thickened skin, black pinpoints, pain or tenderness with significant morbidity for the patients.

A range of types of wart have been identified, varying in shape and site affected, as well as the type of human papillomavirus involved.

These include:

* Common wart (Verruca vulgaris).
* Flat wart (Verruca plana).
* Filiform or digitate wart.
* Genital wart (venereal wart, Condyloma acuminatum, Verruca acuminata).
* Mosaic wart.
* Periungual wart.
* Plantar wart (verruca, Verruca plantaris). Despite the presence of several therapeutic options, treatment of warts can present a challenge and they are not uniformly effective. Viral warts often disappear without treatment. In case of pain, discomfort and long duration they can be treated . Treatment options include cryotherapy, electrocautery, salicylic acid, immune therapy, minor surgery or laser surgery.

Common warts have a distinctive appearance and can usually be diagnosed with the unaided eye; however, early growth stages and post-treatment warts are less easily diagnosed. Published dermoscopic features of common warts include frogspawn pattern, mosaic pattern and dotted, linear, globular or coiled vessels. Mosaic pattern consists of relatively flattened, rounded structures of similar size, resembling a jigsaw puzzle. Frogspawn pattern consists of densely packed papillae, each containing red dot or loop, surrounded by a whitish halo. Vascular structures seen dermoscopically in common warts as red or black dotted, linear, globular and coiled vessels. Haemorrhages are possible additional features, with black dots corresponding to thrombosed vessels. Hairpin vessels were usually seen in non-wart lesions.

In this study, we aim to compare two therapeutic modalities, the clinical effectiveness and safety of carbon dioxide laser and cryotherapy in the treatment of viral warts together with dermoscopic evaluation of viral warts before and after treatment.
