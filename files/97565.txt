Buccal Film Versus IV Injection Palonosetron for Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting
Phase 2 study to compare efficacy, safety and PK of palonosetron, a long acting 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, by buccal film delivery compared to iv injection for chemotherapy induced nausea or vomiting (CINV). Subjects receive a single dose of palonosetron prior to moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.
Nausea With Vomiting Chemotherapy-Induced
DRUG: Palonosetron Hydrochloride Buccal Film 0.25 Mg|DRUG: Palonosetron Hydrochloride Buccal Film 0.5 Mg|DRUG: Palonosetron Hydrochloride, 0.25 Mg/5 mL Intravenous Solution

This is a Phase 2 study to compare efficacy, safety and PK of palonosetron, a long acting 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, by buccal film compared to iv injection for moderately emetogenic chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting (CINV) in cancer patients. Subjects are randomized into three treatment groups, two with the experimental study drug palonosetron in buccal film at one of two different doses or the control treatment using Palonosetron hydrochloride iv injection. Palonosetron PK will be assessed in a subgroup of each treatment group.
