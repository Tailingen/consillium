Predicting the Efficacy and Prognosis of Rectal Cancer Patients Based on ctDNA-MRD Technology
The purpose of this study is to study the performance of MRD monitoring in predicting the efficacy and prognosis of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with rectal cancer, and to explore the value of MRD detection in evaluating the prognosis of patients. In this prospective study, 50 patients with stage II-III rectal cancer who are planing to receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy will be enrolled. The tumor tissue will be collected by colonoscopy before treatment and blood samples will be collected before treatment and during treatment.The whole blood samples will receive MRD detection. The change rate and clearance rate of MRD during treatment will be calculated, and will be associated with imaging efficacy evaluation, pathological efficacy evaluation,and prognosis, to determine the performance of MRD in predicting and judging the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and postoperative recurrence of rectal cancer.

Area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the MRD biomarker, The area under the ROC curve ( AUC ) of MRD, Baseline to 12 months
Local recurrence-free survival（LRFS）, LRFS differences in patients with MRD clearance / decrease / increase, From date of radical surgery to local recurrence or death due to disease progression，assessed up to 60 months.|Distant metastases-free survival（DMFS）, DMFS differences in patients with MRD clearance / decrease / increase, From date of the beginning of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to disease metastasis or death due to any cause,assessed up to 60 months.
This study is a prospective, observational study. It is expected to enroll 50 patients with newly diagnosed stage II-III rectal cancer.Before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, tumor tissue will be collected by colonoscopy biopsy for WES and customized panel design, and peripheral blood samples will be collected for baseline MRD detection ( MRD1 ) and during neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( MRD2-6 ) .Peripheral blood sample will be collected 3-4 weeks after radical surgery ( MRD7 ). For patients who achieved cCR after the end of neoadjuvant therapy and adopted the W \& W ( watch and wait ) strategy, the sampling time point was 3 months after the start of watching and waiting ( MRD7 ).
