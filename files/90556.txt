Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: No intervention
Determination of the expression, Expression profiling of the selected miRNAs, By the end of the study (September 2022)
A retrospective observational study on NSCLC patients, to determine the serum expression levels if some miRNAs in NSCLC patients and to find if having proper diagnostic and prognostic values in early disease detection, and/or staging.
