This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study assessing the efficacy and safety of Niraparib re-treatment with Bevacizumab of assessment progression-free survival(6 months PFS rate) with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer patients previously treated with a PARP inhibitor The study will assess the effectiveness of progression-free survival(6 months PFS rate) as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The subject will be treated to until disease progression as below:

* Niraparib 200mg or 300mg (once daily\[QD\])\*
* Bevacizumab 15mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W)

  * The recommended starting dosage of niraparib is 200mg QD. For patients who weigh ≥77 kg and have baseline platelet count ≥150,000/μL, the recommended starting dosage is 300 mg QD.
