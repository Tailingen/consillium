Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) for Early Treatment Response Assessment of Solid Tumors
Earlier detection of disease recurrence will enable greater treatment options and has strong potential to improve patient outcomes. This project is translational and has the potential to lead to future translational research opportunities, including interventional trials in which therapeutic escalation is offered at the early circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) molecular residual disease (MRD) detection timepoint. Ultimately, the integration of ctDNA into the clinical workflow has the potential to enhance cancer diagnosis, treatment, surveillance, and prognosis, and guide clinical decision-making in this era of personalized precision medicine.
