Prospective Study on the Value of Subcutaneous Drains in Gastrointestinal Surgery
The aim of the study is to determine wether subcutaneus suction drain (type redon-drain) protect against surgical side infection by laparotomy in general surgery.
Digestive System Diseases [C06]|Digestive System Neoplasms [C04.588.274]
DEVICE: Redon drain
number of surgical site infections according to CDC guidelines after laparotomy in general surgery, 30 days after operation
risk factors for surgical site infections, 30 days after operation
If subcutan drains inserted during wound closudsure after laparotomy avoid subcutaneous haematoma and seromas by suction, these drains shout protect against surgical site infections. This is the ratio why such drain are in use in many countries. To test whether this hypothesis is true or not we pland this study.
