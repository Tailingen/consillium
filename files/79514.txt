the Value of Transanal Endoscopic ISR
The Intersphincteric resection (ISR) technique is an alternative for anal preservation in ultra-low rectal cancer. The transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) technique might compensate for the deficiencies of ISR in terms of tumor spillage and poor surgical field exposure. Thus, the investigators perform ISR through a transanal endoscopic approach (taE-ISR), seeking to evaluate the value of this innovative technique in anal preservation in ultra-low rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: transanal endoscopic ISR
anal preservation rate, No conversion to APR and closure was closed within 1 year after surgery, 1 year after sugery
incidence of Defecation disorders, A Wexner score \>10 indicated the existence of defecation dysfunction, 6 months after surgery|incidence of positive distal resection margin, A positive distal resection margin (DRM) was diagnosed with the presence of tumor cells within 1mm from the DRM, 30 days after surgery
