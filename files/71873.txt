Guided Treatment Based on Mini-PDX in Metastatic Triple Negative Breast Cancer
Triple-negative breast cancer constitutes 15-20% of cases of breast cancer and is defined by the absence of estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and overexpression or gene amplification of HER2. Although the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors could improve the outcome of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC), chemotherapy has been the standard of care for systemic treatment for patients with mTNBC. Prognoses remain poor, with reported median overall survival estimates of approximately 18 months or less with available treatments. A meta-analysis of seven clinical trials showed that the median objective response rate (ORR) of second or later line of chemotherapy in mTNBC was only 11%.

Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor model, which preserves the histologic and genetic characteristics of patients' tumors, has shown its predictive value of clinical outcomes and are used for preclinical drug evaluation, biomarker identification, biological studies, and personalized medicine strategies. However, long time period and low success rate has limited its application in clinical practice.

Mini patient derived xenograft (miniPDX) offers an effective alternative as it only takes about 7 days for drug sensitivity test and could thus provide guidance for prompt personalized treatment for each patient.

Thus, the investigators conduct this single-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical study to investigate the efficacy of guided treatment based on Mini-PDX in patients with metastatic refractory triple negative breast cancer.

Objective response rate, To compare the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of patients who recieve persionalized treatment based on mini-PDX model with ORR of patients who receive Treatment of Physician's Choice (TPC). ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1. ORR will be calculated based on the Investigator assessment of response. CR = Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. In addition, any pathological lymph nodes assigned as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to \< 10 mm; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameter of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., Through study completion, an expected average of 1 year
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Patients will be followed until their date of death or until final database closure. Patients who are lost-to-follow-up or are alive at the time of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive or at the date of event cut-off for OS analysis., Through study completion, an expected average of 1 year|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first evidence of documented disease progression as defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1 or death from any cause. Progressive Disease (PD) was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions. If a participant was not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusion cutoff date for the analysis, the PFS time was censored at the last adequate tumor assessment date., Through study completion, an expected average of 1 year|Adverse events, Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0, Through study completion, an expected average of 1 year
