Different Cycles of Capecitabine Usage in Esophageal Cancer Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy
Definitive chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin with cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil is the standard in Western countries in esophagus cancer.But in China because of its toxic reaction, most of patients stop the halfway.Because low toxicity, Capecitabine is widely used in the chemotherapy of esophageal cancer.

The purpose of this experiment was to study the different cycle on capecitabine with chemotherapy for esophageal cancer chemoradiation effect.We are prepared to within 2 years study recruited 200 patients with esophageal cancer.The primary endpoint is overall survival and the secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, response rate,pathologic complete response rate and adverse events.
Stage III Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Stage II Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Capecitabine(Aibin)|RADIATION: radiotherapy
overall survival, OS, 2 years
progression-free survival, 2 years|overall remission rate, ORR, 16 weeks|serious adverse event, 16 weeks|quality of life, Qol, 16 weeks|pathologic complete response rate, 16 weeks
We recruited the patients who were pathologically confirmed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from the Oct 2014. The the patients was divided into two groups. Group 1: Capecitabine + chemoradiation, radiation at the end of the stop using capecitabine. Group 2: Capecitabine + chemoradiation, at the end of the radiotherapy with capecitabine consolidating treatment for 5 weeks.
