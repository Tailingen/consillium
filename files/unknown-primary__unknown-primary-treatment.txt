Go to Patient Version
A cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is defined as a biopsy-confirmed malignancy with no established primary site after pathological evaluation and radiographic studies. With the advent of comprehensive genomic profiling and positron emission tomography–computed tomography scanning, less than 1% of new cancer diagnoses are designated as CUP.[
1
-
5
]
Most CUPs are adenocarcinomas or undifferentiated tumors. Less commonly,
squamous cell carcinomas, melanomas, sarcomas, germ cell tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors present with an undetermined primary site of origin.[
6
] In some patients, the primary site cannot be identified even at postmortem examination.
Prognosis and Survival
The prognosis for patients with CUP is poor. Approximately 30% of patients are alive at 1 year.[
1
,
7
]  CUP is represented by a
heterogeneous group of diseases, all of which have presented with metastasis as
the primary manifestation.  Although most diseases are relatively
refractory to cytotoxic treatments, molecular and genetic diagnostics can identify targeted therapies that may result in a much better prognosis.[
1
]  In each instance, the clinician must consider distinct
clinical and pathological details when selecting appropriate, and
potentially curative, management.
Survival is worse for patients with any of the following characteristics: [
8
-
10
]
Adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma histology.
Extranodal presentation.
Older age.
Hepatic or adrenal involvement.
Poor performance status.
Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Lymph node involvement or neuroendocrine histology were associated with longer survival in retrospective reviews.[
8
-
10
]
Patients who present with LDH levels within the reference range and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 have better prognoses than those with high LDH levels or worse performance statuses.[
10
]
A review of five case control studies and 14 cohort studies found a clear increased risk of CUP with smoking.[
11
]
Patterns of Metastases
Conceptually, CUP is a type of tumor that tends to metastasize early, unlike more common cases, in which the primary tumor is apparent, with or without metastasis.
The pattern of spread of CUP at diagnosis can provide clues to the likelihood
of the primary site being above or below the diaphragm.  Lung metastases are
twice as common in primary sites ultimately found to be above the diaphragm. 
Liver metastases are more common from primary disease sites below the diaphragm.  A cancer presenting as CUP may have a significantly different pattern of metastasis than what is typically expected. For instance, when presenting as CUP, bone metastases are more common from pancreatic cancer and less common from lung cancer, unlike their typical presentation.
Diagnostic Evaluation
The pathologist has a central role in the evaluation of CUP.  A thorough evaluation of an adequate specimen using
histology, immunohistochemistry, molecular diagnostics, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and, when appropriate, electron microscopy provides the most important clues in the diagnosis of CUP.[
12
-
16
]   Pathological evaluations provide guidance for an appropriate clinical
evaluation.
The following tests may be used to diagnose CUP:
Gene expression profiling:
Gene expression profiling and NGS may identify a potential site of origin in patients with CUP.[

Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) analysis:
Beta-hCG and AFP are not absolutely specific for germ cell tumors, and AFP is not specific for hepatoma. However, abnormal levels of these proteins are an important finding in young men with a mediastinal or retroperitoneal mass. Prognosis is improved for patients with germ cell tumors treated with site-specific therapy.[
18
]
Other tumor marker tests include prostate-specific antigen (prostate cancer) in men; CA-125 (ovarian or gynecologic cancers), CA 15-3 (breast cancer), and CA 27.29 (breast cancer) in women; and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 19-9, CA 72-4 (adenocarcinoma), and chromogranin A (neuroendocrine cancer). Elevation of less specific tumor-specific markers such as CEA, CA 19-9, and CA 72-4 can be used to monitor progression or tumor response.
Magnetic resonance imaging is used for head and neck presentations, brain metastases, suspected pelvic neoplasms, suspected breast cancer (with isolated axillary lymph nodes or isolated bone metastases), prostate lesions, and adrenal lesions.
For patients with presumed CUP, a prior diagnosis of malignancy should be evaluated by pathological comparison, using genomic sequencing in both tissue and circulating tumor DNA, when available.[
19
]
Clinical, pathological, and molecular genetic tests have two goals. The first is to identify tumors that are responsive to available therapies. The second is to identify novel targeted therapies that might be applicable to the particular genetic profile.[
5
] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved some novel targeted therapies when a molecular target is identified in a cancer, regardless of primary site (including when no primary site is evident with metastases). Examples include tumors with the following actionable targets:[
20
-
27
]
High tumor mutational burden.
Elevated PD-1 or PD-L1 expression.
HER2 expression.
Pathogenic variants in
NTRK
,
RET
, or
EGFR
.
BRAF
V600E pathogenic variant.
ROS1
gene fusion.
MET
amplification.
Homologous recombination repair deficiency/microsatellite instability.
Two randomized prospective trials published in 2019 compared standard chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel or cisplatin and gemcitabine) versus site-specific therapy using gene expression profiling.[
28
,
29
] There was no advantage to site-specific therapy in median progression-free survival (PFS) (5 months) or median overall survival (OS) (10–12 months) in either trial. However, most novel targeted therapies, including checkpoint inhibitors, were not available at that time.[
28

Level of evidence B1
]
A meta-analysis of five studies including 1,114 patients compared site-specific therapy from genomic profiling versus empiric therapy. There was no improvement in PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74–1.17;
P
= .534) or OS (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55–1.03;
P
= .069).[
30
][
Level of evidence B1
] Isolated benefit was seen in patients with more responsive tumors with an identified specifically targeted therapy.
In a retrospective analysis, a cohort of 97 patients with CUP underwent NGS of tissue- or blood-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA). The median number of pathogenic genomic alterations found in tissue was four (range, 0–25), and the median number of genomic alterations found in cfDNA was two (range, 0–9).[
31
]  Combination matched therapies based on these alterations might improve patient outcomes.[
31
] A matching score (MS) (roughly equivalent to the number of alterations targeted/total number of deleterious alterations) was calculated post hoc to quantify the degree of the tumor-to-drug match. Outcomes were compared for evaluable patients determined to be MS high (>50%; n = 15) or MS low (≤50%; n = 47). The median PFS was 10.4 months for MS-high patients and  2.8 months for MS-low patients (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.11–0.64;
P
= .002). The OS was 15.8 months for MS-high patients and  6.9 months for MS-low patients (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.17–1.16;
P
= .09).[

Stage Information for Cancer of Unknown Primary
A positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) scan of the whole body can reveal the extent of disease and is especially useful in single-site or oligometastatic presentations, especially for patients with cervical lymph node metastases  suspicious for a head and neck primary.[
1
-
4
]
PET-CT can be combined with somatostatin receptor PET-CT scans for neuroendocrine neoplasms or prostate-specific membrane antigen for suspected prostate cancer. A meta-analysis of 20 studies including 1,942 patients found a biopsy confirmed or clinically confirmed positive PET-CT scan in 40.9% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.0%–42.9%).[
5
]
A meta-analysis of 38 studies including 2,795 patients found that a fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose–PET or PET-CT scan led to management changes in 35% of patients (95% CI, 31%–40%).[
6
] In this meta-analysis, PET-CT identified a primary site in 22% of patients (95% CI, 18%–28%) and other metastases in 14% of patients (95% CI, 10%–19%).[
6
]
After staging with a PET-CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the head, the next step is molecular characterization and next-generation sequencing, preferably on the tissue biopsy or alternatively by analyzing circulating tumor cells on a blood sample (so-called liquid biopsy).

Single-Site or Oligometastatic Disease Amenable to Surgery or Radiation Therapy
According to a consensus paper, when a single site of metastasis can be confirmed by positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) scan and  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, local treatment with surgery or radiation therapy is an option. Local treatment has resulted in anecdotal cure in a few patients and several months to years of anecdotal relapse-free survival in a few patients.[

][
Level of evidence C3
] Anecdotal reports also support localized therapy for patients with fewer than five metastases, or even re-treatment with radiation therapy or surgery for patients with localized recurrence.[
2
][
Level of evidence C3
] A patient staged with CUP and a single brain metastasis  may also do well with radiation therapy with or without surgery, as was reported in a prospective study of 33 patients.[

Cervical Lymph Node(s) With Squamous Cell Histology (Head and Neck Paradigm)
PET-CT, MRI, and pan-endoscopy for biopsies and bilateral tonsillectomies are performed when squamous cell carcinoma is identified in cervical lymph nodes (not supraclavicular) in patients with CUP.[
5
]
Transoral robotic surgery may replace pan-endoscopy in the search for a primary site in the head and neck region.[
6
] Pathological studies should include testing for p16 expression to assess human papillomavirus status, Epstein-Barr virus status, and PD-L1 expression.[

.
Inguinal Lymph Nodes With Squamous Cell Histology (Genitourinary or Anorectal Source)
Squamous cell carcinoma in an inguinal or iliac site is usually associated with a genital or anorectal primary. Examinations should focus on the vulva, vagina, and cervix in women, and the penis in men. In both sexes, the anorectal area should be examined, and any suspicious areas should be biopsied. Anecdotal cures have been reported in a few cases of isolated inguinal or iliac sites with an occult primary after staging studies.[
8
]
Axillary Lymph Node(s) With Adenocarcinoma Histology (Breast Paradigm)
Less than 1% of female patients present with histological breast cancer in an axillary lymph node with an occult primary even after MRI of the breast.[
9
] Initial pathological studies should include estrogen-receptor, progesterone-receptor, and human epidermal growth factor (HER2) status, with further molecular and genetic studies done subsequently. Surgery, radiation therapy, neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy are given according to guidelines for conventional breast cancer.[

Bone Metastases if Blastic (Breast Paradigm for Women, Prostate Paradigm for Men)
The presence of blastic bone metastases or mixed blastic/lytic lesions will usually suggest breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. Diagnostic procedures and therapeutic options should proceed in these directions.

Elevated AFP and/or Beta-hCG (Germ Cell Paradigm)
The presence of elevated serum or tissue levels of AFP and/or beta-hCG suggests testicular cancer or extragonadal germ cell tumor in males. Men younger than 50 years with mediastinal adenopathy and pulmonary metastases have immunohistochemical evidence of AFP and/or beta-hCG in the extragonadal presentation. Diagnostic procedures and therapeutic options should proceed in these directions.

Peritoneal Carcinomatosis if Adenocarcinoma (Ovarian Paradigm)
Women with peritoneal carcinomatosis of an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma or serous histology in the absence of an ovarian, fallopian tube, or uterine primary site should undergo diagnostic testing and a therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer.[

Neuroendocrine Neoplasms
Neuroendocrine neoplasms are classified as well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and slow progression neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC). Well-differentiated NETs exhibit relatively indolent behavior. Slow progression NECs may exhibit highly aggressive behavior, with a rapid metastatic spread that is clinically indistinguishable from pancreatic adenocarcinoma or small cell lung cancer. The Ki-67 proliferative index rate  is used to subclassify well-differentiated NETs into low, intermediate, and high-grade, while NECs are by default high-grade and poorly differentiated and divided into small- and large-cell NEC.
NETs of unknown primary origin may derive from the small bowel, pancreas, appendix, colon, rectum, or ovary.[
23
,
24
] Somatostatin receptor PET-CT scans are highly effective at identifying primary sites and metastatic sites for well-differentiated NETs, while fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose–PET is more appropriate for NEC.[

Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Unfavorable Cancer of Unknown Primary
In This Section
Treatment Options for Newly Diagnosed Unfavorable CUP
Site-directed therapy based on molecular tissue of origin or molecular targeted therapy
Immunological therapy
Chemotherapy
Current Clinical Trials
Most patients with newly diagnosed cancer of unknown primary (CUP) are considered to have an unfavorable prognosis.
Treatment Options for Newly Diagnosed Unfavorable CUP
Treatment options for newly diagnosed unfavorable CUP include the following:
Site-directed therapy based on molecular tissue of origin/molecular targeted therapy
.
Immunological therapy
.
Chemotherapy
.
Site-directed therapy based on molecular tissue of origin or molecular targeted therapy
Clinical, pathological, and molecular genetic tests have two goals. The first is to identify tumors that are responsive to available therapies. The second is to identify novel targeted therapies that might be applicable to the particular genetic profile. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved some novel targeted therapies when a molecular target is identified in a cancer, regardless of primary site or when no primary site is evident. Examples include tumors with the following actionable targets:[
1
-
8
]
High tumor mutational burden (TMB-H).
Elevated PD-1 or PD-L1 expression.
HER2 expression.
Pathogenic variants in
NTRK
,
RET
, or
EGFR
.
BRAF
V600E pathogenic variant.
ROS1
gene fusion.
MET
amplification.
Homologous recombination repair deficiency/microsatellite instability (MSI).
Immunological therapy
Immunological therapy using checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab has been given to a general population with unfavorable CUP, resulting in  a 22% overall response rate.[
8
] Better response rates can be seen when checkpoint inhibitors are given to patients with tumors expressing high levels of MSI (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).[
7
] Patients with TMB-H disease, defined as at least 7.75 mutations [
8
] or 10 mutations [
9
] per megabase, also have higher response rates to immunotherapy.[
6
] The FDA has approved pembrolizumab in a tumor-agnostic situation (which includes CUP) for tumors with MSI-H, dMMR, or TMB-H.[
7
] High PD-L1 expression also correlates with higher response rates in patients who receive immunotherapy.[
8
] Further trials for patients with CUP are required to  assess when to give checkpoint inhibitors and to define optimal cutoffs (1% to 50%) and scoring systems (cancer cell tumor proportion score vs. cancer-plus-surrounding cell combined positive score) to guide treatment.[
10
]
Chemotherapy
Patients with unfavorable CUP who are not candidates for molecular targeted therapy or immunotherapy  are candidates for clinical trials. Cytotoxic chemotherapy can be a palliative therapy, but the choice of drugs has been based on a few small clinical studies, with no randomized trials establishing their benefit over best supportive care.[
10
] Several randomized prospective studies demonstrate that platinum-based doublet chemotherapy combined with a taxane or gemcitabine is equivalent to other chemotherapy in response rate and progression-free survival.[

Level of evidence B1
] Although most patients in these trials had adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma, patients with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma were included.
Palliative care and hospice are options for patients with a poor performance status and relapsing disease.
