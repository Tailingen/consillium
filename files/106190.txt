A Study of Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging With ICG During Reconstructive Gynecologic Surgery
The objective of this study is to assess whether Near-Infrared Fluorescence/NIR Imaging perfusion alters intraoperative management of the flap or of the participant wound bed.
Gynecologic Surgery
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: ICG-NIR angiography
Percentage of cases in which intraoperative ICG-NIR angiography altered surgical flap reconstruction plans, The primary purpose of this study is to introduce ICG-NIR angiography in abdominopelvic skin and myocutaneous pedicle flap-based reconstruction during gynecologic oncology surgery and determine the percentage of cases in which intraoperative ICG-NIR angiography altered surgical flap reconstruction plans., Up to 24 months
The objective of this study is to assess whether Near-Infrared Fluorescence/NIR Imaging perfusion alters intraoperative management of the flap or of the participant wound bed.
