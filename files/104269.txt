A Clinical Trial on Efficacy and Safety for Lobaplatin and Gemcitabine in Combination With Docetaxel in the Second-line Treatments on Advanced Osteosarcoma
The purpose was to evaluate efficacy, safety and effects on survival for lobaplatin and Gemcitabine in combination with Docetaxel, which can provide a kind of completely new second-line chemotherapy program for osteosarcoma patients in aggressive-phase, provide accurate and reliable evidence-based results for clinical applications of lobaplatin in osteosarcoma patients as one of the third-generation of platinum drugs, and further consummate and enrich clinical practice guidance on osteosarcoma all over the world.
Lobaplatin and Gemcitabine in Combination, Second-line Treatments on Advanced Osteosarcoma
DRUG: Docetaxel+lobaplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine+lobaplatin
progression free survival (PFS), Major parameter: progression free survival (PFS) Progression free survival (PFS): it refers to the period from the day of randomization in the groups to any progression of disease or death with records., 2 years
Minor parameters: objective remission rate (ORR), Overall survival (OS): it refers to the period from the date of randomization in the groups to death induced by any reason with records. The ending date of last correspondence should be recorded for all of the subjects lost from follow-ups before termination of the clinical trials or quit from the tests. The last date for survival will be recorded as the ending for the subjects still accepting treatments., 2 years|Minor parameters: overall survival (OS), safety., Objective remission rate (ORR): it refers to the percentage of patients for whom tumors decrease to certain sizes and maintain for a period, including CR and PR cases. The criteria for evaluations on therapeutic efficacy are divided into complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD) and progression of disease (PD) according to the RECIST criteria (please refer to attachment 1 for details)., 2 years
