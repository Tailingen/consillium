The most important outcome in the management of HBP malignancies is survival. Since the application of ERAS (enhanced recovery after surgery), the improvement of QOL(quality of life) has been known as one of important factor for the management of HBP malignancies as well as survival, and the improvement of QOL, itself, affect the survival.

There are several reports that perioperative rehabilitation affect positively for the outcome of surgery and QOL in surgical patients. However, in the HBP field, there are rarely studied for this concept.

This study aim to investigate that the application of rehabilitation program for the surgery of HBP malignancies affect on short-term outcome and lead the improvement of QOL.
