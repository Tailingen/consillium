A Study of Ketogenic Diet in Newly Diagnosed Overweight or Obese Endometrial Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to test any good and bad effects of an experimental diet, called a ketogenic diet, in endometrial cancer. A ketogenic diet is one that is very low in carbohydrates (simple and complex sugars). The goal of this diet is for the body to go into a state of ketosis. Ketosis is when the body does not have enough sugar for energy so it burns stored fats which create acids called ketones, which can be used for energy. Researchers hope to learn whether or not a ketogenic diet is well-tolerated and safe to eat before surgery in endometrial cancer patients.
