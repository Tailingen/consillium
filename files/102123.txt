Long Term Arrhythmia Risk and Cardiovascular Events in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant
The purpose of this study is to better understand the following aims:

1. Aim 1: To evaluate the rate of recurrent Atrial Fibrillation (AF)/Atrial Flutter (AFL) in hematopoietic stem call transplant (HCST) patients with incident AF/AFL identified during the initial 30 days of the transplant
2. Aim 2: To evaluate incident episodes of 1) stroke/TIA; 2) other thromboembolic events (not stroke/TIA); 3) Heart failure events; 4) Ischemic heart events
3. Aim 3: To evaluate overall implantation safety in this population
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant|Atrial Fibrillation|Atrial Flutter
OTHER: HSCT Patients
Recurrent AF/AFL episodes, Any recurrent episodes of AF/AFL lasting â‰¥2 minutes identified in ICM monitoring, 1 year
Incident Episodes of Interest, Incident episodes of: stroke/TIA; other thromboembolic events (not stroke/TIA); Heart failure events; ischemic heart events. Overall device implantation safety., 1 year
We propose a registry study in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients with incident atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (AF/AFL) during the initial 30 days of transplant who will be implanted with the Medtronic Reveal Linq Implantable Cardiac Monitor (ICM) within 90 days of HSCT. We will evaluate the rate of recurrent AF/AFL as well as incident episodes of major cardiovascular events and the safety of ICM implantation in this population.
