Ibrutinib in Patients With Refractory/Relapsed Non-GCB Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Non-candidates to ASCT
Multicentric phase II trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin and dexamethasone followed by Ibrutinib maintenance in patients with refractory/relapsed non-GCB DLBCL non candidates to autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) An extensive biological study will be conducted in order to further characterize this population of DLBCL patients and correlate the response obtained with the biological profile of the tumor.
Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Overall Response (OR) Rate, Overall Response (OR) rate (complete remission + partial response) measured by PET(Positron Emission Tomography)/CT image scan. OR will be assessed by Lugano Classification: Revised Criteria for Response Assessment., Treatment responses will be evaluated 30 days after end of study treatment which can be occurred after 2 years and 4 months
CR Rate During Induction and Maintenance Phases., Complete treatment responses evaluation during 21-35 days after initiation of 6 or 8 cycle of study treatment (depend of treatment responses obtained from cycle 4) and 30 days after end of study treatment which can be occurred after 2 years and 4 months, Complete treatment responses will be evaluated 30 days after end of study treatment which can be occurred after 2 years and 4 months|Response Duration, Response duration defined as the time from the documentation of tumor response to disease progression or death, in the event of no documented recurrence, or start of a new anti - lymphoma treatment because of refractory or persistent disease., Response duration will be evaluated at any time during the study when tumor response is documented or after end of study treatment which can be occurred after 2 years and 4 months.|Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival defined as the time between start of treatment and the first documentation of recurrence, progression, or death in the event of no documented recurrence, or start of a new anti - lymphoma treatment, due a refractory or persistent disease. Progression is defined using Lugano Classification for response assessment for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, defined as Score of 4 or 5 with an increase in uptake intensity over baseline period for Individual lymph nodes/target lymph node masses; New areas of FDG avidity consistent with lymphoma at mid- or end-of-treatment assessment for Extranodal injuries; new injuries; New or recurrent areas of FDG avidity in bone marrow., Progression free survival will be evaluated at any time during the study when first documentation of recurrence, progression, or death or after end of study treatment which can be occurred after 2 years and 4 months|Event-free Survival, Event-free survival defined as the time between start of treatment and the first documentation of adverse events and serious adverse events graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0, 2 years and 4 months.|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time between the start of treatment and death from any cause. Patients that are withdrawn from the trial or lost of follow-up, will be censored with the date of last contact. Patients who are still alive at the end of the study will be censored at that time., 2 years|Percentage of Participants That Present Treatment-Related Adverse Events Oxaliplatin and Dexamethasone, Safety and tolerability will be assessed during any phase of study treatment and 30 days after end of study treatment which can be occurred after 2 years and 4 months and will be classified according to the Common Toxicity CNC, 2 years and 4 months
The use of highly effective rituximab-containing therapy for treating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) makes it more difficult to salvage relapsed or refractory patients. In addition, patients with advanced age or significant comorbidities, who are consequently not candidates for high-dose consolidative therapy, have a very poor prognosis. Prospective studies investigating new salvage regimens are essential.

The combination of rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GEMOX) is an effective salvage regimen for patients with relapsing or refractory DLBCL, with a favourable toxicity profile for unfit and/or elderly patients. Ibrutinib, an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a potent killer of ABC DLBCL cell lines in vitro and in xenografts.

It is expected that the combination of ibrutinib with R-GEMOX-Dexa could be effective and well tolerated. Thus, it is proposed an open-label, non-randomized, multicentre, phase II trial, to investigate the safety and efficacy of the combination of ibrutinib with rituximab, gemcitabine, oxaliplatine and dexamethasone followed by ibrutinib maintenance as salvage therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory non-GCB DLBCL non-candidates to stem cell transplant.
