A Trial to Learn How Effective and Safe Odronextamab is Compared to Standard of Care for Adult Participants With Previously Treated Aggressive B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study is researching an experimental drug called odronextamab, referred to as study drug. The study is focused on patients with previously treated aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma whose cancer has stopped responding to treatment (also known as 'refractory') or has returned (also known as 'relapsed'). The aim of the study is to see how safe, tolerable and effective the study drug is when given alone.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug versus Standard of Care (SOC)
* How much study drug is in the blood at different times
* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the study drug less effective or could lead to side effects)
* Comparing the impact from the study drug versus SOC on quality-of-life and ability to complete routine daily activities
B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL)
DRUG: Odronextamab|DRUG: Ifosfamide|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Event-free survival (EFS) as assessed by independent central review, Assessed up to 3 years
Progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by independent central review, Assessed up to 3 years|Best overall response (BOR) as assessed by independent central review, Assessed up to 6 months|Overall change in physical functioning as measured by scores of the physical function scale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social functioning), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting), a global health status (GHS)/QoL scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, shortness of breath, appetite loss and financial difficulties). For the functioning scales and global health status / QoL, scores range from 1 = "very poor" to 7 = "excellent" with higher scores indicate better functioning; for the symptom scales, scores range from 1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much" higher scores indicate higher symptom burden., Assessed up to 3 years|EFS as assessed by local investigator, Assessed up to 3 years|PFS as assessed by local investigator, Assessed up to 3 years|BOR as assessed by local investigator, Assessed up to 6 months|Complete response (CR) as assessed by independent central review, Assessed up to 6 months|CR as assessed by local investigator, Assessed up to 6 months|Duration of response (DOR) assessed by independent central review, Assessed up to 3 years|DOR assessed by local investigator, Assessed up to 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Assessed up to 3 years|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Assessed up to 1 year|Severity of TEAEs, Assessed up to 1 year|Odronextamab concentrations in serum, Assessed up to 6 months|Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) to odronextamab over the study duration, Assessed up to 6 months|Titers of ADAs to odronextamab over the study duration, Assessed up to 6 months|Incidence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to odronextamab over the study duration, Assessed up to 6 months|Measurable residual disease (MRD) status, Assessed up to 6 months|Duration of MRD-negativity, as determined by circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), Assessed up to 3 years|Overall change in patient-reported outcomes, as measured by scores of the EORTCQLQ- C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social functioning), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting), a GHS/QoL scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, shortness of breath, appetite loss and financial difficulties). For the functioning scales and global health status / QoL, scores range from 1 = "very poor" to 7 = "excellent" with higher scores indicate better functioning; for the symptom scales, scores range from 1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much" higher scores indicate higher symptom burden., Assessed up to 3 years|Overall change in patient-reported outcomes, as measured by scores of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma (FACT-LymS), The FACT-Lym lymphoma subscale (LymS) includes 15 items to assess NHL-related symptoms and concerns. All questions are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from "not at all" (0) to "very much" (4). Higher scores are associated with a worse quality of life., Assessed up to 3 years|Overall change in patient-reported outcomes, as measured by scores of the EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: "no problems", "slight problems", "moderate problems", "severe problems" and "extreme problems". The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labeled "Best imaginable health state" and "Worst imaginable health state"., Assessed up to 3 years|Overall change in score of the Global Population item 5 (GP5) of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) questionnaire, A single item GP5 of the validated FACT-G questionnaire will be used to assess from the participant perspective the overall impact of treatment side-effect. The question item is on a 5-point scale ranging from "not at all" (0) to "very much" (4)., Assessed up to 3 years
