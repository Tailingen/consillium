Autologous and Allogeneic Transplant for Relapsed Lymphoma
The sequential combination of myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) followed by a reduced intensity allogeneic stem cell transplant (Allo SCT) and post SCT adoptive cellular immunotherapy will be well tolerated in patients with refractory or recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease (HD).

Total Number of Subjects With a Complete Response (CR) Following Myeloablative Conditioning (MAC) and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (AutoSCT), Complete Response is defined as the complete resolution of B symptoms (i.e., weight loss, night sweats and fever) and normalization of all sites of disease on the basis of physical exam, bone marrow biopsy, and imaging studies., Up to 1 year post-transplantation|Total Number of Subjects With a Disease Relapse or Progression Following MAC AutoSCT, Includes subjects with any measurable growth of disease in a previously affected site or detection of disease in a new site confirmed by biopsy., Up to 1 year post-transplantation|Total Number of Subjects With Partial Response or Stable Disease Following MAC AutoSCT, Total includes subjects with partial response and patients with stable disease, defined as \<50% reduction in measurable disease or the uninterrupted persistence of B symptoms., Up to 1 year post-transplantation
Time to Neutrophil Engraftment, Following MAC AutoSCT, the median time to neutrophil (PMN) recovery will be measured., Up to 1 year post-transplantation|Time to Platelet Engraftment, Following MAC AutoSCT, the median time to platelet recovery will be measured., Up to 1 year post-transplantation|Total Number of Subjects With Grade II-IV Acute Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GVHD), The criteria for grading is based on extent of organ involvement (i.e., Skin, Liver and Gut - rash on \>50% of skin, bilirubin 2-3 mg/dl, diarrhea \> 500 ml/day) with Grade II being better outcome and Grade IV being worse outcome., Up to 1 year post-transplantation|Total Number of Subjects That Experienced Transplant-related Mortality (TRM), Status as subjects died post-AlloHCT, Up to 1 year post-transplantation
Lymphomas are the third most common group of cancers in children and adolescents in the United States. While Hodgkin's Disease (HD) has been described for many years, some subtypes of the non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHL) have only recently been described. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas traditionally have been classified as low, intermediate or high grade based on their clinical aggressiveness. More recently they have been divided into two major subgroups indolent and aggressive lymphomas by the current National Cancer Institute (NCI/PDQ) reference. Among children, aggressive histologies are prevalent including small non-cleaved cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and diffuse large cell lymphoma. The most common histologic classifications of childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma over the past 30 years has included the morphological schema developed by Rappaport, the morphologically and immunologically based schema of Lukes and Collins, the Kiel classifications, the prognostic sub-groupings of the National Cancer Institute's Working Formulation, and the most recently developed classification that utilizes morphological, immunophenotypic and genetic information in the Revised European-American Lymphoma (REAL) classification.
