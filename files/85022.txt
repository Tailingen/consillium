Leflunomide in Patients With PTEN-Altered Advanced Solid Malignancies
Leflunomide in patients with PTEN-null advanced solid tumors. Objectives are to determine the safety and tolerability and the MTD of leflunomide in patients with PTEN-null advanced solid malignancies and to assess preliminary evidence of clinical activity of leflunomide in patients with PTEN-null advanced solid malignancies.

Maximum tolerated dose, A standard 3+3 design is used to define the MTD. Dose level 0 will only be utilized in the presence of â‰¥2/6 DLTs in dose level 1 or for a dose reduction if a patient does not tolerate dose level one. Standard dosing for rheumatoid arthritis is 100mg daily for 3 days loading dose followed by 20mg daily maintenance dose, which can be reduced to 10mg in the event of intolerance., 2 years|Overall Response Rate, Overall Response Rate for dose expansion cohort. Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of patients achieving a best response of complete response or partial response using RECIST v1.1, 2 years
