A Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Potential Anti-tumor Effects of SSGJ-705 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic HER2-expressing Solid Tumors
The study will consist of two parts: a dose-escalation part (Part 1) and a dose expansion part (Part 2). In both study parts, SSGJ-705 will be administered，the administration duration may be adjusted based on outcomes of previous patients if necessary) followed by safety, PK, PD, potential anti tumor effects and immunogenicity evaluation.
Receptor, ErbB-2
DRUG: SSGJ-705
DLT, Dose-limiting toxicity（part 1）, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|MTD, maximum tolerated dose（part 1）, up to 1 years|RP2D, Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria according to investigators recommended Phase II dose（part 1）, up to 1 years|ORR, Objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria according to investigators assessment（part 2）, up to 1 years
Adverse events, the safety of SSGJ-705 in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-expressing solid tumors who have failed standard treatment, up to 1 years|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To evaluate the Cmax of single and multiple doses of SSGJ-705 in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2 expressing solid tumors who have failed standard treatments, up to 1 years|Area Under the Curve (AUC), To evaluate the AUC of single and multiple doses of SSGJ-705 in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2 expressing solid tumors who have failed standard treatments, up to 1 years|incidence of anti-609A antibodies, incidence of anti-609A antibodies, up to 1 years|Median Progression-free Survival (PFS), The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate median PFS., up to 1 years|Overall Survival (OS), The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate median OS., up to 1 years
