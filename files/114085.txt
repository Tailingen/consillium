DAHANCA 33: Image Guided Dose-escalated Radiotherapy to Patients With Hypoxic HNSCC
Aim: To improve curability of radiotherapy in HNSCC patients identified by hypoxic FAZA-PET scanning
Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer|Radiotherapy|Hypoxic Radioresistance
RADIATION: HART-CN
Loco-regional failure, loco-regional failure defined as persistent or recurrent disease in tumor and/or regional lymphnode sites (within the radiotherapy treated volume). The primary endpoint did not include the effect of a successful procedure with salvage surgery (no primary neck dissection was allowed)., Year 3
Overall survival, Death from all causes, Year 3|Acute radiation related morbidity, Month 3|Late radiation related morbidity, Year 3|Disease-specific death, Disease-specific death is defined as death from or with the cancer in question;, Year 3
Prospective phase II study aiming to improve the outcome in hypoxic resistent patients identified by FAZA-PET.

Inclusion:

Patients must fulfill the following:

Positive hypoxic FAZA-PET Scanning (as described in DAHANCA 24 - see citation) Stage III-IV, Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, pharynx or oral cavity (HPVneg (oropharynx) Indication for hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy with concommitant cis-platin and nimorazole
