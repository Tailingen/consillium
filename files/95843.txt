Acupressure for Cancer-Related Fatigue
This study develops and pilot tests the efficacy of a home-based, self-administered acupressure intervention in improving cancer-related fatigue (proximal outcome), and physical functioning and other quality of life outcomes (distal outcomes) of Chinese immigrant breast cancer survivors (versus usual care control group).
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: acupressure intervention|BEHAVIORAL: usual care
Cancer-related fatigue (proximal outcome), The primary outcome will be measured by 6-item PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) (e.g., felt tired, exhausted, limited at work)., 8 weeks post-intervention
Physical functioning (distal outcomes), The secondary outcomes will be measure by 8-item PROMIS (e.g., ability in carrying grocery, kneeling, climbing stairs)., 8 weeks post-intervention|Sleep disturbance, The secondary outcomes will be measure by 6-item PROMIS (e.g., sleep not steady, unsatisfied, hard to fall asleep)., 8 weeks post-intervention|Anxiety, The secondary outcomes will be measure by 7-item PROMIS (e.g., felt anxious, nervous, fearful, tense)., 8 weeks post-intervention|Depression, The secondary outcomes will be measure by 8-item PROMIS (e.g., felt helpless, depressed, unhappy, hopeless)., 8 weeks post-intervention|Pain interference, The secondary outcomes will be measure by 6-item PROMIS (e.g., affecting ability to focus, interact with others, run errands)., 8 weeks post-intervention
We will enroll 124 foreign-born, Chinese-speaking women from Southern California and Maryland areas with moderate to severe levels of fatigue, diagnosed with stage 0-IV breast cancer, aged 21-74, and 1-5 years post-primary treatment. Using an adaptive treatment strategy design, participants will be randomized to either the acupressure intervention or control groups. The acupressure group will learn how to press three chief energy acupoints on each side of the body through de novo 11-minute Chinese-language video and practice acupressure every day (one minute per acupoint; a total of 6 minutes per day) for an 8-week intervention period. Participants will be telephone interviewed twice: at baseline and 8-weeks post-intervention follow-up.
