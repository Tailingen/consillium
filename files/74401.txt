Study of Orally Administered TAK-960 in Patients With Advanced Nonhematologic Malignancies
Overview of Study Design: This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of TAK-960 in patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies. This study will be the first to administer TAK-960 to humans. The patient population will consist of adults with a nonhematologic malignancy for which standard treatment is no longer effective or does not offer curative or life-prolonging potential, or for which no standard treatment is available.
