Study of Pelvic Hypofractionated Radiotherapy in Endometrial Cancer
This study will investigate if a shorter treatment course (known as "hypofractionation") for pelvic radiation is safe for women with endometrial cancer. Doctors leading the study will also determine the safest and most tolerable dose of shortened radiation (hypofractionation) used to treat women in this study. Because this study will shorten the radiation course typically used to treat endometrial cancer, each daily treatment given to women in this study will be slightly higher than normal to ensure that the total radiation dose they receive is still effective and similar to the radiation dose they would receive if they were not participating in this study (standard treatment).
Endometrial Cancer
RADIATION: Hypofractionated Radiation|OTHER: Clinical Follow-Up and Assessments
The Maximum Tolerated Dose of Hypofractionated Whole Pelvic Radiation Treatment (Phase 1), The maximum tolerated dose-per-fraction regimen of whole pelvic radiation therapy that will be administered during uterine cancer treatment., 3-5 weeks|Change in patient-reported acute gastrointestinal side effects after completion of hypofractionated radiation (Phase 2), Change in quality-of-life experience on the bowel and urinary domains, 3-5 weeks (end of treament)
Change in patient-reported acute urinary side effects, Determined using frequency of reported events of urinary frequency, urinary incontinence, and urinary urgency on the Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO-CTCAE), 1 month post radiation|Change in gastrointestinal toxicity over time, Determined using frequency of reported events of diarrhea and proctitis on the Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO-CTCAE), 1 month post radiation|Overall quality of life after treatment, Total quality of life score from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-General questionnaire will be calculated. A higher score indicates better quality of life., 2 years post treatment|Financial Distress of Treatment, Change in reported financial distress in patients as reported on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- COST (FACIT-COST) questionnaire. Higher scores on scale of 0-5 indicates better financial wellbeing., End of treatment|Treatment Satisfaction, We will characterize the measure of regret experienced in the study patients over time as reported on the Decision Regret Scale questionnaire. Higher scores on scale of 0-100 indicates high regret., End of treatment
