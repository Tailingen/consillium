A Study of the Use of Acellular Dermal Matrix for Breast Reconstruction
The researchers are doing this study to look at the number of complications that occur immediately after prepectoral breast reconstruction when Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM) is used compared to when ADM is not used. These complications include infections, the need for Tissue Expander (TE) or implant removal, and other conditions that lead to additional surgery.

PROCEDURE: Prepectoral Breast Reconstruction with Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM)|PROCEDURE: Prepectoral Breast Reconstruction without Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM)
Percentage of patients who experience major complications, Listed below are definitions for 90-day major complications for TEs (i.e., infection, explantation, and reoperation for any cause, including mastectomy flap necrosis):

* Infection defined as:
* Any event requiring the restart of antibiotics (oral or intravenous) after completion of initial perioperative antibiotics
* Admission to the hospital for signs and symptoms of cellulitis (redness on breast mound) requiring antibiotics
* Purulent drainage from the surgical site or incision
* Explantation defined as the need for removal of a TE for any cause
* Reoperation defined as skin excision performed in either the clinic or the operating room for mastectomy skin flap necrosis, surgical incision dehiscence, pending skin breakdown or another surgical complication, 90 days
Estimate rates of minor complications (specifically seroma), Minor complication for (Tissue Expanders) TEs are defined as:

o Seroma: Clinically significant noninfected fluid collection requiring either needle aspiration or drain replacement, 90 days
