The Purpose of the Study is to Continue to Provide Pemigatinib to Patients With Advanced Malignancies.
Safety and tolerability of pemigatinib.in monotherapy or combination in patients that have participated in a previous parent study to treat advanced malignancies.
Advanced Malignancies
DRUG: Pemigatinib|DRUG: Retifanlimab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Number of Participants With Any Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it was considered drug related. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study treatment. TEAEs were defined as AEs either reported for the first time or the worsening of pre-existing events after the first dose of study drug and until 30 days after the last dose of study drug., up to at least 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or until toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever was longer (up to 1010 days)
A Phase 2 Open-Label, Multicenter, Rollover Study to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of Pemigatinib and to provide Continued Treatment for Participants With Advanced Malignancies Previously Enrolled in Studies of Pemigatinib
