PD-L1 and BRAF Expression in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The prognostic value of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and BRAF expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is not well-defined. In this study the investigators investigated alterations in PD-L1, BRAF and EGFR by using immunohistochemistry analysis in a cohort of consecutively enrolled NPC patients.

Survival rate, Survival in PD-L1 positive and negative group, Followed up with 12 months after last patient in
NPC is a common type cancer in Macau and Southern China. The role of PD-L1 in NPC remains controversial. There many reasons behind these inconsistent findings. We used the SP263 antibody with the standard cut off value of 1% and 5%, which is frequently used for lung cancer and other cancer types. We also plan to include over 150 patients, which will be the largest study in NPC. This will help us to gain insights in NPC.
