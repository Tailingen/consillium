Clofarabine-cyclophosphamide as Salvage Therapy for Refractory and Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Adults
This is a multicentric, prospective pilot trial testing a Clofarabine-Cyclophosphamide combination to treat refractory and first bone marrow relapse adult ALL, for the achievement of a complete remission (CR) and the concurrent evaluation of biological response in ALL cells (minimal residual disease, apoptosis and DNA cell damage, pharmacogenomics).
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Clofarabine, Cyclophosphamide
The Primary End-point is the Number of Patients in CR After Induction Therapy., Disappearance of any clinical and laboratoristic sign of ALL. The patient must be transfusion-free with neutrophils \>1.0 x109/L and platelets \>100 x109/L. BM examination must show absence or reduction of blast cell content (\< 5%, none of which obviously leukemic), with cellularity in the normal or slightly hypocellular range and with evidence of trilineage hemopoiesis. BM is examined on day 28 from start of chemotherapy cycle 1, or later as clinically indicated in ill/cytopenic patients, and after cycle 2 in patients with PR proceeding to this treatment., At day +28 from start of chemotherapy cycle 1 and after cycle 2 in pts with PR
Number of Participants With Toxicity of Grade 2 or Greater, Referring to CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria Events), version 4.0, At 13 months from study entry|Number of Participants With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Response in Remission., At week 10, 16 and 22 from start of treatment and the, every three months till study completion|Disease-free Survival (DFS), Disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year, defined as the time interval between the evaluation of CR and relapse of the disease or death in first CR; patients still alive, in first CR, will be censored at the time of the last follow-up. In this case, the DFS curve will be truncated at 1 year, At one year from completion of chemotherapy|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) at 1 year; defined as the time interval between inclusion and death for any cause; patients still alive will be censored at the time of the last follow-up. In this case, the OS curve will be truncated at 1 year., At one year from therapy completion.|Cumulative Incidence of Relapse (CIR), Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 1 year, it will be calculated from the date of achievement of the first CR, using the cumulative incidence method, considering death in CR as a competing risk. Patients still alive, without a date of relapse, will be censored at the time of the last follow-up. In this case, the CIR curve will be truncated at 1 year., At one year from therapy completion.
The proposed treatment schedule consists of a combination of Clofarabine plus Cyclophosphamide administered over 5 consecutive days (Treatment scheme). This is an open, nonrandomized prospective phase II trial aimed to evaluating (1) activity of this combination in terms of CR rate.

* STEP 1. All eligible patients will be screened for the availability of an HLA-matched or partially mismatched compatible HSCT donor, of both family related - or unrelated type (early activation required), including cord blood and haploidentical siblings. Moreover, pre-treatment investigation will include collection and storage of patient ALL cells for specific biological studies relating to sensitivity and response to study chemotherapeutic combination.
* STEP 2. Cycle 1 will be applied to all eligible patients once all enrollment criteria are confirmed.
* STEP 3. After cycle 1, response will be evaluated.
* STEP 4. After remission induction cycle 1, only responsive patients (CR or PR, see below for definitions) could be given cycle 2, according to the opinion of the responsible physician and with a minimum intercycle interval of 4 weeks from day 1 of cycle 1. All NR patients will be declared off study and will not be given a second course with study combination. The suggested treatment following cycle 2 (or cycle 1 if cycle 2 is omitted) is HSCT.
