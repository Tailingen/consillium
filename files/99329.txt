Clinical Pilot Study for Personalized Risk-based Breast Cancer Screening
The study aims to evaluate the impact of implementing population-based genetics testing strategy for breast cancer precision prevention using the polygenic risk score and monogenic pathogenic variant (MPV) testing in the Norwegian healthcare setting.
Breast Cancer
GENETIC: Polygenetic risk score
Assessment of breast cancer risk by polygenetic risk score in the study population, Polygenetic breast cancer risk score (PRS) as a numeric value with 10 percentile, as absolute 10-year breast cancer risk, and as relative risk compared with average women at the same age, 10 years
Compliance to individual recommedations for breast cancer screening, Percentage and frequencies of participants following their individual screening recommendations, 10 years|Correlation of polygenetic risk score and breast cancer risk assessed by family history, Distribution of PRS among participants with increased breast cancer risk based on family history, 10 years|ParticipantsÂ´ experience with study participation, Questionnaries on experience with the sampling process and feedback on a categorical scale (totally disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, totally agree), 10 years
The study will recruit women age 40-50 referred for clinical mammography at the Vestre Viken Breast Center, with mammographic density BI-RADS a or d. After informed consent, saliva from the participants will be sampled and tested for polygenetic risk score (PRS) for breast cancer. The participants will be recommended future mammographic screening based on the PRS (standard screening, or more frequent/start at earlier age). The participants family history of cancer will be assessed, and if indicated, the participants will be referred for full genetic counselling/testing. The study will follow the women for 10 years for development of breast cancer as well as compliance to the recommended follow-up.
