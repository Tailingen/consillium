Palliative RT & Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Checkpoint Blockade in Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma
The primary objectives of this study are to assess 1) the safety and 2) efficacy of combining Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 blockade with palliative radiation therapy in patients with Stage IV Merkel Cell Carcinoma.

DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Tumor Response, Tumor Response at both irradiated \& unirradiated sites will be measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Basic RECIST response will be assessed by the criterion below.

* Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions.
* Partial Response (PR) = ≥0% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions.
* Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria.

RECIST v1.1 immune-related response will be assessed by the criterion below.

* Immune-related CR (irCR) = Disappearance of all target lesions. Lymph nodes \<10 mm in short axis.
* Immune-related PR (irPR) = ≥30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions.
* Immune-related SD (irSD) = Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPR.

The outcome is reported as the number of lesions with each of the different levels of clinical response, a number without dispersion., 15 months
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) was assessed as the duration of time from study entry to time of death or the date of last contact. The outcome is reported as OS in months., 18 months|Duration of Response (DOR), The duration of response (DoR) is measured from the time the criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the date that recurrent or progressive disease is documented. Tumor response at both irradiated \& unirradiated sites will be measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Basic RECIST response will be assessed by the criterion below.

* CR = Disappearance of all target lesions.
* PR = ≥0% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions.
* SD = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria.

RECIST immune-related response will be assessed by the criterion below.

* irCR = Disappearance of all target lesions. Lymph nodes \<10 mm in short axis.
* irPR = ≥30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions.
* irSD = Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPR. The outcome is reported as the duration of response for each level of level of clinical response., 15 months
The hypothesis for this study is that local radiation therapy (RT) can be safely used in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. This combination therapy may have the potential to enhance the induction of systemic anti-Merkel cell carcinoma immune responses, which will inhibit growth and kill Merkel cell tumor cells in sites of established metastases outside of the local radiation therapy field.
