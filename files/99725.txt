Trans-catheter Arterial Embolization Combined With p53 Gene Therapy for Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
An open-labeled, randomized, active-controlled phase II study to investigate clinical efficacy and immunoreaction using trans-catheter arterial embolization (TAE) combined with p53 gene therapy in treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
DRUG: TAE plus P53 gene|OTHER: TAE
overall survival, overall survival will be follow up to 2 years, 2 years
immuno-reaction (lymphocyte counts and subgroup ratios), The immune reaction after study treatment will be assessed every one week until 3 months after the first treatment, 3 months|progression free survival, 2 years
Treatment options for advanced HCC are limited due to patients' poor condition, advanced stage, concomitant intra- and extra-liver diseases, and resistance to both chemo- and radio-therapy. Trans-catheter embolization (TAE) is a safe locoregional treatment for advanced HCC and p53 gene has multiple anticancer functions, and both methods do not have immune-inhibitory effects as chemo- or radio-therapy. The objectives of this study are to investigate clinical efficacy and immunoreaction usingTAE plus recombinant adenoviral human p53 gene (rAd-p53) in treatment of advanced HCC.
