Decompression of Odontogenic Cysts
The aim of this case-control study is to evaluate the effects of decompression of cystic jaw lesions by means of comparing pre- and post-decompression histologic findings.

The main question it aims to answer is:

Does decompression of cystic jaw lesions alter the histologic diagnosis?

A retrospective analysis was performed based on the comparison of initial and final histologic diagnoses of patients with an odontogenic cystic lesion, that was surgically treated with decompression followed by a definitive surgery.

Change in histologic diagnosis following decompression (yes/no), A comparison will be made between the initial histologic diagnosis and post-decompression definitive histologic diagnosis of the cystic jaw lesions, A decompression period ranging between 2 and 15 months
The study included patients with a histologic diagnosis of an odontogenic cystic lesion, that was surgically treated with decompression followed by a definitive surgery. The study was carried out retrospectively by means of evaluating records, surgical and histologic reports of patients. Pre- and post-decompression histologic findings were compared in effort to understand if decompression leads to alteration in histologic character and change in diagnoses of lesions.
