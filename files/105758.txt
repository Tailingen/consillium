Study of Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFr) Antibody, Cetuximab, in Combination With Gemcitabine/Carboplatin in Patients With Stage IV Lung Cancer
The objective is to evaluate the toxicity profile, response rate, and time to progression of Cetuximab administered in combination with either Carboplatin + Gemcitabine in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with positive EGFr expression.
Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab in combination with Carboplatin/Gemcitabine
Evaluate the tumor response of cetuximab in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with EGFr positive, chemotherapy-naive, Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer., 3-week cycles with evaluation after every 2 cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
Evaluate the response rate and time to disease progression, 3-week cycles with evaluation after every 2 cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of Cetuximab when used in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin in patients with EGFr positive, chemotherapy-naive, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Also, the study will determine the response rate in patients with EGFr positive chemotherapy-naive, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with Cetuximab in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin as well as determine the time to progression in patients with EGFr positive chemotherapy-naive, stage IV NSCLC treated with Cetuximab in combination with gemcitabine and carboplatin.
