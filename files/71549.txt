Investigating the Use of Fluorescence Imaging in Endometrial Cancer Surgery
The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the detection rate and accuracy of fluorescence imaging in endometrial cancer staging by sentinel node assessment.
Endometrial Cancer
PROCEDURE: Fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node detection
Evaluating detection rate and accuracy of fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node detection in endometrial cancer., Average expected time of 12 weeks
Determine the rate of upstaging using fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node assessment by microscopic evaluation., In cancer, "upstaging" is changing the stage used to describe a patient's cancer from a lower stage (less extensive) to a higher stage (more extensive). The sentinel lymph nodes removed during the flourescence guided surgery will be examined microscopically to determine how often upstaging occurred., Average expected time of 12 weeks
In many cancer types, such as breast cancer and melanoma, sentinel node assessment has become the standard of care surgical treatment. Sentinel nodes are the first lymph nodes to which cancer cells are likely to spread from a primary tumor. Removal of a sentinel node for examination accurately predicts whether the cancer has spread to other nodes further along in the nodal chain. Fluorescence imaging with ICG dye (Indocyanine Green) has been used to detect lymph nodes in patients with gastric, colorectal and breast cancer. To date, the use of this technique in endometrial cancer has not been reported.
