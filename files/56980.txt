Contrast The Role of Avitene And OK-432 in Reducing Seroma Formation After Axillary Lymphadenectomy for Breast Cancer
After Axillary lymphadenectomy for breast cancer there are not few patients showed seroma formation and it can not be ignored.Investigators aimed to study two new methods of application of Microfibrillar Collagen Hemostat Flour and OK-432 to reduce seroma formation and to verify the efficacy and safety of these two applications.Try to prove them as beneficial supplements for axillary lymphadenectomy of breast cancer.
Drainage|Postoperative Complications
DRUG: Avitene|DRUG: Sapylin|BEHAVIORAL: axillary drainage|OTHER: reexamine
postoperative drainage magnitude, up to 1 year
Duration of the drainage, up to 1 year
The complications of seroma formation, up to 1 year
A prospective,randomized analysis of breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy plus axillary lymphadenectomy for those patients with sentinel node positive using Microfibrillar Collagen Hemostat Flour 、 OK-432 or using nothing in equal probability.Up to 12 months,a total of 180 will be recruited in plan.During the operation and after the axillary lymphadenectomy，according the arms，Investigators put Microfibrillar Collagen Hemostat Flour（avitene）、 OK-432（Sapylin） or nothing into patients axillary wounds。And Investigators will the statistical significance of these three arms that the postoperative drainage magnitude and duration.Also the complications associated with axillary lymphadenectomy will be studied.
