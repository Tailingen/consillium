Preserving Left Colonic Artery During Radical Resection of Rectal Cancer
To evaluate the feasibility and clinical significance of preserving left colonic artery in rectal cancer surgery.The investigators will focus on the effect of preserving left colonic artery during radical resection of rectal cancer on anastomotic leakage and oncology efficacy.
Postoperative Complications|Proteinosis
PROCEDURE: Preserve the left colonic artery|PROCEDURE: The left colonic artery is not preserved
The incidence of postoperative anastomotic leakage was compared between the two groups., The incidence of anastomotic leakage within 30 days after surgery was compared between the intervention group and the control group., Within 30 days after surgery|The distant metastasis rates of rectal cancer between the two groups were compared., The incidence of distant metastasis rectal cancer within two years after surgery was compared between the intervention group and the control group., Two years after surgery|The local recurrence rates of rectal cancer between the two groups were compared., The incidence of local recurrence rectal cancer within two years after surgery was compared between the intervention group and the control group., Two years after surgery|The five-year survival rates of rectal cancer between the two groups were compared., The 5-year survival rates of rectal cancer in the intervention group and the control group were compared., Five years after surgery
The investigators performed three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction to investigate the vascular anatomy, including the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and left colic artery (LCA),to help make pre-operative strategies of rectal cancer surgery.The investigators will preserving the left colonic artery during rectal cancer surgery and evaluate its feasibility and clinical significance.The investigators will focus on the effect of preserving left colonic artery during radical resection of rectal cancer on anastomotic leakage and oncology efficacy.
