Evaluating Laser Photobiomodulation for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain in Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Cancer Patients
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) (including taxanes, platinum, al pervenche from Madagascar alkaloids...), is a frequent secondary effect of treatments: 68% at 1-month post-chemotherapy, 60% at 3 months and 30% after 6 months. Symptoms associated with CIPN are usually symmetric and bilateral (typical distribution in "gloves and socks") inducing sensory alterations, paresthesias, dysesthesias, numbness and pain. Neuropathic Pain (NP) is an important characteristic of CIPN, affects 25-80% of patients with CIPN, and reduces quality of life (e.g., concomitant psychological distress, risks of falls, risks of neurocognitive impairments, and sleep disorders).

In severe cases, it is even necessary to delay and/or reduce the dose of chemotherapy. The benefit of drug interventions on NP remains limited. To date, there are no proven preventive strategies and few evidence-based treatment options for CIPN. Also, the use of complementary or non-pharmacological interventions are common, including photobiomodulation (PBM).

PBM is the therapeutic use of non-ionizing laser light for its anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects. Its use is currently recommended only for the prevention of oral mucositis related to cancer treatments. Recent preliminary clinical evidence suggests that PBM may be beneficial to established CIPN, with safety and improvement beyond the intervention. However, to date, clinical trials are rare, have methodological weaknesses, and/or focus on global CIPN. The overall objectives of the study are therefore to assess the effectiveness, feasibility and safety of the PBM for treating NP in the CIPN.
