Trial of Cladribine and Low-Dose Cytarabine (LoDAC) Alternating With Decitabine vs. Hypomethylating Agents (HMA) Plus Venetoclax as Frontline Therapy for AML or High-Grade MDS in Patients Unfit for Intensive Induction
This phase II, open-label, randomized trial will compare the efficacy of the novel regimen of cladribine/low-dose cytarabine alternating with decitabine to the current standard of care regimen of hypomethylating agents (decitabine or azacitidine) plus venetoclax in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-grade myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are either elderly or unfit for intensive induction. Subjects will be randomized to be treated with either cladribine/low-dose cytarabine alternating with decitabine (Arm A) or decitabine or azacitadine plus venetoclax (Arm B).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Cladribine|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: azacitidine or decitabine|DRUG: Venetoclax
Rate of complete remission, Compare the rate of complete remission (per 2017 European LeukemiaNet criteria for AML response assessment) in patients treated with cladribine/cytarabine alternating with decitabine to that for patients treated with decitabine or azacitidine and venetoclax, 18 months
Time to complete remission, Compare time to complete remission (per 2017 European LeukemiaNet criteria for AML response assessment) in patients treated with cladribine/cytarabine alternating with decitabine to that for patients treated with decitabine or azacitidine and venetoclax, 18 months|Time to minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, Compare time to MRD negativity (as measured by multicolor flow cytometry per current NCCN guidelines) in patients treated with cladribine/cytarabine alternating with decitabine to that for patients treated with decitabine or azacitidine and venetoclax, 18 months|Overall survival, Compare overall survival (defined as the time from date of randomization until date of death) in patients treated with cladribine/cytarabine alternating with decitabine to that for patients treated with decitabine or azacitidine and venetoclax, 30 months|Overall response rate, Compare overall response rate (defined as the number of patients who achieve either complete or partial remission per 2017 European LeukemiaNet criteria for AML response assessment) in patients treated with cladribine/cytarabine alternating with decitabine to that for patients treated with decitabine or azacitidine and venetoclax, 18 months|Time to overall response, Compare time to overall response in patients treated with cladribine/cytarabine alternating with decitabine to that for patients treated with decitabine or azacitidine and venetoclax. Time to overall response is defined as the time interval from the date of treatment initiation to achievement of overall response., 18 months|Rate of MRD negativity, Compare rate of MRD negativity (as measured by multicolor flow cytometry per current NCCN guidelines) in patients treated with cladribine/cytarabine alternating with decitabine to that for patients treated with decitabine or azacitidine and venetoclax, 18 months|Event-free survival, Compare event-free survival in patients treated with cladribine/cytarabine alternating with decitabine to that for patients treated with decitabine or azacitidine and venetoclax. Event-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to induction treatment failure, relapse in those with a complete remission after induction, or death from any cause., 30 months
