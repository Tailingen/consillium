Early Intervention With Acalabrutinib in Patients With High Risk CLL
This study evaluates the effectiveness of acalabrutinib treatment in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) deemed at high risk for Richter's Transformation (RT). This is a single arm study. Enrolled patients will initiate therapy with acalabrutinib and will dose continuously. While on study, subjects will be monitored monthly for the first 3 months, then every three months thereafter until disease progression, discontinuation due to toxicity, death, or study completion.

This is a multi-center, single arm, Phase II clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of acalabrutinib treatment within 6 months of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnosis for patients with CLL deemed at high risk for Richter's Transformation (RT).
