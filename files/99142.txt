Pupil diameter, Measure the pupil diameter using a pupillometer., Pupil measurements were taken at 1, 2, 3, 5 , 10 , 30minutes , and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 18hours after drug administration.
Consenting patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were allowed to enter the study. The subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive an intravenous bolus (5 seconds) of 25μg fentanyl injection in the first cycle, and after a 2-week washout period, to receive a single dose of 25μg inhaled fentanyl aerosol through the Staccato delivery system in the second cycle; or to receive the same treatment in the opposite order.
