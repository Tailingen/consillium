The primary objective for this study is to evaluate PSA response rates (response will be defined as a \> 50% reduction in PSA levels) in men who have failed primary chemotherapy. The secondary objectives are to compare progression free survival, disease free survival, overall survival, and toxicity (tolerance/safety).

This is a single institution phase II study of oxaliplatin and Taxotere in patients with androgen independent prostate cancer previously treated with up to two cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. During this study, the efficacy and safety of this combination will be evaluated. The primary objective for this study is to evaluate PSA response rates (response will be defined as a \> 50% reduction in PSA levels) in men who have failed primary chemotherapy. The secondary objectives are to compare progression free survival, disease free survival, overall survival, and toxicity (tolerance/safety). There will be up to 35 male subjects \>= 18 years of age enrolled on this single institution study.
