PICAROS - Acalabrutinib RWE on 1L CLL in Spain
This is a multicenter non-interventional study (NIS) on patients with CLL who have been treated with acalabrutinib for the first time within the year before the first site initiation visit in Spain
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

In addition to this outcome measured in the overall population, it will also be assessed by the following factors:

1. the reason for treatment initiation (i.e., first-line treatment-naïve patients, and those switching due to intolerance in absence of progression),
2. presence/absence of risk factors (i.e., del17p, TP53 mutation, and unmutated IGHV).
3. cardiovascular comorbidities (yes/no)., 24 months after treatment initiation.

This is a multicenter, non-interventional study (NIS) based on ambispective (including retrospective and/or prospective) real-world data collection of patients with CLL who have been treated with acalabrutinib for the first time within the year before the first site initiation visit, from approximately 50 Hospitals in Spain. Patients who had already initiated acalabrutinib therapy will be identified by the investigators and offered to participate in the study.

The start of acalabrutinib treatment (index date) must be prior to the first site initiation visit. Therefore, the clinical decision of starting patient on acalabrutinib has independently occurred prior to the patient inclusion into this study. Patients' eligibility for study inclusion is regardless of their current status of acalabrutinib therapy, for example, patients already deceased or discontinued therapy are still eligible to be included into this study. Patient data will be collected both retrospectively and/or prospectively up to 3.5 years from the first site initiation visit. For patients who received acalabrutinib therapy and have deceased, only retrospective medical chart review will be conducted.
