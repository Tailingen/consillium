Study of PV in Combination With Bendamustine and Rituximab for Patients With R/R MCL
A Czech Lymphoma Study Group, phase II, open-label, study of polatuzumab-vedotin in combination with bendamustine and rituximab for patients with mantle cell lymphoma, who relapse after previous therapy with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor
Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell
DRUG: Polatuzumab vedotin|DRUG: Bendamustine Hydrochloride|DRUG: Rituximab
Progression-free survival (PFS), evaluation of the efficacy of the combination of polatuzumab vedotin plus bendamustine and rituximab (BR) with respect to progression-free survival (PFS), 4 years
overall response rate (ORR), efficacy of polatuzumab vedotin plus BR with respect to overall response rate, 4 years|duration of response (DoR), efficacy of PV plus BR with respect to duration of response, 4 years|event free survival (EFS), efficacy of PV plus BR with respect to event free survival, 4 years|overall survival (OS), efficacy of PV plus BR with respect to overall survival, 4 years
