Study of the Effects of Brilacidin Oral Rinse on Radiation-induced Oral Mucositis in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
Oral Mucositis (OM) is a painful and debilitating side effect of many of the drug/radiation regimens used to treat cancer. This study examines the investigational drug brilacidin and its possible application in prevention of oral mucositis in patients undergoing chemoradiation for treatment of head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Neoplasms|Mucositis
DRUG: Brilacidin|OTHER: Placebo
Incidence of Severe OM During Radiation Therapy in Subjects Receiving a Cumulative IMRT Dose of at Least 55 Gy, Incidence of severe oral mucositis, defined as grade 3 or 4 on the WHO Oral Mucositis score, experienced during radiation therapy by patients with head and neck cancer receiving a cumulative radiation dose of at least 55 Gy. The higher the score the more severe the mucositis., 7 weeks
Duration of Severe Oral Mucositis (WHO Grade ≥3) [Overall Duration], Overall duration of severe OM was defined as the number of days from initial WHO Grade ≥3 during radiation therapy to the day prior to the next OM assessment after the last WHO Grade ≥3 during/after radiation therapy., 11 weeks|Incidence of Severe Oral Mucositis (WHO Grade ≥3) for Subjects Receiving Cisplatin Every 21 Days, Incidence of severe oral mucositis (WHO Grade ≥3) for subjects receiving cisplatin every 21 days, 7 weeks|Time to Onset of Severe Oral Mucositis (WHO Grade ≥3), Time to onset of severe oral mucositis (WHO Grade ≥3) analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods., 7 weeks
This study will examine whether daily oral rinses with a solution containing brilacidin will prevent the occurrences of OM or lessen the severity of OM if it occurs. Patients will use an oral rinse 3 times daily for up to seven weeks during chemoradiation for head and neck cancer.
