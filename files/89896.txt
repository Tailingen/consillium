Linked Color Imaging (LCI) for Colorectal Adenoma Detection
Linked color imaging (LCI) is newly developed image-enhancing endoscopy technology that differentiates the red color spectrum more effectively than white light imaging thanks to its optimal pre-process composition of light spectrum and advanced signal processing. This technology, combined in the latest generation Fujifilm's endoscopes (Fujifilm Co, Tokyo, Japan) with new high-performance LED illumination system, enhances the visibility of colonic mucosal vessels and might increase the detection rate of colorectal polyps. Data available regarding colorectal polyp or adenoma detection with LCI are encouraging but are scanty and limited to back-to back studies.

This two parallel arms, randomized, multicenter trial is aimed at evaluating whether LCI is superior to WL endoscopy in terms of adenoma detection
Colon Adenoma|Colonic Polyp
DEVICE: Linked Color Imaging
Adenoma Detection Rate, proportion of participants with at least one adenoma (per-patient analysis), 1 year
advanced adenoma detection rate, proportion of participants with at least one advanced adenoma, 1 year|mean number per subject of polyps, adenomas, advanced adenomas and sessile serrated lesions, total number of detected lesions in each group divided by the total number of participants, 1 year|Withdrawal time, time for mucosal inspection only, 1 year
50-75 years-old subjects participating in the regional screening program undergoing their first colonoscopy following a positive immunochemical fecal occult blood test (FIT) and meeting all eligibility criteria are randomised 1:1 to LCI (LCI group) or WLI (WL) during insertion and withdrawal phase of colonoscopy. A randomisation list for each participating center was produced by the coordinating center via computer-generated treatment code list. Randomisation is stratified by gender, age (50-60, 61-729 years) and screening history (first vs subsequent test) through an online centralised study database.All procedures are performed with a high-definition ELUXEO 700 series videocolonscopes with or without magnification (EC-760R, EC-760ZP, FUJIFILM Co., Tokyo).

The primary outcome measure is the ADR, defined as the proportion of participants with at least one adenoma (per-patient analysis).
