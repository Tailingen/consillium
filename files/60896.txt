Mirdametinib + BGB-3245 in Advanced Solid Tumors
A Phase 1/2a open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study of mirdametinib in combination with BGB-3245 in adult participants with histologically confirmed, advanced (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage III or IV) metastatic or unresectable solid cancer that is refractory to or has progressed during or after at least 1 line of appropriate prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or appropriate targeted therapy, or for which there is no treatment available, or prior standard of care therapy was not tolerated.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: Mirdametinib|DRUG: BGB-3245
Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, Safety and tolerability endpoint evaluation via incidence of treatment emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs).

TEAEs severities will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., Up to 24 months|Maximum Tolerated Dose (Part 1 Only), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for mirdametinib and BGB-3245 administered as a combination, if any, will be based on safety and tolerability during the first 28 days of treatment in Cycle 1., Up to 18 months|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (Part 1 Only), The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for mirdametinib and BGB-3245 administered as a combination will be determined based on safety, tolerability, PK, preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, and other available data., Up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (Part 2 Only), Preliminary anti-tumor efficacy for the RP2D of mirdametinib and BGB-3245 administered as a combination as assessed by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Objective Response Rate (ORR) defined as the proportion of participants with complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1)., Up to 24 months
Objective Response Rate (Part 1 Only), Preliminary anti-tumor efficacy for the RP2D of mirdametinib and BGB-3245 administered as a combination as assessed by CT or MRI. ORR defined as the proportion of participants with CR + PR using RECIST v1.1, Up to 24 months|Duration of Response Rate, Duration of response rate in participants treated with the combination of mirdametinib and BGB-3245, defined as the time from response (CR + PR using RECIST v1.1) to disease progression and/or death., Up to 36 months|Change in plasma concentrations of mirdametinib and BGB-3245, To determine the PK of mirdametinib and BGB-3245 administered as a combination in the eligible participant population. Plasma concentrations of mirdametinib and BGB-3245 will be measured to evaluate systemic exposures (AUC, Cmax, Ctrough, and other PK parameters as data allow)., Up to 24 months
