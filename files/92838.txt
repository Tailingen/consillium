MRD negativity rate within the first treatment cycle, MRD negativity is defined as no presence of small numbers of leukemic cells detected by the flow cytometry after remission, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)
Complete MRD response rates, Complete MRD response is defined as no presence of small numbers of leukemic cells detected by the flow cytometry after remission, At the end of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, respectively (each cycle is 28 days)|Duration of MRD negativity rate, The duration of MRD response was analyzed as the time from onset of MRD negativity until MRD or hematological relapse or date of last confirmation of negative MRD status., From enrollment to the end of Cycle 1 or Cycle 2, which achieves MRD negative first (each cycle is 28 days)|MRD level variation from baseline to post cycle 1, cycle 2 in patients with detectable MRD, respectively, The variation of MRD level from baseline to post cycle 1, cycle 2, respectively, From enrollment to the end of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2, respectively (each cycle is 28 days)|Relapse-free Survival (RFS), RFS is defined as the time from the date of CR until the date of relapse or death, Up to 5 years from enrollment|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from enrollment to date of death due to any cause., Up to 5 years from enrollment
