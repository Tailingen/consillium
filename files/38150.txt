Fibroblast Before and After Neoadjuvant Chemo-radiotherapy in Patient With Locally Advanced Rectal Adenocarcinoma
Single center interventional study to explore activity of fibroblasts in the tumor and away in the healthy rectal tissue.
Rectum Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: Biopsy
Proteomic level evaluation in intra-tumor fibroblast, Proteomic level is assessed before and after radiochemotherapy using SILAC technic (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture), 3 years
Study of fibroblast impact on colorectal tumor cells (in vitro), In vitro analysis including tumor cells characteristics: proliferation, invasive potential, stem cells phenotype)., 3 years
Metastatic spread evaluation, On a mouse model of orthotopic rectal cancer, assessment of the potential and metastatic tumor growth, 3 years|Outcomes 1 to 3 correlation with histological response after RT-CT, Histological response after RT-CT assessed according to the tumor regression grading - Dworak 1997, 3 years|Disease-free survival, Disease-free Survival assessment, 5 years
Patients included in the trial will have new biopsy performed before starting the Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy (RT-CT). These biopsies will study the activity of fibroblasts in the tumor and away in the healthy rectal tissue. Within 8 to 10 weeks after the end of RT-CT, patients will have cancer surgery by proctectomy (with complete removal of the meso-rectum). On the resection specimen, new samples will be taken at the level of the tumor and away from the rectum.This study is single center interventional exploratory .
