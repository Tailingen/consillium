Xbox Kinect Training in Men With Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of 12 weeks systematically training using the Xbox Kinect system.

Outcome measures are made on physical function, quality of life, fatigue and metabolic parameters.

Patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic at the urological department, Regionshospitalet Holstebro.

Patients who have been discharged from the outpatient clinic due to biochemical stabile cancer prostate disease will receive a letter with information about the study.

A research assistant will be responsible for randomization and test procedures. A physiotherapist will be responsible for instruction of the participants to the training and the Xbox system.

A student will be responsible for installation and collection of the Xbox system in the participants home.
