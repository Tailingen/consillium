Normalization of Morning Testosterone Levels in Men With Secondary Hypogonadism
The Purpose of the study is to determine the effects of Androxal on morning testosterone and reproductive status in men with secondary hypogonadism(confirmed morning Testosterone less than 250 ng/dL), compared to changes with placebo, or Testim (topical testosterone). The effects of Testim versus placebo on reproductive status will also be examined. Study subjects must not be currently using a topical testosterone.
Secondary Hypogonadism
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: topical testosterone|DRUG: Androxal
Change in Total Morning Testosterone, Changes in values from baseline in total morning testosterone levels at month 3 comparing Androxal 12.5 and 25 mg to placebo and Testim, 3 months
Change in Luteinizing Hormone Levels, Changes in values from baseline in LH at month 3, 3 months|Change in FSH After 3 Months of Treatment, 3 months|Reproductive Safety, Change from baseline in sperm concentration, 3 months
This study is a phase IIb, 4 arm study with three month active dosing period. Three of the four treatment groups will be randomized to either Androxal or placebo in a double-blind fashion, and the fourth treatment group will receive open-label Testim. The doses of Androxal in the blinded portion of the study will be 12.5 mg and 25 mg, in capsule form.
