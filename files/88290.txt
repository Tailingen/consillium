Multi-center Trial of ESK981 in Combination With Nivolumab in Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
The objective of the trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of ESK981 in combination with nivolumab therapy in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Renal Cell Carcinoma, Metastatic
DRUG: ESK981|DRUG: Nivolumab
1. The Percentage of Patients That Respond to Treatment With the Combination of ESK981 Monotherapy and Nivolumab Therapy (Cohort B)., The percentage of patients in Cohort B that achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Response will be assessed by combined Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and Immune-related (ir)RECIST., Up to 24 months after last dose of study treatment
The Percentage of Patients That Respond to Treatment With ESK981 Monotherapy (Cohort A)., The percentage of patients in Cohort A that achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Response will be assessed by RECIST v1.1., Up to 24 months after last dose of study treatment, 5 month treatment duration on average, no CR or PR responses were recorded.|Median Overall Survival Time, Overall survival time measured from start of treatment until up to 24 months after the last dose of study treatment in Cohort A (ESK981 monotherapy) and in Cohort B (combination of ESK981 and nivolumab therapy)., Up to 24 months after last dose of study treatment|Progression Free Survival Time, Measured from start of treatment to time of progression or death, or up to 24 months after the last dose of study treatment in Cohort A (ESK981 monotherapy) and in Cohort B (combination of ESK981 and nivolumab therapy). Disease progression will be assessed by RECIST v1.1 in Cohort A and by combined RECIST v1.1/irRECIST in Cohort B., Up to 24 months after last dose of study treatment|Duration of Therapy, Measured from the first to the last dose of study treatment in Cohort A (ESK981 monotherapy) and in Cohort B (combination of ESK981 and nivolumab therapy)., Up to approximately 24 months after treatment start|Duration of Response, Measured from the time of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. Response will be assessed by RECIST v1.1 (Cohort A) and by combined RECIST v1.1/irRECIST (Cohort B)., Up to 24 months after last dose of study treatment
The study was terminated early due to changes in the RCC treatment landscape which limited the patient population. Due to this early termination no subjects were enrolled into Cohort B.
