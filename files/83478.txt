The Efficacy and Safety of Lenalidomide Monotherapy in Red Blood Cell Transfusion Dependent Subjects With Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Associated With Del (5q) Abnormality
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of lenalidomide treatments to achieve haematopoietic improvement in subjects with low- or intermediate-1 risk International Prognostic Scoring System1 (IPSS) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) associated with a del (5q31-33) cytogenetic abnormality.
