The Effect of Ganoderma on Patients With Head-and-neck Cancer
To study the effect of Ganoderma Spores Powder Capsules on the life quality and immunity status of the patients with head-and-neck cancer after complete treatment (including surgery and / or radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy)
Head-and-neck Cancer
OTHER: Control group|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Ganoderma Spores Powder Capsules
Immune modulation such as tumor necrosis factors-Î± or interleukin-6, Subjects will be assigned to receive placebo/Ganoderma or Ganoderma Spores Powder Capsules twice a day for 12 weeks. Peripheral blood and saliva will be collected at 3 different times: (1)baseline data: before oral intervention, (2)outcome data: at 6 and 12 weeks post-oral intervention., Change from baseline in cytokines at 6 months
Life quality, Health and life quality will assessed by Quality of Life Questionnaire at three different times: (1)baseline data: before intervention, (2)outcome data: at 6 and 12 weeks post-oral intervention., Change from baseline in life quality at 6 months
Ganoderma is known to modulate immunity and improve health. However, the mechanism is not clear. We hypothesize that patients who have completed standard treatment with/without radiotherapy might require biological modifier such as Ganoderma to improve life quality and immunity status.

A total of 100 patients are randomized to study and control groups. In study group, Ganoderma Spores Powder Capsules are given to the patients for 6 weeks, In control group, only placebos are given during the same period. Then the patients in study and control groups are switched, Ganoderma Spores Powder Capsules and placebos are given for 6 weeks. The data pertaining to their Life quality are collected using Quality of Life Questionnaire after the first 6 weeks and the second 6 weeks. The immunity status is also studied at the same time.
