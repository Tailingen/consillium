Leukemia
DRUG: gemcitabine hydrochloride
confirmed response, Up to 20 weeks
overall survival, Up to 8 years|progression free survival, Up to 8 years|time to progression, Up to 8 years
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the rate and duration of complete and partial remission in patients with recurrent B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with gemcitabine. II. Assess the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a minimum of 3 courses. Patients achieving clinical complete remission, complete remission, nodular partial remission, or partial remission following 3 courses of therapy, receive 2 additional courses of therapy. Patients achieving complete remission or further improvement following the 2 additional courses of therapy, receive another 2 courses of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or relapse. Patients achieving complete remission are followed every 6 months for 1 year.
