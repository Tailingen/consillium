Vorinostat Plus FND in Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
1. Rationale In mantle cell lymphoma, the conventional chemotherapy achieves only temporary responses with a median duration of remissions only from 1 to 2 years. Therefore, mantle cell lymphoma is known as one of the B-cell lymphomas with poor prognosis. Although the treatment outcome of mantle cell lymphoma has been improved since intensive chemotherapy regimens such as HyperCVAD was used, a substantial number of patients are still frequently relapsed after chemotherapy. After relapse, most of them became refractory to various kinds of salvage treatment. That is why the results of most salvage chemotherapy regimens were disappointing. In addition, mantle cell lymphoma generally occurs in elderly people. Thus, intensive salvage chemotherapy may not be feasible for elderly patients. Therefore, an effective, novel combination treatment is urgently needed in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma patients.
2. Hypothesis

   * Vorinostat will produce synergism with a combination treatment regimen (Fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone, FND) without overlapping toxicity
   * Vorinostat maintenance treatment will reduce the relapse rate in patients ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation.
3. Purpose A phase II investigation to determin the effectiveness of vorinostat in combination with intravenous fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphomain patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Fludarabine, Mitoxantrone, Dexamethasone, Vorinostat
To determine the efficacy of vorinostat plus FND as an induction treatment confirmed by CT or MRI (PET/CT as indicated), B) Response criteria

1) Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all detectable clinical and radiographic evidence of disease 2) Partial response (PR): ≥50% decrease in sum of product diameter (SPD) of 6 nodes/nodal masses 3) Stable disease (SD): Disease status is less than PR, but is not PD 4) Progressive disease (PD): Appearance of any new lesions, A) After 8weeks and 16 weeks of the treatment
To determine the efficacy of vorinostat maintenance treatment, survival outcome and toxicity of vorinostat/FND measured by CT or MRI scan, CTCAE ver 4.0, A) Disease status evaluation every 3 months during the 1st two years after enrollment B) Monitoring survival status during the five years after enrollment C) Toxicity evaluation, every 3 months during the 1st two years after enrollment
