A Phase 1 Study of Pegilodecakin (LY3500518) in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pegilodecakin in participants with advanced solid tumors, dosed daily subcutaneously as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
