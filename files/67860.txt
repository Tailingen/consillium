Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Levels in Brain Tumor Patients
Objectives: This study is looking at the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) circulating in the blood stream of patients diagnosed with either a meningioma or a glioma. The questions that will be addressed include:

1. Can VEGF level alert us to tumor progression or recurrence before MRI changes occur?
2. Is the VEGF level an indicator of the response to treatment?
3. Does the VEGF level correlate with tumor histology and behavior?
4. Is there a relationship between VEGF level and outcome?
Glioma|Meningioma
PROCEDURE: Blood test
Determine if VEGF levels correlate with tumor progression or recurrence, every one to three months
Determine if the VEGF level is an indicator of the response to treatment., Every one to three months|Determine if the VEGF level correlates with tumor histology and behavior., Every one to three months|Determine if there is a relationship between VEGF level and outcome., Every one to three months
