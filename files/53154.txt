Effects of Weight on Inflammation and Colon Cancer Risk
An observational study designed to compare colonic cytokine concentrations in lean versus obese individuals
Colorectal Cancer
OTHER: no intervention
colonic concentration of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, time zero: at baseline|colonic concentration of Interleukin-6, time zero: at baseline|colonic concentration of Interleukin-1 beta, time zero: at baseline|colonic concentration of Interferon-gamma, time zero: at baseline
An observational study was performed on 43 individuals undergoing routine screening colonoscopy, some of whom were lean and some who were obese. They had weight, height, and waist-hip ratio measured at the time of colonoscopy and had additional colonic biopsies to measure colonic cytokines.
