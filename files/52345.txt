A Study of Multiple Immune and Disease Treatment Combinations in Participants With ER+HER2- Breast Cancer That Has Spread
The hypothesis of the CA048-001 Phase 1 clinical trial is targeting multiple mechanisms involved in generating and maintaining antitumor immune response will lead to a tolerable and robust anti-tumor response. This study utilizes an innovative clinical trial design to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of targeting multiple, distinct combination regimens that modulate several immune and non-immune mechanisms by escalating the number of therapies administered.
