A Study of CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN in Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
Multi-center, open-label, Phase 1 study of the safety, tolerability and feasibility of dosing patients harboring metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with genetically modified autologous T cells (CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cells) engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) capable of recognizing the tumor antigen prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and activating the T cell.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Anakinra
Dose Escalation: Dose Identification of CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN, Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Up to 2 years|Cohort Expansion: Safety of CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN, Percentage of patients experiencing adverse events (AEs), including serious and severe AEs overall, by dose level, and severity grade, Up to 2 years
Preliminary efficacy of CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN as assessed by biochemical Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of patients with maximal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of greater than or equal to 50% at 12 weeks post infusion, Up to 2 years|Feasibility of CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN, Proportion of patients who did not receive CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN cells, Up to 2 years|Peripheral expansion and persistence of CART-PSMA-TGFβRDN, Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Up to 15 years
This is a Phase 1 single-arm study designed to identify the dose and regimen of CART-PSMA- TGFβRDN cells that can be safely administered intravenously following the lymphodepletion (LD) regimen to patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Following Dose Escalation, a Cohort Expansion will enroll patients to further explore the safety and tolerability of the selected dose and schedule.

It is anticipated that up to 50 patients will enroll in this study in both dose escalation and cohort expansion.
