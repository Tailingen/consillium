Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: JNJ-87704916|DRUG: Cetrelimab
Part 1: Number of Participants with Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), The DLTs are specific adverse events and are defined as any of the following: non-hematological toxicity and hematologic toxicity., Up to 5 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. Severity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0. Severity scale ranges from Grade 1: mild, Grade 2: moderate, Grade 3: severe, Grade 4: life-threatening, and Grade 5: death related to adverse event., From first dose up to 100 days after last dose of study treatment (up to 5 years)
Parts 1 and 2: Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), OR is defined as the percentage of participants who have best response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Up to 5 years|Parts 1 and 2: Percentage of Participants With Disease Control (DC), DC is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved complete response, partial response, and stable disease according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 5 years|Parts 1 and 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR will be calculated among responders from the date of initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of relapse according to RECIST v1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years|Part 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from treatment initiation until disease progression or worsening or death due to any cause., From treatment initiation until disease progression or worsening or death due to any cause (up to 5 years)|Part 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from treatment initiation until death due to any cause., From treatment initiation until death due to any cause (up to 5 years)|Parts 1 and 2: Number of JNJ-87704916 Genome Copies per Milliliter, Viral genome copies of JNJ-87704916 collected from samples (that is, blood, urine, oral mucosa, injection sites, and dressings) will be determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays., Up to 5 years|Parts 1 and 2: Payload Concentrations of JNJ-87704916, Blood samples will be collected to characterize JNJ-87704916 payload concentrations in blood will be analyzed using immunoassay., Up to 2 years|Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants with JNJ-87704916 Antibodies, Antibodies against JNJ-87704916 encoded payloads and against herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) will be analyzed., Up to 2 years
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, feasibility, recommended dose(s) and regimen(s) of JNJ-87704916 as monotherapy and in combination with cetrelimab.
