Tobacco Cessation Care for Cancer Patients by Automated Interactive Outreach
This is a multi-arm, randomized controlled, pilot study which will recruit cancer patients who have been seen by a UCSF Cancer Center-affiliated clinical department to evaluate the efficacy of "CareConnect". This is the first study to assess the efficacy CareConnect, a combination of the Ask-Advise-Connect (AAC) with an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) delivering cancer-targeted educational messages to support referral to smoking cessation resources for patients with cancer.

BEHAVIORAL: CareConnect|OTHER: AutoReach|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen samples
Proportion of participants who report using any smoking cessation resources, Self-reported receipts (recorded as 'yes' or 'no') of evidence-based, smoking cessation services assessed at 3 months post-intervention will be reported as a proportion., Up to 3 months
Proportion of participants who started the call and chose the referrals, Proportion of participants who started the call and chose the referrals to quitline/speaking with a tobacco treatment specialist or to use smokefree.gov, Up to 3 months|Mean Satisfaction Ratings (CareConnect Group Only), Participants in the CareConnect intervention group will be asked to respond to the following single item to measure overall satisfaction with the CareConnect intervention from answers to the following question "How helpful was the call you received about tobacco use and cancer care?". The response to this single item is scored on a range from 0= 'Not at all helpful' to 4= 'Extremely helpful'. Higher scores indicate a greater degree of satisfaction., Up to 3 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate CareConnect's efficacy on referring patients to tobacco cessation resources.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate patients' acceptance of referrals.

II. To evaluate the acceptability of CareConnect.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. In-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews of 20 selectively chosen participants who completed the 3-month follow-up survey or finished the automated CareConnect or Auto-Reach call but may have refused to complete the 3-month follow-up survey (10 from each group).

II. Smoking cessation with verification.

OUTLINE:

Eligible participants, identified through the Cancer Center Tobacco Registry will be randomized to either the Intervention or Control arm on a 1:1 ratio. Participants who complete the first call of CareConnect or AutoReach will be considered enrolled. Participants will complete a baseline assessment, a 3-month assessment, and have option to provide a saliva sample.

For those who are selected to participate in an in-depth interview, this will take place within 1 month after the 3-month assessment. Data from the participants medical record may be accessed at 6 months post follow-up.
