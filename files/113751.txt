Timing of Start of systemIc Treatment for Asymptomatic Metastasized Pancreatic Cancer
Since patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer have a limited life expectancy, it is important to determine the timing of when to start chemotherapy in order to optimize the benefits of chemotherapy relative to the side effects. Therefore, two treatment strategies can be considered: chemotherapy started immediately at diagnosis, or delayed until disease-related symptoms occur.
