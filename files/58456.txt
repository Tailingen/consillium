TPST-1120 as Monotherapy and in Combination With Nivolumab in Subjects With Advanced Cancers
This is a phase 1/1b open label, multicenter dose escalation and dose expansion study to investigate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of TPST-1120, a small molecule selective antagonist of PPARα (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) as monotherapy and in combination with a systemic anticancer agent, nivolumab, an anti-PD1 antibody, in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

This is a phase 1/1b open label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of TPST-1120, a small molecule selective antagonist of PPARα (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) in adult subjects with selected advanced solid tumors. TPST-1120 will be administered as monotherapy and in combination with a systemic anticancer agent, nivolumab, an anti-PD1 antibody, in subjects with advanced solid tumors. This trial is composed of dose escalation and dose expansion cohorts.
