The aim of this study is the safety and efficacy of cryosurgery plus NK immunotherapy to advanced NSCLC.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic
DEVICE: Cryosurgery|BIOLOGICAL: NK Immunotherapy
Relief degree, It will be evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors（RECIST）, 3 months
Progress free survival（PFS）, 1 year|Overall survival（OS）, 3 years
By enrolling patients with NSCLC adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the safety and the short and long term efficacy of the combined therapy using cryosurgery and nature killer (NK) cells for NSCLC.

The safety will be evaluated by statistics of adverse reactions. The efficacy will be evaluated according to local relief degree, progress free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
