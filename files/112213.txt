Cold Plasma for the Reduction of Lymphoceles Following PLND
This study protocol will evaluate the efficacy of Bovie Medical's J-Plasma® helium based plasma technology in the reduction of lymphoceles following pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) during robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). The J-Plasma® handpiece will be used during the PLND by dissecting the lymph nodes and sealing the lymphatic channels to prevent lymph leakage.
Lymphoceles Following Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection
DEVICE: J-Plasma
Number of Participants With Incidence of Lymphocele Formation, The primary outcome to be measured will be the incidence of lymphocele formation as diagnosed upon post- operative abdominal ultrasound., 12 weeks
Participants evaluated and scheduled for a PLND during Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy who have met the study inclusion criteria and who have also given informed consent will be enrolled. Enrolled participants will have their PLND performed using J-Plasma® for dissection and sealing of lymphatic channels. An abdominal-pelvic ultrasound will be completed at a follow-up period ranging from 4-12 weeks post operatively to determine if a lymphocele is present. The occurrence rate of lymphoceles in this trial group will be compared to retrospective data from the principal investigator's practice and other published data to determine if the occurrence rate has been reduced.
