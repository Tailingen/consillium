Adaptive Individualized High-Dose Radiotherapy Analysis-REctum-1 (AIDA-RE-1)
Aim of the study is to evaluate achievement of complete pathologic response (pCR) in high-risk rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant concomitant chemotherapy plus adaptive-intensity modulated imaging-guided radiotherapy

complete pathological response (pCR), pCR is defined as ypT0N0, 6 weeks
Acute toxicity, Acute toxicity is evaluated using CTCAE criteria, 6 months|Quality of Life (QoL), QoL is evaluated using EORTC QoL questionnaire, 1 year|Late toxicity, Late toxicity is evaluated using CTCAE criteria, 1 year|Dosimetric advantage of GTV-boost reduction, Dosimetric advantage is evaluated using DVHs (Dose Volume Histograms), 6 weeks|Evaluation of PET-response as predictive factor, Correlation between SUV (Standardized Uptake Value) and pathological response, 1 year
AIDA-RE-1 is an interventional prospective trial for the treatment of locally advanced high-risk rectal cancer. In neoadjuvant setting, patients are treated with standard chemotherapy plus experimental radiotherapy. The total dose to clinical target volume (CTV, rectum and locoregional lymph nodes) is 45 Gy, with a concomitant boost of 5 Gy to gross tumor volume (GTV), delivered with IMRT-SIB (intensity modulated radiotherapy-simultaneous integrated boost) technique in 25 fractions. After 2 weeks of treatment, patients are evaluated with 18 FDG-PET and sequential boost of 5 Gy (in 2 fractions) is planned.
