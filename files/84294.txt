Study of Thymosin α1 to Reduce Acute Pneumonia For Bulky None-small Cell Lung Cancer
This Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of Thymosin α1 on the frequency of acute pneumonia in non-small cell lung cancer with bulky tumor.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Concurrent chemotherapy|RADIATION: split-course radiotherapy|DRUG: thymosin alpha 1
Incidence of ≥grade 2 radiation pneumonitis (CTCAE 5.0 version), Radiation-induced pneumonitis except other reasons induced pneumonia, 1-year
Total lymphocyte count, From the beginning of CCRT until 6 months after the completion of CCRT.|C-reaction protein, From the beginning of CCRT until 6 months after the completion of CCRT.|grade of pulmonary fibrosis (CTCAE 5.0 version), 1-year
Alpha diversity of gut microbiota as the exploratory outcome, From baseline to the end of CCRT, an average of 2 months
This Phase II study is to determine the efficacy of Thymosin α1 on the frequency of radiation pneumonitis in non-small cell lung cancer with bulky tumor.

All patients received four cycles of weekly docetaxel (25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin (25mg/㎡)(DP), each of 1 day's duration, combined with split-course thoracic radiotherapy of 51 Gy in 17 fractions or 40 Gy in 10 fractions as the first course followed by a break of four weeks. Patients without disease progression had a dose of 15 Gy in 5 fractions or 24 Gy in 6 fractions as a boost. Patients were further treated with subcutaneous injections of thymosin once a week,1.6mg each time from the start of radiation to 2 months after the end of radiation. Toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE v. 4.0.
