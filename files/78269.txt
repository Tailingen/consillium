Neoadjuvant Radiation in Locally Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether neoadjuvant radiation therapy is effective in improving local-regional control and to explore predictors of response to treatment in inoperable breast cancer patients after 2-6 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Neoplasms
RADIATION: Neoadjuvant radiotherapy
Pathological response rate, only for operable patients, 1 year|Fbjective response rate(ORR), for inoperable patients, 3 year|Event free survival(EFS), for all patients, 3 year
Time to progression, including local-regional recurrence, disease-free survival, overall survival, 3 year|Radiation Toxicity, using CTCAE 4.0 and RTOG classification, 6 months
Biologic predictor for treatment response, biopsies of the original tumor before treatment for future molecular biology studies in LABC, before treatment|The role of ultrasound in predicting treatment response, shear wave elastography(SWE) technology, before and 1 month after treatment
RATIONALE: The optimal management of patients with locally advanced breast cancer(LABC) remains unknown. It is currently accepted that the administration of radiation therapy prior to surgery might result in higher surgery rate or improvement of clinical outcomes.

OUTLINEï¼š This is a prospective phase II study. The purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of neoadjuvant radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy. The primary objective in this study is to assess clinical outcomes of these patients. A secondary objective in this study is to identify biomarkers and imaging parameters that can be used as early predictors of treatment response in women with locally advanced breast cancer. Fresh tumor tissue or fresh peripheral blood should be collected as the test sample and stored before treatment. Ultrasound spectroscopy including shear wave elastography parameters should be done before and after treatment.
