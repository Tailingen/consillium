This is a non-blinded, randomized control trial to determine the feasibility of a hybrid-model, prehabilitation program for participants diagnosed with rectal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or radiation) before surgical resection. Investigators hope that prehabilitation will result in improved outcomes after surgery.

Participants will be randomized into one of the study groups: Group A: prehabilitation program, or Group B: usual care. Randomization means that a participant is placed into a group by chance.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, in-clinic visits, physical exams, exercise training, blood tests, and questionnaires.

It is expected that about 40 participants will take part in this research study.
