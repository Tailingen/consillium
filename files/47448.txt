Application of Serum Bile Acid Profile in the Diagnosis of Gastric Cancer
In this study, the composition and level of serum bile acids in patients with gastric cancer and non-gastric cancer were analyzed by detecting the serum bile acid profile, so as to develop new serological diagnostic methods for early diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer.
