Partial Breast Irradiation in a Low-risk Population Screened With MRI
This is a pilot study to determine if partial breast irradiation (PBI) limited to the region of the tumor bed following lumpectomy in patients screened with MRI provides historically similar rates of local failure, limited acute skin toxicity, late complications and cosmetic outcome when compared to patients treated with standard 3D-CRT to the whole breast.

RADIATION: Partial Breast Irradiation
Rates of toxicity (breast edema/pain, hyperpigmentation, erythema) for patients receiving partial breast irradiation (PBI) compared to historical rates of toxicity of patients receiving whole breast irradiation (WBI), During radiation therapy (5-10 days)|Rates of toxicity (breast edema/pain, hyperpigmentation, erythema) for patients receiving PBI compared to historical rates of toxicity of patients receiving WBI, Post therapy (until death)
Survival Rates, 5 years|Cosmetic outcomes of breast PBI, Comparison of cosmetic results (appearance, size, shape, texture, scaring) of breast treated with PBI to untreated breast., 3 years
