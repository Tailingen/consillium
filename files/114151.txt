A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of ONO-4538 in Combination With Ipilimumab and Chemotherapy in Chemotherapy-naïve Participants With HER2-negative Unresectable Advanced or Recurrent Gastric Cancer (Including Esophagogastric Junction Cancer)
This study is to compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of ONO-4538 in combination with ipilimumab and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy in chemotherapy-naïve participants with HER2-negative unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer (including esophagogastric junction cancer).
