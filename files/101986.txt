Study of EGFRBi Armed Fresh PBMC in Metastatic or Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to understand the safety and estimate the efficacy of combining anti-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) x anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) bispecific antibody fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (EGFR FPBMC) for patients with relapsed and/or refractory pancreas cancer. Participants receive 8 weekly doses and then 8 more doses every 2 weeks of EGFR FPBMC by intravenous infusion.
Pancreas Cancer|Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: EGFR FPBMC
Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the dose escalation phase (during the first 8 infusions only), As defined in the protocol, Through the dose escalation phase (during the first 8 infusions only, about 8 weeks after starting study treatment))
Overall Response Rate, Number/Percentage of participants that have a partial or complete response to study treatment, Through the dose escalation phase (during the first 8 infusions only, about 8 weeks after starting study treatment))|Progression free survival, Time from start of treatment to time of progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Through 3 years after last infusion for each participant (a maximum of about 3 1/2 years)|Overall Survival, Time from start of treatment to time of death from any cause., Through 3 years after last infusion for each participant (a maximum of about 3 1/2 years)|Specific cytotoxicity by PBMCs against pancreatic cancer cell lines, In blood samples, Before study treatment, about 8-9 weeks into study treatment, then 30-45 days, 6 months and 12 months after completion of study treatment|Development of antibodies to pancreatic cancer antigens, In blood samples, Before study treatment, about 8-9 weeks into study treatment, then 30-45 days, 6 months and 12 months after completion of study treatment|Survival of EGFR FPBMCs after multiple infusions, In blood samples, Prior to study treatment, prior to each of the first 5 infusions, (optionally) about 1-2 days after each of the first 8 infusions, and about 8-10 weeks after starting study treatment
Once subjects are determined to be eligible, white blood cells (lymphocytes) are collected via leukapheresis procedure. The T cells in the mononuclear cells are coated with bispecific antibody to activate the T cells and the mononuclear cells are reinfused into the patients so the T cells can multiply and kill tumors.

About 72 hours after the leukapheresis procedure, EGFR FPBMC infusions will start. After about 8-9 weeks, participants will have another leukapheresis procedure and then receive doses every 2 weeks for 8 more doses. Before, throughout and following EGFR FPBMC, research blood will be collected to better understand immune response. Disease status will be checked regularly during and after study treatment.
