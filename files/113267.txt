A Study of DKN-01 in Combination With Paclitaxel or Pembrolizumab
A study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DKN-01 in combination with weekly paclitaxel or pembrolizumab in participants with relapsed or refractory Esophagogastric Malignancies
Esophageal Neoplasms|Adenocarcinoma of the Gastroesophageal Junction|Gastroesophageal Cancer|Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: DKN-01 150 mg|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: DKN-01 300 mg
Number of subjects with dose limiting toxicities in each treatment arm, Baseline to End of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days, except each cycle is 21 days when DKN-01 is administered with pembrolizumab)|Number of subjects with treatment emergent adverse events related to study treatment (DKN-01 as monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel or pembrolizumab), Baseline until 30 days after last dose of study drug
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Baseline to study completion (approximately 3 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), Baseline to study completion (approximately 3 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Baseline to study completion (approximately 3 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Baseline to study completion (approximately 3 months)
This is a dose-escalating, open-label study conducted in multiple parts (Part A dose-escalation, Parts B-F expansion cohorts, and a monotherapy substudy). Parts A-E (DKN-01 plus paclitaxel) and the DKN-01 monotherapy substudy includes 28-day cycle treatment cycles; Part F (DKN-01 plus pembrolizumab) includes 21-day treatment cycles. Depending on their cancer type, subjects with histologically confirmed recurrent or refractory esophageal, gastro-esophageal junction tumors, or gastric adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in each study part to receive DKN-01 150 mg or 300 mg in combination with paclitaxel or pembrolizumab. Subjects who are unable to receive paclitaxel or pembrolizumab for any reason are allowed to receive single agent DKN-01 300 mg as part of a monotherapy substudy. Results are reported by treatment group, irrespective of the study part in which the subject was enrolled.
