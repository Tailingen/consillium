Dose Escalation Study of a PD1-LAG3 Bispecific Antibody in Patients With Advanced and/or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, Phase I multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study of RO7247669, an anti PD-1 (programmed death-1) and LAG-3 (Lymphocyte-activation gene 3) bispecific antibody, for participants with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors. This study aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or define the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of RO7247669, and to evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity in participants with solid tumors. An expansion part of the study is planned to enroll tumor-specific cohorts to evaluate anti-tumor activity of the MTD and/or RP2D of RO7247669 and to confirm safety and tolerability in participants with selected tumor types.
