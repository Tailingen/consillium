Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Treating Patients With Liver Metastases, Lung Metastases, or Other Advanced Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiosurgery delivers x-rays directly to the tumor and may cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating patients who have liver metastases, lung metastases, or other advanced solid tumors.
Metastatic Cancer|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
RADIATION: stereotactic radiosurgery
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the feasibility of fractionated stereotactic body radiosurgery in patients with advanced extracranial tumors.
* Assess the toxicities of this treatment regimen in these patients.
* Determine tumor response and cause of death in these patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: Patients receive fractionated stereotactic body radiosurgery over 30 minutes for 5-10 days for a total of 3 treatments.

Patients are followed every 3 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-25 patients will be accrued within 2-3 years.
