DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: IRX-2 Regimen
Phase 1 - Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD of combination of the IRX-2 regimen and durvalumab as outlined in treatment arm., Up to 12 months
Phase 2 - Objective Clinical Response Rate, Response to combination of the IRX-2 regimen and durvalumab . Objective response will be documented using standard Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria., Up to 12 months post treatment|Phase 2 - Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival of IRX-Dura treatment participants at six months.

Progression free survival is defined as the time from Day 1 of treatment to evidence of progression. Progression will be defined by RECIST v 1.1., Up to 12 months post treatment|Median Overall Survival (OS), Median Overall Survival of IRX-Dura treatment participants. OS: The length of time from the start of treatment that participants are still alive., Up to 12 months post treatment
Study Population:

Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity, oropharynx, paranasal sinuses, hypopharynx, or larynx that is not amenable to local therapy with curative intent.
