Observational, non-interventional, retrospective, multicentre study focusing on the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab as monotherapy and nivolumab in combination with brentuximab vedotin in daily clinical practice in patients with Primary Mediastinal B Cell Lymphoma Relapsed/Refractory. The study aims to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy in terms of overall response rate (ORR, sum of complete response rate \[CR\] and partial response rate \[PR\]) of pembrolizumab as a single agent and nivolumab in combination with brentuximab vedotin in patients with Primary Mediastinal B Cell Lymphoma Relapsed/RefractoryL treated in a real-life setting from November 2020 until November 2021.

Secondary objectives

* To assess efficacy, in terms of:
* Duration of response (DoR)
* Progression-free survival (PFS)
* Overall survival (OS)
* Disease-free survival (DFS)
* Best response rate (achieved at any time during treatment)
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab as a single agent and nivolumab in combination with brentuximab vedotin The study will include patients with Primary Mediastinal B Cell Lymphoma Relapsed/Refractory treated with pembrolizumab as a single agent and nivolumab in combination with brentuximab vedotin in a real-life setting from November 2020 until November 2021.
