Phase II Study of RT-PEPC in Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Primary Objective:

Evaluate the clinical activity of the RT-PEPC combination regimen (rituximab, thalidomide, and prednisone, etoposide, procarbazine, cyclophosphamide) in patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma. Specifically, response rate (RR) and time to disease progression (TTP) will be assessed.

Secondary Objectives:

1. Assess the toxicity profiles of RT-PEPC treatment in patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.
2. Prospectively characterize the angiogenic profile of patients with mantle cell lymphoma during treatment with RT-PEPC. The dynamics of the angiogenic profile will be correlated with clinical response to RT-PEPC therapy.
3. Assess the quality of life of patients receiving RT-PEPC treatment
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: PEPC|DRUG: Thalidomide|DRUG: Rituximab
Overall Survival and Progression Free Survival, measured by overall Response Rate (ORR), which includes Complete response and partial response., 38 months
Asses the Toxicity Profiles, Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0., 38 months|Dynamic Levels of Plasma VEGF, Stromal angiogenesis was assessed using blood vascular and perivascular markers, including VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, CD34, and a-SMA, as well as lymphatic vascular markers ofVEGFR-3, podoplanin, and Lyve-1., 38 months|The Quality of Life (QoL) of Patients Receiving RT-PEPC Treatment, QoL assessments were obtained with version 3 of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) instrument. The FACT-G is comprised of four subscales: physical well-being (7-items, score range 0-28), social/family well-being (7-items, score range 0-28), emotional well-being (6-items, score range 0-24), and functional well-being (7-items, score range 0-28). Users of the FACT-G are able to generate an overall score and four subscale scores with ranges and distributions that are sample-specific. All questions in the FACT-G use a 5-point rating scale (0 = Not at all to 4 = Very much) A higher number indicates a better Quality of Life, and has a possible range of 0-108 points.

ANOVA was used to compare the difference in the means of total score among the different time points (baseline, every 2M until 6M, and every 6M until PD). The mean of the total FACT-G scores at baseline and mean of total score at all timepoints (using ANOVA) are reported below., baseline, every 2 months until Month 6, and every 6 months until disease progression
