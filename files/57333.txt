Sitravatinib and Tislelizumab in Patients With Metastatic Uveal Melanoma With Liver Metastases.
SITISVEAL stablish the hypothesis that treatment with Tislelizumab + Sitravatinib will increase the Objective Response Rate in patients with Metastatic Uveal Melanoma (mUM) with liver metastases, compared with the current standard of care.

This is a non-randomized, single arm, multicenter, phase II study of Sitravatinib in combination with Tislelizumab in subjects with metastatic uveal melanoma and liver metastases. After informed consent is obtained, subjects will enter in the Screening phase to assess eligibility criteria and perform a mandatory tumor biopsy. Upon meeting criteria, eligible subjects will be entered into the Treatment phase. Patients will receive Sitravatinib 100 mg orally once daily in combination with tislelizumab 200 mg IV once every 3 weeks until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, or consent withdrawal, whichever occurs first. Treatment may be continued after progression according to physician criteria (with previous consultation with Coordinating investigator) until patients no longer receive clinical benefit.
Uveal Melanoma
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Sitravatinib Malate
Objective Response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with at least one visit response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) that is confirmed at least 4 weeks later according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria., Throughout the study period, approximately 1 year per patient
Progression Free Survival (PFS), For this protocol, PFS is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment until objective tumor progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or death, whichever occurs first., Throughout the study period, approximately 1 year per patient|Overall survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment until death from any cause. Those patients that do not present a death event or are lost to follow up will be censored at the date of the last contact., Throughout the study period, approximately 1 year per patient|Frequency of Adverse Reactions, Percentage of patients who experienced an adverse reaction, Throughout the study period, approximately 1 year per patient
