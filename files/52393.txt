Acquired Resistant Mechanism of the First-generation EGFR TKIs
Patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring sensitive epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations invariably develop acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Identification of actionable genetic mutations can be helpful for guiding the subsequent treatment. This study aimed to analyze the genetic profile of NSCLC harboring acquired resistance to the first-generation EGFR TKIs using next generation sequencing (NGS).
