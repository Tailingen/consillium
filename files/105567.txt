Daratumumab Retreatment in Participants With Multiple Myeloma Who Have Been Previously Treated With Daratumumab
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy (rate of very good partial response \[VGPR\] or better as best response as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group \[IMWG\] criteria) of daratumumab subcutaneous (Dara-SC) in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) with the efficacy of Kd in participants with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma who were previously exposed to daratumumab to evaluate daratumumab retreatment.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved partial response (PR) or better responses based on the computerized algorithm, in accordance with the IMWG criteria, during or after the study treatment but before the start of subsequent anti-myeloma therapy. IMWG criteria for PR: greater than or equal to (\>=)50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or less than (\<)200 mg/24 hours; If the serum and urine M-protein were not measurable, a decrease of \>=50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels was required in place of the M-protein criteria; If serum and urine M-protein were not measurable, and serum free light assay is also not measurable, \>=50% reduction in bone marrow plasma cells (PCs) was required in place of M-protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was \>=30%; additionally, if present at baseline, \>=50% reduction in the size of soft tissue PCs was also required., Up to 3 years and 7 months|Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Better, Percentage of participants achieving CR or better were reported. CR or better rate was defined as the percentage of participants achieving CR or sCR based on the computerized algorithm, according to IMWG response criteria. IMWG criteria for CR: Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, and Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas (PCs), and \<5% PCs in bone marrow., Up to 3 years and 7 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization to either progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever comes first. IMWG criteria for PD: \>=25% from lowest response level in serum M-component (the absolute increase must be \>=0.5 gram per deciliter \[g/dL\]) and/or in urine M-component (the absolute increase must be \>=200 mg/24 hour); only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: increase of \>=25% in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain levels and the absolute increase must be \>10 mg/dL. BMPC%: the absolute % must be \>=10%; definite increase in size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas; development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \>11.5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 2.65 millimoles per liter \[mmol/L\]) that can be attributed solely to PC proliferative disorder., Up to 3 years and 7 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the participant's death due to any cause., Up to 3 years and 7 months|Percentage of Participants With Negative Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), Percentage of participants with negative MRD were reported. MRD negativity rate, defined as the percentage of participants who had MRD negative status at 10\^-5 by bone marrow aspirate after the date of randomization and prior to PD or subsequent anti-myeloma therapy., Up to 3 years and 7 months|Time to Next Treatment, Time to next treatment was defined as the time from randomization to the start of the next-line treatment., Up to 3 years and 7 months|Serum Concentrations of Daratumumab, Serum concentrations of daratumumab were assessed. This outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for specified arm only., Day 1 of Cycles 1, 3, and 7 (each cycle of 28 days) and Follow Up (post treatment Week 8; up to 30.3 months)|Number of Participants With Anti-recombinant Human Hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) Antibodies, The incidence of anti-rHuPH20 antibodies were summarized for all participants who received at least one dose of Dara-SC and had appropriate plasma samples for detection of antibodies to rHuPH20 (at least 1 sample after the start of the first dose of Dara-SC). This outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for specified arm only., Up to end of study; up to 30.3 months|Number of Participants With Anti-Daratumumab Antibodies, Number of participants who test positive for anti-daratumumab antibodies were reported. This outcome measure was planned to be analyzed for specified arm only., Up to end of study; up to 30.3 months
For relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, the treatment is determined on an individual basis. Common standard of care regimens use either a proteasome inhibitor (PI) or an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) in combination with dexamethasone with or without a monoclonal antibody (mAb) such as daratumumab. After relapse from PIs or IMiDs, patients are often retreated with drugs that have same mechanism of action to which they have been sensitive. The disease becomes refractory and all effective treatment options are exhausted. Daratumumab is a human IgG1 mAb that binds with high affinity to unique epitope on cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) and attacks tumor cells that overexpress CD38. Study is to determine the efficacy of Dara-SC in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone (DKd) in adult participants with relapsed refractory MM who had 1 to 3 prior line(s) of treatment including a line containing daratumumab to evaluate daratumumab retreatment. The MM treatment is determined on an individual basis where patient's age, prior therapy, bone marrow function, co-morbidities, patient preference and time to relapse are considered. Common standard of care regimens use either PI or an IMiD in combination with dexamethasone with or without a mAb. It is a targeted immunotherapy that attacks tumor cells that overexpress CD38, a transmembrane glycoprotein, in a variety of hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: Screening (28 days), Treatment, and Follow-Up. Assessments like chest X-ray, spirometry test, electrocardiogram (ECG), will be performed during Screening phase. During the Treatment Phase, participants will be randomized to receive Kd or DKd. Efficacy assessments like bone marrow examination will be performed. Follow-up will continue until the end of study.
