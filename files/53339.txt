Bortezomib in Treating Children With Advanced Solid Tumors
Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating children who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded to previous treatment.
Unspecified Childhood Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: bortezomib|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis|OTHER: pharmacological study
MTD defined as the dose at which fewer than 20% of patients experience DLT assessed using CTC version 2.0, 3 weeks|20S proteasome inhibition, The 95% confidence interval for the percent of patients who exhibit inhibition at a recommended dose level determined according to the table above is 61%-100%, if six patients are evaluated or 55%-100% if five patients are evaluated., Up to 2 weeks|Progression free survival, Up to 24 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib in pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors.

II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and other toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

III. Preliminarily determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. If dose-limiting toxicity in the form of myelosuppression occurs in stratum I, dose escalation continues with patients meeting the qualifications for stratum II.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
