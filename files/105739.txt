Glioma Brain Tumours - E12513 - SensiScreen Glioma
Validation of a new platform for the molecular characterization of patients affected by glioma. The new platform includes a series of faster, less expensive real-time PCR methodologies that, in comparison to standard analyses (DS, MS-PCR), are also characterized by higher sensitivity and consequently can be able to identify mutations in ctDNA extracted from liquid biopsies as well. The development of these assays will allow the analysis of molecular markers alteration even in liquid biopsies, providing a less invasive sampling than tissue biopsies, a procedure that sometimes is characterized by side effects or that allow the collection of few tissues for the histological and molecular diagnosis.

This study will not interfere with the patients routine treatment pathway and there will be no deviation from the standard of care: the molecular characterization of the tissues will be performed according to the standard diagnostic routine using the currently approved methodologies. For the retrospective study, it will be used the left-over DNA. For the cohort, that includes the collection and the subsequent analysis of liquid biopsies (prospective study), blood and CSF will be sampled during surgery.

The mutations in the molecular markers will be analyzed in tissue as well as in plasma and CFS samples by the new real-time based assays. Then, the qualitative and quantitative values obtained on liquid biopsies with the new methodology will be compared to the results of the standard methodologies already obtained, for diagnostic routine, on surgical tissue samples of the same patients.
