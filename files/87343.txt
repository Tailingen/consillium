A Prospective Clinical Study of Ruxolitinib and Etoposide Combined With DDGP Regimen (RUE-DDGP) in Induction Therapy of T/NK Cell Lymphoma-associated Hemophagocytic Syndrome.
To observe the efficacy and safety of Ruxolitinib and Etoposide combined with DDGP regimen ( cis-Platinum, Dexamethasone, Gemcitabine and Pegaspargase) in the first-line induction therapy of T cell lymphoma and NK/T cell lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic syndrome.
Hemophagocytic Syndrome|T/NK-Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Ruxolitinib, Etoposide, Dexamethasone, Gemcitabine, Pegaspargase, cis-platinum
ORR of hemophagocytic syndrome, Objective remission rate of hemophagocytic syndrome, 28 days
PFS, Progression-free survival, up to 24 months|ORR of lymphoma, Objective remission rate of lymphoma, up to 24 months|OS, Overall Survival, up to 24 months|ADR, Adverse Reaction Rate, up to 24 months
This is an open, one-arm, prospective clinical collaborative study. This study is aimed to observe the efficacy and safety of the new combined therapy of Ruxolitinib and Etoposide combined with DDGP regimen ( cis-Platinum, Dexamethasone, Gemcitabine and Pegaspargase) in the first-line induction therapy patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. A total of 30 patients plan to participate in the study. The primary endpoint is objective remission rate (ORR) of hemophagocytic syndrome, and the secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS) , objective remission rate (ORR) of lymphoma, overall survival (OS), and adverse events(ADR).
