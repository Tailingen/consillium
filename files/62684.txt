Culturally Tailored Nurse Coaching Study for Cancer Symptom Management
The purpose of the study is to see whether or not a telephone/ text message intervention, delivered by a registered nurse, is helpful in managing symptoms and can also prevent dehydration caused by chemotherapy treatment when given together for patients with metastatic breast, colon, lung or prostate cancer.
