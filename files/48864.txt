Influence of Rifampin on the Pharmacokinetics of Romidepsin in Patients With Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of multiple doses of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of romidepsin after a single intravenous (IV) infusion.
Hematologic Malignancy|Malignant Lymphoma
DRUG: Romidepsin|DRUG: Rifampin
Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time-curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-t)of Romidepsin, AUC0-t: area under the plasma concentration time-curve from Time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (Ct), calculated by linear trapezoidal method when concentrations are increasing and the logarithmic trapezoidal method when concentrations are decreasing., Days 1 and 8; at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time-curve From Time 0 to 24-hour (AUC0-24) for Romidepsin, Individual and mean romidepsin plasma concentrations by treatment and scheduled time data were collected. AUC0-24: area under the plasma concentration time-curve from Time 0 to 24 hours, calculated by linear trapezoidal method when concentrations are increasing and the logarithmic trapezoidal method when concentrations are decreasing., Day 1 and Day 8; at 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Area Under the Plasma Concentration Time-curve From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-∞)., AUC0-∞: area under the plasma concentration time-curve from Time 0 extrapolated to infinity, calculated as \[AUCt + Ct/λz\]. λz is the apparent terminal rate constant. No AUC extrapolation was performed with unreliable λz. If the percentage of AUC extrapolated is ≥ 25%, AUC0-∞ will not be reported., Days 1 and 8; at 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax)of Romidepsin, Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax)was obtained directly from the observed concentration versus time data., Days 1 and 8; at 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Time to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Time to maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax) was obtained directly from the observed concentration versus time data., Days 1 and 8; at 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Estimate of the Terminal Elimination Half-life in Plasma (t1/2), The terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) in plasma, was calculated as \[(ln 2)/λz\]. This was only calculated when a reliable estimate for λz could be obtained., Days 1 and 8; at 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Clearance (CL): Apparent Total Plasma Clearance., The apparent total plasma clearance (CL) was calculated as \[Dose/AUC0-∞\] for Romidepsin alone and co-administered with rifampin plasma concentrations., Days 1 and 8; at 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.|Apparent Total Volume of Distribution (Vz)., Apparent total volume of distribution (Vz) was calculated as \[(CL)/λz\] for Romidepsin and co-administered with Rifampin., Days 1 and 8; at 0 (predose), 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours (end of infusion) and at 4.25, 4.5, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the initiation of IV infusion.
Summary of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), AEs were considered related if assessed by the Investigator as possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug. Serious AEs (SAEs) are those that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or resulted in an important medical event that may have jeopardized the patient or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above., Day 1 up to Day 36 (28 days after the last treatment)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of multiple doses of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of romidepsin after a single intravenous (IV) infusion.
