Prospective Translational Study Investigating Possible Molecular prEdictors of Resistance to First-Line pazopanIb
This is a prospective, single-arm, monocentric translational study designed to evaluate possible biomarkers of resistance to the first line of therapy with pazopanib in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) who have not received systemic therapy in both the adjuvant and metastatic phases.
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Pazopanib
A panel of possible predictive candidate biomarkers of resistance to anti-angiogenic targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), using next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods for future research. This will be done by within-patient comparison of metastatic tissue samples taken on commencement of first-line pazopanib, and secondly on development of TKI resistance, 18 months|The Overall Response Rate (ORR), evaluate per RECIST v.1.1 criteria in mRCC patients treated with first-line pazopanib in order to either correlate circulating angiogenic factors (CAFs) levels and gene candidate biomarkers status to clinical outcome when resistance develops, 18 months
Identification of other protein markers circulating in blood,, To obtain serial blood samples from patients whilst they are being treated with pazopanib, 18 months|compare the frequency of previously defined promising circulating predictive biomarkers for pazopanib treatment, between blood samples taken at commencement of therapy (baseline) and at the time of progressive disease (PD) as per RECIST 1.1 criteria as well as changes of interleukin 8 (IL-8), c-Met and hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) expression between metastatic tumour tissue samples in order to better understand changes in the tumor and in the levels of circulating angiogenic factors as resistance develops., 18 months|Collect Data, prospective and retrospective demographic, clinical and pathological data on patients who enter the study, enabling current and future correlation of biomarkers to clinical outcomes, 18 months|Perform subgroup analyses, comparing the tissue and blood biomarkers identified in patients who developed secondary resistance with those biomarkers identified in patients who have primary resistance., 18 months
