A Study to Assess Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) Expression in Cytological Versus Histological Lung Cancer Specimens
The primary purpose of this non-interventional, multinational study is to assess the feasibility of assessing PD-L1 protein expression on cytological samples as a surrogate for histological samples obtained from participants with any stage of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
