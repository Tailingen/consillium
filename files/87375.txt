Effect of FAS and FAS Ligand Polymorphisms on Patients With Platinum-Based -Treated Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
To Study the Effect of Polymorphisms in Fas Ligand Gene Promoter Region (rs 763110) and Fas gene (rs1800682) on Platinum-Based regimens used in treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM)
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
response rate, Tumor response will be evaluated after the third (initial evaluation response) and the sixth (confirmation of initial response) chemotherapy cycle according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Patients will be assigned to one of following groups: complete response (CR), Partial response (PR), Stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD)., After 6 cycles of chemotherapy (each cycle is 21 days )
progression free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) time is defined as the time from day 1 of chemotherapy to the day of documented disease progression or to death from any cause, one year|overall survival (OS), time is defined as the time from day 1 of chemotherapy to death from any cause., one year|estimation of treatment related toxicity, Hematologic (anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) and non hematologic (nausea/vomiting, alopecia and nephrotoxicity) toxicities will be evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria. The worst degree of toxicity experienced throughout the treatment is used for the analysis. Toxicities of grade 2 or higher will be considered as clinically relevant., during the chemotherapy period, average duration 4 months
This study tries to find a correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) found in promoter region of Fas Ligand gene (rs 763110) and Fas (rs1800682) and clinical outcome on patients with MPM treated with platinum-Based agents as first line. the patients will have one of three following genotypes : Thymine/Thymine, Thymine/Cytosine or Cytosine/Cytosine (for Fas ligand polymorphism) and Adenine/Adenine, Adenine/Guanine or Guanine/Guanine ( for Fas polymorphism).
