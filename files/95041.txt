NX in Luminal B Breast Cancer Patients After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
This is a prospective, randomized, open-lable phase III clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness and safety of vinorelbine plus capecitabine as adjuvant treatment for non-pCR Luminal B breast cancer patients after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Vinorelbine
Disease free survival, The length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer, 5-year
Overall survival, Overall survival is calculated from randomization to death from any cause., 5-year
This is a prospective ,randomized, open-lable phase III clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness and safety of vinorelbine plus capecitabine as adjuvant treatment for non-pCR Luminal B breast cancer patients after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Non-pCR Luminal B patients who completed 6-8 cycles of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be included in this study and receive 4 cycles of NX regimen chemotherapy for 4 cycles (vinorelbine 25 mg/m² d1,8 and capecitabine 1250 mg/m² d1-14, every 3 weeks) or not. the investigator's primary endpoint is disease free survival (DFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), recurrence free survival (RFS), distant disease free survival (DDFS)rates and safety.
