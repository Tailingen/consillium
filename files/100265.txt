Virtual Prostate Biopsy Protocol for Patients on Active Surveillance and at Risk of Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to examine the use of MRI surveillance for patients with no prostate cancer, potential prostate cancer, or diagnosed low-grade prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: virtual biopsy (VB) monitoring protocol
Negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI (adjusted to the prostate VB protocol criteria), Negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI (adjusted to the prostate VB protocol criteria). This metric will determine if the the VB protocol is statistically equal to (or greater than) the negative predictive value of the standard of care TRUS prostate biopsy., Up to 3 years from start of study
This study will use MRI instead of prostate biopsy in combination with regularly scheduled urologist visits, interval PSA checks, and annual DRE to help establish a non-invasive method for 1) participants with a negative prostate MRI (PI-RADS 1 or 2) who have never had a biopsy; 2) participants with a positive MRI (PI-RADS score of 3, 4, or 5) and negative MRI-targeted biopsy pathology; and 3) monitoring participants with clinically diagnosed low risk prostate cancer who are on active surveillance. However, if at any point, clinical suspicion indicated either by the presence of suspicious lesions on the MRI, rising PSA, and/or positive DRE arises, then an immediate biopsy will be performed.
