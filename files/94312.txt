Validation of a Molecular Signature for Early Detection of Colorectal Cancer
The goal of this Multicentre and international prospective study is to validate a molecular signature using plasma samples in average-risk population for colorectal cancer who undergo colonoscopy in a screening setting.

The main question it aims to answer is:

Does molecular signature in plasma sample have higher diagnostic accuracy than FIT for early detection of colorectal cancer? Participants who already have a colonoscopy as part of their regular medical care for colorectal cancer screening will provide a stool sample and a plasma sample.
