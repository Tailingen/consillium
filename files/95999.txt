A Study on Predictive Value of ERCC1 in Esophageal Cancer Patients Treated With Paclitaxel and Cisplatin
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel in esophageal cancer
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: paclitaxel and cisplatin
Overall response rate (ORR), The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate of paclitaxel plus cisplatin as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal carcinoma, 5 year
Time to event efficay, The following time to event efficacy measures:

* Duration of overall response for responding patients
* Time to documented progressive disease
* Overall survival
* The quantitative and qualitative toxicity of paclitaxel plus cisplatin.
* Determinant of efficacy of the treatment with paclitaxel and cisplatin in the patient population by means of the analysis of ERCC1, 5 year
Open label single arm phase II study of cisplatin and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer. 92 Patients will be enrolled in this local trial. The primary objective of this study is to determine the response rate of the treatment.Schedule for this study is as follows: paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hour on Days 1, followed by cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on Days 2. This study will also include the investigation of ERCC1 expression in order to assess determinants of efficacy of the treatment with cisplatin and paclitaxel in the study population.
