DRUG: Rulonilimab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: cisplatin/carboplatin + paclitaxel ± bevacizumab
Objective tumor response rate (ORR) assessed by RECIST1.1, Defined as the proportion of subjects who achieves a best overall response of CR or PR based on RECIST1.1, up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) assessed by RECIST1.1, Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever occurs first., up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any reason, up to 2 years
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of subjects' response of CR, PR, or SD based onRECIST1.1, up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from the date that CR or PR are first occurred to the date of objective disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, up to 2 years|Time to Response (TTR), Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date when the response criteria are first met, based on RECIST1.1, up to 2 years
The Incidence and Severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Number of participants with an AE or SAE, up to 2 years|Healthy related quality of life (HRQoL), EORTC QLQ-C30 will be used, up to 2 years
The trial was divided into screening period, treatment period and follow-up period. Participants entered the screening period after signing informed consent and met the inclusion criteria. Subjects who did not meet the exclusion criteria were treated with Rulonilimab/placebo plus chemotherapy ± bevacizumab, intravenously, at target dose every 3 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity or withdrawal for other reasons, for a maximum of 2 years.
