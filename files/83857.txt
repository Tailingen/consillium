Comparison of Recovery From General Anesthesia in Remimazolam With Flumazenil vs. Propofol
This prospective randomized trial aims to compare recovery time from discontinuation of remimazolam followed by flumazenil administration vs. propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.
Recovery
DRUG: REMIMAZOLAM BESYLATE 2.5 Mg in 1 mL INTRAVENOUS INJECTION, POWDER, LYOPHILIZED, for SOLUTION [BYFAVO]|DRUG: Flumazenil|DRUG: Propofol
Time to eye opening (minute), The time to the first eye-opening response to the doctor's command from the discontinuation of anesthetic agents, 20 minutes after anesthesia emergence
Time to emergence (minutes), The time from anesthetics off to extubation/discharge from operating room, 20 minutes after anesthesia emergence|Bispectral index score (Score), A BIS score quantifies changes in the electrophysiologic state of the brain during anesthesia. In patients who are awake, a typical BIS score is 90 to 100. Complete suppression of cortical activity results in a BIS score of 0, known as a flat line. Lower numbers indicate a higher hypnotic effect., During 20 minutes after anesthesia emergence (3 point : Time from anesthetics off to eye opening/extubation/discharge from operating room)|Incidence of emergence agitation at operating room (n(%)), Ricker sedation agitated scale ≥5 was defined as emergence agitation, (1-7), Time Frame: 20 minutes after anesthesia emergence|The modified Aldrete score (Score), The modified Aldrete score (0-10), Score ≥9 was defined as the possibility of discharge from PACU, 30 minutes after post anaestheisa care unit adminstration|The modified Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (Score), The modified Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (0-5), Score 5 was defined as respond readily to name spoken in normal tone., 30 minutes after post anaestheisa care unit adminstration|Postoperative Pain (score), Numerical rating scales score (0-10) of pain, The higher score was defined as severe pain, 10/20/30 minutes after post anaestheisa care unit administation|Postoperative opioid consumption (The number of analgesic use), Postoperative opioid requirement, from post anaestheisa care unit administation to post anaestheisa care unit discharge (during 30-40 minutes, upto 1 hours)|Postoperative nausea and vomiting (The incidence of PONV, n(%)), Postoperative nausea and vomiting, from post anaestheisa care unit administation to post anaestheisa care unit discharge (during 30-40 minutes, upto 1 hours)|Postoperative quality of recovery (score), Korean version of quality of recovery-15, The higher score was defined as good satisfaction., upto 24 hours|Postoperative opioid consumption (The number of analgesic use), Postoperative opioid requirement, upto 24 hours|Postoperative Pain (score), Numerical rating scales score (0-10) of pain, The higher score was defined as severe pain, upto 24 hours
Adult patients undergoing breast cancer surgery are randomized to receive either remimazolam with flumazenil or propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia. When the surgery is ended, anesthetic agents are discontinued. The study's primary outcome is a comparison of the time to the first eye-opening response to the doctor's command from the discontinuation of anesthetic agents between the groups. Secondary outcomes include the time from anesthetics off to extubation/discharge from operating room (OR), BIS score at eye-opening/extubation/discharge from OR, the incidence of emergence agitation at OR, the PAT score, the modified Aldrete score, modified OAA/S (Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale) after PACU administration. In addition, the investigators investigate postoperative pain score at 10/20/30 minutes and postoperative nausea and vomiting after PACU administration, Korean version of quality of recovery-15 in postoperative 24 hours, postoperative pain score and postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative opioid consumption in postoperative 24 hours.
