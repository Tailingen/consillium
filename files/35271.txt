Study With [225Ac]Ac-FL-020 in mCRPC Participants
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, therapeutic effect, and pharmacokinetics of \[225Ac\]Ac-FL-020 in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: [225Ac]Ac-FL-020|DRUG: Blood samples for PK|DRUG: [111In]In-FL-020|PROCEDURE: Blood and urine samples collection|PROCEDURE: SPECT/CT images
Dose escalation: Incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)., RP2D, 28 days after the first injection of [225Ac]Ac-FL-020|Dose escalation and dose expansion: Type, frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0., From ICF signature and up to 42 days after the last dose of study treatment and then during the long-term follow-up period
Dose escalation and dose expansion: Absorbed doses, Absorbed doses in different organs and tumors, During one week following the injection of [111In]In-FL-020|Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Pharmacokinetics, During one week following the first injection of [225Ac]Ac-FL-020|Area Under the Plasma concentration versus time curve, Pharmacokinetics, During one week following the first injection of [225Ac]Ac-FL-020|Overall response rate, Anti-tumor activity via imaging assessments and PSA levels, 2 years|Disease Control Rate, Anti-tumor activity via imaging assessments and PSA levels, 2 years|Best Overall response, Anti-tumor activity via imaging assessments and PSA levels, 2 years|Progression Free Survival, Anti-tumor activity via imaging assessments and PSA levels, 2 years|Overall Survival, Anti-tumor activity, 2 years
The aim of this Phase 1, First-in-Human, Open-label Trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of \[225Ac\]Ac-FL-020 as a single agent in participants with metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). \[111In\]In-FL-020 serves as a surrogate for 225Ac-FL-020 for dosimetry purposes. The trial is divided into two parts: dose escalation in Part 1 and cohort expansion in Part 2.
