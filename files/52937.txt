Urology San Antonio MRI/MicroUS Comparison
This study compares micro-ultrasound image targeted prostate biopsy with multi-parametric MRI targeted biopsy in men indicated for prostate biopsy due to suspicion of prostate cancer. Both imaging techniques will be applied to each subject and compared, along with systematic biopsy.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Micro-ultrasound targeted biopsy|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: mpMRI targeted biopsy
Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Cancer, Comparison of subject-level detection rate of clinically significant cancer (csPCa, defined as Grade Group 2 or higher) between micro-ultrasound targeted biopsy and mpMRI targeted biopsy., At time of biopsy
The investigational protocol describes a study designed to compare ultra-high resolution transrectal micro-ultrasound (micro-US), and multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI). These modalities are both used clinically to identify targets for prostate biopsy, however little data is available to compare their sensitivity. While mpMRI is used clinically to identify targets for biopsy, it is not used for real-time biopsy guidance due to challenges performing the biopsy procedure within the MRI gantry. Instead, targets identified on mpMRI are sampled during transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy as part of the prostate biopsy procedure, often using software assisted fusion products. For this investigation, the biopsy procedure will be guided by transrectal micro-US (current standard of care at Urology San Antonio), and will include systematic (standard, random, extended sextant) plus image-guided prostate biopsies among men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer and an indication for prostate biopsy.
