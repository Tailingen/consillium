Surgery Versus Internal Radiation in Treating Patients With Stage II Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Internal radiation uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether surgery is more effective than internal radiation in treating prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery with that of internal radiation in treating patients who have stage II prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: surgery|RADIATION: radiation
overall survival, Up to 10 years
disease free survival, Up to 10 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare overall survival in patients with stage II prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy vs brachytherapy.
* Compare metastasis-free survival and probability of survival without symptoms of patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the side effects of these treatment regimens in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo radical prostatectomy.
* Arm II: Patients undergo brachytherapy with implanted iodine I 125 or palladium Pd 103 seeds Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,980 patients (990 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 5.5 years.
