A Study of AK104 With Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This study is a multicenter, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activities of AK104，a PD-1/CTLA-4 bispecific antibody, in combination with chemotherapy as first-line therapy in subjects with advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: AK104|DRUG: AK104|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Liposomal Irinotecan, Oxaliplatin, 5-Fluorouracil/Calcium folinate|DRUG: Oxaliplatin + Irinotecan + 5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of subjects with CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1, Up to 2 years|The number of subjects experiencing adverse events (AEs), Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), and clinically significant abnormal laboratory results., From the subject signs the ICF to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.
Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of AK104, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK104 at different timepoints after AK104 administration., From first dose of study drug until the 8th cycle (each cycle is 28 days) of study drug administration.|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of AK104 at steady state, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK104 at different timepoints after AK104 administration., From first dose of study drug until the 8th cycle (each cycle is 28 days) of study drug administration.|Area under the curve (AUC) of AK104, The endpoints for assessment of PK of AK104 include serum concentrations of AK104 at different timepoints after AK104 administration., From first dose of study drug until the 8th cycle (each cycle is 28 days) of study drug administration.|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of AK104 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable antidrug antibodies (ADAs)., From first dose of study drug until the 8th cycle (each cycle is 28 days) of study drug administration.
