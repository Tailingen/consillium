A Multi-Institution Study of TGFβ Imprinted, Ex Vivo Expanded Universal Donor NK Cell Infusions as Adoptive Immunotherapy in Combination With Gemcitabine and Docetaxel in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Pediatric Bone and Soft Tissue
The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of infusions of a type of immune cell called a "natural killer", or NK cell to the sarcoma chemotherapy regimen GEM/DOX (gemcitabine and docetaxel) can improve outcomes in people with childhood sarcomas that have relapsed or not responded to prior therapies.

The goals of this study are:

* To determine the safety and efficacy of the addition of adoptive transfer of universal donor, TGFβ imprinted (TGFβi), expanded NK cells to the pediatric sarcoma salvage chemotherapeutic regimen gemcitabine/docetaxel (GEM/DOX) for treatment of relapsed and refractory pediatric sarcomas To determine the 6-month progression free survival achieved with this treatment in patients within cohorts of relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma.
* To identify toxicities related to treatment with GEM/DOX + TGFβi expanded NK cells

Participants will receive study drugs that include chemotherapy and NK cells in cycles; each cycle is 21 days long and you can receive up to 8 cycles.

* Gemcitabine (GEM): via IV on Days 1 and 8
* Docetaxel (DOX): via IV on Day 8
* Prophylactic dexamethasone: Day 7-9 to prevent fluid retention and hypersensitivity reaction
* Peg-filgrastim (PEG-GCSF) or biosimilar: Day 9 to help your white blood cell recover and allow more chemotherapy to be given
* TGFβi NK cells: via IV on Day 12
Pediatric Sarcoma, Refractory|Pediatric Sarcoma, Relapsed
BIOLOGICAL: GEM/DOX + TGFBi expanded NK cells
Part 1, Evaluation of DLT in patients enrolled during Part 1 enrollment

* ≥2 of 6 patients with DLT will be cause for termination of the study, 3-5 years|Part 2, Determination of 6-month progression free survival (PFS) in study patients measured from initiation of treatment (Day 1 of the first cycle of therapy)

Patients will be considered evaluable for tumor response if they:

* Have received at least one dose of NK cell infusion
* Have completed all therapy and are 1 year from initiation of treatment
* Are lost to follow up
* Elect to discontinue therapy
* Terminate treatment for reasons of toxicity or progression prior to completion of therapy., 3-5 years
Treatment response of target lesions determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, Assessments will be performed after every other cycle of treatment to determine antitumor effect of therapy., Every two cycles (21 days per cycle) for 3-5 years|Frequency and characterization of DLT in study patients, cycle = 21 days, 3-5 years
Exploratory Endpoint, Assessment of TGFβi NK cell persistence, phenotype, and retained cytolytic activity in patient peripheral blood via samples drawn on days 1, 8, and 12 of each cycle beginning with cycle 2 analyzed by flow cytometry., Days 1, 8, and 12 of each cycle (21 days per cycle), starting with cycle 2
This is a multi-center study with rolling safety and toxicity analysis, to determine the safety and efficacy of the addition of adoptive transfer of universal donor, TGFβ imprinted (TGFβi), expanded NK cells to the pediatric sarcoma salvage chemotherapeutic regimen gemcitabine/docetaxel (GEM/DOX) for treatment of relapsed and refractory pediatric sarcomas, identify toxicities related to treatment with GEM/DOX + TGFβi expanded NK cells, and assess in vivo persistence of expanded, universal donor, TGFβi NK cells after adoptive transfer and correlate with clinical outcomes.

The planned therapy will involve 8 cycles of 21 days each consisting of gemcitabine, docetaxel, supportive dexamethasone and peg-filgrastim, and universal donor, TGFβi ex vivo expanded NK cells (Cycles 1-6).
