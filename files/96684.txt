Treatment of Radiation-induced Fibrosis in the Upper Aerodigestive Tract Cancer by a Combination of Pentoxifylline-tocopherol and Hyperbaric Oxygen
The pentoxifylline used with tocopherol achieves a certain effectiveness in the treatment of the fibrosis.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been recommended and used in a wide variety of medical conditions including the treatment of delayed radiation injuries (soft tissue and bony radiation necrosis). The hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the formation of granulation tissue and produces angiogenesis maintained after use.
Fibrosis
DRUG: pentoxifylline with tocopherol|OTHER: pentoxifylline+tocopherol + Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy
Change in skin fibrosis measured by MRI, The change is calculated as the latest time point (6 months) minus the earliest time point (baseline), From baseline to 6 month of starting treatment
Clinical assessment of the radiation late (delayed) toxicity for mucosal membranes, salivary glands, larynx and skin by the LENT-SOMA scale (Late Effect Normal Tissue Task Force / Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic scale), The change is calculated as the latest time point (6 months) minus the earliest time point (baseline), Baseline and 6 months
Patients with head and neck tumors often present superficial radiation induced fibrosis and other late complications of radiotherapy that can seriously affect their quality of life.

The pentoxifylline used with tocopherol achieves a certain effectiveness in the treatment of the fibrosis.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been recommended and used in a wide variety of medical conditions including the treatment of delayed radiation injuries (soft tissue and bony radiation necrosis). The hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the formation of granulation tissue and produces angiogenesis maintained after use.

Both treatments in combination could produce a synergistic effect because the angiogenesis induced by hyperbaric oxygen therapy allow better access to drugs to the injury. The magnetic resonance, provides data of the fibrosis and other side effects of radiotherapy.
