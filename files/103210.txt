Program of Physical Activity, Nutrition and Supportive to Improve the Quality of Life of Breast Cancer Survivors
Despite it being one of the leading causes of cancer death among women, survival following a breast cancer diagnosis has greatly increased in high-income countries. However; this gave rise to a growing population of women living long after breast cancer with a diminished quality of life (QoL) due to the long-term effects of cancer and cancer treatment.

Exercise can improve QoL, fatigue, and other mental and physical health outcomes in this population, and is strongly recommended among breast cancer survivors, much like a healthy diet. However adherence in real-life to these recommendations is seldom satisfactory. Also, evidence regarding the effect and cost-effectiveness of concurrent healthy lifestyle behaviors compared to exercise alone is limited. Hence the need to develop pragmatic (evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in real-life conditions) theoretical-based customized interventions, which aim to improve uptake and instill long-term adherence of health lifestyle among breast cancer survivors.

ADA (Activité physique adaptée Doublée d'un Accompagnement spécifique post-cancer) is an integrative intervention based on physical activity, nutrition and supportive care. The interventions aims to improve breast cancer survivors' physical and mental health and instill long-term healthy behaviors.

Our study will be a pragmatic two-arm (ADA intervention versus control/usual care) cluster randomized controlled trial which examines the effectiveness of the ADA intervention program.

The primary endpoint will be health-related quality of life, as measured at 12-month after the start of the trial.

Several secondary outcomes will also be assessed; which include Physical activity level, relationship to food and self-efficacy.

The study aims to recruit 160 participants in total, divided into 20 activity groups (clusters) of 8 participants.

Primary analyses will be carried out on an intention to treat (ITT) basis, at both cluster and participant level. All statistical analysis will adjust for the clustering of patients within centers as a random effect.

The aim of this trial is to provide scientific evidence on the 'real-world' effectiveness of an easily generalizable trial, with clinically-significant outcomes, touching a growing number of cancer survivors.
Quality of Life|Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: ADA|BEHAVIORAL: Usual Care
Health-related quality of life, The primary endpoint will be the health-related quality of life, as measured by the FACIT-F global score. This score is based on the 27-items Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale ,and the 13-items fatigue subscale included in the FACIT-F. Higher score indicate better Quality of life., 12 months after the beginning of the intervention
Physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being, measured separately by the FACT-G four different subscales. Higher score indicate better Quality of life., At 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the beginning of the intervention|Fatigue, measured by the FACIT-F global score. This score is based on the 13-items fatigue subscale included in the FACIT-F., At 3 months, and 6 months after the beginning of the intervention|Physical activity level, Measured with the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF).A higher IPAQ-SF score indicates a better physical activity level.., At 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the beginning of the intervention|Motivation for physical activity Questionnaire-2 (BREQ-2) scale, assessed with the short form of Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2 (BREQ-2). A higher BREQ-2 score indicates a better exercise motivation., At 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the beginning of the intervention|Sedentary behavior (sitting time), measured with a questionnaire adapted from the Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ). A higher RPAQ score indicates a lower sedentary behavior level., At 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the beginning of the intervention|Relationship to food, Measured using a scale adapted from the Positive Eating Scale. A Higher score indicates a positive relationship with eating., At 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the beginning of the intervention|Self-efficacy, people's beliefs about their ability to produce designated levels of performance that influence events that affect their lives, assessed by an ad-hoc scale, At 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the beginning of the intervention
