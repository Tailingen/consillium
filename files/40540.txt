A Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of ASP1650, a Monoclonal Antibody Targeting Claudin 6 (CLDN6), in Male Subjects With Incurable Platinum Refractory Germ Cell Tumors
The purpose of this study was to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ASP1650 (Safety Lead-in Phase), as well as, evaluate the efficacy of ASP1650 as measured by confirmed objective response rate (ORR) (phase 2) in participants with incurable platinum refractory germ cell tumors.

This study also evaluated the following efficacy measures for confirmed objective response rate (ORR); clinical benefit rate (CBR); duration of response (DOR); and progression-free survival (PFS); as well as safety and tolerability; the effect of ASP1650 on changes in serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (βhCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP); and the pharmacokinetics of ASP1650.
Incurable Platinum Refractory Germ Cell Tumors|Tumors
DRUG: ASP1650
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of ASP1650, The RP2D was determined via dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment by dose evaluation committee (DEC). DLT was evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 28 days|Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response by Modified RECIST v1.1, Confirmed objective response was defined as the confirmed completed response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), as confirmed by investigator based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Per modified RECIST v1.1, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Both Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) and Beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (beta-HCG) values were below the ULN. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. No increase ≥ 50% in 2 samples at least 1 week apart compared to nadir values for both AFP and beta-HCG., From randomization until confirmed CR or confirmed PR, whichever occurred first (up to 26.57 weeks)
Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response by RECIST v1.1, Confirmed objective response was defined as the confirmed CR or PR, as confirmed by investigator based on RECIST v1.1. Per RECIST v1.1, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., From randomization until confirmed CR or confirmed PR, whichever occurred first (up to 26.57 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit by Modified RECIST v1.1 and RECIST v1.1, Clinical benefit: defined as best overall response of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or durable stable disease (SD) as confirmed by investigator based on modified RECIST v1.1 and RECIST v1.1. Per RECIST v1.1 and modified RECIST V1.1, CR: disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR:at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference smallest sum diameters while on study. Durable SD: SD maintained for at least 12 weeks. Additionally, per modified RECIST v1.1, CR also included AFP and beta-HCG values below ULN. PR also included no increase ≥ 50% in 2 samples at least 1 week apart compared to nadir values both for AFP and beta-HCG., From randomization until confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or durable SD whichever occurred first (up to 26.57 weeks)|Duration of Response (DOR) by Modified RECIST v1.1 and RECIST v1.1 for Dose Level 2, DOR was defined as the time from the date of the first confirmed response CR or confirmed PR (whichever was first recorded) as confirmed by investigator based on modified RECIST 1.1 and RECIST v1.1 to the date of disease progression or date of censoring, whichever was earlier. If a participant had not progressed, participant was censored at the date of last disease assessment or at the date of first confirmed CR/PR if no post-baseline disease assessment was available. DOR (in days) was calculated as: (Date of documented progressive disease \[PD\], death, or censoring) minus (Date of the first CR/PR which was subsequently confirmed) +1. Duration of response was planned to summarized only for participants receiving dose level 2 in phase 2., From randomization until confirmed CR or confirmed PR whichever occurred first (up to 26.57 weeks)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) by Modified RECIST v1.1 and RECIST v1.1 for Dose Level 2, PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose until the date of disease progression, or until death due to any cause. If a participant had neither progressed nor died, the participant was censored at the date of last disease as confirmed by investigator based on modified RECIST v1.1 and RECIST v1.1. The distribution of PFS was planned to be summarized only for participants receiving dose level 2 using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Per modified RECIST v1.1 and RECIST v1.1, Progressive disease (PD): appearance of one or more new lesions or at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). Also, the sum must be an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Additionally per modified RECIST v1.1, PD was increase ≥ 50% in serum tumor markers AFP or beta-hCG in 2 samples at least 1 week apart compared to nadir values., From the date of first dose until the date of disease progression, or until death due to any cause (up to 26.57 weeks)|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered with an Investigational Product (IP) which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign including abnormal laboratory finding/test result or other safety assessment, symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of IP whether or not considered related to IP. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE with onset at any time from first dosing until last scheduled procedure. AEs were considered serious (SAEs) if AE resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly, birth defect, or required inpatient hospitalization or led to prolongation of hospitalization., From first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (up to 41.14 weeks)|Number of Participants With Shifts From Baseline to Post Baseline in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), Number of participants with shifts from baseline to post baseline in ECOG PS levels were reported. ECOG has 6 levels (0-5). Level 0 is fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction; Level 1 is restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory ad able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g. light house work, office work; Level 2 is ambulatory and capable of all self care but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours; Level 3 is capable of only limited self care; confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours; Level 4 is completely disabled; cannot carry on any self care; totally confined to bed or chair); and Level 5 is dead., Baseline, C2D1, C3D1, C4D1, C5D1, C6D1, C7D1, C8D1, C9D1, C10D1, C11D1, C12D1 (Duration of each treatment cycle was 14 days)|Change From Baseline in Serum Beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (βhCG), Blood was drawn for the measurement of serum βhCG at day 1 of every cycle (14 day cycle) to align with imaging assessment until the participant develops radiological disease progression per RECIST v1.1 evaluation or starts other systemic anticancer treatment.

The study consisted of 2 phases: Safety Lead-in phase and phase 2. 19 participants were enrolled in both phases.

The Safety Lead-in phase of this study was to establish the tolerability of RP2D. The RP2D determination was based on at least 6 evaluable participants at the RP2D as determined by the Dose Evaluation Committee (DEC).

Once RP2D had been established as tolerable, 13 additional participants were enrolled in phase 2 to receive ASP1650 for up to a maximum of 12 cycles or until a study discontinuation criteria had been met, whichever occurred earlier.
