The Association of hsCRP and Radiotherapy-Induced Toxicity in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The primary purpose of this study is to explore the association of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and radiotherapy(RT)-induced toxicity in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In each patient, hsCRP levels in the pre- and post-RT plasma samples will be measured according to the schedule we set.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Head and Neck Cancer|Toxicity Due to Radiotherapy
OTHER: clinical measurements
hsCRP levels, The hscrp levels in the plasma samples from each participant were measured at the following time points:

1. at the time of diagnosis completion/before the initiation of the first neoadjuvant chemotherapy
2. before the initiation of each neoadjuvant chemotherapy
3. before the initiation of the first radiotherapy
4. during radiotherapy, once a week
5. 1 week and 4weeks after the last radiotherapy, Through treatments completion，12 weeks|Incidence of adverse events, All adverse events were recorded during treatment(for example, oral mucositis, dermatitis)., Through treatments completion，12 weeks
