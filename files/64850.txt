Bladder Tumor Biopsy Study to Improve Preoperative Determination of Stage and Grade
To assess whether the addition of a bladder tumor biopsy improves the level of agreement between the pretreatment endoscopic impression and the final postoperative pathology determination of stage and grade in non-muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.
Bladder Cancer
PROCEDURE: Bladder tumor biopsy
Improvement of the kappa agreement score between preoperative and postoperative assessment of stage and grade in non-muscle-invasive bladder tumors., Assessment of grade, which is the main endpoint will be dichotomous defining lesions between low versus high grade. Stage classification of non-muscle-invasive papillary lesions is also dichotomous between Ta and T1 lesions. CIS can be annotated, but since these are flat, diffuse and non "resectable" in the bladder, they are not part of our main analysis, endpoints, or sample size calculations. The only exception is when the presence of CIS is used to determine grade (high-grade lesion)., 3 years
Non-invasive bladder cancer is challenging to treat because it is a condition characterized by frequent recurrences that lead to numerous invasive procedures for detection and treatment. The mainstay of therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, which has remained unchanged for decades, relies on surgical resection (TUR) associated with utilization of intravesical immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite our best efforts, these tumors continue to have suboptimal rates of recurrence and require long-term follow-up with costly and invasive procedures. The rationale for this study is to show that the preoperative biopsy, taken at the time of the office cystoscopic evaluation, improves pre-TUR staging and grading correlation with the final pathology of the resection. Indirectly, this will suggest that the routine use of pre-TUR biopsy provides more accurate information for intraoperative decision-making that can ultimately lead to better management of these patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
