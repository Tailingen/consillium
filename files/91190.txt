Multiple Class I Peptides & Montanide ISA 51 VG w Escalating Doses of Anti-PD-1 ab BMS936558
This is a pilot phase 1, open-label, single center, multi-dose, dose-escalation study of BMS-936558 in combination with or without a peptide vaccine.

The purpose of this study is to test the side effects of an investigational vaccine with an immune booster. Investigators also wish to find out its effects on the patient's immune system and whether it will shrink their melanoma.

Best Overall Response Rate (BORR), The primary analysis is the BORR as determined using irRC. The BORR will be summarized using descriptive statistics., 2 years, 6 months
Time to Response, Time to response for participants with confirmed responses. Response categories: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD); disease control rate (sum of response rate for CR+PR+SD)., 2 years, 6 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response for participants with confirmed responses. Response categories: Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) Stable Disease (SD), Progressive Disease (PD); disease control rate (sum of response rate for CR+PR+SD)., 2 years, 6 months
BMS-936558 will be administered as an i.v. infusion, using a volumetric pump with a 0.2 micron in-line filter at the protocol-specified dose(s) and rate.

The vaccine consists of the following peptides: gp100280-288 (288V), and NY-ESO-1157-165 (165V).

NOTE: \*Patients in cohorts 1-5 will receive the peptide vaccine, but not those in cohort 6.

Blood samples are collected for pharmacokinetic and immunologic analysis.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
