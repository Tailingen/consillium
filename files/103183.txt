Phase II Study of NGR-hTNF in Combination With Doxorubicin in Patients Affected by Soft Tissue Sarcomas.
The main objective of the trial is to document the preliminary antitumor activity of two doses of NGR-hTNF administered either alone or in combination with doxorubicin in locally advanced or metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) patients untreated or previously treated with one or more prior systemic regimen.
Metastatic Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: low-dose NGR-hTNF|DRUG: high-dose NGR-hTNF|DRUG: Doxorubicin
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until disease progression, or death, every 6-12 weeks
Safety and Toxicity according to NCI-CTCAE criteria (version 4.02), To evaluate safety and toxicity profile related to NGR-hTNF, during the study|Duration of Disease Control, Measured from the date of randomization until disease progression, or death due to any cause, every 6-12 weeks|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death due to any cause or the last date the patient was known to be alive, every 6-12 weeks|Response rate, Measured both according to RECIST criteria and by FDG-PET, every 6-12 weeks|Tumor response, Evaluated by a centralized review of changes in tumor density on CT scan and/or perfusion MRI, every 6-12 weeks
Considering the safety/toxicity profile of NGR-hTNF characterized by mild-to-moderate constitutional symptoms when given either every three weeks or weekly both at low (0.8 µg/m\^2) and high dose (45 µg/m\^2); the reversibility of these adverse events generally occurring only during the infusion time; the absence of overlapping toxicities with chemotherapeutic agents; and the safety and preliminary antitumor activity observed in phase Ib trial with doxorubicin, seems justified to evaluate in a randomized 4-arm phase II trial the preliminary antitumor activity of two doses of NGR-hTNF (0.8 µg/m\^2 and 45 µg/m\^2) administered weekly either alone or in combination with a standard dose of doxorubicin (60 mg/m\^2 every three weeks).
