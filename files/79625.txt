Efficacy, Safety and CNS Exposure of G-202 (Mipsagargin) in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Glioblastoma
This study will evaluate if a drug called G-202 can be safely used to treat people with glioblastoma (GBM) that has progressed or recurred. G-202 is given by intravenous infusion on three consecutive days of a 28-day cycle.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: G-202
6-month Progression-free Survival (PFS), Percentage of patients who received at least 2 cycles of G-202 and have not progressed or died within 6 months of beginning treatment with G-202. Progression is defined using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group (RANO) for high-grade glioma, as any of the following: by any of the following: 25% or greater increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions (compared with baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids; a significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesions on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy, not due to comorbid events; the appearance of any new lesions; clear progression of nonmeasurable lesions; or definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor, or to decrease in corticosteroid dose., 6 months
Toxicity Assessed by CTCAE v 4.03 Criteria, Percentage of all analyzed patients experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events., Every 2 weeks for approximately one year|Objective Tumor Response Rate, Percentage of analyzed participants experiencing a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using RANO criteria. CR is defined as complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and nonmeasurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks; no new lesions; stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions; and patient must be off corticosteroids or on physiologic replacement doses only, and stable or improved clinically. PR is defined as at least 50% decrease, compared with baseline, in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks; no progression of nonmeasurable disease; no new lesions; stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan; and patient must be on a corticosteroid dose not greater than the dose at time of baseline scan and is stable or improved clinically., approximately one year|Duration of PFS, Duration of time from the first administration of G-202 until the first documented progression or date of death, assessed up to 12 months. Progression is defined using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Working Group (RANO) for high-grade glioma, as any of the following: by any of the following: 25% or greater increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions (compared with baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids; a significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesions on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy, not due to comorbid events; the appearance of any new lesions; clear progression of nonmeasurable lesions; or definite clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the tumor, or to decrease in corticosteroid dose., Every 4 weeks for approximately one year|Overall Survival, Duration of time from the first administration of G-202 until the date of death, assessed up to 12 months, Every 4 weeks for approximately one year|Biomarkers in Tumor, PSMA immunohistochemistry staining score on tumor tissue collected prior to start of G-202 study treatment.

Intensity of staining was ranked on a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (with 0 representing no staining and 3 representing maximum intensity): absence of staining (0), weak staining (1), medium staining (2), or strong staining (3) relative to a staining calibration curve and normalized to the image mean background intensity.

The scoring scale does not have a title nor does it have a subscale. It is not known whether PSMA staining intensity is associated with tumor molecular phenotypes or response outcome to G-202; therefore, this was an exploratory analysis. However, the lack of objective tumor response in the trial precluded comparative analysis., Within 4 weeks of receiving G-202
Glioblastoma (GBM) comprises about 16% of all malignancies of the nervous system and over 50% of all gliomas. Standard of care for newly-diagnosed GBM is a combination of surgical debulking followed by concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Efforts to improve second-line therapy in GBM have met with only marginal success and there is a large unmet medical need for new therapies. G-202 (mipsagargin) is an example of prodrug chemotherapy. It is activated by Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), which is expressed by some cancer cells and in the blood vessels of most solid tumors, including GBM, but not by normal cells or blood vessels in normal tissue. It is believed that activation of the prodrug G-202 will allow the drug to kill cancer cells. This study will evaluate the activity, safety and CNS exposure of G-202 in participants with recurrent or progressive GBM receiving G-202 by intravenous infusion on three consecutive days of a 28-day cycle.
