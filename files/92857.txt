An Exploratory Study of Caregiver Burden Among Family Caregivers of Patients With Cancer
This study will look at caregiver burden and the coping behavior of caregivers of patients with cancer. Through this study, the investigators will identify the relationship between cognitive dysfunction (measured as a proxy rating by the caregiver), resilience, social support, cognitive appraisal, coping behavior, and caregiver burden, anxiety, and depression among family caregivers of patients with cancer.

Changes in Caregiver Burden Score [Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA)], Relation between caregiver burden subscale scores and caregiver resilience, social support, and coping, 1 year
Changes in Anxiety and Depression Score [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], Relation between caregiver anxiety and depression score and caregiver resilience, social support, and coping, 1 year
The goal of this study is to explore caregiver burden and the coping behavior of caregivers of patients with cancer. It has been documented that non-professional caregivers and long-term care providers to patients with cancer receive little preparation, information, or support to perform their vital role. Through this study, the investigators will identify the relationship between cognitive dysfunction, resilience, social support, cognitive appraisal, coping behavior, and caregiver burden, anxiety, and depression among family caregivers of patients with cancer. The findings of this study will direct future intervention studies to reduce caregiver burden and improve outcomes for the many individuals caring for family members with cancer.
