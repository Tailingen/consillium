TACE+Tilelizumab+Sorafenib in the Treatment of BCLC Stage C HCC
According to the BCLC staging system treatment recommendation, systemic treatment is recommended for patients in BCLC stage C, and TACE and systemic treatment are recommended for patients in this stage. Studies have shown that TACE combined with sorafenib therapy has shown effectiveness in the treatment of advanced liver cancer, and PD-1 inhibitors have also shown effectiveness in the treatment of advanced liver cancer. Therefore, in order to improve the survival benefit of BCLC stage C liver cancer patients, this clinical study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TACE combined with sorafenib and tislelizumab in the treatment of BCLC stage C liver cancer patients.
