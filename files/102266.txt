Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) in the Hormone Receptor-Positive (HR+), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-Low Population, PFS per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) assessed by BICR was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of PD, as defined or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the participant withdrew from randomized therapy or received another anticancer therapy prior to progression. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (TLs), taking as reference the smallest previous sum of diameters (nadir), this included the baseline sum if that was the smallest on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm) from nadir.

Eligible patients will be those patients who have had disease progression on at least 2 previous lines of endocrine therapies given for the treatment of metastatic disease or disease progression within 6 months of starting first line treatment for metastatic disease with an endocrine therapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. All patients must have historically confirmed HR positive (either estrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive), HER2-low (defined as IHC2+/ISH- and IHC 1+) or HER2 IHC \>0 \<1+ expression, as determined by central laboratory testing results, advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

The study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of trastuzumab deruxtecan compared with investigator's choice chemotherapy. This study aims to see if trastuzumab deruxtecan allows patients to live longer without the cancer getting worse, or simply to live longer, compared to patients receiving standard of care chemotherapy. This study is also looking to see how the treatment and the cancer affects patients' quality of life.
