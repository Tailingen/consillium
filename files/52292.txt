A Study of HS248 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is a non-random, open multi-center study This study is a non-random, open multi-center phase I study, aimed at evaluation period research, aimed at In the evaluation phase study, it aims to evaluate the safety, tolerance PK characteristics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of HS248 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study was divided into 2 phases, including dose escalation and dose expansionã€‚
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: HS248 pieces
Safety and tolerability, To examine the incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events after multiple doses of HS-248 in the dose escalation and dose expansion phases, From first dose of HS248 through 28 days after the last HS248 treatment (up to 2 years); each cycle is 28 days|MTD and/or RP2DP2D, MTD and/or RP2DP2D, The end of the study is defined as the last subject completing the last visit, study treatment for 2 years, loss to follow-up, death or withdrawal of informed consent, whichever occurs first
Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Cmax of HS248, From date of initial dose until up to 33 days for treatment|Area Under the Plasma Concentration versus Time Curve (AUC), AUC of HS248, From date of initial dose until up to 33 days for treatment|ORR, Objective Response Rate, Up to 2 years|DOR, Duration of Remission, Up to 2 years|PFS, Progression-Free Survival, Up to 2 years|DCR, Disease Control Rate, Up to 2 years|OS, Overall Survival, Up to 2 years
Main purpose:

Assess the safety and tolerability of HS248 in patients with advanced solid tumors, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of HS248.

Secondary purpose: Secondary purpose:

Assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of HS248 in patients with advanced solid tumors; To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of HS248 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Preliminary antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Other purposes:

Population-based PK (PopPK) analysis method, exploratory description) analysis method, exploratory description) analysis method, exploratory description) analysis method, exploratory description of HS248 in patients with advanced solid tumors PK features in; Evaluate the relationship between exposure and efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of HS248 in patients with advanced solid tumors, as data permit; To explore the changes of HS248 in myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and CD8+ T cells in patients with advanced solid tumors.
