HPV Infection and Genital Microecology of Childbearing-age Female in China: A Cohort and Multicenter Study
The purpose of this study to access the relations between genital microecology, HPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of childbearing-age female in China
Papillomavirus Infections|Uterine Cervical Neoplasms|Sexual Transmitted Disease
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 16S rRNA gene sequencing of cervical secretions
alteration of genital microecology from baseline at month 6, Genital microecology includes measurements of cervical microbiota, HPV and other sexually transmitted diseases pathogens infection status, conditions of the vaginal secretion and the grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. As for cervical microbiota, the NGS technology will be used to sequence the 16s rRNA gene of the microbes in the cervical secretion of each volunteers. PCR will be used to detect HPV and other sexually transmitted diseases pathogens. As for the conditions of the vaginal secretion, methods such as manual microscopic inspection, gram stain and enzymology test will be used to do the measurement. Moreover, thinprep cytologic test of cervical exfoliated cells will be performed to evaluate the grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia., basline and month 6
The volunteers will be recruited from the women who come to the hospital to do the thinprep cytologic test. After being informed about the potential risks, each volunteer giving written informed consent will be asked to complete a questionnaire. Then, cervical and vaginal swabs and cervical exfoliated cells will be taken from each volunteer to perform 16S rRNA gene sequencing microecology assessment on cervical secretions and detection and genotyping of HPV and pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases. If there is something abnormal with the diagnostic outcomes in the previous examinations, according to the doctor's judgement, those volunteer will be asked to undergo a vaginoscope and a cervical biopsy to evaluate the grade of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. After six months since the entry, each volunteer will be asked to go back to each research center to do the same sampling and examination as previously did in entry.
