Study to Evaluate the Effect of Cetuximab on Corrected QT (QTc) Interval Changes in Patients With Advanced Malignancies From Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine whether corrected QT (QTc) interval changes occur on an electrocardiogram (ECG) when cetuximab is administered to the study population.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: Cetuximab
Number of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Prolongation of the QT Interval Corrected for Heart Rate (QTc) From Time-matched Baseline, 12-Lead continuous digital electrocardiogram (ECG) data were collected at preselected time points at baseline visit and on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. The QT interval is the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the cardiac electrical cycle. The corrected QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate. Prolongation of the QTc was identified as clinically meaningful at the investigator's discretion., Baseline, Day 1, and then weekly to end of Cycle 1 (28 days)|Mean Change in QTc From Time-matched Baseline Assessed Using Fridericia's Correction Formula (QTcF) by Study Day and Time Point, The QT interval is the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the cardiac electrical cycle. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate. The QTcF=QT/RR\^1/3, where RR=RR interval in seconds. Baseline=predose. Mean change in QTc interval from baseline to time t=QTc interval at time t minus QTc interval at baseline., Predose Day 1 (Baseline) to end of Cycle 1 (28 days)
Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in PR Interval, QRS Interval, and Heart Rate, 12-Lead continuous digital ECG data were collected at preselected time points at baseline visit and on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. The PR interval is the time from the onset of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. The QRS interval=deflections in the ECG, comprising Q, R, and S waves, that represent depolarization of the ventricles. Clinically significant was determined at the investigator's discretion., Baseline, Day 1, and then weekly to end of Cycle 1 (28 days)|Number of Participants With Death, Treatment-related Death, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Treatment-related SAEs, Adverse Events (AEs) Leading to Discontinuation, and Treatment-related AEs Leading to Discontinuation, AE=any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, results in development of drug dependency or drug abuse, or is an important medical event.
