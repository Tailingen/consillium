Chemotherapy Administered Every 2 Weeks With or Without Pegfilgrastim in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Colon Cancer
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pegfilgrastim in reducing grade 3/4 neutropenia when given after one of three chemotherapy regimens (FOIL, FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. This study is considered to be "investigational" because the time between receiving pegfilgrastim and the next cycle of chemotherapy is only 11 days.
