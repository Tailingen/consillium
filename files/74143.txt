Breath Analysis and Arterial Stiffness in Patients With Respiratory Diseases
Assessment of cardiovascular disorders using echocardiography and arterial stiffness; comparative noninvasive assessment of volatile organic compound (eVOC) exhale breath patterns in patients with different chronic respiratory diseases with age and gender-matched healthy adults in order to identify a disease-specific exhaled eVOCs profiles and markers of respiratory and cardiovascular disorders.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Breath test using the Compact PTR-TOF-MS|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Portable cardiac monitor "CardioQvark"|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Assessment of arterial stiffness using the VaSera VS-1500N
Molecular composition of exhaled breath analysed by proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometer (Compact PTR-MS, Ionicon, Austria), Exhaled volatile organic compounds (eVOCs) profiles listed as ions at various mass-to-charge ratios (m/z), up to 3 years|Results of recording an electrocardiogram (ECG) in one lead with an assessment of the pulse wave, Pulse wave velocity, augmentation index, pulse wave type (A, B or C) analysed by a portable cardiac monitor "CardioQvark", up to 3 years|Indicators of arterial stiffness, Cardio-ankle vascular index and ankle-brachial index analysed with using the VaSera VS-1500N, up to 3 years
Composite of clinical records, Clinical data are assessed via questionaire according to the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale (scale points: 0 scores - the best outcome, 4 scores - the worst outcome) and Borg Dyspnea scale (scale points: 1 score - the best outcome, 10 scores - thr worst outcome), Standard examination of respiratory function (spirometry: FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF75 - % of predicted, absolute value, z-score; body plethysmography: TLC, RV, VC - % of predicted, absolute value, z-score; diffusion test: DLCO, DLCO/VA - % of predicted, absolute value, z-score), echocardiography, CT scan of the chest, if necessary, sputum culture results, up to 3 years
Evaluating of eVOCs profiles by proton mass spectrometry with a time-of-flight (PTR-TOF) in patients with different chronic respiratory diseases is of great interest for assessing the prognosis and development of severe ventilation and cardiovascular disorders.

The aim of our study is to determine the diagnostic significance of PTR-TOF analysis in patients with chronic respiratory diseases and to identify specific eVOC markers of a severe ventilation and cardiovascular disorders in patients with different chronic respiratory diseases.
