Glucose Metabolism in Different PCOS Phenotypes
In the present study glucose metabolism and ectopic lipids in the liver, heart and muscle were investigated in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in healthy control subjects.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)|OTHER: 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy
Comparison of glucose metabolism between PCOS women and healthy control subjects, using data of the OGTT., In the present study the Glucose metabolism in PCOS women and control subjects was assessed with an OGTT. Therefore the dynamic levels of glucose, insulin and C-peptide were assessed during an extended OGTT for the calculation of Insulin resistance and beta-cell function. In addition an 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy was done for the assessment of the ectopic lipid content in the liver, heart and the skeletal muscle., Up to 4 weeks
In detail an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted in women with the PCOS defined by the Rotterdam and the NIH-criteria, as well as in healthy control subjects. In addition 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Imaging was used for the assessment of the ectopic lipid content in the liver, heart and skeletal muscle. The aim of the present study was to compare the glucose metabolism and the ectopic lipid conent in the liver, heart and muscle between women with the PCOS defined by the NIH-criteria, Rotterdam-criteria and healthy control subjects.
