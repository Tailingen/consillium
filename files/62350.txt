Development and Evaluation of a Therapeutic Education Intervention in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Radical Prostatectomy to Improve Their Sexuality
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in France (54,000 cases in 2011). About 20,000 radical prostatectomies (PR) per year are performed. Despite the progress of PR over the past 20 years, the rate of erectile dysfunction post PR varies between 30 and 90% and only 16% of operated men recover their pre-treatment erections.

There is currently no validated post-prostatectomy rehabilitation protocol. The associations of patients, including the National Association of Prostate Cancer Patients have a very strong demand for treatment of sexual problems after treatment.
