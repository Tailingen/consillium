Safety and Efficacy of Single-agent CC-5013 in Subjects With Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma
For each subject the study will consist of two phases: a treatment phase and a follow-up phase. Screening procedures will take place within 28 days of baseline.

Treatment Phase: Subjects who qualify for enrollment into the study will receive single-agent CC-5013 in 28-day cycles. Study visits will occur every 4 weeks and hematologic and myeloma paraprotein laboratory assessments will occur every 2 weeks for the first 6 cycles and every 4 weeks thereafter.

Follow-Up Phase: All subjects who discontinue the treatment phase for any reason will continue to be followed for survival and post-treatment phase anti-myeloma treatment.
