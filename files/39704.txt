In this study, BKM120 will be administered to adult patients with advanced solid tumors whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists. The trial will confirm the safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BKM120 in Japanese patients.
