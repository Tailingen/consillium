ALI (Acute Lung Injury) /ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) in Oncologic Pediatric Patients
Identify pediatric oncologic patients with ALI/ARDS at GRAACC (Grupo de Apoio ao Adolescente e a Criança com Câncer) /IOP's (Instituto de Oncologia Pediátrica) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and evaluate the mechanical ventilation practice in these subjects for a 48mo period.
Acute Lung Injury|Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome|Neoplasms
Identify pediatric oncologic patients with ALI/ARDS at GRAACC's PICU and evaluate how they are mechanically ventilated, 2y
Epidemiologic data about the selected patients, Type and data about their mechanical ventilation, etiologic factors for ALI/ARDS, mortality rates, predictive factors about outcomes (death/ discharge), necessity and types of rescue therapies (surfactant, prone position, corticosteroids, etc.), 28 days
Evaluate adequate mechanical ventilation based on protective ventilation protocols for children available so far.

Evaluate and describe the subjects. Evaluate the necessity and outcome of rescue therapies (surfactant, prone position, corticosteroids, alveolar recruitment) Obtain data about ALI/ARDS' etiology, mortality rates and predictive factors related to the outcomes (PICU/ hospital discharge or death)
