LY3214996 and Cetuximab Alone or in Combination With Abemaciclib for the Treatment of Unresectable or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This phase Ib/II trial investigates the side effects and best dose of LY3214996 when given together with cetuximab alone or in combination with abemaciclib and to see how well they work in treating patients with colorectal cancer that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and/or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. LY3214996 and abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving LY3214996 and cetuximab alone or in combination with abemaciclib may help treat patients with colorectal cancer.

DRUG: Abemaciclib|BIOLOGICAL: Cetuximab|DRUG: ERK1/2 Inhibitor LY3214996
Best overall response (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]), Response rate will be calculated based on the number of patients in the evaluable population experiencing a radiographic response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria (either CR or PR) relative to the total number of patients in the efficacy evaluable population. A 95% confidence interval will be estimated around this population., From the start of the treatment until disease progression, assessed up to 1 year
Overall survival, The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate both the survival curves and the median survival time. The 95% confidence intervals for median survival times will also be calculated., From enrollment until death, assessed up to 1 year|Progression-free survival (PFS), The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the proportion of subjects without progression or death overtime and the median PFS. The 95% confidence intervals for median PFS will also be displayed., From enrollment until death or disease progression as defined by RECIST version 1.1 criteria for the evaluable population, assessed up to 1 year|Incidence of adverse events, Will be tabulated for adverse events according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 across all grades., Up to 30 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ERK1/2 inhibitor LY3214996 (LY3214996) administered in combination with cetuximab. (Phase 1b) II. Determine the MTD and RP2D of LY3214996 administered in combination with cetuximab plus abemaciclib. (Phase 1b) III. Assess the preliminary antitumor activity of the treatment combinations based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. (Phase 2)

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Assess the preliminary antitumor activity of the treatment combinations based on RECIST v.1.1. (Phase 1b) II. Characterize the safety profile of the treatment combinations (DLTs). III. Evaluate for pERK and Ki67 inhibition.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. Assess blood- and tissue-based predictive biomarkers of activity and immune effects upon treatment with cetuximab, LY3214996, and abemaciclib.

II. Demonstrate feasibility of establishing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in matched patients with cetuximab-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to evaluate for biomarkers of response and mechanisms of resistance.

III. Explore mechanisms of resistance to cetuximab plus LY3214996 and cetuximab, LY3214996, plus abemaciclib.

OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of ERK1/2 inhibitor LY3214996 followed by a phase II study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM A: Patients receive ERK1/2 inhibitor LY3214996 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

ARM B: Patients receive ERK1/2 inhibitor LY3214996 and cetuximab as in Arm A. Patients also receive abemaciclib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
