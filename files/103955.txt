LAMS Choledochoduodenostomies: With or Without Coaxial Plastic Stent
The aim of the study is to evaluate technical, clinical and safety outcomes of lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) with and without a coaxial double-pigtail plastic stent (DPS) in EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomies (CDS) for the management of biliary obstruction.
Biliary Obstruction|Pancreatic Cancer|Biliary Tract Neoplasms
DEVICE: Double pigtail plastic stent through lumen-apposing metal stent|DEVICE: Lumen-apposing metal stent without double pigtail plastic stent
Safety (Adverse events), Safety will be measured by careful and comparative evaluation of adverse effects in both groups., 12 months|Recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO), Recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO) has been defined as a composite endpoint of either occlusion or migration., 12 months
Clinical success, Resolution of jaundice or drop in total bilirubin level by \> 50% within 2 weeks after the EUS-CD., 2 weeks|Technical success, Technical success was defined as successful placement of the LAMS between the bile duct and the duodenal lumen, creating a transmural ostomy. To evaluate the correct position of the transmural stent, the deployment of the internal flap in the lumen of the bile duct must be verified by ultrasound vision and the internal flap by endoscopic vision., 24 hours.|Survival, Survival is defined as the time elapsed between biliary drainage and the end of follow-up, either due to death and cessation of follow-up., 12 months
The introduction of specific biliary lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) represented a great technical improvement in EUS-guided transmural Biliary drainage (BD) of distal malignant biliary obstruction Data is still limited, but recent studies and reviews have been reported with acceptable technical and clinical success. However, some concerns exist regarding its safety, as secondary adverse events

There are doubts concerning the possible benefits derived from the insertion of double-pigtail plastic stents (DPS) within the lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) in the EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy (CDS). Our hypothesis is that adding a coaxial plastic stent may offer benefits in terms of safety in CDS.
