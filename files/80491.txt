High-Intensity Aerobic Interval Training in Testicular Cancer Survivors
This study evaluates the impact of a supervised 12-week high-intensity aerobic interval exercise program (versus a self-directed exercise usual care group) on traditional and novel cardiovascular disease risk factors and surrogate markers of cardiovascular- and overall-mortality in a population-based sample of testicular cancer survivors.
