A Clinical Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of BioTTT001 in Patients with Recurrent/progressive High-grade Glioma.
This study is a single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expanding Phase Ⅰb/Ⅱ clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, biodistribution characteristics and preliminary efficacy of recombinant human nsIL12 oncolytic adenovirus injection (BioTTT001) in patients with recurrent/progressive high-grade glioma.
Recurrent High-grade Glioma
BIOLOGICAL: BioTTT001 injection
Incidence of adverse events, The incidence and severity of all types of adverse events evaluated based on NCI-CTCAE5.0, 28 days within BioTTT001 injection|DLT、MTD and/or RP2D, Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)、Dose-limiting toxicity（DLT）、Recommended Phase II Dose（RP2D）, 28 days within BioTTT001 injection|OS12, 12-month survival rate, 12 months
Phase Ⅰb Dose Escalation Study:Three dose groups were established in the dose escalation phase, namely 1.0×10\^10 VP, 5.0×10\^10 VP and 2.5×10\^11 VP. The traditional "3+3" dose escalation method was used for dose escalation, with at least 3 subjects enrolled in each dose group, and each subject received only one corresponding dose until the MTD and/or RP2D were determined.It is planned to enroll 12\~18 subjects, and the final sample size of enrollment depends on the number of DLT, the number of dose groups that are escalated before the DLT is observed, and the determination of the MTD.

Phase Ⅱ Dose Expansion Study:In this phase, one dose group was selected for a dose expansion study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of BioTTT001 in patients with recurrent/progressive high-grade glioma.It is planned to select 1 dosage that may be used for phase Ⅰ clinical research to expand enrollment, and it is planned to enroll 10\~30 subjects.
