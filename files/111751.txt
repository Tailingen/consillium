Transbronchial Ablation for Peripheral Lung Tumor
The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of navigation bronchoscopy guided transbronchial ablation for the treatment of inoperable peripheral lung tumor.
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency ablation|PROCEDURE: Microwave ablation
Local control rate, Local control rate was defined as the proportion of the complete ablation and incomplete ablation of the tumor., Three months after ablation
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was defined from the first day after ablation to progression of target lesions and/or appearance of new lesions or death., From the time of treatment to the time of disease progression or death, assessed up to 1 year|Overall survival（OS）, Overall survival（OS) is evaluated after the treatment of ablation until the patient death., From the time of treatment to the time of the patient death, assessed up to 3 years|Cancer-specific survival, The cause of death is related to the patient's underlying malignancy., From the time of treatment to the time of the patient death, assessed up to 3 years
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE 4.0, Complications refer to serious operation-related adverse events during and after the operation,such as pneumothorax, bleeding and infection., From the time of treatment to the complication occured, assessed up to 1 month
The study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of navigation bronchoscopy guided transbronchial ablation for treating inoperable malignant lung tumor. The study is designed as a single-center prospective trial. The participating centers are Department of pulmonary medicine and endoscopy, Shanghai Chest Hospital,Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. Patients are divided into two groups, including radiofrequency ablation group and microwave ablation group. Sixty patients are expected to be enrolled into the study with 30 patients in each group.
