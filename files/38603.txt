A Phase I Study of AK138D1 in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, first-in-human, Phase I clinical study aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor efficacy of AK138D1 in subjects being treated for advanced solid tumors.

This study is comprised of two parts: the dose-escalation and dose-expansion stages. Dose-escalation stage aims to determine the MTD/MAD, while the dose-expansion stage is designed to establish the RP2D.
