Triple Therapy for Intermediate-advanced HCC With BDTT (TALENP002)
This is a multicenter, Single-arm, Real-world Study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), Lenvatinib combined with Tislelizumab (Triple Therapy) for patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) with bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT).

Objective response rate, ORR, The Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the complete response (CR) rate or the partial response (PR) rate according to mRECIST., Four weeks after the initiation of medication until the day before surgery
Overall survival, OS, The Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time between receiving treatment and observing death or loss of follow-up for any reason., From date of enrollment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Progression free survival, PFS, The Progression free survival (PFS) was defined as the time between the start of treatment and the progression of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic tumors, or the occurrence of death or loss of follow-up for any reason., From date of enrollment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months|The Disease control rate, DCR, The Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the complete response (CR) rate or the partial response (PR) rate or stable disease (SD) rate according to mRECIST., Four weeks after the initiation of medication until the day before surgery|Conversion resection rate, CRR, The Conversion resection rate (CRR) was defined as the patient who reach the resectable criterion after treatment and accepted operation., Four weeks after the initiation of medication until the day before surgery|Toxicity Adverse events, Grade 1-5 AEs according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0., From the initiation of medication, with recordings made whenever an adverse reaction occurs, assessed up to 12 months
Surgical resection is considered to be the treatment of choice for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) combined with bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT), but a significant proportion of patients with HCC combined with BDTT are unable to undergo surgical treatment at the time of initial diagnosis. For patients with unresectable advanced HCC combined with BDTT, conversion therapy is particularly important. Currently, there is relatively little literature related to the conversion treatment of HCC with BDTT. Several studies have confirmed that the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), lenvatinib, combined with Tislelizumab (Triple Therapy) for the treatment of intermediate-advanced HCC can achieve better efficacy with an acceptable safety. However, there are no clinical studies or relevant literature reports on Triple Therapy for the treatment of HCC with BDTT. The present study is a multicenter, Single-arm, Real-world Study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a triple therapy for the treatment of patients with HCC with BDTT.
