A Phase II Study of Rituximab Combined With CHOP in T-cell Angio-immunoblastic Lymphoma
To evaluate the efficacy and the safety of a front-line treatment combining CHOP regimen and rituximab in patients aged 60 to 80 years with previously untreated AIL.
Untreated T-cell Angioimmunoblastic Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Doxorubicine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Vincristine
Overall Response Rate (ORR), \[Complete response (CR), Complete response unconfirmed (CRu)\] after the end of treatment., 8 months (4 cycles of treatment + 4 cycles of consolidation)
Event-free survival (EFS) relapse for complete responders, disease progression, early discontinuation of treatment for toxicity or modification of treatment., Events being death from any cause, 2 years|Overall survival (OS), 2 years|Time to progression (TTF), 2 years|Disease-free survival (DFS)., 2 years|number of SAE, 2 years
This is a multicentric, open-label, non-randomized clinical study, evaluating the efficacy and the safety of a front-line treatment combining CHOP regimen and rituximab in patients aged 60 to 80 years with previously untreated AIL.

It is anticipated that 25 subjects will be enrolled over 2 years (from 2005 / 2007).Analysis performed every 5 patients (based on triangular test).

The duration of the treatment period is approximately 25 weeks and patients are followed until Death.

The total Duration of the study is expected to be 2.5 years.
