Aspirin or Rivaroxaban Thromboprophylaxis for Patients With Multiple Myeloma
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of aspirin and rivaroxaban in thromboprophylaxis in Chinese MM patients at high risk for MM-associated VTE.
Multiple Myeloma|Venous Thromboembolism
DRUG: Aspirin 100mg|DRUG: Rivaroxaban 10mg
Incidence of VTE within 6 months, Participants will receive a chest X-ray (or lung CT scan) and a color Doppler ultrasound of the limb blood vessels before the study begins, and then once monthly for the next six months., 6 months
Side effects of aspirin and rivaroxaban within 6 months, Testing indicators, including blood routine, urine routine, stool routine, liver and kidney function tests, electrolytes, blood glucose, and blood lipids, will be recorded before the study begins and then once weekly for the next six months. Other observational indicators, such as hemorrhagic events, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, will also be recorded., 6 months
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the most common and dangerous complications of Multiple Myeloma (MM). The occurrence of VTE can disrupt treatment plans, compromise patients' quality of life, and even threaten their lives, presenting significant challenges in clinical management. Although several guidelines recommend risk-stratified thromboprophylaxis, there is a deficiency in prospective validation, and most initial studies were conducted in Western cohorts. This prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of aspirin or rivaroxaban in preventing VTE in Chinese MM patients who are at high risk for VTE.
