Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Chemotherapy Versus Placebo Plus Chemotherapy in Participants With Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma (MK-3475-585/KEYNOTE-585)-China Extension
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3745) in the neoadjuvant (prior to surgery) or adjuvant (after surgery) treatment of previously untreated Chinese adults with gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma. No formal hypothesis testing will be done.

Event-free Survival (EFS) Per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) - Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP Treatment Arms, EFS is based on RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator and is defined as the time from randomization to the first of the following events: radiographic disease progression per RECIST 1.1; local or distant recurrence as assessed by computer tomography (CT) scan or biopsy if indicated (for participants who are disease free after surgery); clinical progression as evidenced by peritoneal carcinomatosis confirmed by preoperative laparoscopy or laparotomy (for participants who are confirmed to be free of peritoneal involvement by laparoscopy at screening); or death due to any cause. A second primary malignancy, or radiographic progressive disease (PD) during the neoadjuvant phase that does not preclude successful surgery (i.e., disease free after surgery), are not considered EFS events., Up to approximately 42 months|Pathological Complete Response (pathCR) Rate - Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP Treatment Arms, PathCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants having a pathCR. pathCR is defined as no invasive disease within an entirely submitted and evaluated gross lesion, and histologically negative nodes., Up to approximately 9 weeks following completion of neoadjuvant treatment (up to Study Week 18)|Overall Survival (OS) - Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP Treatment Arms, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. OS is presented for the Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP treatment arms., Up to approximately 42 months|Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs) - Pembrolizumab+FLOT and Placebo+FLOT Cohorts, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The FLOT cohort was not enrolled in China per specifications in the protocol Supplemental Statistical Analysis Plan (sSAP) amendment and no data were collected for the FLOT cohort in China., Up to approximately 42 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE) - Pembrolizumab+FLOT and Placebo+FLOT Cohorts, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The FLOT cohort was not enrolled in China per specifications in the protocol sSAP amendment and no data were collected for the FLOT cohort in China., Up to approximately 17 months
Number of Participants Who Experience One or More Adverse Events (AEs) - Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP Treatment Arms Separately and in Combination With the Pembrolizumab+FLOT and Placebo+FLOT Cohorts, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who experience at least one AE is presented for Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP treatment arms. The FLOT cohort was not enrolled in China per specifications in the protocol Supplemental Statistical Analysis Plan (sSAP) amendment and no data were collected for the FLOT cohort in China. There is no FLOT cohort in China to combine with XP/FP arms., Up to approximately 42 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE) - Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP Treatment Arms Separately and in Combination With the Pembrolizumab+FLOT and Placebo+FLOT Cohorts, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be presented for Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP treatment arms. The FLOT cohort was not enrolled in China per specifications in the protocol sSAP amendment and no data were collected for the FLOT cohort in China. There is no FLOT cohort in China to combine with XP/FP arms., Up to approximately 23 months|Disease-free Survival (DFS) Per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) - Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP Treatment Arms, DFS is defined as the time from post-surgery baseline scan until the first occurrence of local/distant recurrence or death from any cause and is based on RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator., Up to approximately 42 months|Overall Survival (OS) - Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP Treatment Arms in Combination With the Pembrolizumab+FLOT and Placebo+FLOT Cohorts, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The FLOT cohort was not enrolled in China per specifications in the protocol sSAP amendment and no data were collected for the FLOT cohort in China. There is no FLOT cohort in China to combine with XP/FP arms., Up to approximately 42 months|Event-free Survival (EFS) Per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) - Pembrolizumab+XP/FP and Placebo+XP/FP Treatment Arms in Combination With the Pembrolizumab+FLOT and Placebo+FLOT Cohorts, EFS is based on RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator and is defined as the time from randomization to the first of the following events: radiographic disease progression per RECIST 1.1; local or distant recurrence as assessed by CT scan or biopsy if indicated (for participants who are disease free after surgery); clinical progression as evidenced by peritoneal carcinomatosis confirmed by preoperative laparoscopy or laparotomy (for participants who are confirmed to be free of peritoneal involvement by laparoscopy at screening); or death due to any cause. A second primary malignancy, or radiographic progressive disease (PD) during the neoadjuvant phase that does not preclude successful surgery (i.e., disease free after surgery), are not considered EFS events. The FLOT cohort was not enrolled in China per specifications in the protocol sSAP amendment and no data were collected for the FLOT cohort in China. There is no FLOT cohort in China to combine with XP/FP arms., Up to approximately 42 months
The China extension study will include participants previously enrolled in China in the global study for MK-3475-585 (NCT03221426) plus those enrolled during the China extension enrollment period. A total of approximately 120 Chinese participants will be enrolled.
