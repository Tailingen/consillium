BIOLOGICAL: Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16, 18) Vaccine (Escherichia coli)
Number of Subjects With CIN2+ and/or VIN2+ and/or VaIN2+ Associated With HPV-16 and/or -18 Cervical Infection on 90m and 114m after dose 1, To observe the number of Subjects With Histopathologically-confirmed CIN2+ and/or VIN2+ and/or VaIN2+ Associated With HPV-16 and/or -18 Cervical Infection on 90m and 114m after dose 1, expected 2-3 years|Number of Subjects With HPV-16 and/or -18 persistent cervical infection(6-month+ definition) on 90m and 114m after dose 1, To detect the HPV16 and HPV18 DNA on the gynecological specimens ( Cervical exfoliated cell specimens and biopsy specimens) collected from the subjects, expected 2-3 years
Anti-HPV16 and anti-HPV18 type-specific IgG antibody level on 90m and 114m after dose 1, To detect the anti-HPV 16 and anti-HPV 18 seroconversion rates and geometric mean concentrations on 90m and 114m after dose 1, expected 2-3 years
This is a follow-up study that is based on phase III clinical study of a recombinant human papillomavirus 16/18 bivalent vaccine in females aged 18-45 years (Unique Protocol ID: HPV-PRO-003, Identifiers: NCT01735006). The investigators will recruit people who have participated in phase III clinical study before and to evaluate the durability of protection and immuno-persistence of the bivalent HPV vaccine on 90m and 114m after dose 1.
