Study of CPI-200 in Patients With Advanced Tumors
This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, non-randomized study of CPI-200 in patients with advanced tumors. CPI-200 is administered via intravenous infusion using an accelerated titration method followed by a conventional 3 + 3 study design to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: CPI-200
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), • To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which is defined as the dose level at which fewer than 33% of patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) using a 3+3 strategy as assessed by CTCAE, 21 days
Rate of Clinical Benefit, • To assess clinical benefit by response rate and resolution of symptoms, which will be reported as response rate (%) of participants, through study completion, an average of 4 months|Rate of Adverse Effect, • To assess adverse effect as either treatment-related or non-treatment-related as defined by CTCAE, which will be reported as % of participants, through study completion, an average of 4 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), • To evaluate maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of CPI-200 in patients tested, 8 Days|Area Under the Curve (AUC), • To evaluate area under the curve (AUC) of CPI-200 in patients tested, 8 Days
Primary Objectives:

• To determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-200 in patients with advanced tumors

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CPI-200
* To evaluate clinical response and resolution of symptoms after CPI-200 treatment
* To characterize adverse events of CPI-200 in patients with advanced cancers

Up to 7 dose levels of CPI-200 will be tested using an accelerated titration method followed by a conventional 3 + 3 dose escalation study design. MTD will be defined as the dose associated with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of patients at the dose level tested. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following events occurring from the intravenous injection of CPI-200 within 21 days:

* All Grade 4 or greater adverse events as determined by CTCAEv5 criteria, excluding toxicities clearly related to disease progression or inter-current illness
* Any Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity with the exception of Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea if lasting less than 72 hours, alopecia, or Grade 3 fatigue if lasting less than 7 days as determined by CTCAEv5 criteria
* Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in the presence of bleeding
* Grade 3 or greater febrile neutropenia
* Any hematologic or non-hematologic adverse events or abnormal laboratory value(s) related to CPI-200 that result(s) in permanent study discontinuation of study treatment
