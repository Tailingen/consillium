FLT PET/MR for Evaluation of Pseudoprogression in Patients With Brain Lesions
This is a single arm, single center study of 15 patients with brain lesions being treated at UNC Hospitals. Subjects will undergo one (1) FLT-PET-MRI scan before their scheduled surgical biopsy of their brain lesion(s).

Sensitivity and specificity of FLT-PET-MRI in distinguishing between recurrence and radiation necrosis, with surgical biopsy as gold standard, 1 week post-surgical biopsy
Identifying imaging biomarkers of metastatic brain tumor treatment response could allow early modification of treatment by determination of tumor progression vs. treatment related effects (pseudo-progression, radiation necrosis). Earlier treatment response assessment could reduce cost, improve clinical trial efficiency and allow better assessment of prognosis. The development of PET/MRI offers the possibility of combining the functional imaging of PET with the exquisite soft tissue contrast and physiologic imaging capabilities of MRI. Combining FLT-PET imaging with MRI may allow better evaluation of new and unclear lesions in brain metastatic disease. The goal of this study is to explore FLT-PET imaging combined with dynamic MR imaging techniques for the identification of tumor response markers in metastatic brain tumors.
