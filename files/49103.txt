Arsenic Trioxide and Itraconazole in Treating Patients With Advanced Basal Cell Cancer
This pilot clinical trial studies how well arsenic trioxide and itraconazole work in treating patients with basal cell cancer that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Itraconazole may help treat fungal infections in patients with basal cell cancer. Giving arsenic trioxide with itraconazole may work better in treating basal cell cancer.
Skin Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Arsenic Trioxide|DRUG: Itraconazole|OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis
Change in Gli levels, Nonparametric methods (Wilcoxon sign rank test) will be used given then the continuous outcome and small sample size., Baseline to up to 1 month
Tumor response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, Proportion of subjects with complete response, partial response, stable disease, or disease progression by RECIST criteria., At 3 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the response of arsenic trioxide/itraconazole in patients with refractory basal cell carcinoma.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if this treatment is associated with a reduction in Gli messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels in tumor and/or normal skin biopsy samples, when compared to baseline levels.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive arsenic trioxide orally (PO) and itraconazole PO daily for 50 days, followed by maintenance therapy consisting of 2 weeks off treatment and then 2 weeks on treatment for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
