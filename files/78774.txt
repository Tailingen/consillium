Phase I Study of Fruquintinib(HMPL-013) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Fruquintinib (HMPL-013) is a novel oral small molecule that selectively inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3 and has demonstrated potent inhibitory effects on multiple human tumor xenografts. This first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics , safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of HMPL-013 at single doses and multiple doses .
Tumor
DRUG: Fruquintinib
Safety in the first 28-Days of Therapy, The primary endpoint is evaluation of safety during the first 28-day cycle of therapy following the initiation of multiple dosing of HMPL-013. The safety variables to be evaluated in this study are adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs (specifically including blood pressure), clinical laboratory evaluations including serum chemistry, hematology , and urinalysis (with detailed sediment analysis, proteinuria, and 24-hour urine for collection for protein), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) in triplicate., 28-Days after Permanent Discontinuation of HMPL-013
Objective Response Rate ï¼ˆORR), Anti-tumoral efficacy will be assessed by best radiographic response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v 1.0) at baseline (Day -14 to -1) and at the end of two 28-Day cycles of therapy . For patients that continue on repeat 28-Day cycles after the primary evaluation period, progression will be assessed after each two 28-Day cycles of therapy., every 8 weeks until end of treatment|Pharmacokinetic Assessments for AUC, Cmax and Tmax, In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles of HMPL-013 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of HMPL-013 on Day 1 to Day 3. At multiple-dose, PK sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 1,4,8,12 hour time points on days 1,14,28 of dosing in the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 2, 3, 7, 15 and 29 of the first 28-Day cycle of therapy, Day 1-3 Single Dose and Day 1-28 Steady State
This will be an open-label, phase I study. This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of HMPL-013 after a single administration followed by a 28-Day continuous course of therapy; evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy in an open-label administration of at the MTD. All subjects of this study will be permitted to continue therapy with only safety monitoring and bimonthly assessments for progression, if the product is well tolerated and the subject has stable disease or better.
