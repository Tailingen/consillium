Study of Radiation Therapy in Combination With Darolutamide + Degarelix in Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and second leading cause of cancer-related death. Men with PCa have a wide range of possible outcomes if the cancer has not spread and is classified as Intermediate-Risk PCa (IR-PCa).

The standard treatment for IR-PCa is radiation therapy (RT) with or without hormone therapy which can result in cure in some men. In other men, the cancer can come back or spread to other areas of the body. Treatment response in men with IR-PCa is highly variable. This uncertainty has led to significant under- and over-treatment.

This study aims to find out if the addition of intensive treatment (hormonal therapy: darolutamide + degarelix) to standard treatment for PCa will work better than standard treatment alone. To do this, some participants will receive hormone therapy and others will not. All participants will receive RT.

Currently, it is difficult to identify men who may require more intensive therapy. Current methods, such as using prostate specific antigen (PSA) alone, may not give the doctor enough information about who requires more intensive treatment. The researchers conducting this study believe that a particular arrangement of cancer cells \[called intraductal carcinoma (IDC)\] and the presence of a genetic marker called SChLAP1 can be used to identify people who would benefit from more intensive therapy.

Hormonal therapy such as with drugs called darolutamide (new drug for PCa) and Degarelix, reduce androgens (male hormones, such as testosterone) or block their effect on the cells. PCa cells require androgens to grow and divide, so removal of androgens may be effective in preventing the return of cancer following radiation therapy.

Although darolutamide has been studied in about 1000 men with PCa and seems promising and well tolerated it is considered an experimental drug, therefore it can only be used in a research study such as this one. Degarelix has been approved by Health Canada to treat PCa.

This is a phase 2, open label, randomized, controlled study and will be conducted across sites in Canada. To qualify, men must have IR-PCa and have both SChLAP1 and IDC present or both absent. Participants will be randomized to receive RT with hormone therapy or RT only. The study treatment period is 6 months for the RT + hormone therapy group. RT will take about 1-2 weeks. All participants will be followed for 5 years with multiple visits to assess safety and treatment effects.
