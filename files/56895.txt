Improving Germline Testing in At-Risk Patients With Prostate Cancer
A quality improvement initiative to improve rates of germline testing among men with prostate cancer through the use of an in-clinic educational session.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Educational intervention.
Feasibility of a patient educational program to improve germline genetic testing for eligible patients with prostate cancer., Accrual rate from study activation, 1 year|Rate of germline genetic testing rate among adult prostate cancer patients who are recommended to receive germline testing per NCCN guidelines., Rate of patients agreeing to proceed with germline testing among those approached with the educational intervention., 1 year
Patient baseline knowledge of germline testing and the change in knowledge of germline testing with the educational intervention., Assessment via baseline and post intervention knowledge questionnaire., 18 months|Patient baseline attitudes towards germline testing and assess the impact of an education interventional on patient perceptions of germline testing, Assessment via baseline and post intervention questionnaire., 18 months|Impact of germline testing results on prostate cancer management, Assessment via clinician survey upon receipt of germline testing results., 18 months|Prevalence of pathogenic germline mutations in patient population, Assessment via tabulation of all germline pathogenic, likely pathogenic mutations and and variants of uncertain significance., 18 months
This is a prospective single arm quality improvement initiative for the use of a standardized educational intervention on germline testing in prostate cancer to improve the rates of germline genetic testing among patients recommended for testing. Patients who consent to the study will undergo a one-on-one education session regarding the rationale and the benefits/risks of germline testing. Following the educational session, if a patient wishes to proceed with testing, they will sign the standard consent to proceed with germline testing via a commercial assay.
