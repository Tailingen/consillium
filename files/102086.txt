Image-guided and Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy Versus External Beam Radiotherapy for Patients With Spine Metastases
The aim of this explorative trial is to verify the comparability of a fractionated intensity modulated radiotherapy with a conventional radiotherapy related to quality of life on the one hand and to evaluate toxicity, re-calcification and stability of vertebral body as well as pain relief and local response for palliative patients with painful spinal bone metastases on the other hand. This is a single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial with parallel-group design to determine the quality of life after RT in patients with spinal bone metastases. Two different techniques were evaluated: intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and fractionated conventional external beam RT with 10×3 Gy each.

Experimental intervention:

IMRT 10 x 3 Gy

Control intervention:

3D-RT 10 x 3 Gy
Vertebral Bony Metastases
RADIATION: IMRT|RADIATION: fractionated RT
quality of life, improvement of more than 10% according to the EORTC BM22 questionaire measured at the 3-months-time-point after the end of RT (t2)., 3-months-time-point after the end of RT
bone density, bone density is assessed 12 weeks post completion of radiotherapy using follow-up CT scan of the spine, 12 weeks post completion radiotherapy|pain reduction, pain is evaluated using the VAS pain scale (0-100 points) at completion and 12/ 24 weeks post completion of radiation, end of treatment, 12 and 24 weeks post completion of radiotherapy|Fatigue, Fatigue is assessed using the EORTC FA13 questionnaire, 12 and 24 weeks post completion of therapy

Experimental intervention:

IMRT 10 x 3 Gy

Control intervention:

3D-RT 10 x 3 Gy After the baseline measurements have been recorded, the patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups: IMRT 10×3 Gy (n = 30) or fractionated conventional 3D-RT 10×3 Gy (n = 30). The RT will be applied daily (mondy to Friday).

Follow-up per patient:

The target parameters will be measured and recorded at baseline, at the end of RT (t1), and at 12 weeks (t2) and 6 months (t3) after the end of the irradiation period.
