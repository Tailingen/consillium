This study included two distinct cohorts of CML-CP patients; that is, patients with CML-CP who initiated 3L for CML-CP (i.e., 3L cohort) and patients with CML-CP with T315I mutation (i.e., T315I cohort).

Study design for the analyses of the 3L cohort:

* The index date: date of initiation of 3L therapy for CML-CP
* The study period: period of ≥ 24 months following the index date unless the patient died before
* Patient characteristics were measured at CML diagnosis and at the index date
* The clinical outcomes of interest were measured during the study period

Study design for the analyses of the T315I cohort:

* The index date: date of initiation of a line of therapy identified as the T315I line of interest (i.e., identification of T315I mutation before initiation or over the course of line of therapy)
* The study period: period of ≥ 24 months following the index date unless the patient died before
* Patient characteristics were measured at CML diagnosis and at the index date.
* The clinical outcomes of interest were measured during the study period
