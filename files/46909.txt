Metabolic Changes in Patients With Chronic Cardiopulmonary Disease
This study aims to evaluate prevalence of sarcopenia and cachexia in patients with chronic cardiopulmonary disease. The investigators will also investigate metabolic disorders like glucose metabolism, presence of metabolic syndrome, body composition and histological changes in skeletal muscle and body fat. Finally, patients will be followed for clinical endpoints.
