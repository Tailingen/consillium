Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Treatment W/High Dose Melphalan Given Directly Into the Liver Followed by Treatment W/approved Cancer Treatment or Approved Cancer Treatment Alone in Patients W/ Metastatic Colorectal Cancer W/liver Dominant Disease
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if using a liver-directed therapy with high dose chemotherapy followed by approved cancer treatment to treat patients with colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver is safe and tolerable. The clinical trial will also learn if the liver-directed therapy with high dose chemotherapy works on the disease in the liver. Investigators will compare the use of the liver-directed therapy with high dose chemotherapy followed by approved cancer treatment or approved cancer treatment alone.

Participants will:

* Undergo up to two liver-directed therapy with high dose chemotherapy procedures followed by approved cancer treatment or take approved cancer treatment alone
* Visit clinic at least every two weeks for checkups and tests
* Complete scans approximately every two months

Safety and Tolerability, Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) Changes from baseline in physical examination findings, vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (ECHO) parameters, assessed from signed informed consent form until study completion
This is an open-label, randomized, multi-center study in which patients with liver dominant refractory mCRC will be randomized 2:1 to receive melphalan/HDS (2 cycles) followed by trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab treatment (Arm A) or trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab alone (Arm B).

Approximately 90 patients will be randomized 2:1 to the two treatment arms (Arm A, n=60; Arm B, n=30). Patients will receive one of the following treatments:

* Arm A: Patients will be treated with melphalan/HDS 3.0 mg/kg ideal body weight (IBW) for two treatment cycles. The second melphalan/HDS treatment will be administered 8 weeks after the first treatment with an acceptable delay of up to 2 weeks (10 weeks total) to allow for recovery of melphalan-related toxicity, if needed. Tumor response will be assessed every 8 weeks (Â± 3 days) during melphalan/HDS treatment, i.e., prior to Cycle 2 of melphalan/HDS and prior to the start of trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab treatment.
* Arm B: Patients will be treated with standard regimen of trifluridine-tipiracil and bevacizumab.

In both treatment arms, treatment with trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab will continue until disease progression, death, intolerable adverse events, consent withdrawal, principal investigator decision, or termination of study by Sponsor.

Cross-over: There will be no cross-over between the two arms of the study. Efficacy and Safety Assessment: Evaluation of tumor response will be determined by the local principal investigator using RECIST 1.1 criteria. Tumor response evaluation and patient management will be according to the principal investigator assessment of images and patients' clinical needs. Patients with progressive disease (PD) will be discontinued from study treatment and will be followed for survival until withdrawal of consent or death.

Study treatment will be discontinued if recovery from treatment related toxicity requires more than 2 weeks from the end of the treatment cycle during melphalan/HDS cycles (Arm A only), or more than a 28-day delay in the start of the next cycle of trifluridine-tipiracil plus bevacizumab; the end of treatment (EOT) visit will be conducted at that time or within 4 weeks.

Safety will be monitored continuously by documentation of AEs, SAEs, clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs, and physical examination.

Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB): A DSMB including independent (non-investigator) clinicians will oversee the emerging patient safety profile during the study. The DSMB will review study data on a regular basis according to the DSMB Charter.
