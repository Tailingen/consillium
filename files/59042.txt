Immunological Function After Radiation With Either Proton or Photon Therapy
This is a pilot prospective observational cohort study, comprising patients with head and neck cancer (HNSCC) treated with standard of care definitive (chemo)radiation either with photons or protons. Patients will be assigned for protons or photons based on the guidelines of the National Indication Protocol for Proton therapy of the Netherlands.

Immunological function will be evaluated by the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Blood samples will be collected at baseline, during (chemo)radiation (end of week 3 and/or before week 4 of treatment) and after completion of (chemo)radiation (week 9, week 12, week 20, week 34 and week 60, respectively 1 week, 5 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after completion of (chemo)radiation). To quantify immunological function, PBMCs collected during (chemo)radiation and after (chemo)radiation will be compared with that before (chemo)radiation (week 0), using IFN-γ-ELISPOT to screen for the presence of antigen-specific T-cell responses. Furthermore, flow cytometry panels will be used to determine global changes in immune cell proficiency.

Histological evaluation will take place at baseline and week 3 to examine changes in immune infiltration within tumour tissue during proton versus photon (chemo)radiation. This biopsy part of the study is optional for the patient. Archival tissue from the biopsy that was taken at diagnosis will be used for the baseline assessments. Biopsy at week 3 week will be taken for all patients who agree to participate in this optional part of the study.

The difference in antigen-specific immunity in HNSCC patients undergoing (chemo)radiation with protons versus photons., Antigen-specific immunity will be assessed by monitoring antigen-specific T-cell responses in peripheral blood before, during and after (chemo)radiation (up to 12 months after completion of (chemo)radiation) to viral peptides such as SARS-CoV-2 peptides and CEF peptides (CMV, EBV and Influenza)., At baseline (week 0), during (chemo)radiation (week 3) and after (chemo)radiation (week 9, week 12, week 20, week 34 and week 60, respectively week, 5 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after completion of (chemo)radiation)
Differences in composition and function of circulating immune cells during and after (chemo)radiation with protons versus photons., Differences in composition and function of circulating immune cells will be determined by flow cytometry-based assays using marker for e.g. T- and B-lymphocytes and different myeloid cells such as derived suppressor cells., At baseline (week 0), during (chemo)radiation (week 3) and after (chemo)radiation (week 9, week 12, week 20, week 34 and week 60, respectively week, 5 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after completion of (chemo)radiation)|Immune infiltrate composition within the primary tumour tissue before and during (chemo)radiation with photons versus protons (optional part of the study)., Immunohistological staining will be performed on these tumour tissues to assess changes in the composition of immune cells after (chemo)radiation with protons versus photons These assays include molecular analyses and immunohistochemical staining to characterize the type of the intratumoral immune cell infiltrate. In particular, immunohistochemical staining to identify immune cell populations and T cell subpopulations within the tumour tissue can be applied, including, but not limited to, CD4, CD8, FoxP3, CD20, CD163, CD68, PDL1 and PD1. Both changes in absolute numbers and ratios of different immune cell types will be assessed., At baseline (week 0) and during (chemo)radiation (week 3)
