Cytokine Induced Killer Cells Stimulated by DC Immunotherapy for Renal Cell Carcinoma
30% of renal cell carcinoma patients have metastases, mostly in lung, liver and bones at the time of diagnosis. Because of poor response to radiation therapy or chemotherapy, several studies have been initiated to find alternative therapeutic options.

Cytokine induced killer cells(CIK) are an unique population of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with a characteristic CD3+ CD56+ phenotype; they can be generated from cytokine cocktail-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). CIK cells represent strong anti-tumor cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly,the anti-tumor activity of CIK cells can be enhanced by incubation with dendritic cells (DC), which are the most potent antigen (Ag)-presenting cells.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of DC-activated CIK cell treatment following regular therapy and the effects of this therapy on immune responses in patients with renal cell carcinoma after surgery.
