Study of Anti-5T4 CAR-raNK Cell Therapy in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This study is a multicenter, open-label, investigator-initiated trial (IIT), divided into dose escalation (Part A) and dose extension (Part B) phases to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacokinetics (PD) and initial efficacy of conjugated antibody redirecting ready-to-use allogeneic NK (CAR-raNK) cells that target trophoblast glycoprotein (5T4) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-5T4 CAR-raNK Cells
Part A: Incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLTs), To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and determine the RP2D of Anti-5T4 CAR-raNK Cells, From day1 to day 21|Part A: Number of Adverse Events (AEs), To evaluate the safety of Anti-5T4 CAR-raNK Cells, From day 1 to day 90 after the last dose|Part B: Objective response rate (ORR), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of Anti-5T4 CAR-raNK Cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Part B: Disease control rate (DCR), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of Anti-5T4 CAR-raNK Cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Part B: Duration of remission (DOR), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of Anti-5T4 CAR-raNK Cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Part B: Progression-free survival (PFS), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of Anti-5T4 CAR-raNK Cells, Up to 1 year after infusion|Part B: Overall survival (OS), To determine the anti-tumor effectivity of Anti-5T4 CAR-raNK Cells, Up to 1 year after infusion
The number of CAR-raNK cells, Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to detect the number of CAR raNK cells in peripheral blood, From day1 to day 21|Cytokine release, Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to detect serum Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to detect the cytokine (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α) concentration, From day1 to day 21|Lymphocyte subtype, Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to analyze the lymphocyte subtypes (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56)., From day1 to day 21|Anti-CAR antibodies, Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to detect anti-CAR(anti-5T4 mAb) antibodies, From day1 to day 21
Part A is a dose escalation study to evaluate maximum toxic dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) which adopts the 3+3 dose escalation design protocol. The dose is respectively 3.0×10\^9 live cells, 6.0×10\^9 live cells and 9.0×10\^9 live cells (if the safety of dose group with 9.0×10\^9 live cells is still good, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will co-decide whether to continue the dose escalation and the specific dose based on the obtained data on safety, efficacy, and PK). The 3.0×10\^9 live cell dose group is given on days 1 and 3 of each cycle (21 days), and the follow-up dose group is given on days 1 and 8 of each cycle (21 days).3-6 subjects will be enrolled at every dose level. The first and second subjects in the same group shall be enrolled at an interval of at least 7 days, for the purpose of ensuring their safety. Only when the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of all subjects in the previous dose group was observed can the enrollment of the next dose group get started.

Part B is the dose extension study. After recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is determined in Part A, the SMC will discuss whether to conduct the Part B study. This stage will be carried out in different tumor types with high expression of 5T4 antigen, and 6 to 10 subjects will be enrolled in each tumor type, and all subjects will receive anti-5T4 CAR-raNK cell therapy at RP2D level. Every 21 days is one cycle, and the administration is performed on day 1 and day 8 of each cycle.
