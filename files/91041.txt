Exercise for Gut Microbiome in Patients With Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Undergoing Chemotherapy: The COURAGE Trial
This research study is a randomized controlled trial that will observe changes in microbiome activity, changes in chemotherapy toxicity, and any changes in treatment outcomes between two groups of participants undergoing chemotherapy with either early-stage or metastatic colorectal cancer.

The names of the study groups involved in this study are:

* Exercise
* Waitlist Control
Colorectal Cancer|Metastatic Colon Cancer|Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Exercise Program
Gut Microbiome Genomes, Gut Microbiome Sequencing will be conducted using the stool samples at Baseline and Post-Intervention. Gut Microbiome sequencing will be performed using DNA and RNA extraction, which will analyze microbial genomes., Baseline (Week 1) and Post-intervention (Week 13)
Change in Chemotherapy Toxicity, To evaluate changes in chemotherapy toxicity following a exercise intervention in survivors of young-onset CRC undergoing chemotherapy., 12 weeks
This research study is a single-center, two-armed, randomized controlled trial that will observe changes in microbiome activity, changes in chemotherapy toxicity, and any changes in treatment outcomes between two groups of participants undergoing chemotherapy with either early-stage or metastatic colorectal cancer. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group A: Exercise group (EXE) vs. Group B: Waitlist control group (WC). Randomization means that a participant will be placed into one of the study groups by chance.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, blood tests, stool samples, and survey questionnaires.

Participation in this research study will last up to 6 months.

It is expected that about 84 people will take part in this research study.

The American Cancer Society is providing funding for this research study.
