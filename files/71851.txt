Orelabrutinib in Combination With Thiotepa in Refractory and Relapsed Primary CNS Lymphoma
The purpose of this study was to investigate the maximum tolerated dose and efficacy of Orelabrutinib combined with Thiotepa in refractory and relapsed primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).
Refractory and Relapsed Primary CNS Lymphoma|PCNSL|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Orelabrutinib|DRUG: Orelabrutinib|DRUG: Thiotepa
Part 1 Dose Escalation：The maximum tolerated dose (MTD), To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) up to 21 days|Part 2 Dose Expansion：ORR (Investigator-Assessed), The overall response rate (ORR) including complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete (CRu) and partial response (PR) according to the 2005 Response Criteria of the International Primary CNS Lymphoma Collaborative Group (IPCG), Up to 2 years
Part 1 Dose Escalation：Objective response rate (ORR), The objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR, CRu or PR, Up to 2 years|Part 1 Dose Escalation：Compelet response rate (CRR), The complete response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or CRu, Up to 2 years|Part 1 Dose Escalation：Duration of overall response (DOR), The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement, Up to 2 years|Part 1 Dose Escalation：Disease control rate (DCR), The disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR, CRu, PR or SD, Up to 2 years|Part 1 Dose Escalation：Progression-free survival (PFS), The progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, Up to 2 years|Part 1 Dose Escalation：Overall survival (OS), The overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death., Up to 2 years|Part 2 Dose Expansion：Compelet response rate (CRR), The complete response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR or CRu, Up to 2 years|Part 2 Dose Expansion：Duration of overall response (DOR), The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement, Up to 2 years|Part 2 Dose Expansion：Disease control rate (DCR), The disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of CR, CRu, PR or SD, Up to 2 years|Part 2 Dose Expansion：Progression-free survival (PFS), The progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first, Up to 2 years|Part 2 Dose Expansion：Overall survival (OS), The overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death., Up to 2 years|The toxicity profile of the orelabrutinib and thiotepa combination therapy, All subjects who received at least one dose of OT will be included in the safety analysis. Adverse events will be graded by the investigator according to the NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0., Up to 2 years
Describe the tumor mutation profile by NGS, DNA from tumor tissue and CSF will be sequencing by next generation sequencing (NGS).Identify the PNCSL-related variants and gene expression alterations by NGS., Up to 2 years
