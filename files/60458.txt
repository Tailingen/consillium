Safety, Tolerability & PK of KX2-361 in Subjects w Adv. Malignancies Refractory to Conventional Therapies
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the study drug KX2-361 and to determine how much of the study drug enters the bloodstream, in patients with advanced malignancies that have not responded to conventional therapies.
Advance Malignancies
DRUG: KX2-361
Define MTD, The Maximum Tolerated Dose is defined as one dose level below where two or more subjects experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT)., 12 months
Safety and Tolerability assessed by adverse events and changes in laboratory parameters, Patient incidence of adverse events will be displayed by dose group and by system organ class. Adverse events will also be summarized by severity and relationship to the study drug. Laboratory parameters assessed will include vital signs, history and PE, assessment of toxicity, complete blood count w differentials and reticulocytes, serum chemistry (incl. RDB, LFT serum amylase and serum lipase), PT (or INR/PTT), urinalysis, and ECG assessment., 24 months|Pharmacokinetics (rofile pharmacokinetic outcome measures, e.g. Cmax, Tmax, AUCt, AUC0-inf, t½, CL, and Css), Plasma concentrations of KX2-361 will be analyzed to determine profile pharmacokinetic outcome measures, e.g. Cmax, Tmax, AUCt, AUC0-inf, t½, CL, and Css etc., 24 months|Activity in escalation and expansion cohorts (according to the RECIST criteria, CHESON criteria, or the Modified RANO), Activity response for the Dose Escalation Cohort portion of the study will be assessed by the investigator according to the RECIST criteria, CHESON criteria, or the Modified RANO criteria. The Expansion Cohort will utilize the Modified RANO criteria only for response measurements., 24 months
