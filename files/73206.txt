A Multiple-Dose Study of RhuMab 2C4 and Docetaxel in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the combination of rhuMab 2C4 (Perjeta) and docetaxel (Taxotere) in participants with advanced solid tumors that have progressed during or after standard therapy, or for which no standard therapy is available. Participants will be enrolled and evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in escalating-dose cohorts in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: RhuMab 2C4
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Docetaxel in Combination of Pertuzumab, A prior dose level was defined as an MTD if at a certain dose level, there were greater than or equal to (≥) 2 out of 6 participants who had Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). If there were no DLTs or DLTs were seen in less than (\<) 2 participants in the highest dose level, that was considered as MTD. Participants received escalating doses of docetaxel and pertuzumab until DLTs were observed. DLTs were defined as any of the following: 1) Any non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 except for fever, chills and flu-like symptoms, in spite of adequate toxicity management, 2) Grade 4 neutropenia lasting greater than (\>) 7 days, 3) Febrile neutropenia, 4) Thrombocytopenia Grade 4 or any thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusion or 5) Any subjectively intolerable toxicity felt by the investigator to be related to either one of the compounds., Cycle 1 Up to Day 15
Plasma Decay Half Life (t1/2) for Pertuzumab in Combination With Docetaxel, The biological half-life or terminal half-life of pertuzumab is the time in days it takes for it to lose half of its pharmacologic activity., Cycle1: Day 2 Pre-dose and 15 minutes, 1.5, 4 and 8 hours Post-dose, and Days 3, 6, 9 and 16; Cycle 2: Day 1 Pre-dose and 15 minutes Post-dose on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) for Pertuzumab in Combination With Docetaxel, Cmax refers to the maximum (or peak) serum concentration that a drug achieves in a specified compartment or test area of the body after the drug has been administrated and prior to the administration of a second dose and is measures as micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL)., Cycle1: Day 2 Pre-dose and 15 minutes, 1.5, 4 and 8 hours Post-dose, and Days 3, 6, 9 and 16; Cycle 2: Day 1 Pre-dose and 15 minutes Post-dose on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22|Area Under the Concentration Curve From Time Zero to the Last Visit (AUC [0-last]) for Pertuzumab in Combination With Docetaxel, The area under the plot of plasma concentration of drug against time after drug administration is defined as the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC0-last is calculated from time 0 (prior to administration of medication) to last measured data point. The AUC is of particular use in estimating the bioavailability of drugs, by measuring the extent of absorption. AUC is measured as micrograms times days per milliliter (μg\*day/mL)., Cycle1: Day 2 Pre-dose and 15 minutes, 1.5, 4 and 8 hours Post-dose, and Days 3, 6, 9 and 16; Cycle 2: Day 1 Pre-dose and 15 minutes Post-dose on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22|AUC From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC [0-infinity]) for Pertuzumab in Combination With Docetaxel, The AUC0-infinity is calculated from time 0 (prior to administration of medication) to infinity (the time of complete elimination of the drug). The AUC is of particular use in estimating the bioavailability of drugs, by measuring the extent of absorption. AUC is measured as μg\*day/mL., Cycle1: Day 2 Pre-dose and 15 minutes, 1.5, 4 and 8 hours Post-dose, and Days 3, 6, 9 and 16; Cycle 2: Day 1 Pre-dose and 15 minutes Post-dose on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22|Clearance (Cl) of Pertuzimab in Combination With Docetaxel, Clearance (expressed as volume/time) describes the removal of drug from a volume of plasma in a given unit of time (drug loss from the body). It is measured as milliliters per day (mL/day)., Cycle1: Day 2 Pre-dose and 15 minutes, 1.5, 4 and 8 hours Post-dose, and Days 3, 6, 9 and 16; Cycle 2: Day 1 Pre-dose and 15 minutes Post-dose on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22|Volume of Distribution (Vz) at Steady State of Pertuzumab in Combination With Docetaxel, The volume of distribution at steady state (Vz), also known as apparent volume of distribution, is a pharmacological, theoretical volume that the total amount of administered drug would have to occupy (if it were uniformly distributed), to provide the same concentration as it currently is in blood plasma., Cycle1: Day 2 Pre-dose and 15 minutes, 1.5, 4 and 8 hours Post-dose, and Days 3, 6, 9 and 16; Cycle 2: Day 1 Pre-dose and 15 minutes Post-dose on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22|Mean Residence Time (MRT) of Pertuzumab, MRT is the average time that pertuzumab is present in the systemic circulation and is measured in days., Cycle1: Day 2 Pre-dose and 15 minutes, 1.5, 4 and 8 hours Post-dose, and Days 3, 6, 9 and 16; Cycle 2: Day 1 Pre-dose and 15 minutes Post-dose on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22|Percentage of Participants by Best Overall Response Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria, Best Overall response was evaluated as Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) or Progressive Disease (PD). CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions. PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameters. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters since the treatment started. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters of the target lesions recorded since the treatment started, including screening, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. If participants withdrew due to insufficient therapeutic response or death and had no tumor measurements at the final visit, they were counted under progressive disease for final visit., Weeks 7 (Cycle 2),13 (Cycle 4) and Final Visit Up to 22 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Decrease in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) by Category of Decrease and Timepoint, Ejection fraction (EF) is the fraction of outbound blood pumped from the heart with each heartbeat. It is commonly measured by echocardiogram and serves as a general measure of a person's cardiac function. Changes in LVEF were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 criteria. The decrease in LVEF has been categorized as follows: A) Increase, no change, decrease from baseline less than (\<) 10%; B) Absolute value \<50% and decrease from baseline greater than or equal to (≥) 10%; C) Absolute value \<50% and decrease from baseline≥15% ; D) Other.
