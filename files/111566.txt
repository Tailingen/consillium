Pre-operative Hormonal Treatment for Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer
To investigate prospectively whether short term endocrine treatment can induce molecular changes, predictive for therapy response.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Anastrozole|DRUG: Anastrozole+Fulvestrant|DRUG: Tamoxifen|DRUG: Tamoxifen
Decrease in tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis., At baseline and after 2-6 weeks of endocrine treatment
Comparison of changes in gene expression after different endocrine treatment exposures, At baseline and after endocrine treatment
We will perform a randomized, open-label, single-institution study. It will compare the efficacy of three different endocrine treatment regimens (Anastrozole +/- Fulvestrant or Tamoxifen) in changing proliferation-index and inducing apoptosis during a 2-6 week pre-operative treatment period in breast cancer patients. These results will be correlated to gene expression profiles, phosphorylation status of the ER, SNPs in CYP450 sequences, tamoxifen metabolite concentrations, changes in estrogen serum levels and protein expression patterns.
