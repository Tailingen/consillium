Real-world Study of Local Therapy Changes During 1L Lorlatinib in Unresectable ALK+ NSCLC
This real-word study is designed to prospectively explore whether local treatment (surgery, ablation, radiotherapy and others) can prolong the time to treatment discontinuation during 1L lorlatinib treatment in Chinese patients with unresectable ALK+ NSCLC. Participation in this study is not intended to change the routine treatment received as determined by their attending physicians. Patients will be treated according to the routine medical practice in terms of visit frequency and types of assessments performed.
Lung Cancer, Non-Small Cell
DRUG: Lorlatinib 100 mg
Time-to treatment discontinuation (TTD), Time-to treatment discontinuation is defined as the time from start of treatment to the date of discontinuation of these therapeutic methods., From November 2024 to April 2027
Objective Response Rate (ORR), proportion of patients with a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as a best response during the lorlatinib treatment. Responses to treatment will be defined according to investigator, From November 2024 to April 2027|Duration of response (DOR), time between the first documentation of objective response and the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause whichever occurred first, for participants with a confirmed objective response of CR or PR., From November 2024 to April 2027|Time to Progression (TTP), Based on Investigator's Assessment, From November 2024 to April 2027|Intracranial Objective Response Rate (IC-ORR), proportion of patients with intracranial objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as a best response in the subset of patients with at least 1 intracranial lesion assessed by investigator., From November 2024 to April 2027|Intracranial Time to Progression (IC-TTP), Time from inclusion to the date of the first documentation of disease progression of intracranial disease, based on either new brain metastases or progression of existing brain metastases., From November 2024 to April 2027|Overall Survival (OS), Time from inclusion to date of death from any cause., From November 2024 to April 2027|Safety: To explore the adverse events (AEs), the dose modification and the reason for interruption or discontinuation of lorlatinib in first line for Chinese patients with ALK-positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC recorded in medical records, From November 2024 to April 2027|Proportion of patients experiencing a 10-points change from baseline in total score for the EORTC QLQ-C30, evaluate Health-related Quality of life (HRQoL) of ALK- positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients treated with lorlatinib in first-line using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires, From November 2024 to April 2027|Dynamic molecular response, Mutational Analysis; measured by next-generation sequencing (NGS) if available in real world setting;, From November 2024 to April 2027|Safety and tolerability of the therapeutic changing mode, Safety profile according to CTCAE v.5, From November 2024 to April 2027
Dynamic ctDNA change during lorlatinib treatment, Plasma samples collected at several timepoints, analyzed by next-generation sequencing, From November 2024 to April 2027|Biomarkers of sensitivity or resistance to lorlatinib in no-prior ALK-TKIs treatment tumor tissue and peripheral blood if available in real world setting, From November 2024 to April 2027
