Study for Treatment With TH-4000 (Tarloxotinib) in Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutant, T790M-negative Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients
This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of TH-4000 a hypoxia-activated prodrug, in patients with EGFR-Mutant, T790M-Negative, Advanced NSCLC.

Hypoxic volume as measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) hypoxia imaging, Baseline
A single arm open label multi-center Phase 2 study in which the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability and efficacy of TH-4000 will be assessed in patients with EGFR mutant, T790M negative advanced NSCLC. Patients must have demonstrated progression during EGFR TKI therapy.

Hypoxia PET scans will be obtained in select centers to analyze potential predictors of tumor response.
