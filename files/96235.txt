Phase 1 Study of OTS167 in Patients With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of an investigational drug called OTS167. OTS167 is a maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) inhibitor which demonstrated antitumor properties in laboratory tests. It is being developed as an anti-cancer drug. In this first-in-human study OTS167 will be administered to patients with solid tumors which have not responded to treatment.
