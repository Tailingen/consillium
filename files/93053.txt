Detection in Tandem Endocuff Cap Trial
A randomised back to back study comparing cap and Endocuff to detect adenomas during colonoscopy
Colonic Neoplasms|Adenomas Serrated|Colo-rectal Cancer|Colon Adenoma
DEVICE: Endocuff|DEVICE: cap assisted colonoscopy (CAC)
Adenoma miss rate, Comparison of adenoma miss rate between cap ( CAC) and Endocuff assisted colonoscopy(E, 1 day
Mean adenoma per procedure, Difference in mean adenomas detected per procedure (MAP) between EAC and CAC., 1 day|Endocuff or cap exchange, Number of times Cap or Endocuff are removed to complete the procedure, 1 day|Ceacal intubation and withdrawal time, Comparison of caecal intubation and withdrawal time, 1 day|miss rate of advanced polyps, Comparison of miss rates of advanced adenomas, serrated polyps and proxima polyps between CAC and EAC, 1 day|Comfort score, Comparison of patient comfort score between CAC and EAC, 1 day
comparison of surveillance intervals, To compare any surveillance interval difference between CAC and EAC, Once histology is available usually takes 10-14 days
