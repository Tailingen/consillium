A Phase I, Bioequivalence Study to Evaluate Two Formulations of Bendamustine (BDM) Hydrochloride (HCl) Administered to Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that a new formulation of an Bendamustine (BDM) Hydrochloride (HCl) is bioequivalent (BE) (similar) to the commercially available product in patients with cancer.
Cancer Which Has Either Progressed or Relapsed After Standard Therapy, or for Which no Curative or Standard Therapy is Appropriate
DRUG: Test Product (Bendamustine)
To demonstrate bioequivalent area under the time concentration curve (AUC) for both drug products, Each patient will receive 3, single doses of study medication in a 56 day treatment period (2 cycles of 28 days each). Medication will be administered on Cycle 1, Day 1; Cycle 1, Day 2; and Cycle 2, Day 1. Each patient will receive 1 dose of Eagle-BDM and 2 doses of Teva-BDM in 3 randomly assigned, varying treatment sequences(Eagle-BDM, Teva-BDM, Teva-BDM; Teva-BDM, Eagle-BDM, Teva-BDM; or Teva-BDM, Teva-BDM, Eagle-BDM). Pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed., Participants will be in the study for up to 65 days
This is an open-label, randomized, crossover, Phase I study intended to demonstrate the BE, and safety and tolerability profile of 2 formulations of BDM HCl administered to cancer patients: Eagle-BDM and Teva-BDM Histologically confirmed diagnosis of any malignant disease (solid tumors and hematologic malignancies are eligible) for which no curative or standard therapy is appropriate.

At the end of the study, patients may be enrolled into an open-label extension (OLE) study (Study EGL-BDM-C-1301-OLE), at the discretion of the investigator.
