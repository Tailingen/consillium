Efficacy of Targeted Therapy Combined Chemotherapy in Advanced EGFR Positive NSCLC Patients
This study is a randomized, multicenter clinical study ，which is designed to compare the efficacy of the safety and efficacy of treatment every 6 weeks in EGFR positive (Non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC) with concurrent Driver gene mutations，who used EGFR-TKI with or without combined chemotherapy，estimated with stable efficacy (CR, PR, and SD) .In this study, subjects will be randomly assigned to the following two groups according to a 1:1 ratio:(A) Standard programme group, EGFR-TKI targeted therapy; (B) controlled programme group, EGFR-TKI targeted therapy combined chemotherapy(pemetrexed plus carboplatin for 4 cycles )
Non-small-lung-cell Cancer|NSCLC|EGFR Gene Mutation
DRUG: EGFR-TKI|DRUG: EGFR-TKI combined with chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus carboplatin)
progression-free survival, Patients with oncological diseases have a period of time from the start of treatment to the observation of disease progression or death due to any cause, three years|objective response rate, Refers to the proportion of patients whose tumor shrinkage reaches a certain amount and remains for a certain period of time, including CR + PR cases, three years
overall survival, The time from randomization to death due to any cause. For subjects who have been lost to follow-up before death, the time of the last follow-up is usually calculated as the time of death., three years
This study is a randomized, multicenter clinical study aimed at EGFR positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects with concurrent Driver gene mutations who have not previously received systematic treatment. After comparing EGFR-TKI alone or EGFR-TKI combined with chemotherapy for 4 cycles, after the efficacy evaluation was stable (CR, PR, and SD), the safety and clinical efficacy of maintenance therapy every 6 weeks were compared. The eligible subjects in this study will be randomly assigned into the following two groups according to the 1: 1 ratio: (A) Standard programme group, EGFR-TKI targeted therapy; (B) controlled programme group, EGFR-TKI targeted therapy combined chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus carboplatin for 4 cycles ) During the course of the trial treatment, if the subject develops disease (the first PD), the researcher will decide whether to continue the medication according to the patient's situation and communicate with the patient, as follows: After the first PD of the subject, the researcher decides whether to continue the treatment with the original regimen according to the disease state of the subject. At least 4 weeks later, the tumor is evaluated again. If the tumor progresses again (the second PD), the subject's study treatment ends and the follow-up period is entered; if there is no progress, the original regimen is continued.

The primary end point was descriptive analysis of progression-free survival and Objective response rate.The secondary end point of this study was to compare the incidence of treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events between the standard group and the controlled group. Using RECIST 1.1 as the evaluation standard, the independent imaging evaluation committee (IRRC) conducted the evaluation. For the first time to evaluate PD, regardless of whether they continue to study treatment after progression, the date of the first PD evaluated by IRRC will be used for all statistical analysis containing progress information.
