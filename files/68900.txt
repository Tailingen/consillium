Herbal Treatment to Improve Chemotherapy Delivery
This study is designed to:(1) determine the efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) 'Tonifying Spleen and Kidney Sequential Regimen' (TSKSR) in improving the completion rate of 8-cycle CapeOX chemotherapy in patients with stage II (high-risk)\& III colon cancer;(2) evaluate the efficacy of the TCM-TSKSR on adverse events of CapeOX chemotherapy and it's impact on patients' quality of life (QoL).A randomized,double-blinded,placebo-controlled clinical trial including seven centers will be conducted in Mainland China.The study will enroll patients with stage II (high-risk)\& III colon cancer who have completed radical surgery and are going to receive CapeOX chemotherapy.All participants will receive chemotherapy as prescribed by their treating physicians and be randomly assigned to either concurrent use of TCM-TSKSR or placebo.

Each question ranged from 1 to 5., 6months|Incidence of AEs, Adverse effects(AEs) includes abnormal results of blood/urine/stool routine examination, liver/renal function test and electrocardiograms., 6months|Incidence of SAEs, Serious Adverse effects(SAEs) includes abnormal results of blood/urine/stool routine examination, liver/renal function test and electrocardiograms., 6months
CapeOX chemotherapy is a combination therapy of Oxaliplatin 130mg/m\^2 IV on 1st day and Capecitabine 1000mg/m\^2 PO twice daily from 1th day to 14th day,21 days for each course of treatment.Adverse effects of chemotherapy,such as myelosuppression and gastrointestinal reactions,may lead to dose reductions,treatment delays or even discontinuation among cancer patients. According to IDEA study,the completion rate of 8-cycle CapeOX chemotherapy in colorectal cancer patients is 64%,which means that nearly 4 in 10 patients could not complete adjuvant chemotherapy as planned,which may negatively impact patients' survival outcomes.Some prior studies have shown that TCM can improve patients' symptom control and QoL during adjuvant chemotherapy,which may further improve the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. However,there is a lack of definitive evidence to evaluate the effects of TCM in stage II(high-risk)\& III colon cancer patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy after radical surgery.The study will be conducted between 2018 and 2021.Four hundred participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group.
