DNA Methylation Combined With Artificial Intelligence Imaging to Identify Lung Nodules
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths,and the key to reducing mortality in lung cancer patients is early diagnosis and treatment.Currently,peripheral blood DNA methylation is a novel in vitro molecular marker for tumors.Meanwhile artificial intelligence diagnostic system can further improve the diagnostic ability.The purpose of this study is to apply the overall DNA methylation level (i.e.,methylation profile) and the altered methylation degree of specific genes as tumor diagnostic indexes,and combined with the artificial intelligence imaging technology for the early and accurate diagnosis of lung cancer,to achieve the early detection,diagnosis,and treatment of lung cancer,and to effectively reduce the mortality rate of lung cancer.
Lung Cancer Diagnosis
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: DNA methylation joint AI imaging
Efficacy of early diagnosis of benign and malignant lung nodules by blood DNA methylation results combined with AI imaging, Construction of a diagnostic model for DNA methylation combined with AI imaging. Comparing the results of the model with pathologic diagnosis, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV)., 10 months
