Safety, Feasibility and Cost-effectiveness of Genotype-directed Individualized Dosing of Fluoropyrimidines
In this study it will be determined whether the rate of severe toxicity associated with fluoropyrimidine treatment (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil) can be significantly diminished by individualized dosing of fluoropyrimidines based on upfront genotypic assessment of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.

In addition to the genotyping, the DPD phenotype of all patients will be determined by measuring the baseline dihydrouracil/uracil (DHU/U) ratio, in order to investigate whether phenotype-guided treatment can further improve patient safety. In a subgroup of patients, other phenotyping methods will be tested: measuring the plasma levels of uracil after a uracil test dose and a uracil breath test after a dose of \[2-13C\] -labeled uracil. To validate these tests, these phenotyping results will be compared with the results of a DPD activity assay (which measures DPD enzyme activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells), which is considered the gold standard in measuring DPD phenotype.
Neoplasms
DRUG: Fluoropyrimidine (capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil)
Safety: incidence of severe treatment-related toxicity (CTC grade 3 to 5), The incidence of severe treatment-related toxicity (CTC grade 3 to 5) in patients carrying DPYD variants compared to wild type patients and compared to a historical cohort of DPYD heterozygous patients treated with a full dose of fluoropyrimidines, patients will be followed during fluoropyrimidine treatment, expected average of 1 year
Cost-effectiveness: medical costs that are made during fluoropyrimidine treatment seen from a health care perspective, Costs in the group where dose individualization of fluoropyrimidines based on upfront genotyping is performed is compared to a historic cohort without dose individualization. Costs include costs for genotyping, fluoropyrimidine drug therapy and costs related to adverse events., patients will be followed during fluoropyrimidine treatment, expected average of 1 year|DPD phenotype, defined as deficient or not deficient, Several phenotyping tests that assess DPD enzyme activity will be compared and clinical sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of each test will be determined, Prior to start of fluoropyrimidine treatment of the patient (pre dose)|Assessment of pharmacokinetics: Such profile parameters will include Cmax, Tmax, AUC and elimination half-life, In patients with heterozygous DPYD mutations the plasma levels of capecitabine, 5-FU and metabolites will be determined to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in these patients given reduced doses of capecitabine and 5-FU, At first week of start of fluoropyrimidine treatment of the patient
