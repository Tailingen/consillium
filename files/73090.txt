A Study of Donafenib Plus S-1 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer After Chemotherapy With Nab-paclitaxel Plus Gemcitabine Regimen
This is a single arm, open label Phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of donafenib combined with S-1 in treating Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer after chemotherapy with Nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine regimen.
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Donafenib|DRUG: S1
Overall Survival, To evaluate the overall survival of patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed with NG (Nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine) regimen after treatment with Donafenib combined with S-1., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Progression Free Survival, To investigate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed with NG (Nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine) regimen after treatment with Donafenib combined with S-1., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Overall Response Rate, To evaluate the overall response rate of patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed with NG (Nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine) regimen after treatment with Donafenib combined with S-1., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Incidence of Adverse Events, Adverse events of patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed with NG (Nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine) regimen after treatment with Donafenib plus S-1., through study completion, an average of 1 year
While NG ( Nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine) is one of the preferred first-line chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer, we have to investigate possible therapeutic options after NG regimen. In this single arm, open-label clinical trial, metastatic pancreatic cancer patients will be received donafenib and S-1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks until the disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity, death or begin a novel therapeutic.

The efficacy and safety data will be assessed through OS, ORR, DCR, PFS,TTP and adverse effects as graded by NCI CTC-AE 5.0.
