Candonilimab Plus Bevacizumab for Patients With Advanced HCC Who Progressed on A+T
To explore the efficacy and safety of candonilimab plus bevacizumab for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who progressed on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Candonilimab|DRUG: Bevacizumab
DCR per RECIST 1.1, DCR （Disease Control Rate） include complete response, partial response and stable Disease per RECIST 1.1, 12 months
Overall survival (OS), OS is the length of time from the date of randomization until death from any cause., 12 months|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first objectively documented tumor progression or death due to any cause., 12 months|ORR per RECIST 1.1, Objective response rate (complete response+partial response) per RECIST 1.1, 12 months|Adverse events, Safety will be evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. All observations pertinent to the safety of the study medication will be recorded on the CRF and included in the final report., 30 days|Biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression, The blood specimen and needle biopsy specimen would be collected, 12 months
Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is the first-line treatent for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the second-line treatment is absent for patients who progressed on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab. Candonilimab is a humanized bisspecific monoclonal antibody against PD-1/ CTLA-4 IgG1. Candonilimab plus lenvatinib showed strong anti-tumor effect, with objective response of 44%. This single-arm, prospective, phase 2 trial is to explore the efficacy and safety of candonilimab plus bevacizumab for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who progressed on atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.
