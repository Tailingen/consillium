A Study to Evaluate the Long-term Safety of Patients With Advanced Lymphoid Leukemia Who Have Been Previously Administered With UCART19
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of UCART19 administration to patients with advanced lymphoid leukemia.
Advanced Lymphoid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: UCART19 follow-up
Long-term safety of UCART19 with or without alemtuzumab, * Number, duration, outcome of all adverse events (AE) within 12 months post last UCART19 infusion
* Number, duration, outcome of adverse events of special interest (AESI) up to the end of the study
* Proportion of patients with adverse events leading to death up to the end of the study
* For paediatric patients: assesment of the potential impact on growth curve and puberty, Up to 15 Year
