Study of MLN2480 in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors Followed by a Dose Expansion in Participants With Metastatic Melanoma
This is a phase 1, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, dose escalation study. The study will be conducted in 2 stages, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. The Dose Escalation phase will include participants with solid tumors (including melanoma) who have failed or are not candidates for standard therapies or for whom no approved therapy is available. The Dose Expansion phase will include participants with metastatic melanoma.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The ORR assessment was based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. CR: was disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeter (mm). PR: was at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameter (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD., Baseline up to EOSV (up to Cycle 38 Days 52 [Q2D] and 58 [QW] [Cycle length =22 days (Q2D) and 28 days (QW)] in Escalation Phase; Cycle 49 Day 58 [Cycle length =28 days] in Expansion Phase)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was the time from first dose date of study drug to date of the first documentation of confirmed progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever occurred first. The PFS assessment was based on RECIST 1.1. PD: at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the SOD of target lesions. PFS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimate and presented with 2-sided 95% confidence interval. Participants with no response assessment were censored at the date of first dose., Baseline up to the date of first document PD, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first (up to Cycle 38 Days 52 [Q2D] and 58 [QW] [Cycle =22 days (Q2D) and 28 days (QW)] in Escalation Phase; Cycle 49 Day 58 [Cycle =28 days] in Expansion Phase)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was assessed from the first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented PD and was censored at the date of the last assessment for responders who died without documented PD and for responders who were still alive and had not progressed. DOR assessment was based on RECIST v1.1. CR: was disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: at least 30% decrease in SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD persistence of one or more non-target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. PD: at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.
