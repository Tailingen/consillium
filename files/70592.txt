ClariCore System Used in Transperineal Prostate Biopsy
The overall objective of this study is to acquire ultrasound images, spectral data and prostate tissue biopsy cores using the ClariCore System via a transperineal approach.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: ClariCore System
Correlation of histopathology of tissue with ultrasound images and spectral data, The correlation of histopathology of tissue biopsy core samples with the corresponding spectral data and ultrasound images obtained in vivo for the purpose of tissue classification algorithm development using a transperineal approach., At time of procedure
Incidence of Adverse Events (Safety), The cumulative incidence of adverse events related to the device or the procedure. The cumulative incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the device or the procedure., At time of procedure
The overall objective of this study is to acquire ultrasound images, spectral data and prostate tissue biopsy cores using the ClariCore System via a transperineal approach. Ultrasound images corresponding to each needle insertion and T2-weighted MR scans will be saved for the purpose of further algorithm development that will provide physicians with real time tissue classification in conjunction with location information from the ultrasound imaging.
