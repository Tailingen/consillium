A Study to Test How Different Doses of BI 1703880 in Combination With Ezabenlimab Are Tolerated in People With Different Types of Advanced Cancer (Solid Tumours)
This study is open to adults with different types of advanced cancer. People can take part if previous treatment was not successful, or no treatment exists.

The purpose of this study is to find the highest dose of a medicine called BI 1703880 that people with advanced cancer can tolerate when taken together with ezabenlimab.

BI 1703880 and ezabenlimab are medicines that may help the immune system fight cancer. In this study, BI 1703880 is given to people for the first time.

Participants get BI 1703880 and ezabenlimab as infusions into a vein. During the first 6 weeks, they get BI 1703880 once a week. Later, they get BI 1703880 every 3 weeks. After the first 3 weeks, they get ezabenlimab in addition every 3 weeks.

Participants can get BI 1703880 for up to 1 year and ezabenlimab for up to 2 years as long as they benefit from treatment and can tolerate it. During this time, they visit the study site regularly. At these visits, the doctors check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects.
