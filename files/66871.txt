SHP2 Inhibitor ET0038 Monotherapy in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, dose-finding study to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of ET0038 in patients with advanced solid tumors. It is anticipated that approximately 37 subjects will be enrolled in the dose-escalation phase of the study. ET0038 will be administered orally once daily (QD) in 21-day treatment cycles.

pERK, On treatment versus baseline comparison of pharmacodynamic marker pERK (Phosphorylated form of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase) on newly obtained tumor biopsy samples by IHC., Approximately 2 years|NGS test of RTK/MAPK pathway genes, Next-generation sequencing (NGS) test will be performed with the tumor tissues or plasma ctDNA collected before ET0038 treatment, to detect gene alterations within the RTK/MAPK pathway. Detected gene alteration data (including but not limited to mutation, insertion, deletion, amplification, translocation...) will be further analyzed for correlation with the anti-tumor activity of ET0038., Approximately 2 years
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study of oral ET0038 monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors. The study will include 2 components: 1) a Dose-Escalation Component for participants with advanced solid tumors and 2) a Dose-Expansion Component for participants with advanced solid tumors harboring certain specific mutations/rearrangements that result in hyperactivation of the RAS-MAPK pathway. Participants will be treated until disease progression per RECIST v1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria for withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first.
