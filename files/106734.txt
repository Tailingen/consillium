Assessment of Sarcopenia at Diagnosis for Patients With Previously Untreated Metastatic Cancer or Hematologic Malignancy
Sarcopenia is defined as reduction in muscle mass and function according to the criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in older people. Initially described for elderly patients, it is also presented as a negative prognostic factor in overall survival in oncology in certain locations (lung, ENT pathways, colon, pancreas) and more controversially for hemopathies. Its screening by measurement of skeletal muscle mass by CT scan and / or PET scan against L3 and by physical functional tests is not routinely integrated despite international recommendations. Sarcopenia is one of the characteristics of patient fragility that can induce more complications, lengthen the average length of hospital stay and reduce overall survival. The PRONOPALL score, a predictor score for survival validated by a previous study, will be correlated with the presence (or absence) of sarcopenia at inclusion for patients with a solid tumor (breast, ovary, prostate cancer , kidney, lungs, pancreas, colorectal). A prospective study on 38 patients with metastatic cancer was carried out at the Victor Hugo clinic in Le Mans between 01/JUN/21 and 31/AUG/21 (SPACE, ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04714203): 25 patients were analyzable on the CT and PRONOPALL score data with a prevalence of sarcopenia of 60% and median overall survival of 14 months (unpublished data), clinical performance and muscle strength tests were not carried out (as in the publications cited above).

A prospective study for the detection of sarcopenia is indicated by extending to blood diseases with the integration of clinical tests included in the initial APA (Adapted physical activity) assessment recommended for diagnosis.
