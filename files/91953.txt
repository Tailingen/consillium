EQ-5D-5L consists of two components: a health state profile and an optional visual analogue scale (VAS). EQ-5D health state profile is comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems.

The ECOG PS is a measure of functional status. It ranges from 0 to 5, with 0 denoting perfect health and 5 death. A deterioration is considered definitive if no improvements in the ECOG PS status is observed at any subsequent time of measurement during the treatment period following the time point where the deterioration is observed., Up to 30 months
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ociperlimab in combination with tislelizumab and platinum-based doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment for participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC without actionable driver mutations.

Participants will receive study treatment every three weeks and will continue to receive it until RECIST 1.1 disease progression as determined by Investigator and confirmed by BIRC, unacceptable toxicity that precludes further treatment, treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator or participant, participant withdrawal of consent, pregnancy, lost to follow-up, or death.
