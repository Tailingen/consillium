Non-coding RNA in the Exosome of the Epithelia Ovarian Cancer
This study aims to analyze the expression of micro-RNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) by next-generation sequencing in patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and benign gynecologic diseases. The candidate miRNA/lncRNA will be validated as biomarker for the detection and prognosis of HGSOC.

GENETIC: Sequencing of miRNA/lncRNA
Differential expression of miRNA/lncRNA, Differential expression of micro-RNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) will be compared between HGSOC group and control group, hence candidate miRNA/lncRNA will be validated as biomarker for the detection and prognosis of HGSOC., One year
Progression-free survival, The progression-free survival of HGSOC patients will be compared between differential expressed candidate miRNA/lncRNA after they have completed debulking surgeries and adjuvant chemotherapy., Five years
