Use of Axillary Ultrasound to Guide Breast Cancer Management in the Genomic Assay Era
The investigators aimed to determine if axillary ultrasound can reliably distinguish between patients with limited or high nodal burden, so that the patients with limited nodal burden can potentially avoid chemotherapy and instead receive upfront surgery followed by gene assay testing.
Axillary Ultrasound
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: axillary ultrasound
the number of abnormal nodes on ultrasound, the number of abnormal nodes on ultrasound which was done at the time of diagnosis will be measured, from the date of diagnosis to the date of surgery, up to 12 weeks
