Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Participants With Advanced Melanoma (MK-3475-041/KEYNOTE-041)
This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of every-3-week dosing (Q3W) of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in participants with advanced melanoma; participants may receive pembrolizumab for up to 2 years if deriving clinical benefit. The primary study hypothesis is that treatment with single agent pembrolizumab will result in a clinically meaningful overall response rate.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the product., All AEs: Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug; Serious AEs: Up to 90 days after last dose of study drug (Up to 27 months)|Number of Participants Discontinuing Treatment Due to AEs, An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the product., Up to last dose of study drug (Up to 24 months)|Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per Central Radiology Review Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, The ORR, using RECIST 1.1, was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a confirmed Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) at any time during the study, based on central radiology review., Up to 24 months
ORR Per Investigator Assessment Using RECIST 1.1, The ORR, using RECIST 1.1 criteria, was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a confirmed Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) at any time during the study, based on Investigator assessment., Up to 24 months|ORR Per Central Radiology Review Using Immune-related Response Criteria (irRC), The ORR, using irRC, was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a confirmed Complete Response (irCR; complete disappearance of all tumor lesions, whether measureable or not, and no new lesions) or a Partial Response (irPR; decrease in sum of the products of the 2 largest perpendicular diameters of 50% or greater) at any time during the study, based on central radiology review., Up to 24 months
Participants who discontinue pembrolizumab after achieving a complete response (CR) and subsequently develop progressive disease (PD) may be eligible to enter a Second Course Phase and receive pembrolizumab again.

The end of the study for each participant will occur with: 1) the marketing approval of pembrolizumab for melanoma, 2) the completion of safety follow up or 3) the time when a possibility of entry to second course of treatment is lost, whichever occurs last.
