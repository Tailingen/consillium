Molecular Study and Precision Medicine for Colorectal Cancer
Researchers collect specimens from advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer (CRC) patients to conduct molecular profiling and establish tumor organoids (PDOs)/ patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). The aim of this study is to identify clinical actionable targets and predict in vivo response of the tumor to targeted drugs by using PDOs/ PDXs. And the above-mentioned studies will provide the patients with potential personalized cancer treatment options.

OTHER: Molecular Profiling & drug testing in tumor organoids and PDXs
Identification of effective drugs or drug combinations, Viability of organoid is measured using CellTiter-Glo by quantifying ATP, which indicates the presence of metabolically active cells., up to 3 years
Comparison of clinical actionable alterations identified in native tumor and organoids., Genomic gene mutation numbers are identified using the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)., Up to 3 years|Correlation between organoid and PDX drug sensitivities, Size of the tumor is measured to reflect the drug response., Up to 3 years
Patient-derived organoid is a model that can recapitulate the histology and behavior of the cancer from which it is derived, and is increasingly used as a tool for drug development in pre-clinical settings. Clinical treatment option of colorectal cancer now is quite limited. By molecular profiling, clinical actionable alterations may be identified. And according to the genomic investigation results, we can find the matched targeted drugs, following further testing in the organoids and PDXs. This will provide an opportunity to guide the precision medicine.
