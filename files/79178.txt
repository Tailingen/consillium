Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma - Microbiome as Predictor of Subtypes
The prospective clinical trial "PDA-MAPS - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma - Microbiome as Predictor of Subtypes" aims to investigate the prognostic and predictive power of the orointestinal and tumoral microbiome in PDAC patients and associate findings with genetic, transcriptional and clinical data, in particular with treatment response.
Pancreatic Cancer
OTHER: Oral and rectal swabs for microbiome sequencing
Progression free survival, Progression free survival of patients measured in months, 12 months upon study enrollment
Molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer, Basal and classical subtype via RNAseq from tissue samples, within 3 months of histological diagnosis|Response to chemotherapy, reponse, partial response and progress according to RECIST within 6 months of therapy initiation, up to 6 months after start of therapy
The prospective clinical trial "PDA-MAPS - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma - Microbiome as Predictor of Subtypes" aims to investigate the prognostic and predictive power of the orointestinal and tumoral microbiome in PDAC patients and associate findings with genetic, transcriptional and clinical data, in particular with treatment response. Patients with histologically confirmed PDA are enrolled at primary diagnosis and prior to oncological or surgical treatment. Rectal and buccal microbiome swabs as well as detailed clinical records are obtained from all patients. Following DNA extraction, both 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing will be performed using ONT sequencing platform. All data and clinical records are centrally stored, visualized and integrated via tranSMART and SEEK platforms.
