CD19-Synthetic T Cell Antigen Receptor(STAR)-T in B-cell Malignancies Patients
This is a single center, single arm, open-lable phase I study to determine the safety and efficacy of CD19-STAR-T cells in patients with refractory and relapsed B-cell malignancies (such as NHL and ALL ).
B Cell Malignancy
BIOLOGICAL: CD19-STAR-T cells
Percentage of adverse events, Percentage of participants with adverse events., 6 months|Objective Remission Rate(ORR), The percentage of participants who achieved complete remission (CR) and partial remission over all participants., 6 months
Relapse-Free Survival(RFS ), 6 months|Overall-Survival(OS), 6 months|Persistence of STAR-T cells in vivo, 6 months
This Phase I study is designed as a pilot trial evaluating the safety and of CD19-STAR-T cell therapy in subjects with refractory and relapsed B cell malignancies. Subjects will receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -5, -4 and -3 followed by infusion of CD19-STAR-T cells. Safety and efficacy of CD19-STAR-T cells therapy will be monitored. The purpose of current study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CD19-STAR-T cells therapy in patients with refractory and relapsed B-cell malignancies.
