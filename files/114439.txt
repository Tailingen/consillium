Diagnosis of Cancer Using Breath Samples
The purpose of this study is to collect breath samples from healthy and cancer sick patients. The breath, collected to special bags, will be transferred to laboratories in the Technion and analyzed using an electronic nose system developed in Hossam Haick's labs (Chemical Engineering, Technion). The hypothesis is that based on the analysis of the chemical bio-markers present in the exhaled breath, cancer states can be distinguished from healthy subjects or before and after treatment, allowing a technique for diagnosis of cancer and/or cancer treatment.
