NIVolumab in Subjects With Recurrent or Metastatic Platinum-refrACTORy SCCHN
Subjects will receive treatment with nivolumab monotherapy at 240mg flat dose as a 30 minute IV infusion on Day 1 of a treatment cycle every 2 weeks (14 days) until confirmed progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal of consent. This study is designed to better evaluate the safety profile of nivolumab in a large series of patients with Recurrent or Metastatic (R/M) Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck. The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of high-grade (CTCAE v 4.03 Grade 3 or higher), treatment-related, select adverse events.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
DRUG: Nivolumab 240 MG in 24 ML Injection
Incidence of high-grade (CTCAE v 4.03 Grade 3 or higher) treatment related AE, To determine the incidence of high-grade (CTCAE v 4.03 Grade 3 or higher), treatment-related, select adverse events in patients with Recurrent or Metastatic Platinum-refractory Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) treated with nivolumab monotherapy;, From baseline to 100 days after last study treatment
Incidence of all high-grade (Grades 3-5), select adverse events;, To determine the incidence and to characterise the outcome (duration of serious adverse events \[SAE\] treatment, dose of immune-modulating agents \[ie, steroids\] dose of agents used, time to event onset, and event resolution, and worst grade of event) of all high-grade (CTCAE v 4.03 Grade 3 or higher) adverse events, From baseline to 100 days after last study treatment|Overall Survival, Defined as the time from first study treatment to death from any cause, At study end 2 years from last patient enrolled|Objective Response Rate, defined as the proportion of response-evaluable patients with a best overall response of CR or PR, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first (up to 24 moths)
This clinical trial has established head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as responsive to immunotherapy and nivolumab as a new potential SOC for these patients. As concern safety, high-grade (CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 or higher), treatment-related, select adverse events occur with a low frequency in patients with Recurrent or Metastatic Platinum-refractory Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN) treated with nivolumab monotherapy. Nonetheless, this observation arises from patients treated in clinical trial and selected according to clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. Therefore they may not precisely reflect the clinical practice. Using a single large study is warranted in order to expand the safety database and to improve the knowledge on estimated incidence of uncommon, select, high-grade AEs.
