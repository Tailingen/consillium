Study of a 1-Millimeter Resolution Clinical Positron Emission Tomography (PET) System in Head and Neck Cancer Imaging
The purpose of this study is to gain initial experience imaging HNC patient using a new PET camera, a 1mm spacial resolution. The goal is to understand image quality of the system and to see how it works in a clinical environment.
Head and Neck Cancer
DEVICE: 1-mm Resolution Clinical PET camera
Acquiring PET images of HNC patients with the 1 mm resolution PET imaging device., PET images of HNC patients with the 1 mm resolution PET imaging device will be qualitatively accessed whether the camera can visualize the primary lesion, including heterogeneity and lymph nodes will be assessed., Day 1
Measure image quality of the 1 mm resolution PET imaging device, Image quality of the 1 mm resolution PET imaging device (scale 1-5) with 5 being highest 'image quality' will be assessed to understand radioactive dose and scan time required for a given desired image quality., Day 1
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S): Gain initial experience imaging head/neck cancer patients using a novel PET camera comprising two opposing panels with 1 millimeter spatial resolution.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S):

1. Determine the radioactive dose and scan time required for this novel 1 millimeter (mm) resolution clinical PET camera.
2. Images obtained with the 1 mm resolution PET camera will be compared to conventional PET imaging (which will serve as gold standard) for image quality and lesion/node visualization.
