Cell Therapy for CD7 Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Mixed Lineage Leukemia
This is an open, single-arm, clinical study to evaluate efficacy and safety of anti CD7 CAR-T cell in the treatment of CD7 Positive acute leukemia or mixed lineage leukemia except those who are diagnosed with T-ALL/T-LBL
Leukemia, T Cell
BIOLOGICAL: CD7 CART
Safety: Incidence and severity of adverse events, To evaluate the possible adverse events occurred within first one month after CD7 CAR-T infusion, including the incidence and severity of symptoms such as cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion|Efficacy: Remission Rate, In the presence of extramedullary lesions, complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), disease recurrence or progression (PD) shall be used to describe extramedullary lesions, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion
duration of response (DOR), duration of response (DOR), 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Efficacy: progression-free survival (PFS), progression-free survival (PFS) time, 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|CAR-T proliferation, the copy number of CD7 CAR- T cells in the genomes of PBMC by qPCR method, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|CAR-T proliferation, percentage of CD7 CAR- T cells measured by flow cytometry method, 3 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Cytokine release, Cytokine( IL-6,IL-10,IFN-γ,TNF-α ) concentration (pg/mL) by flow cytometry method, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion|Pharmacokinetics (PK) indicators, the peak concentration of Senl-T7 CAR-T cells amplified in the peripheral blood (Cmax, detected by flow cytometry and qPCR); the time taken to reach the peak concentration (Tmax), and the persistent time of the Senl-T7 CAR-T cells in vivo in patients, 24 months post CAR-T cells infusion|Pharmacodynamic (PD) indicators, the pharmacodynamic change in the clearance of peripheral blood CD7+ cells and the release of the cytokines at each observation time point, First 1 month post CAR-T cells infusion
The CARs consist of an anti-CD7 VHHs, a portion of the human CD137（4-1BB） molecule, and the intracellular component of the human CD3ζ molecule. Prior to CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After CAR-T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for adverse reactions and efficacy.

The Main research objectives:

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of CD7 CAR-T cells in patients with CD7 Positive acute leukemia or mixed lineage leukemia except those who are diagnosed with T-ALL/T-LBL

The Secondary research objectives:

To investigate the cytokinetic characteristics of CD7 CAR-T cells in patients with CD7 Positive acute leukemia or mixed lineage leukemia except those who are diagnosed with T-ALL/T-LBL
