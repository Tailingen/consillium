DFMO Maintenance for Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Ewing Sarcoma or Osteosarcoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of administering DFMO to patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma who have completed all planned therapy and have no evidence of disease.
Osteosarcoma Recurrent|Ewing's Tumor Recurrent
DRUG: DFMO
Feasibility of Administering DFMO, Feasibility will be defined as the ability to successfully administer DFMO to at least 80% of subjects who initiate therapy until either disease recurrence or completion of the maximally allowed duration of therapy. Results will be summarized using basic descriptive statistics., Up to 2 years
Event Free Survival, The number/percentage of participants with event-free survival (EFS) will be determined. Event-free survival will be defined as the time from diagnosis until drug discontinuation, disease progression, recurrence at any site, secondary malignancy, death from any cause, or last follow-up, whichever is observed first., Up to 2 years
Approximately 30-35% of patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma will develop relapsed/refractory disease and carry a very poor prognosis. DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine, commonly known as DFMO or eflornithine, is a synthetic analog of the amino acid ornithine. DFMO has been studied in a number of different cancers as either a therapeutic or a chemopreventative agent and is now FDA approved to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma. As DFMO has now been given to over 100 children with metastatic cancer, dosing and safety in this population is well established. Given the stagnant survival rates for children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma over the past few decades, this study will explore the feasibility of using DFMO in patients with relapsed osteosarcoma and relapsed Ewing sarcoma who are without any evidence of disease at the end of therapy in order to prevent disease recurrence.
