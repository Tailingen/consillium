This is a phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GX-I7 in combination with bevacizumab in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma.

A total of 20 patients will be enrolled in the study and administered bevacizumab GX-I7. The study treatment will be continued for up to 6 cycles or until a progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity is confirmed.
