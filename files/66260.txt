Phase 1A: Number of Participants Experiencing Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE could have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of an investigational product. All AEs were monitored per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version \[v\] 4.03 2010)., Day -28 through 5 years and 2 months|Phase 1A: Number Of Participants With Abnormal Physical Examination Values, A complete physical examination, vital signs (systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate), and weight were performed pre-specified time points for Phase 1A. During the treatment period, symptom-directed physical examinations were performed. If there were no complaints and no abnormal findings from the previous visit for a particular organ system, a physical examination of that organ system was not required., Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle through 30 (+/- 7) days after last dose (up to 5 years and 2 months)|Phase 1A: Number Of Participants Experiencing Dose-dependent Toxicity Through Ophthalmology Findings, Ophthalmological examinations (such as eyesight/visual acuity, fundoscopy, slit lamp microscopy, and optical coherence tomography \[or equivalent diagnostic test\]) were performed at pre-specified time points for Phase 1A.
