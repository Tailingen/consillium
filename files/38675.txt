Novel ACK1 Inhibitor (R)-9b in Patients With Prostate Cancer
TITLE: Phase 1 First in Human Trial to Assess Safety and Tolerability of the Novel ACK1 Inhibitor (R)-9bMS in Patients with Prostate Cancer (PHAROS)

STUDY DESCRIPTION: Prostate cancer (PC) patients receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), but recalcitrant disease recurs typically within 2-3 years, referred to as the Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC). Androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapies, such as Enzalutamide (Enz) or Abiraterone (Abi), are FDA-approved therapeutics for CRPC patients. However, virtually all patients develop resistance.

A non-receptor tyrosine kinase, ACK1 act as a novel epigenetic modifier in prostate tumors, regulating AR and its splice variant, AR-V7 expression. A new class of ACK1 small molecule inhibitor, (R)-9bMS, was developed that exhibited excellent drug-like properties. Treatment with (R)-9bMS suppressed Abi and Enz-resistant tumor growth in mice. Robust immune activation against prostate tumors was also reflected in mice treated with ACK1 inhibitor, (R)-9bMS. Importantly (R)-9bMS functionally reinvigorated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CRPC patients to mount a robust immune response against CRPC organoids. Collectively, these data indicate that the ACK1 inhibitor, (R)-9bMS, fulfills a unique niche, wherein it not only suppressed AR/AR-V7 within the tumor milieu, but also activated host immune system by overcoming CSK-restrained LCK activity, to mount a robust 'dual' anti-tumor response.

OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of (R)-9bMS in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Secondary Objectives: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of (R)-9bMS in patients with CRPC. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of (R)-9bMS in patients after single and multiple dose oral administration. To assess clinical outcomes and anti-tumor activity in patients treated with (R)-9bMS.

ENDPOINTS: Primary Endpoint: Frequency of dose-limiting toxicities and toxicity and severe AEs per CTCAE v 5.0.

Secondary Endpoints:

* RP2D (recommended phase 2 dose)
* PK (pharmacokinetics)
* PSA responses
* Duration of responses
* ORR (objective response rate)
* OS (overall survival)
* PFS (progression free survival)
* DSS (disease specific survival)
* Toxicity and severe AEs per CTCAE v 5.0 STUDY POPULATION: Approximately 18-30 adult patients with a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer will be enrolled.

ACK1/TNK2, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase contributes to prostate cancer pathophysiology. Activated ACK1 expression is significantly correlated with the severity of disease progression. In spite of the considerable clinical significance of pathogenic ACK1 activation in prostate \[and lung \& breast\] cancers, no ACK1 inhibitor has been tested in clinical trials to date. ACK1 inhibitor, (R)-9bMS, also known as (R)-9b, with IC50 of 13 nM, suppresses AR/AR-V7 levels and sensitizes Enz-resistant CRPCs.

STUDY DESIGN: This phase Ib single-center open-label The PHAROS trial, "Phase 1 First in Human Trial to Assess Safety and Tolerability of the Novel ACK1 Inhibitor (R)-9bMS in Patients with Prostate Cancer", will establish the safety/tolerability and recommended phase II dosing (RP2D) for (R)-9bMS. Given the unique cancer suppressing properties of the (R)-9bMS compound, its safety and tolerability and proposed Phase 2 dosing will be evaluated in a first-in-human trial in CRPC patients who have stopped responding to Enz or Abi. Post-treatment PSA levels and radiographic responses will be assessed, which will provide preliminary assessment of the efficacy; immune responses will be evaluated, which will provide exploratory assessment immunomodulation.

JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE: (R)-9bMS will be administered orally twice a day, with an interval of 12 hours between doses.

Both the 28-day rat and 28-day dog toxicity studies were conducted using the clinically-relevant mesylate salt (MS) form of the (R)-9b drug substance.

The results of the 28-day definitive toxicity studies were used to calculate a reasonably safe clinical starting dose for (R)-9bMS in the planned Phase 1 trial. The approach used is consistent with guidance provided in the ICH S9 guideline and the Senderowicz 2010 publication and involves setting the starting dose at 1/10th of the STD10 in rodents. If the nonrodent is the most appropriate species, then 1/6th of the HNSTD is considered an appropriate starting dose.

Step #1: Identifying the rodent STD10 and nonrodent HNSTD values In the 28-day toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs, the STD10 and HNSTD values were identified as 60 mg/kg/day (R)-9bMS and 45 mg/kg/day (R)-9b, respectively.

* Rat STD10 = 60 mg/kg/day (R)-9bMS
* Dog HNSTD = 33.3 mg/kg/day (R)-9b \[41.3 mg/kg/day (R)-9bMS\]

Step #2: Converting the STD10 and HNSTD dosages from units of mg/kg/day to units of mg/m2/day:

* Rat STD10 = 60 mg/kg/day X 6 (rat km value) = 360 mg/m2/day (R)-9bMS
* Dog HNSTD = 33.3 mg/kg/day X 20 (dog km value) = 666 mg/m2/day (R)-9b \[825.8 mg/kg/day (R)-9bMS\]

Step #3: The safe starting dose in humans is 1/10th of the rat STD10 or 1/6th of the dog HNSTD:

* Rat STD10 = 360 mg/m2/day ÷ 10 = 36.0 mg/m2/day (R)-9bMS
* Dog HNSTD = 666 mg/m2/day ÷ 6 = 111 mg/m2/day (R)-9b \[137.6 mg/kg/day (R)-9bMS\]

Step #4: The lower of the two dosages (in mg/m2/day) is identified as the starting dose in humans:

• 36.0 mg/m2/day \< 111 mg/m2/day

For an average 60-kg individual with a body surface area of 1.62 m2, this would be a daily dose of 58.32 mg (R)-9bMS (36.0 mg/m2/day X 1.62 m2).

One capsule containing 30 mg will be administered twice a day to patients for a total daily dose of 60 mg for the level 1 dose.

The phase I trial adopts a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design for dose escalation/stay/de-escalation. If excessive dose limiting toxicities are observed at the first dose level requiring dose reduction, the (R)-9bMS dose will be reduced to 30 mg/day. If no excessive toxicities are observed, the dose will escalate gradually following the decision rules dictated to 300 mg/day in five phases. The trial expects a maximum of 40 patients.

Dose escalations will proceed until the MTD has been reached.

Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)

* DLTs are defined as any (R)-9bMS related (TRAE) toxicity that are ≥ Grade 3 occurring within the 28 days post (R)-9bMS treatment (starting with first day of dosing), with the following caveats:

  * Grade 3 neutropenia lasting \< 7 days
  * Grade 3 thrombocytopenia without bleeding or requiring platelet transfusion
* Any ≥ Grade 3 Non-hematologic toxicities EXCEPT:

  * Grade 3 nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea lasting \< 72 hours
  * Grade 3 fatigue lasting \< 7 days
  * Any non-hematologic Grade 3 clinical laboratory AE that is asymptomatic and returns to ≤ Grade 2 within 72 hours \* Asymptomatic Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities, symptomatic Grade 3 abnormalities that persist \>72 hours despite appropriate replacement therapy will be considered a DLT
* Additionally, the following events will be considered DLTs if they occur during the first cycle:

  * Any Grade 5 toxicity
  * Any death not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes
  * Any event that meets Hy's law criteria
  * Delay in Cycle 2 due to toxicity by \> 14 days

DURATION OF THERAPY

In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for up to 1 year or until one of the following criteria applies:

* Documented and confirmed disease progression
* Death
* Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug
* Specific conditions described in the dose modifications section
* If the subject does not recover from his toxicities to tolerable grade ≤ 2 within 6 weeks, the subject will have study treatment discontinued
* Inability to tolerate the minimum protocol-specified dose of study treatment
* Participation in another clinical study using an investigational agent, investigational medical device, or other intervention
* General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unable to receive further treatment in the judgment of the investigator
* Serious noncompliance with the study protocol
* Patient withdraws consent
* Request by regulatory agencies for termination of an individual subject or all subjects under the protocol

DURATION OF FOLLOW-UP Patients will have a safety follow-up visit or a review of the medical record at 12 months to assess disease and survival status.

DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN

The entities providing oversight of safety and compliance with the protocol require reporting, as outlined below. Adverse events (AE) include the following:

1. An exacerbation, or an unexpected increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing condition, including intermittent or episodic conditions.
2. Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication under investigation.
3. A suspected drug interaction.
4. An intercurrent illness.
5. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality.

Serious adverse events (SAE) are any events occurring that result in any of the following outcomes:

1. Subject death
2. Life-threatening adverse event
3. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
4. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity
5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect

A life-threatening event is defined as any adverse event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.

* Is another important medical event
* Is a new cancer
* Is associated with an overdose.

SEVERITY RATING/GRADING SCALE: Adverse events are classified by organ system and graded by severity according to the current NIH Common Terminology Criteria V. 5. The defined grades use the following general guidelines:

* 0 No adverse event or within normal limits
* 1 Mild adverse event
* 2 Moderate adverse event
* 3 Severe adverse event
* 4 Life-threatening or disabling adverse event
* 5 Fatal adverse event

All adverse events will be recorded from time of treatment initiation through 30 days after the final dose of study treatment, as well as any time after these 30 days for events that are believed to be at least possibly related to study treatment.
