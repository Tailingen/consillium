A Phase 1 Dose-escalation Study of FF-10832 for Treatment of Solid Tumors Including Biliary Tract Cancer
To determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients who receive FF-10832 (Gemcitabine Liposome Injection) for treatment of advanced solid tumors including biliary tract cancer
Advanced Solid Tumors|Biliary Tract Cancer
DRUG: FF-10832 Gemcitabine Liposome Injection
Determine incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Safety and tolerability assessed by adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), 2.5 years|Identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of FF-10832, DLT is defined as any adverse event at least possibly related to FF-10832, and meeting specified DLT criteria, 2.5 years|Determine maximun tolerated dose (MTD) of FF-10832, MTD is defined as the next lower dose of a cohort where patients experienced a DLT, 2.5 years
Disease Assessment by CT or MRI scan for solid tumors, Disease assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v. 1.1), clinical benefit is defined as best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or disease progression (DP), 2.5 years|Disease Assessment by CT or MRI + PET scan for pancreatic cancer, For solid tumors assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v. 1.1), clinical benefit is defined as best response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) or disease progression (DP). European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria will be utilized for PET response assessments., 2.5 years|Duration of Response, Duration of Response is calculated from the date of first response to the date of progression or death, 2.5 years|Duration of Stable Disease, Duration of Stable Disease is the length of time from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, 2.5 years|Time to progression (TTP), Time to progression is calculated from the date of first treatment to the date of first progression, 2.5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival will be calculated from the date of first treatment to the date of progression or death, 2.5 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival will be calculated from the date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause; patients who do not experience death will be censored at the last follow-up time., 2.5 years
Dose-escalation Phase:

Eligible patients will receive FF-10832 in 28 day or 21 day cycles. Dosing will continue until progression of disease, observation of unacceptable adverse events, intercurrent illness, or changes in the patient's condition that prevents further study participation after discussion between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. A number of cohorts will be enrolled sufficient to determine the MTD and to identify the RP2D.

Expansion Phase:

One cohort of biliary tract cancer will enroll up to 18 patients in a 21 day cycle.
