Epoetin Alfa in Treating Anemia in Patients With Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Epoetin alfa may stimulate red blood cell production and treat anemia in patients with solid tumors. It is not yet known whether epoetin alfa given once a week is more effective than epoetin alfa given once every 3 weeks in treating anemia.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of epoetin alfa in treating anemia in patients who have solid tumors.
Anemia|Leukemia|Lymphoma|Lymphoproliferative Disorder|Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm|Precancerous Condition|Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
BIOLOGICAL: epoetin alfa
Compare the effects of these regimens on increasing hemoglobin levels, Up to 1 year post-treatment
Compare the effects of these regimens on overall quality of life (QOL), Up to 1 year post-treatment|Compare the effects of anemia-specific components of QOL, Up to 1 year post-treatment
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the effects of 2 different schedules of epoetin alfa on decreasing transfusion requirements in anemic patients with nonmyeloid cancer.
* Compare the effects of these regimens on increasing hemoglobin levels in these patients.
* Compare the effects of these regimens on overall quality of life (QOL) and anemia-specific components of QOL in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to concurrent chemotherapy or radiotherapy (yes vs no), concurrent platinum-based (cisplatin or carboplatin) chemotherapy (yes vs no), degree of anemia (mild \[hemoglobin at least 9.0 g/dL\] vs severe \[hemoglobin less than 9.0 g/dL\]), age (60 and under vs over 60), and type of neoplasm (plasma cell disorder \[including multiple myeloma\] or lymphoproliferative disorder \[including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia\] vs all other neoplasms).

All patients receive epoetin alfa (EPO) subcutaneously (SC) once weekly for 3 weeks. Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.
