Gedatolisib Plus Fulvestrant With or Without Palbociclib vs Standard-of-Care for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced or Metastatic HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer (VIKTORIA-1)
This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of gedatolisib plus fulvestrant with or without palbociclib for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer following progression on or after CDK4/6 and aromatase inhibitor therapy.

Progression Free Survival (PFS) in Patients with PIK3CA WT and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to death or the first documented progression, whichever occurs first, confirmed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, as determined based on blinded independent central review (BICR), Approximately 48 months
Overall Survival (OS) in Patients with PIK3CA WT and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, OS is defined as the length of time from randomization until the date of death from any cause method, where PFS is defined as the time from randomization to death or the first documented progression, whichever occurs first, confirmed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria, as determined based on blinded independent central review (BICR), From date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, up to approximately 48 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) in Patients with PIK3CA WT and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Percentage of subjects who achieved an objective response according to RECIST v1.1 criteria (complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\]) as assessed by BICR), Up to approximately 48 months|Duration of Response (DOR) in Patients with PIK3CA WT and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Time from the assessment of initial response (PR or better) to death or first documented disease progression as assessed by BICR, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 48 months|Time to Response (TTR) in Patients with PIK3CA WT and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Time form randomization to the first assessment of PR or better as assessed by BICR, whichever comes first, Up to approximately 48 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) in Patients with PIK3CA WT and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Percentage of subjects with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) \>24 weeks as assessed by BICR, Up to approximately 48 months|Quality of Life (QOL)Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast Trial Outcome Index (FACT-B TOI) Questions in Patients with PIK3CA WT and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, The FACT-B TOI is an abbreviated (24-item) version of the full FACT-B which focuses only on the patient's Physical Well-being (PWB), Functional Well-being (FWB), and Breast Cancer Subscale (BCS) components using a 5-level scale, (Not at all, A little bit, Some-what, Quite a bit, Very much)., From baseline to 30 Day Safety Follow-up|Quality of Life (QOL) NCCN-FACT Breast Symptom Index -16 (NFBSI-16) in Patients with PIK3CA WT and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, NCCN-FACT is derived from the FACT-B and only 4 additional items will be administered to enable optional scoring of the NFBSI subscales and total score using a 5-level scale (Not at all, A little bit, Some-what, Quite a bit, Very much)., From baseline to 30 Day Safety Follow-up|Patient-Reported Outcomes in Patients with PIK3CA WT and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMISÂ®) Short Form v2.0 - Physical Function 8c using a 5-level scale (Without any difficulty, With a little difficulty, With some difficulty, With much difficulty, Unable to do), From baseline to 30 Day Safety Follow-up|EuroQol 5 in Patients with PIK3CA WT and PIK3CA MT Breast Cancer, EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) - This is a 5 question, self-administered visual analog scale (VAS) where patients use 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health) to indicate how they view their health., From baseline to 30 Day Safety Follow-up|Adverse Events, Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by review of type, incidence, severity (as graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[NCI CTCAE\] v5.0), seriousness, and relationship to study medications of adverse events (AEs) and any laboratory abnormalities, Up to approximately 48 months
This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of gedatolisib plus fulvestrant with or without palbociclib for the treatment of patients with advanced (inoperable) or metastatic Hormone Receptor Positive, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer following progression on or after CDK4/6 and aromatase inhibitor therapy. Gedatolisib is an intravenously administered pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor. Palbociclib is a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). Subjects will be assessed for PIK3CA status and then randomized to treatment arms according to their confirmed PIK3CA mutation status.
