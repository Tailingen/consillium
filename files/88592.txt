Study of ACY-1215 in Combination With Lenalidomide, and Dexamethasone in Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the best dose of ACY-1215 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Once determined, the purpose of this study will be to determine the efficacy of ACY-1215 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who have had 1-3 prior therapies and who are not lenalidomide-refractory.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: ACY-1215|DRUG: lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
To determine DLT of ACY-1215 administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patient with relapsed/refractory MM, Number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), up to 7 years|To determine MTD of ACY-1215 administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patient with relapsed/refractory MM, Maximum Tolerated Dose is defined as the dose level immediately below the DLT dose level., up to 7 years|Objective Response Rate of ACY-1215, The objective response rate is the proportion of subjects achieving an investigator conformed partial response (PR) or better, to treatment according to IMWG (International Myeloma Working Group)., up to 7 years
Duration of Response, The duration of response is defined as the time (in weeks) from the date of the first documentation of objective response to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death on study due to any cause, whichever comes first., Up to approximately 7 years|Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants with adverse event, From enrollment until at least 28 days after completion of study treatment|Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with a response (Unconfirmed or Confirmed) of SD or better, more specifically sCR, CR, VGPR, PR, MR, or SD respectively., Up to approximately 7 years|Progression-free Survival, PFS is defined as the time (in weeks) from the date of first dose to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death on study due to any cause, whichever comes first., Up to approximately 7 years|Evaluate the pharmacodynamics of ACY-1215 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM, Exposure-response of ACY-1215 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, including biomarkers relating to intracellular protein acetylation, levels of proteins, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and microRNA expression profiles will be analyzed for potential relationships., up to 28 days|Pharmacokinetic- Cmax, Maximum serum concentration, up to 28 days|Pharmacokinetic- Cmin, Minimum observed concentration, up to 28 days|Pharmacokinetic- Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration, up to 28 days|Pharmacokinetic- AUC, Area under the plasma concentration time curve, up to 28 days|Pharmacokinetic- t1/2, Serum half-life, up to 28 days
This is phase 1, single-arm, multicenter, open-label study in patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory MM. The study employs a sequential group dose-escalation design to determine the DLT and MTD of ACY-1215 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, all administered orally (PO). The safety, tolerability, single- and multiple-dose PK, pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of ACY 1215 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone also will be evaluated.

Each cohort will enroll 3 patients. Study drug doses will be escalated sequentially after the Safety Review Committee (SRC) reviews safety data collected in C1 (28 days) from patients enrolled at the current dose level as well as emerging data from ongoing studies of ACY-1215. If there are no DLTs (as defined in Section 5.2.6) during C1 or concerns based on data from other ongoing studies, the study will proceed with dose escalation to the next cohort following safety data review by the SRC. If 1 of 3 patients has a DLT, then up to 3 additional patients will be enrolled in that cohort; if none of the additional 3 patients experience a DLT during C1, escalation may then continue to the next cohort following SRC review. If 2 or more patients have DLTs during C1, the DLT dose level will have been reached.

The MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below the DLT dose level. A total of up to 6 additional patients may be enrolled at the MTD or other appropriate dose level to obtain additional AE, PK, pharmacodynamic, and anti-tumor activity data on ACY 1215 in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.
