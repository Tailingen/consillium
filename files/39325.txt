Studying Gene Expression in Tissue Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at gene expression in tissue samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

Correlation of high relative expression levels of PLAGL2 and putative PLAGL2 target genes with potential pathogenic relevance
OBJECTIVES:

* Screen acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples to correlate high relative expression levels of PLAGL2 and putative PLAGL2 target genes (implicated in microarray study) with potential pathogenic relevance with respect to AML development.

OUTLINE: Cryopreserved mRNA from diagnostic samples is analyzed for gene expression by reverse transcriptase-PCR.
