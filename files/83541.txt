Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy Nodule Localization by Robotic Bronchoscopy
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of real-time needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) in improving diagnostic accuracy of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RANB) biopsy performed with the MonarchÂ® Endoscopy Platform in patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPN).

Robotic-assisted navigational bronchoscopy (RANB) improves accuracy of lesion localization and diagnostic yield of the peripheral pulmonary nodule (PPN) biopsy compared to conventional flexible bronchoscopy. Needle based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) allows real-time microstructural imaging of lung nodule tissues at the needle tip. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of utilizing nCLE during RANB biopsy procedure to optimize needle position and diagnostic accuracy, as well as reduce or replace the need for additional imaging tools such as radial endobronchial ultrasound (r-EBUS), cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), and/or fluoroscopy during RANB biopsy.
