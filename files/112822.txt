Kinesiophobia in Prostate Cancer
This study aimed to investigate the effects of prostate cancer on patients' physical activity, kinesiophobia, fatigue and functionality.

This research is a prospective study to be conducted on volunteer individuals between the ages of 40-75. People diagnosed with prostate cancer (study group) and healthy adults who have not been diagnosed with prostate cancer before (control group) will be included in the study. The demographic characteristics, physical activity levels and quality of life of all individuals participating in the study will be evaluated with an online form. In demographic data, physical, sociodemographic data such as age (years), height (cm), body weight (kg), body mass index (kg/m2) and disease-specific information will be recorded. Physical activity level will be measured with the International Physical Activity Survey short form (UFAA), fatigue with the Functional Evaluation of Chronic Disease Treatment-Fatigue Questionnaire, fear of movement with the Causes of Fear of Movement Questionnaire, and quality of life with the Functional Evaluation of Cancer Treatment-Prostate Version questionnaire (KHTFD-Y).

International Physical Activity Survey short form, The short form consists of 7 questions. The form provides information about the frequency and time spent in walking, moderate physical activity, and vigorous physical activity., 10 minutes|Functional Assessment of Fatigue Chronic Disease Treatment-Fatigue Questionnaire, It consists of 13 questions that evaluate the level of fatigue that occurred during daily activities in the last 7 days. Scoring varies between 0-52. High scores indicate less fatigue., 10 minutes|Reasons for Fear of Movement Questionnaire, It allows the causes of kinesiophobia to be identified and both biological and psychological causes to be determined separately. The average of the scores obtained from the biological and physiological subscales gives the total score from the survey. A 5-point Likert scoring (1 = Totally disagree, 5 = Completely agree) is used in the scale. An individual's high score from the survey indicates that he/she has more fear of movement., 10 minutes|Functional Evaluation of Cancer Treatment-Prostate Version questionnaire, It consists of 13 questions that evaluate the level of fatigue that occurred during daily activities in the last 7 days. Scoring varies between 0-52. High scores indicate less fatigue., 10 minutes
