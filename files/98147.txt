Combined Use of Pulsed Dye Laser and Topical Antiangiogenic Agents for Treatment of Port Wine Stain Birthmarks
The researcher want to improve port wine stain (PWS) therapeutic outcome in response to laser therapy. The researcher want to determine whether the combined use of pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy and topical tacrolimus or pimecrolimus will improve PWS therapeutic outcome.
Port Wine Stain
DRUG: Topical Antiangiogenic|DEVICE: Pulsed Dye Laser
Improve PWS lesion blanching., 8 weeks
To determine whether the combined use of pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy and topical agent will improve PWS outcome., 8 weeks
Both topical agents inhibit nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) which blocks the calcineurin/NFAT pathway inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, which could be very useful in preventing PWS recanalization.

The combined use of PDL to induce PWS blood vessel injury, and topical antiangiogenic agents to prevent PWS blood vessel angiogenesis and recanalization after laser therapy, will improve PWS lesion blanching.
