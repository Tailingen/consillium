Pulmonary Physiology and Systemic Inflammatory in EO Pulmonary Events With Brigatinib Use in NSCLC and Other Diseases
To estimate the incidence of Early Onset Pulmonary Events (EOPEs), defined as the proportion of participants with a peak reduction in DLCO of 20% or greater after commencing brigatinib at 90mg QD.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
To estimate the incidence of Early Onset Pulmonary Events (EOPEs), EOPEs is defined as the proportion of participants with a peak reduction in Diffusion capacity in the Lung of Carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 20% or greater after commencing brigatinib at 90mg once daily QD., 8 days
This is a single-arm study of patients who plan on starting brigatinib 90 mg QD or brigatinib 90 mg QD x 7 days to brigatinib 180 mg QD. Participants who enroll on this study protocol will either be taking brigatinib in the context of an ongoing clinical trial, or as part of standard of care treatment as licensed by FDA.
