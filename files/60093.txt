A Study of MGC026 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The study is designed to understand the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of MGC026 in participants with relapsed or refractory, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors The study has a dose escalation portion and a cohort expansion portion of the study.

Participants will receive MGC026 by intravenous (IV) infusion. The dose of MGC026 will be assigned at the time of enrollment. Participants may receive up to 35 treatments if there are no severe side effects and as long as the cancer does not get worse. Participants will be monitored for side effects, and progression of cancer, have blood samples collected for routing laboratory work, and blood samples collected for research purposes.

Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), Throughout the study, up to 135 weeks
Overall response rate in advanced solid tumors, The objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 is estimated as the proportion of participants in the Response Evaluable population who achieve best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (called responders). Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) is used to classify responses., Throughout the study, up to 135 weeks|Duration of response (DoR) in advanced solid tumors, DoR is defined as the time from the date of initial response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. (RECIST 1.1) is used to classify responses., Throughout the study, up to 135 weeks|ORR rate in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), The ORR per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria is estimated as the proportion of participants in the Response Evaluable population who achieve best overall response of CR or PR (called responders)., Throughout the study, up to 135 weeks|DoR in mCRPC, DoR is defined as the time from the date of initial response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented progression, per PCWG3 criteria or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Throughout the study, up to 135 weeks|Mean (standard deviation [SD]) of MGC026 maximum serum concentration (Cmax), The maximum concentration in the bloodstream at the end of the infusion., Day 1 of every 21-day cycle, throughout the study, average of 1 year.|Mean (SD) of MGC026 area under the time concentration curve (AUC), Calculated exposure to MGC026, Day 1 of every 21-day cycle, throughout the study, average of 1 year.|Number of participants who develop anti-MGC026 antibodies (immunogenicity), Development of anti-MGC026 antibodies in the bloodstream, Day 1 of every 21-day cycle, throughout the study, average of 1 year.
