Microsphere Localization Using PET/MRI or PET/CT in Patients Following Radioembolization
The successful localization of the y90 microspheres by PET/MR and/or PET/CT scans would be a useful tool in individualizing patient care after the radioembolization procedure. The information from a PET/MR or PET/CT scan would allow for early evaluation of the technical success of the procedure.

Evaluate y90-PET/MRI and PET/CT for potential on reporting presence of extrahepatic deposition of microspheres, A diagnostic radiologist and a nuclear medicine physician will evaluate the images and will determine any presence of extrahepatic deposition of microspheres., 1 day (one time event for patient)|Evaluate y90-PET/MRI and PET/CT for potential on reporting technical success of radioembolization, A diagnostic radiologist and a nuclear medicine physician will evaluate the images and will determine whether technical success of the procedure can be determined. They will rate the images if they are 'adequate' to report on these two measures., 1 day (one time event for patient)
