The Safety and Efficacy of Psilocybin in Cancer Patients With Major Depressive Disorder
This is a Phase II, single-center, fixed dose, open label trial to explore the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a 25mg dose of psilocybin in cancer patients with MDD. The study population will include adult men and women, 18 years of age or above, with MDD, diagnosed with a malignant neoplasm. MDD is defined as those who meet DSM 5 diagnostic criteria for a single or recurrent episode of MDD without psychotic features. A diagnosis of a malignant neoplasm is defined as having a diagnostic code from C00 to C97 according to the ICD-10.

It should be administered by an experi- enced clinician. The HAM-A probes 14 parameters and takes 15-20 minutes to complete the interview and score the results. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0=not present to 4=severe.

Additionally changes in the three factor scores on this measure will be assessed for change at the same timepoints: Connection; Reflection and Introspection; Trust and Acceptance.Healing Experience of All Life Stressors (NIH-HEALS) was developed by the NIH Clinical Center Pain and Palliative Care Service as a psycho-social-spiritual measure of healing that assesses positive transformation in response to challenging life events. It is a self-report, 35-item questionnaire., 8 weeks|Patient EQ-5D-5L, EQ-5D is an instrument which evaluates the generic quality of life developed in Europe and widely used. The EQ-5D descriptive system is a preference-based HRQL measure with one question for each of the five dimensions that include mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.

Recent randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psilocybin therapy for anxiety and depression associated with cancer diagnosis showed significant improvement in study endpoints reflecting psychological distress, as compared to placebo. The effects of a single psilocybin therapy session endured for up to six months with no specific follow-up care. In this study, we aim to explore the safety and efficacy of psilocybin therapy in cancer patients, diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
