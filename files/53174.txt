Delivering a Diuretic Into the Liver Artery Followed by Plugging up the Artery to Starve Out Liver Cancer Cells
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Bumetanide , at different doses to find out what effects, if any, it has on people who undergo tumor TAE as part of their regular care. Bumetanide is a commonly used medication to reduce the amount of water in the body.
Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Hepatic artery embolization (HAE)|DRUG: Bumetanide
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (phase I), Three escalating doses of bumetanide will be used: 0.01 mg/kg (level 1), 0.02 mg/kg (level 2) and 0.04 mg/kg (level 3) in a standard 3+3 design. Starting with level 1, three patients will first be enrolled at each level., 1 year|estimate the local tumor progression (LTP) rates (phase II), After the last first stage patient has three months followup, 6-month LTP will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. If the one-sided 90% lower confidence bound is less than 40% the study will stop. Otherwise 12 more patients will be enrolled for a total of 30. At the end of the study 12-month LTP will be estimated using competing risk (cumulative incidence) methods., 1 year
