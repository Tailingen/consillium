TAVT-45 (Abiraterone Acetate) Granules in Patients With Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of a new formulation of an existing drug product called TAVT-45 in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

DRUG: TAVT-45|DRUG: Zytiga|DRUG: Prednisone
Serum Testosterone (ng/dL) Days 9 and 10 Average (Rounded-up), CR-ITT, The primary endpoint was the between group comparison of serum testosterone levels for the average of levels on Days 9 and 10 (rounded-up) for mCRPC patients., Average over Day 9 and Day 10
Serum Testosterone (ng/dL) Days 9 and 10 Average (Rounded-up), CS-ITT, This was a supplementary analysis of equivalence, with a between group comparison of serum testosterone for the Days 9 and10 average (rounded-up) values for mCSPC patients treated with either TAVT-45 or R-AA., Average over Day 9 and Day 10|Serum Testosterone (ng/dL) Days 9 and 10 Average (Rounded-up), mITT, Supplementary analysis of equivalence of TAVT-45 and R-AA on Days 9 and 10 average (rounded-up) values in the mITT population (including mCRPC and mCSPC patients)., Average over Day 9 and Day 10|Percent of Subjects With PSA-50 Response, mITT, The PSA-50 response is defined as a decrease of ≥ 50% in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels from baseline., Response at any time over the 84-day post-treatment period.
This is a Phase 3 randomized, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect and safety profile of TAVT-45 compared to Zytiga (reference abiraterone acetate formulation, hereafter referred to as R-AA) in patients with high-risk metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) and metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Randomization was stratified by prostate cancer population (CSPC vs CRPC) and baseline testosterone (\<10 vs ≥ 10 ng/dL). Patients were treated for 84 days and randomized into one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio:

* TAVT-45: Administered twice daily as 1 x sachet containing TAVT-45 (250 mg abiraterone acetate), reconstituted in water or specified fruit juice (orange juice), + Prednisone (5 mg once or twice daily, depending on prostate cancer population)
* R-AA: Administered once daily as (2 x 500 mg Zytiga tablets) + Prednisone (5 mg once or twice daily, depending on prostate cancer population)
