RAD 1802: Pilot Trial of Five Fraction Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Early Stage Breast Cancer Patients Eligible for Post-Operative Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI)
This study offers 5 fractions of radiation treatment through partial breast irradiation in patients with early stage breast cancer after having a lumpectomy.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: 5 Fraction Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
Toxicity levels of 5 fractions SBRT for partial breast irradiation assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To determine the safety of 5 fractions SBRT for patients with early stage breast cancer after a lumpectomy. Safety will be determined by CTCAE v4.0 and access toxicity, or lack of, experienced by patients enrolled in this study., 0-2 years
Toxicity of breast SBRT using CTCAE v4.0, To define the acute (\<90 days) and late toxicity (\>90 days) up to two years after breast SBRT (CTCAE 4) attributable to therapy., 0-2 years|Cosmetic outcome baseline and post-SBRT, To determine patient and nurse assessed cosmetic outcome at baseline and 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months post SBRT. Patient will give a verbal satisfaction rating of 1-Excellent, 2-Good, 3-Fair, or 4-Poor of their cosmetic appearance post-SBRT. Nurse will also give their overall rating of 1-Excellent, 2-Good, 3-Fair, or 4-Poor based off of their examination of the cosmetic appearance post-SBRT., 0-2 years|Patient reported outcome baseline and post-SBRT, To determine patient reported outcome at baseline and 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months post SBRT. The Quality of Life Breast Cancer Questionnaire (QLQ-BR45) is a 45-item questionnaire is composed of 45 questions with scale of 4 options where 1 represents "not at all" to 4 "very much". Scores on the QLQ-BR45 range from 45 to 180, with a lower score representing a higher quality of life., 0-2 years
This study offers 5 fractions stereotactic body radiotherapy for early stage breast cancer after patient undergoes a lumpectomy. The study aims to determine the safety and feasibility of delivering only 5 doses of radiation treatment rather than the longer schedule of treatments that is currently considered standard of care for breast cancer patients. Patients will be followed for 36 months (2 years) with follow-up appointments at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months.
