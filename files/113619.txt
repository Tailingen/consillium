A Study of Enzalutamide and LY3023414 in Men With Prostate Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the study drug known as LY3023414 in combination with enzalutamide in men with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: LY3023414|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Placebo
Part B: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization until the date of clinical (symptomatic or radiographic) and/or prostate specific antigen (PSA) disease progression per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) or death by any cause regardless of whether the participants withdraws from study drug or receives a subsequent anti-cancer therapy (as determined by the investigator). Participants who have not progressed or died at the time of assessment were censored at the time of the last date of assessment (tumor evaluation or PSA level)., Randomization to Measured Progressive Disease or Death from Any Cause (Up To 34 Months)
Part B: Time to Disease Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as time from randomization until the date of clinical (symptomatic or radiographic) and/or prostate specific antigen (PSA) disease progression per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2)., Randomization to Objective Disease Progression (Up To 34 Months)|Part B: Percentage of Participants With Prostate Specific Antigen Response, PSA response was defined as more than 50% and 90% reduction from baseline to lowest post baseline value. 95% Confidence Intervals are based on Fisher's Exact Method., 12 Weeks|Part A: Pharmacokinetic (PK): Area Under the Concentration-time Curve Over the Dosing Interval (AUCτ) of LY3023414, PK: Area under the Concentration-time Curve Over the Dosing Interval (AUCτ) of LY3023414

Time Frame:

Part A LY3023414 200 mg: Day-1 pre-dose, 1.5, 3, and 6 hours post LY3023414 dose, Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose of LY3023414 and enzalutamide, and Part A Day 15 Pre-dose of LY3023414 and enzalutamide 1.5, 3, and 6 hours post LY3023414 dose;, Part A: 200 mg LY3023414 + 160 mg Enzalutamide: Cycle 1 Day 15 Pre-dose of LY3023414 and enzalutamide 1.5, 3, and 6 hours post LY3023414 dose|Part B: Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Objective Response Rate [ORR]), ORR was the percentage of participants achieving a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no appearance of new lesions. PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum LD), no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions. Progressive Disease (PD) was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, with reference being the smallest sum on study and an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter (mm), or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or 1 or more new lesions., Randomization to Second Measured Complete Response or Partial Response (Up To 34 Months)
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the study drug known as LY3023414 in combination with enzalutamide in men with prostate cancer.
