Studying Stored Samples From Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Treated on Clinical Trial NCI-00-C-0154
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients before and after treatment may help doctors learn more about the effects of the treatment on cells.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying samples collected from patients with localized prostate cancer who received treatment on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: diagnostic procedure|PROCEDURE: molecular diagnostic method|PROCEDURE: protein expression analysis
Immunologic response|Incidence of formation of antibody complexes in serum samples taken before initiation of treatment and after completion of therapy by western blot and SEREX
Cloning of any underlying tumor antigens discovered in this process
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Evaluate the formation of antibody complexes in serum samples taken before initiation of treatment and after completion of therapy in prostate cancer patients previously enrolled on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154.
* Evaluate immunologic response.

Secondary

* Clone the underlying tumor antigens discovered through SEREX.

OUTLINE: Samples previously collected on clinical trial NCI-00-C-0154 (whole blood, serum, and peripheral mononuclear blood cells) are analyzed for immunologic responses and evidence of formation of anti-tumor antibodies. Western blot is used to detect any evidence of vaccine-induced autoantibody responses. If there is an indication of response, SEREX is used to clone the underlying antigens.
