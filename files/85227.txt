Engineering Gut Microbiome to Target Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out if using probiotics will help the body's immune system react to breast cancer. New studies showed that diverse species of bacteria inside the bowel might help improve immune system, particularly the ability of immune system to recognize cancer. This study will investigate how probiotics will affect the subjects' immune system on breast cancer.
