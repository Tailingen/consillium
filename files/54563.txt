Surgery Plus Intraoperative Peritoneal Hyperthermic Chemotherapy (IPHC) to Treat Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine response and survival of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis treated with cytoreductive surgery plus intraoperative peritoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy with cisplatin and mitomycin
* Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into IPHC group and control group. In the former group, the patients undergo cytoreductive surgery plus intraoperative hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion with cisplatin and mitomycin over 60 minutes. Patients in the control group just underwent routine cytoreductive surgery.

All patients in both groups receive the standard conventional chemotherapy after surgery.

Quality of life is assessed at study initiation, at 1, 3, 6 months. Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
