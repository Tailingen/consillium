Disease Control Rate (DCR) per PCWG3/mRECIST1.1, DCR: Percentage of participants who exhibit stable disease (SD), PR or CR., Baseline through progressive disease or date of death for any causes, whichever comes first, assessed up to 12 months.|Duration of Response (DOR) per PCWG3/mRECIST1.1, DOR: Date of PR or CR to date of objective progression or death due to any cause., Baseline through progressive disease or date of death for any causes, whichever comes first, assessed up to 12 months.|Radiographic Progression Free Survival (rPFS) per PCWG3/mRECIST1.1, Proportion of patients experiencing a radiographic progression by PCWG3/mRECIST1.1 criteria, Baseline through progressive disease or date of death for any causes, whichever comes first, assessed up to 6 months.|Overall Response Rate (ORR) per PCWG3/mRECIST1.1, Proportion of patients experiencing a best overall response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial response (PR), Baseline through progressive disease or date of death for any causes, whichever comes first, assessed up to 12 months.|Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) Response, Proportion of patients with â‰¥50% reduction in PSA from baseline to lowest post-baseline result., Baseline to PSA progression, up to 12 months|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters including but not limited to: Cmax, time of TAS0612 it takes to reach Cmax., Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 1 Day 15 (28-day cycle) Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters including but not limited to: Tmax, time of TAS0612 it takes to reach Cmax,, Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 1 Day 15 (28-day cycle) Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters including but not limited to: AUC., Area under the plasma concentration curve of TAS0612., Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 1 Day 15 (28-day cycle) Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters including but not limited to: T1/2., time it takes for plasma concentration to fall by half its original value (t1/2) of TAS0612, Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 1 Day 15 (28-day cycle) Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1|Safety and Tolerability, All adverse events (AEs) per CTCAE v5.0., From screening to 30 days after last dose|Pharmacodynamic: biochemical effects of TAS0612: Total proteins, Total proteins will be measured in blood samples collected at different time points., Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 1 Day 15 (28-day cycle)|Pharmacodynamic: biochemical effects of TAS0612: phospho-proteins, Phospho-proteins will be measured in blood samples collected at different time points. The levels/changes (dose- and concentration-dependent) of phospho-proteins will be assessed and reported for biochemical effects of TAS0612., Cycle 1 Day 1 through Cycle 1 Day 15 (28-day cycle)|Pharmacodynamic: molecular effects in tumor tissue of TAS0612, Selected phospho-proteins will be analyzed in tumor tissue at baseline and on-treatment in dose escalation. The levels/changes of the phospho-proteins will be assessed and reported for target modulation., Baseline through Day 1 Cycle 2 (28-day cycle) through study completion, an average of 1 year
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Metabolites in plasma, Structure elucidation of TAS0612 metabolites in human plasma., Cycle 1 Day 1 (each cycle is 28 days).|Time-matched plasma exposures of TAS0612 and changes from baseline in QTcF using central ECG measurements, To explore the correlation between the incidence of exposures of TAS0612 in plasma and QT prolongation, Baseline through progressive disease or date of death for any causes, whichever comes first, assessed up to 12 months|Exploratory correlation of tissue and/or blood markers with tumor efficacy endpoints and/or tumor resistance to TAS0612, To investigate potential predictive biomarkers for TAS0612., Baseline through progressive disease or date of death for any causes, whichever comes first, assessed up to 12 months.|Exposure of TAS0612 and selected efficacy and safety measures., To explore the correlation between PK and antitumor activity or toxicity, Baseline through progressive disease or date of death for any causes, whichever comes first, assessed up to 12 months.
The purpose of this study is to see if TAS0612 is safe in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumor cancer.
