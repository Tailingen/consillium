A Study of Bevacizumab (Avastin) in Combination With Neoadjuvant Treatment Regimens in Participants With Primary Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Negative Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate the effect of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy, as preoperative treatment, in participants with HER2 negative breast cancer. Participants will be randomized to receive either chemotherapy (FEC100: Epirubicine 100 milligrams per square meter \[mg/m\^2\], 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m\^2, and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m\^2\] for 12 weeks followed by taxane (paclitaxel/docetaxel) for 12 weeks or endocrine therapy (an aromatase inhibitor\] daily for 24 weeks) with or without bevacizumab (15 milligrams per kilogram \[mg/kg\] as intravenous \[IV\] infusion every 3 weeks up 24 weeks).
