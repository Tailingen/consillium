Target-specific immunoPET Imaging of Digestive System Carcinoma
The aim of this study is to establish and optimize the target-specific PET/CT imaging method, and its physiological and pathological distribution characteristics, on the basis of which the diagnostic efficacy of the above imaging agents in digestive system malignant tumors will be evaluated.

Biodistribution, Measurement of the overall biodistribution of above tracers in normal tissues and organs., 1 day from injection of the tracers|Standardized uptake value (SUV), Standardized uptake value (SUV) of above tracers in the included subjects' primary and/or metastatic lesions., 1 day from injection of the tracers|Radiation dosimetry, Measurement of absorbed radiation doses (Gy/MBq) to tissues/organs, tumor(s), and whole body (Sv/MBq). Dynamic imaging within one hour will be acquired for the purpose., 1 day from injection of the tracers|Diagnostic value in patients with digestive system malignancy, Systematic evaluation of these parameters will elucidate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and, more importantly, the clinical value of these target-specific tracers in patients with malignancies of the digestive system., 30 days|The correlation between the expression of specific target and tracer uptake value, The Standardized uptake value (SUV) will be calculated, and the correlation between pathological results and tumor uptake of these tracers will be analyzed., 60 days
Predictive value of these tracers in the course of combined immunotherapies and targeted therapies, Baseline and follow-up immunoPET imaging in combined immunotherapies and targeted therapies (four to eight cycles) will be investigated in this setting to determine the value of the immunoPET imaging in predicting or evaluating treatment responses., 3-6 months|Target-specific PET/CT in changing clinical decision-making for patients with digestive system malignancy, After analyzing the imaging parameters and diagnostic/predictive value of these target-specific tracers, we will also investigate how clinical use of these tracers changes clinical decision-making for patients with malignant tumors of the digestive system. Joint efforts from nuclear medicine physicians, surgeons, oncologists, and pathologists will draw solid conclusions from the imaging and clinical information., 3-6 months
Enrolled patients will undergo whole-body PET/CT scans at 1 hours after tracer injection(0.05-0.1 mCi/kg). Uptake of above imaging agents in tumor and normal organs/tissues will be scored visually and quantitatively.

Tumor uptake will be quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy will be calculated to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy. The correlation between lesion uptake and protein expression level determined by immunohistochemistry staining will be further analyzed. The exploration endpoint will be the imaging feasibility and preliminary diagnostic value of the above tracers.
