A Study of Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of ATG-010, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone (SVd) Versus Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (Vd) in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM)
This is a Phase III Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter, Open-label Study of ATG-010, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone (SVd) Versus Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (Vd) in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM).

This is a Phase III Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter, Open-label Study of ATG-010, Bortezomib, and Dexamethasone (SVd) Versus Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (Vd) in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma (RRMM). About 150 subjects are planned to be enrolled in this study, and be randomized into two treatment Arms in a 2:1 allocation (SVd Arm or Vd Arm).
