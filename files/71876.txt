Evolution of Resistance to Systemic Therapies in Patients With Breast Cancer
The objective of this study is to apply Whole-body DW imaging alongside the routine management of patients requiring systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer to compare the time to progression of individual liver metastases within and between patients following stable disease or partial response to palliative systemic therapy for breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
GENETIC: n/a - observational
Progression rate of liver metastases, Patients will be monitored by routine CT scans after 3 cycles of cytotoxic/biological therapy or after 3 months of endocrine therapy, 3 months
Progression rate of skeletal metastases, Patients will be monitored by routine CT scans after 3 cycles of cytotoxic/biological therapy or after 3 months of endocrine therapy, 3 months|Global and local lesion Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) distributions of WB-DWI scans within individual patient, Patients will be monitored by routine CT scans after 3 cycles of cytotoxic/biological therapy or after 3 months of endocrine therapy, 3 months|Patient acceptability of WB-DWI assessed from questionnaires provided between WB-DWI scans and quantified using a 5-point Likert scale, Patients will be monitored by routine CT scans after 3 cycles of cytotoxic/biological therapy or after 3 months of endocrine therapy, 3 months|Comparison of patient acceptability to whole-body CT, Patients will be monitored by routine CT scans after 3 cycles of cytotoxic/biological therapy or after 3 months of endocrine therapy, 3 months
