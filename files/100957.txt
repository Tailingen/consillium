Autologous SCT Followed by Dendritic Cell p53 Vaccination in Patients With Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether p53 vaccination followed by high dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT and T cell therapy significantly induces immune responses resulting in 1-year survival greater that the current 70%.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Combined adenovirus vectored p53 tranfected dedritic cell vaccine and ex vivo expanded T-lymphocytes
Number of Subjects Meeting 1-year Overall Survival, Number of participants with overall survival from first day of cyclophosphamide and GM-CSF mobilization to the day of death, up to one year
3 Year Progression-free Survival, 3 year progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as time from maximum response to relapse or progression of SCLC, up to 3 years
The purpose of this study is to determine whether p53 vaccination followed by high dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT and T cell therapy significantly induces immune responses resulting in 1-year survival greater that the current 70%.
