PRP vs Corticosteroid in Baker's Cyst
This is a Prospective study with Randomized patients into either Ultrasound-guided Platelets-Rich-Plasma injection and Ultrasound guided Corticosteroid Injection, with 3 months and 6 months follow ups after aspiration at our institution. There will be 25 patients in each group, including any patient with symptomatic baker's cyst.
Baker's Cyst
OTHER: Platelets-Rich-Plasma|DRUG: Corticosteroid
Outcome of Baker's Cysts With the Use of Platelets-Rich-Plasma Versus Corticosteroid, Outcome measure will be determined through the use of the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria which are used to clinically evaluate the presence of the popliteal cysts, pain, posterior sense of tension in the popliteal fossa and its clinical importance for range of motion reduction. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) will be used to assess short and long term outcome of knee related conditions., 6 Months
Recurrence of Baker's Cysts Treated on Each Group, Outcome measure will be determined through the use of the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria which are used to clinically evaluate the presence of the popliteal cysts, pain, posterior sense of tension in the popliteal fossa and its clinical importance for range of motion reduction. The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) will be used to assess short and long term outcome of knee related conditions., 6 Months|Complications, All disease signs and symptoms experienced by the patient, as defined as an Adverse Event (AE), Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Serious Adverse Event (SAE), and Unexpected Adverse Device Effect (UADE), will be recorded from questionnaires during each study visit., 6 Months|Side Effects, All disease signs and symptoms experienced by the patient, as defined as an Adverse Event (AE), Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Serious Adverse Event (SAE), and Unexpected Adverse Device Effect (UADE), will be recorded from questionnaires during each study visit., 6 Months
The treatment of Baker's Cysts are based on its presentation, asymptomatic cysts are currently managed conservatively, symptomatic cysts are treated with joint aspiration and Corticosteroid injection, which have shown according to literature a decrease of the cyst size in approximately two-thirds of patients within 2-7 days but only complete disappearance in approximately 7 %. Ultrasound guided cyst aspiration and Corticosteroid injection are also used with reduction of cyst's size with recurrence in 6 months of 19%. Surgical options to remove the cyst include, Open Resection with a recurrence of 50%, 25% of patients have motion limitation recurrence, 37% have wound healing problems or tense swelling of the calf and 75% of patients have joint pain lasting more than 2 days. Arthroscopic resection, with no recurrence in ultrasound performed 6 and 12 months after procedure, pain lasting more than 3 days in 28% of patients, mild hematoma in 7% of patients and 7% where converted into an open procedure

There is no study using ultrasound guided aspiration with platelet-rich-plasma injection (PRP). The rationale for the use of PRP is the belief that the additional platelets will exponentially increase the concentration and release of multiple growth and differentiation factors at the injury site to augment the natural healing process9. PRP does not have any described negative side effect due to the fact that is being prepared from subject's own blood, with no risk of allergy or cross infection, relatively easy for a practiced clinician, and reproducible.
