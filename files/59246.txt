A Single Arm, Single Centered Phase II Trial on the Combination of Adebrelimab, Surufatinib and Irinotecan Liposome-based HAIC in Advanced iCC
Southeast Asia and China have the highest incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma worldwide, with limited treatment options and large unmet medical needs.

Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) has gradually emerged as a promising treatment option for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Increasing evidence suggests that infusion of HAIC, which maintains high local concentrations of toxic agents in tumors without embolism, provides a significant survival benefit for patients with advanced HCC and is well-tolerated. However, there is limited evidence for the efficacy of HAIC for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

Irinotecan liposome (nal-IRI) is a concentrate of an infusion solution containing 5 mg/ml irinotecan trihydrate (irinotecan sucrose salt) active substance, which is encapsulated in liposomes and prevents premature conversion of the drug to SN-38 in the liver. Liposomal irinotecan prolongs the circulation time of the drug in the plasma of patients and prolongs the tumor exposure of the drug compared to conventional irinotecan.Nal-IRI based protocol has shown positive results in the phase III trial of pancreatic carcinoma.

Adebrelima(SHR-1316) is a recombinant humanized IgG4 antibody that binds efficiently and specifically to human and cynomolgus programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274, or B7-H1), a cell surface molecule that plays an important role in T cell immune function, and stimulates IFN-γ secretion from mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) of dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4 + T cells.

Surufatinib is a multiple kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR 1-3, FGFR1 and CSF1R.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of irinotecan liposome-based hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy combined with adebrelimab and surufatinib in the treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, which may bring significant clinical benefit to the iCC patients with new treatment options.
