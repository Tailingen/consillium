Role of Tibial Nerve Stimulation for Enhanced Postoperative Recovery After Colorectal Surgery
Aim of the study is to evaluate the role of postoperative tibial nerve stimulation in the enhancement of the recovery of bowel function and in shortening the hospital stay.
Postoperative Ileus|Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Tibial nerve stimulation|PROCEDURE: Sham tibial nerve stimulation
bowel function recovery (Time to first bowel movement or flatus), Time to first bowel movement or flatus, 7 days
Length of postoperative hospital stay, Length of postoperative hospital stay, 30 days|Post-operative vomiting (episodes of vomiting), Episodes of vomiting, 30 days|Use of NG Tubes (Nasogastric tube (re)insertions), Nasogastric tube (re)insertions, 30 days
Patients were randomized in two groups. The first group underwent a three days postoperative transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation. The second group underwent a sham stimulation. Aim of the study is to evaluate the role of tibial nerve stimulation in the postoperative recovery after colorectal surgery.
