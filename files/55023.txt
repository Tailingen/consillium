Anti-CD19 CAR-Engineered NK Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies
This study is a single arm, open and multi center exploratory clinical study to observe the safety and effectiveness of CAR NK-CD19 in participants with recurrent or refractory CD19 positive B-cell malignant tumors, and preliminarily evaluate the expansion of this product in vivo and the objective remission rate after administration.
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-NK-CD19 Cells
Safety of CAR NK-CD19 Cell, Safety of CAR NK-CD19 will be assessed by incidence and severity of AEs and SAEs., Up to 3 months after cell infusion|The overall response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) according to NCCN, Complete response(CR),CR with incomplete blood count recovery(CRi)., Up to 3 months after cell infusion
Concentration of PK CAR positive NK cells in peripheral blood, PK CAR positive NK cells in peripheral blood, PK CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood, Up to 3 months after cell infusion|Pharmacodynamic data in peripheral blood, The amount and duration of antibody to CAR NK-CD19 cells in peripheral blood., Up to 3 months after cell infusion
Duration of remission (DOR) after infusion, refers to the time from the first assessment of CR or PR to the first assessment of disease progression or death from any cause, From 28 to 180 days after infusion|Progression-free survival (PFS) after infusion, refers to the time from cell infusion to the first assessment of tumor progression or recurrence or death from any cause, From 28 to 180 days after infusion|Overall survival (OS) after infusion, refers to the time from cell infusion to death due to any cause. For subjects who have dropped out before death, the dates of their last visit would be counted as their time of death; if the subject receives other new treatments, the time of death will be calculated based on the start date of the new treatment; if the study ends, the time of death will be calculated based on the end date, From 6 to 24 months after infusion
The study will enroll 9-21 participants diagnosed with recurrent or refractory CD19 positive B-cell malignant tumors, including acute B-lymphocyte leukemia, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic B-lymphocyte leukemia. There will be three preset dose groups in this clinical trial, which are 1.0×10\^7、2.0×10\^7 and 3.0×10\^7 CAR positive NK cells / kg (body weight), SRC will discuss and decide the next infusion plan. Participants will be enrolled from low dose group to high dose group, each dose will enroll at least 3 cases. Dose escalation will be decided by the SRC (Safety Review Committee) separately by diseases. There will be expanded cases in the aim dose group, which will at most to 6 cases. The protocol will be performed into screening period (-30\~-10 days), prophase of lymophodepletion (-10\~-5 days), Lymophodepletion (-5\~-3 days), pre-infusion evaluation (-2\~-1 days), infusion (day 0), and follow-up period (1-720 days). According to the administration strategy, we will start from single administration. Only after the SRC's decision based on safety and PK data, we could explore further on multiple administrations or combo therapy strategy.
