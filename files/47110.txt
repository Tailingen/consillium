Fasciectomy vs Collagenase Injection in Recurrent Dupuytren Disease
This randomized controlled trial will compare the outcome of surgery (fasciectomy) with that of local injection of Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum in patients with recurrent finger joint contracture after previous treatment with Surgery, collagenase injection or needle fasciotomy. Half of the participants will be treated with surgery while the other half will receive collagenase injection.

Serious adverse events include nerve, artery or tendon damage, deep infection, complex regional pain syndrome and any complications requiring surgery or hospital admission., Anytime during 24 months after treatment|Costs, Total treatment cost, direct (medications, surgery, materials, visits etc) and indirect (sick leave related to the treatment), From baseline through 24 months|Total active motion, Sum of active range of motion of metacarpophalangeal, proximal intephalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints of the treated finger, Change from baseline to 3 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months|Total active extension deficit (metacarpophalangeal plus proximal interphalangeal joints), Active extension deficit of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the treated finger measured with hand-held goniometer (0 degrees indicates no extension deficit), Change from baseline to 12 months, 24 months and 60 months|Proportion of patients with worsening in total active extension deficit ≥20 degrees, Extension deficit of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the treated finger measured with hand-held goniometer (0 degrees indicates no extension deficit), 60 months compared to 3 months|Palmar pain score, 2-item scale inquiring about pain in the palm and related activity limitations, total score range 0 (best) to 100 (worst), Change over time from baseline to 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months.|Cold intolerance symptom severity score, 6-item scale inquiring about symptoms of cold intolerance, total score range 4 (best) to 100 (worst), Change from baseline to 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months.|Total passive extension deficit (metacarpophalangeal plus proximal interphalangeal joints), Passive extension deficit of the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the treated finger measured with hand-held goniometer (0 degrees indicates no extension deficit), Change from baseline to 24 months and 60 months
No definitive cure for Dupuytren disease (DD) currently exists and recurrence of finger contractures after treatment is common. Surgical fasciectomy is considered the standard treatment method for patients with recurrence. However, the procedure is associated with a high incidence of complications. Injection of Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum into Dypuytren cords causing the contracture is a non-surgical treatment for DD and has been shown to be a safe and effective method. Most studies regarding collagenase injection have involved first-time treatment. Efficacy of collagenase injection in patients with recurrent DD, beyond the immediate effect, has not yet been determined. This randomized trial will compare the outcome of surgical fasciectomy and collagenase injection in treating patients with finger joints contracture due to recurrent DD. The study is a single-center randomized controlled trial. Patients referred to an orthopedic department are screened for eligibility. The inclusion criteria are recurrence of DD in one or more fingers after previous treatment with fasciectomy, collagenase injection or needle fasciotomy, a passive extension deficit ≥30 degrees in the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and/or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint in a previously treated finger, and a palpable cord believed to cause the recurrent contracture. A total of 56 patients will be randomized (computer-generated randomization list, stratified according to type of previous treatment and affected finger), to either surgical fasciectomy or collagenase injection. A blinded hand therapist will measure range of motion (including active and passive extension deficit) at baseline and 3 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months after treatment. The primary outcomes are the total active extension deficit (MCP plus PIP) at 3 months and the proportion of patients with contracture worsening ≥20 degrees in the treated finger joint at 2 years compared to 3 months. The secondary outcomes include total passive extension deficit, the 11-item disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (QuickDASH) score, EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) index, cold intolerance symptom severity score, palmar pain score, pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, satisfaction VAS score, adverse events and costs.
