Dose-Dense Epirubicin and Cyclophosphamide (EC) Followed by Paclitaxel in Breast Cancer: Feasibility
The purpose of this study is to give a drug regimen that is hoped to be effective in preventing cancer from coming back. Since it is an aggressive breast cancer, there is a moderate to high chance that the cancer may come back. The standard treatment for this tumor type includes a chemotherapy regimen with drugs named epirubicin (E) and cyclophosphamide (C) in a vein every 2 weeks for 4 treatments, followed by a drug named paclitaxel, every 2 weeks in your vein for 4 treatments.

This study is an experimental study in which you will be given 6 cycles of EC followed by 6 cycles of paclitaxel. The purpose of getting 2 more cycles of EC and 2 more cycles of paclitaxel than what is normally given is to study a regimen that may be more effective than the current standard treatment in preventing the recurrence of this cancer. Specifically, in this study we are looking for side-effects and risks of these drugs as more cycles are given.
