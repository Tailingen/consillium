Ibuprofen or Morphine in Treating Pain in Patients Undergoing Pleurodesis for Malignant Pleural Effusion
RATIONALE: Morphine and ibuprofen help lessen pain caused by pleurodesis. It is not yet known whether one drug is more effective than the other in lessening pleurodesis-related pain or whether the size of the chest drain tube affects pain.

PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying ibuprofen to see how well it works compared with morphine in treating pain in patients undergoing pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusion.
Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: ibuprofen|DRUG: morphine sulfate|PROCEDURE: management of therapy complications|PROCEDURE: pleurodesis
Average pain score over 72 hours post pleurodesis (total pain relief score) by a Visual Analogue Scale of pain relief and pain intensity every 6 hours|Pleurodesis success at 3 months post randomization (time to relapse of pleural effusion, censored for survival)
Presence of chronic chest pain on the side of the pleurodesis at 6 weeks and 3 months post randomization|Change in hemoglobin and white cell count from day 0 to day 3|Change in renal function and liver function (i.e., ALT or AST, bilirubin, albumin, and alk phos) from day 0 to day 3|Change in Inflammatory markers from day 0 and day 3 (e.g., CRP, WCC) from day 0 to day 3|Change in alveolar PO2-arterial PO2 (A-a) gradient (on air) on day 0 and day 3|Continuous oximetry monitoring from day 0 to day 3 (on air unless saturation < 90%)|Average conscious level measured by Glasgow Coma scale from day 0 to day 3|Drug- and talc-related adverse reactions|Complications from chest drain insertion|Presence of chronic chest wall pain assessed at all follow-up visits
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To evaluate the efficacy of a non-steroidal based regimen comprising ibuprofen in decreasing post-pleurodesis pain as compared to an opiate-based regimen comprising morphine sulfate in patients with malignant pleural effusion.
* To evaluate whether chest drain size influences the amount of post-pleurodesis pain.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to histological tissue type (mesothelioma vs non-mesothelioma) and thoracoscopic procedure. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a large bore chest drain (24F) on day 0 and receive oral ibuprofen 3 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is removed on day 3.
* Arm II: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a small bore chest drain (12F) on day 0 and receive oral ibuprofen 3 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is removed on day 3.
* Arm III: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a large bore chest drain (24F) on day 0 and receive oral morphine sulfate 4 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is removed on day 3.
* Arm IV: Patients undergo pleurodesis after placement of a small bore chest drain (12F) on day 0 and receive oral morphine sulfate 4 times daily for 3 days. The chest tube is removed on day 3.

All patients will receive regular background analgesia comprising paracetamol 4 times daily on days 0-3. Patients not adequately treated with these regimens may also receive rescue analgesia comprising morphine sulfate IV on days 0-3.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months, and periodically thereafter.
