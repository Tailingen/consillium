Assessment of Indocyanine Green as a Near-Infrared Fluorescent Contrast Agent for Image-guided Liver Surgery
This is a prospective, monocentric, non-randomized, phase I-II study. The goal is to assess the faisability and the capabilities of fluorescence imaging in hepatic surgery, and specially to help the surgeon while performing liver surgery.

This study will be performed on patient intended to undergo a liver cancer surgery.It will contain three steps, assessing the following items:

* Step 1: to assess the faisability of the use of the Fluobeam, in actual clinical surgical conditions and validate the data obtained in the preclinical phase,
* Step 2: to assess the ability of the combination of ICG and Fluobeam to mark hepatic lesions,
* Step 3: to assess the ability of the combination of ICG and Fluobeam to help in guiding per-hepatectomy.

  3 to 6 patients will be enrolled in the first step, 20 in the second step and 20 in the third step.

Patients will be followed during 4 weeks after the surgery.
Liver Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Fluobeam
First step: assess the feasibility and the acceptability of Fluobeam, * The ability to detect fluorescence
* The ability to investigate the mobilized parenchyma
* The ability to use the medical device following requested asepsis procedures
* Surgeon satisfaction
* Nurse satisfaction, During surgery on day 0|Second step: assess the rate of patients in whom, all of the lesions (superficial/deep) will be detected by means of the Fluobeam medical device in peroperative or in postoperative., During surgery on day 0|Third step: assess the rate of patients in whom, among the 7 liver segments, the surgeon will be able to selectively target a predefined area., During surgery on day 0
First step: assess the ability to visualize the fluorescent anatomical areas, During surgery on day 0|First step: Quantify the fluorescence, by using the images obtained during the surgery, After the surgery, on day 0|First step: assess the ability to review saved data, After the surgery, on day 0|Second step: assess the ability to detect tumor lesions which were not previously known., Assessment of the number of lesions detected thanks to the medical device. The malignant aspect must be confirmed by an anatomopathological analysis., During surgery on day 0|Second step: assess the rate of modifications of the surgical plan., Number of patients for whom the surgery would be modified after using Fluobeam., During surgery on day 0|Second step: assess the quality of the resection margins., It will be measured using the residual fluorescence and the pathology analysis, After the surgery on day 0|Second step: assess the depth limit of detection of the fluorescence., It will be assessed after the anatomopathological analysis., After the pathology analysis on day 0|Second step: Quantify the fluorescence., From images obtained during the surgery and from the sample analysed by a pathologist., After the surgery, on day 0|Second step: assess the number of asepsis due to Fluobeam, During surgery on day 0|Third step: assess the ability to detect tumor lesions which were not previously known., Assessment of the number of lesions detected thanks to the medical device. The malignant aspect must be confirmed by an anatomopathological analysis, During surgery on day 0|Third step: quantify the fluorescence., From images obtained during the surgery and from the sample analysed by a pathologist., After the surgery on day 0|Third step: assess the ability to administer two doses of ICG in the same patient, one before and one during the surgery (tumor detection and segment targeting respectively)., On day 0|Third step: assess the number of asepsis due to Fluobeam, During surgery on day 0|Third step: assess the ability of the medical device to detect tumor lesions which were previously known., Number of lesions seen on images before and during the surgery and detected by Fluobeam., On day 0
