AZD2171 in Addition to Fulvestrant in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer.
The purpose of this study is to determine whether AZD2171 can effectively improve time to tumour progression when added to fulvestrant in patients with advanced hormone sensitive breast cancer who progressed on prior hormonal therapy.
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: AZD2171|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Progression Free Survival, Number of months from randomisation until progressive disease based on RECIST (progression of target lesions, clear progression of existing non-target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions) or death in the absence of progression., RECIST performed at screening and every 8 weeks through to progression or discontinuation whichever is earliest.
Objective Response Rate, Best objective tumour response (based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST)) during the study for patients with measurable disease. Best objective tumour response defined as:

Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions Partial response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameters (LDs) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of LDs.

Progression (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of LDs of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of LDs since treatment started (including the baseline sum of LDs) and at least 5 mm increase.

Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, RECIST performed at screening and every 8 weeks through to progression or discontinuation whichever is earliest.|Duration of Response, Number of days from date of response (complete/partial based on RECIST) to date of progression, Every 8 weeks until progression or discontinuation|Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical Benefit is defined as the number of patients having a best overall tumour response of CR/PR or SD for ≥6 months.

The Clinical Benefit rate is defined as the number of responders divided by the number in the Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis set: responder=overall best response of complete response (CR)/partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months (calculated from the date of randomisation) as defined by RECIST criteria at any point prior to the data cut-off., Every 8 weeks until progression or discontinuation|Duration of Clinical Benefit, Number of days from date of clinical benefit to date of progression. Clinical benefit is defined as having a best overall tumour response of CR/PR or SD for ≥6 months., Every 8 weeks until progression or discontinuation
