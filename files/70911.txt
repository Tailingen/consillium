Prospective Trial for Examining Hematuria Using Computed Tomography
The primary objective is to evaluate whether one-phase nephrographic CT (experimental) is sufficient to detect urothelial cell carcinoma in patients with hematuria compared to the traditional four-phase CT (control).

accuracy for detecting urothelial cell carcinomas, the accuracy of the experimental arm will not be worse than the accuracy of the control CT by a margin of more than 7.5%, all examinations are evaluated immediately after the CT examination. Follow-up ascertainment of UCC diagnosis after one year

Study type: Prospective clinical trial

Study design: One sample paired proportion, non-inferiority study with a 7.5% non-inferiority limit.

Investigational product: One phase nephrographic CT (experimental arm) vs. Four-phase CT (control arm)

Objective:The primary objective is to evaluate whether one-phase nephrographic CT (experimental) is sufficient to detect urothelial cell carcinoma in patients with asymptomatic macroscopic hematuria compared to the traditional four-phase CT (control).

Primary endpoints: The difference in accuracy between the experimental- and control arm.

there will also be a secondary reading in order to asses interobserver variability for both the experimental and the control arm

Sample size: 250 patients
