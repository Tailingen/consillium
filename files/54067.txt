Busulfan, Fludarabine Phosphate, and Anti-Thymocyte Globulin Followed By Donor Stem Cell Transplant and Azacitidine in Treating Patients With High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This phase II clinical trial is studying how well giving busulfan, fludarabine phosphate, and anti-thymocyte globulin followed by donor stem cell transplant and azacitidine works in treating patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and older patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as busulfan and fludarabine phosphate, before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-vs-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving anti-thymocyte globulin before transplant and giving azacitidine, tacrolimus, and methotrexate after the transplant may stop this from happening.

Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival rate (percentage) at 2 and 5 years is defined as the percentage of patients who are alive and progression free at 2 and 5 years from date of transplantation respectively.

AML progression is defined as:

* Reappearance of leukemia blast cells in peripheral blood and \> 5% blasts in marrow
* If no circulating blasts, but the marrow contains 5-20% blasts, a repeat bone marrow \>= 1 week later with \> 5% blasts
* Development of extramedullary leukemia MDS progression is defined as
* For patients with \<5% bone marrow blasts: ≥50% increase in blasts to \>5% blasts
* For patients with 5-10% bone marrow blasts: ≥50% increase to \>10% blasts
* Any of the following: Reappearance of prior documented characteristic cytogenetic abnormality or refractory cytopenias with unequivocal evidence of dysplasia on bone marrow biopsy/aspirate, Up to 5 years
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival rate (percentage) at 2 and 5 years is defined as the percentage of patients who are still alive 2 and 5 years after date of transplantation respectively. Estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator., Up to 5 years|100-day Mortality, The number of death reported within the first 100 days after transplant., Up to 100 days post-treatment
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To determine if this treatment can improve 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) \>= 60 yrs age

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety and feasibility of using post-transplantation azacitidine.

II. To determine the ability to use pharmacokinetic-directed busulfan to achieve area under the curve (AUC) within 20% of target AUC in \> 80% of patients.

III. To determine the rate of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

IV. To determine the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD. V. To determine treatment-related mortality at 100 days and at 1 year. VI. To determine 5-year overall survival.

OUTLINE:

REDUCED-INTENSITY CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3, busulfan IV over 45 minutes on days -6 to -3, and anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4-10 hours on days -6 to -5 (matched sibling donor \[MSD\]) or -6 to -4 (matched unrelated donor \[MUD\]).

TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on day 0 or on days 0-1.

GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus orally (PO) or IV on days -2 to 90 with taper on days 150-180. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6 (MSD), and 11 (MUD).

CONSOLIDATION: Beginning on day 42, patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or IV on days 1-5.

Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses. Blood and bone marrow samples may be collected periodically for correlative and pharmacokinetic studies.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
