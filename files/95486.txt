Selenium and Vitamin E in Preventing Cancer Progression and Recurrence in Patients With Early-Stage Bladder Cancer
RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of selenium and vitamin E may stop cancer from growing or coming back.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving selenium together with vitamin E to see how well it works compared with a placebo in preventing cancer progression and recurrence in patients with early-stage bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: selenium|DRUG: vitamin E|PROCEDURE: chemoprevention
Recurrence-free interval
Overall survival time|Incidence of transitional cell carcinoma outside the bladder|Incidence of all other malignancies clinically diagnosed|Incidence of cardiovascular events|Quality of life as assessed at each follow-up visit by the quality of life instruments EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-BLS24 and QLQ-BLM30|Progression-free interval
OBJECTIVES:

* To investigate whether selenium and/or vitamin E (Î±-tocopherol) supplementation reduces the risk of recurrence and progression.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by recurrence risk group (high vs intermediate) and treatment center and randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral selenium tablet and oral vitamin E capsule once daily.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral selenium tablet and oral placebo capsule once daily.
* Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo tablet and oral vitamin E capsule once daily.
* Arm IV: Patients receive oral placebo tablet and oral placebo capsule once daily.

In all arms, treatment continues for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life is assessed every 6 months for 5 years.
