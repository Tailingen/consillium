Reproducibility and Reliability of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA/RNA Measures in Nasopharyngeal Swabs
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a virus-associated cancer that is rare among Caucasians but occurs at an elevated rate among Southern Asians. Rates of NPC are particularly high among individuals with a family history of this disease, but no specific genetic factors have been identified that can serve to guide clinical management of this high-risk population to ensure early detection and treatment of this life-threatening condition.
