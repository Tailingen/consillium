General Information About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment During Pregnancy


Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is more common in older patients, with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years.[
1
] Hodgkin lymphoma is most common in early adulthood and in patients older than 65 years.[
2
] This age distribution may explain why there are fewer reports of NHL in pregnant patients.[

Stage Information for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy


To avoid exposure to ionizing radiation, magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred tool for staging evaluation.[

Immediate Therapy
According to anecdotal case series, most non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in pregnant patients are aggressive, and delay of therapy until after delivery appears to have poor outcomes.[
1
-
4
] Consequently, some investigators favor immediate therapy, even during pregnancy.[
4
] In a review of 121 patient case reports from 74 papers, one-half of the patients had very aggressive lymphomas, such as Burkitt lymphoma, and one-half of the patients had involvement of the breast, ovaries, uterus, or placenta.[
5
] One-half of the patients received therapy antepartum, and the 6-month survival rate was 53%, with a live-birth rate of 83%.[
5
][
Level of evidence C3
]
A multicenter retrospective analysis of 50 patients described pregnancy termination in 3 patients, deferral of therapy to postpartum in 15 patients (median 30 weeks gestation), and antenatal therapy in the remaining 32 patients  (median 21 weeks gestation, all done after the first trimester).[
6
] With a median follow-up of 41 months, the 3-year progression-free survival  rate was 53%, and the overall survival rate was 82%, using R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) or modifications of this regimen.[

Level of evidence C3

Early Delivery, When Feasible
For some women, early delivery, when feasible, may minimize or avoid fetal exposure to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
Termination of Pregnancy
Termination of pregnancy in the first trimester may allow immediate therapy for women with aggressive NHL.
Effects of Treatment on Children
Evidence (treatment effect on children exposed in utero):
With follow-up ranging from several months to 11 years, children who were exposed to high-dose doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapy in utero (especially during the second and third trimester) had normal growth and no evidence of congenital malformations.[

,

-
9
] For most of the chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of NHL, there are no data regarding long-term effects on children exposed in utero.
In one anecdotal case, a newborn exposed to a rituximab-containing regimen in utero was born with no circulating B lymphocytes. The newborn was otherwise healthy and recovered the circulating B lymphocytes by age 6 months with no unusual or persisting intercurrent infections.[
