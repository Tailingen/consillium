Azacitidine in Treating Patients With Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of azacitidine and to see how well it works in treating patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
Leukemia
DRUG: azacitidine|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Safety and tolerability|Overall response rate
Incidence of clinical remission/complete remission or partial response according to International Working Group (IWG) criteria|Hematological improvement according to IWG criteria|Overall survival|Progression-free survival|Time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation of CMML|Time to death or AML transformation of CMML|Biological correlates
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess the safety and tolerability of azacitidine in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).
* To assess the overall response rate in these patients.

Secondary

* To assess the incidence of clinical remission/complete remission or partial response in these patients.
* To assess hematological improvement in patients treated with this drug.
* To assess the overall survival of patients treated with this drug.
* To assess progression-free survival of patients treated with this drug.
* To assess the time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation of CMML.
* To assess the time to death or AML transformation of CMML.
* To assess the biological correlates.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-5 and 8-9. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of loss of response/disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo response evaluation after 6 courses or the last course of treatment. Responders may continue azacitidine until loss of response/disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Some patients undergo blood, bone marrow, and buccal swab sample collection periodically for correlative studies.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
