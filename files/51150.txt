Two Radiation Dose Schedules of SBRT to Lung Metastases < 5cm in Dimension
30 Gy single fraction of SBRT for lung metastases will result in comparable oncologic outcomes to 18Gy in three fractions (or dosing to a BED \</-100Gy at the discretion of the radiation oncologist) with respect to disease control and toxicity.

Local Disease Control Rates, Response defined by the Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guideline version 1.1, 6 MONTHS
Using two different doses of SBRT, this study will examine the 6-month local disease control rate (LDCR) of the SBRT-treated metastasis to determine the optimum dosing for SBRT in pulmonary metastases. This will allow us to establish baseline SBRT data, from which we will develop a second trial to examine sequencing of immunotherapy with SBRT.
