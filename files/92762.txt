The Utility of Multiplex PCR for Detection of DNA in Neutropenic Patients With Hematological Malignancies
Objectives: Invasive infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients treated for hematological malignancies. Blood cultures are often negative in neutropenic patients because of low-burden of organisms, previous antibiotic therapy or non-infectious reason of fever. More rapid, accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools are needed.

Hypothesis: Multiplex real-time PCR may detect microbial DNA in neutropenic patients before febrile episode. To investigate this hypothesis, EDTA-blood was routinely collected for multiplex PCR at admission and 3x/week thereafter until discharge or recovery from neutropenia
