Retrospective Descriptive Study of Platelet Transfusion in Patients With Palliative Hematologic Malignancies at the University Hospital of Besançon
Development of palliative care is less effective for patients with hematologic malignancies. Limited data is available for end of life care in this population, moreover with thrombocytopenic patients. Thrombopenia is a frequent complication, specific of bone marrow involvement in those diseases or its treatments. Yet, a few studies was interested in, whereas platelet transfusion is the only treatment indicated. As it represent a scarce, limited resource, the ethical principles are in conflict in this setting.

The purpose of this study was to describe retrospectively platelet transfusion in the six last few month of life of patients with hematologic malignancies at the CHU of Besançon (France) between 01/07/15 and 31/12/16.

OTHER: descriptive
evaluate frequency of platelet transfusion at the end of life, to calculate the number of platelet transfusion at the end of life. The number of platelet transfusion between 6 months and death are collected in each periods of 2 weeks to calculate the number of transfusion per patient during each 2 weeks., 18 months (between 07/01/2015 and 12/31/2016)|evaluate efficacy of prophylactic platelet transfusion at the end of life, to calculate the platelet yield in percentage, 18 months (between 07/01/2015 and 12/31/2016)|evaluate efficacy of non prophylactic platelet transfusion at the end of life, to calculate the transfusional interval between 2 platelet transfusion in days, 18 month (between 07/01/2015 and 12/31/2016)
