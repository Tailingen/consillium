Determining Whether Multiple Anesthesia Exposures Affect Cognitive Function for Retinoblastoma Patients
The purpose of this study is to see if there is a difference between the development of the brain (neurodevelopment) in children who have been treated for retinoblastoma with multiple anesthetic exposures, compared with brain development in children who have never had anesthesia.

Comparing scores in neuropsychological testing results, The primary outcome is based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 5th edition (WISC-V) measured at follow up. The 5 primary index scores on the WISC-V (Verbal Comprehension, Visual Spatial, Fluid Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed) are based on 10 subtests and represent intellectual functioning in different cognitive areas. Similar to the FSIQ, the primary index scores are on a standard score metric with a mean of 100 (SD=15). The WISC-V consists of 16 subtests; each subtest is based on a scaled score metric with a mean of 10 and standard deviation (SD) of 3. Performance on these domain-specific subtests will be summarized and analyzed similarly to the FSIQ., 6 weeks
