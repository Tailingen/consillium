CemiplimAb Survivorship Epidemiology
The objectives of the study are:

* To describe the effectiveness of cemiplimab 350 mg administered every 3 weeks (Q3W) for treatment of patients with advanced (defined as locally advanced or metastatic \[nodal or distant\]) cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and patients with advanced (defined as locally advanced or metastatic \[nodal or distant\]) basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in real-world clinical settings
* To evaluate the safety of cemiplimab based on incidence of treatment related immune-related adverse events (irAEs), infusion related reactions (IRRs), and treatment related serious adverse reactions (TSARs) in patients with advanced CSCC and patients with advanced BCC receiving cemiplimab treatment in real world clinical settings
* To describe patient experience, including patient reported quality of life (QOL) and functional status, and clinician reported performance status in a real-world setting for patients with advanced CSCC and patients with advanced BCC
* To describe baseline characteristics that could potentially be associated with health-related outcomes for patients with advanced CSCC and patients with advanced BCC undergoing treatment with cemiplimab
* To describe patients who receive cemiplimab as treatment for CSCC or BCC in a real-world setting
* To describe real-world use patterns of cemiplimab for CSCC and BCC
* To investigate the long-term effects and effectiveness of cemiplimab in patients with advanced CSCC or advanced BCC
* To describe the effectiveness of cemiplimab in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients with advanced CSCC or advanced BCC, regardless of etiology, per available data
* To describe the effectiveness of cemiplimab after prior exposure to radiation therapy for CSCC per available data
* To describe the effectiveness of cemiplimab as a first-line (1L) or later systemic treatment in patients with advanced CSCC, regardless of etiology, per available data
* To describe the effectiveness of cemiplimab in patients with advanced BCC based on treatment patterns (reason for discontinuation, treatment exposure, etc) of prior Hedgehog inhibitor (HHI) usage
