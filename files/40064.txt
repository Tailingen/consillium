A Metagenome-wide Association Study of Gut Microbiota in Gastrointestinal Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Patients
This is a observational study on the fecal microbiota in primary/secondary gastrointestinal lymphoma patients.
Gastrointestinal Lymphoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Metagenomic shotgun sequencing
Metagenomic Linkage Groups (MLGs), A serial of genes in a metagenome that is probably physically linked as a microbial unit., 2 years
This observation study is aimed at investigating the gut microbiota alteration in gastrointestinal lymphoma (GIL) patients by performing metagenomic shotgun sequencing on GIL patients' fecal specimen. Before immuno-chemotherapy, the feces specimen of GIL would be collected and stored for further laboratory examination. This study would NOT alter the subsequential treatment of the patients.
