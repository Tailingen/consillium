Nanogen Pegfilgrastim (Pegcyte) PK/PD Clinical Study in Breast Cancer Patients
Breast cancer patients scheduled to receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy (AC regimen) will be enrolled in this study. Eligible patients receive single SC injection of pegcyte or neulastim 24 hours after administration of chemotherapy (Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide) in the first cycle (14 days each cycle). Blood samples are collected to determine the serum concentration of investigational drugs at specific time points in the first cycle. Absolute neutrophil count, CD34+ count, Cmax (maximum serum concentration), AUC0-t (area under the curve of the plasma concentration time) and Tmax (time required to reach Cmax) will be calculated from the serum concentration profile
