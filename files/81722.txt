Study of XL102 as Single-Agent and Combination Therapy in Subjects With Solid Tumors (QUARTZ-101)
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, antitumor activity, and effect on biomarkers of XL102 administered orally alone and in multiple combination regimens to subjects with advanced solid tumors.

DRUG: XL102|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Prednisone
Dose-Escalation Stage: MTD/recommended dose for XL102, To determine the MTD and/or RD for further evaluation of XL102 when administered orally alone and in combination therapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors, Approximately 18 months|Cohort-Expansion Stage: Objective Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate preliminary efficacy of XL102 when administered alone and in combination therapy by estimating the ORR as assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1, Approximately 12 months
Safety of XL102 as evaluated by Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), To evaluate the safety of XL102 when administered orally alone and in combination therapy through the evaluation of overall incidence of AEs, severity grade, relationship to study treatment, and laboratory tests., Approximately 30 months|Tolerability of XL102 as evaluated by Study Treatment Exposure, Dose Intensity and Modifications, and Study Treatment Discontinuation due to AE, To evaluate the tolerability of XL102 when administered orally alone and in combination therapy through the evaluation of study treatment exposure, dose intensity, dose modifications, and study treatment discontinuation due to AE., Approximately 30 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Drug-Drug Interactions, To assess drug-drug interactions between XL102 and combination agents, Approximately 18 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), To evaluate the Tmax of XL102 alone and in combination therapy, Approximately 18 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To evaluate the Cmax of XL102 alone and in combination therapy, Approximately 18 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve Over the Last 24-hour Dosing Interval (AUC 0-24), To evaluate the AUC 0-24 of XL102 alone and in combination therapy, Approximately 18 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Terminal Half-Life, To evaluate the terminal half-life of XL102 alone and in combination therapy, Approximately 18 months|Dose-Escalation Stage: Apparent Clearance (CL/F), To evaluate the CL/F of XL102 alone and in combination therapy, Approximately 18 months
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, antitumor activity, and effect on biomarkers of XL102 administered orally alone and in multiple combination regimens to subjects with advanced solid tumors.
