Evaluating Efficacy and Tolerability of Anticancer Drug Therapies for the Treatment of Gynecologic and Breast Cancers
retrospective/prospective observational study. Objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of drugs in terms of objective responses, disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and side effects compared with registry studies in the medical therapy of breast and gynecologic cancers.

DFS, To evaluate effect of drugs in terms of objective responses compared with registrational studies in medical therapy of breast and gynecological cancers: disease-free survival (DFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months.
PFS, Effect of drugs in terms of objective responses compared with registrational studies in medical therapy of breast and gynecological cancers: progression-free survival (PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months.|OS, Effect of drugs in terms of objective responses compared with registrational studies in medical therapy of breast and gynecological cancers: overall survival (OS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months.|Side effects, Effect of drugs in terms of objective responses compared with registrational studies in medical therapy of breast and gynecological cancers: side effects, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months.
This is a single-center retrospective/prospective observational study. Objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of drugs in terms of objective responses, disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and side effects compared with registry studies in the medical therapy of breast and gynecologic cancers.

Regarding the prospective component of the study, it is clarified that therapy will be warranted by clinical practice regardless of study enrollment. Diagnostic investigations will also be conducted as per normal practice; enrollment in the study does not require additional examinations.
