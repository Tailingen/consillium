Nivolumab + Ipilimumab With Immunostimulatory Embolization for Stage 4 Renal Cell Carcinoma With Unresected Primary
This single center phase 1 trial will study the combination of nivolumab+ipilimumab with embolization in participants with renal cell carcinoma. The study will evaluate the safety of embolotherapy in patients with metastatic RCC receiving nivolumab+ipilimumab. The hypothesis is that the number of serious adverse events will be no greater than the number of serious adverse events for both therapies combined.
Renal Cell Carcinoma|Renal Cell Carcinoma Stage IV
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DEVICE: bland embolization
Rate of serious adverse events, SAE rate following embolization in patients, Serious adverse events will be recorded from time of informed to consent to 100 days after the end of study intervention
Objective response rate, Objective response rate by RECIST 1.1, Measured from baseline to 6 months post initiation|Characterization of immune cells, Characterization of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes in primary and metastatic lesions before and after embolotherapy, From baseline to 12 weeks post initiation of therapy|PD-L1, Percentage of PD-L1 stain positivity in the primary tumor biopsy of participants, From baseline to 12 weeks post initiation of therapy
Previously untreated subjects with stage 4 RCC and unresected primary tumor or metastasis amenable to embolization will undergo two cycles of combination immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy, embolization of the target tumor, then resume ICI therapy. Study ends with safety and efficacy assessment at 6 months. Correlative blood and tissue specimens will be obtained.
