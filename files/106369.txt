Clinical Study of Personalized mRNA Vaccine Encoding Neoantigen in Patients With Advanced Digestive System Neoplasms
A single arm, open-label pilot study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of personalized mRNA tumor vaccine encoding neoantigen in Patients with advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma
Advanced Esophageal Squamous Carcinoma|Gastric Adenocarcinoma|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma|Colorectal Adenocarcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Personalized mRNA Tumor Vaccine
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, During the trial conduction, especially within the 24 weeks of treatment phase when mRNA tumor Vaccine administered, all adverse events (including laboratory abnormality and clinical events) will be closely monitored, and all â‰¥ grade 3 adverse events per CTCAE (v 3.0) will be recorded, including but not limited to the toxicities potentially suspected to relate to injection procedures and/or mRNA Tumor Vaccine therapy as listed below:

* Fever
* Chills
* Nausea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms
* Fatigue
* Hypotension
* Respiratory distress
* Tumor lysis syndrome
* Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia
* Liver and kidney dysfunction, 24 weeks
Disease Control Rate of Personalized mRNA Tumor Vaccine, Disease Control Rate (DCR), 1.5 years|Progression-free Survival of Personalized mRNA Tumor Vaccine, Progression-free Survival (PFS), 2 years|Time to Tumor Progression of Personalized mRNA Tumor Vaccine, Time to Tumor Progression (TTP), 2 years|Overall Survival of Personalized mRNA Tumor Vaccine, Overall Survival (OS), 3 years
Dr. Bin Wang developed the investigational vaccine used in this clinical trial and designed the trial protocol.For patients with advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma tumor who have disease progression with first line chemotherapy. Single or multiple doses of personalized mRNA tumor vaccine encoding neoantigen will be given to observe the safety and efficacy the mRNA tumor vaccine.

Primary objectives:

Determine the safety, tolerability and cytokinetics of the personalized mRNA tumor vaccine in patients with advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma.

Secondary objectives:

Make a preliminary evaluation on the efficacy of personalized mRNA tumor vaccine in patients with advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma with the following parameters:

Time of tumor progression (TTP);

Disease Control Rate (DCR);

Objective Remission Rate (ORR);

Overall Survival (OS).
