A Study of BBI503 in Asymptomatic Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Patients With CA-125 Elevation
This was an open-label, single-arm, Phase II study in which amcasertib (BBI503) was administered to adult, asymptomatic patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who had elevated CA-125.
Cancer|Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: BBI503
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Assessed by the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) guidelines which incorporate both CA-125 response and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 (the latter applies to patients who have measurable disease). DCR was defined as the proportion of patients who had an overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)., From the date of first treatment, every 8 weeks, until the date of first documented objective disease progression, up to 24 weeks
Progression Free Survival (PFS), The effect of amcasertib (BBI503) on PFS in asymptomatic recurrent ovarian cancer patients with CA-125 elevation, The time from the date of first treatment to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, up to 18 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS)-6, The effect of amcasertib (BBI503) on PFS at 6 months in asymptomatic recurrent ovarian cancer patients with CA-125 elevation, The time from the date of first treatment to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause at 6 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Assessed by the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) guidelines which incorporate both CA-125 response and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 (the latter applies to patients who have measurable disease)., From the date of first treatment, every 8 weeks, until the date of first documented objective disease progression, up to 18 months|Overall Survival (OS) at 6 Months, Defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., 4 weeks after the patient has been off study treatment, every 3 months thereafter until death, up to 6 months|Number of Patients With Adverse Events, Assessment of safety of amcasertib in participants by reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events, The time from the date of first treatment, while the patient is taking amcasertib, and for 30 days after stopping therapy, an average of 4 months.
