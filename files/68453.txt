HIV Seropositivity|Cancer|Blood Disease
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: HIV Ag +Ab Assay Kit (Sysmex)
The HIV Ab/Ag results, The HIV Ab/Ag results generated using HIV Ag +Ab Assay Kit (Sysmex) and the gold standard method for HIV test. The results will be recoreded seperately., through study completion, an average of 1.5 year
First,HIV Ag +Ab Assay Kit (Sysmex)Assay Kit (Sysmex) was used to detect HIV antigens and antibodies in the serum of patients with tumor and blood diseases, and then confirmed by using the gold standard for HIV diagnosis,human immunodeficiency virus (HIV type 1+2) antibody assay kit (immunoimprinting). The specificity of HIV Ag +Ab Assay Kit (Sysmex) for HIV assay in patients with tumor and hematological diseases was calculated.
