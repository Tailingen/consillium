Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of 6 Cycles vs 8 Cycles in Node Positve Breast Cancer
Various regimens and schedule as neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens were investigated and sequential treatment of anthracyclines followed by taxanes, which has shown superior pathologic complete respone (pCR) rate (NSABP-B27 study) is widely used until now. Considering the proven efficacy and tolerable toxicity of 3 cycles of FEC followed by 3 cycles of Docetaxel (FEC3-D3) compared to FEC 6 cycles in adjuvant chemotherapy (PACS 01 trial), use of FEC3-D3 regimen in neoadjuvant setting will be feasible with acceptable efficacy and further reduce the duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: FEC3-D3
pathologic complete response (pCR) between two arms, within the first 30 days (plus or minus 3 days) after surgery
3 year-disease free survival between two arms, 1. Correlation of pCR and Ki-67 expression at baseline and D14 tumor specimen
2. 3 year-disease free survival
3. Correlation of pCR and biomarkers such as Ki-67 expression, 3 year after surgery
To investigate feasibility of FEC3-D3 regimen in neoadjuvant setting in terms of comparable efficacy and shorter duration across all subtypes.
