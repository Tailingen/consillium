The Effect of Anesthetic Technique on VEGF-C and PGE2
The purpose of this study is to verify the effect of anesthetic technique on the change of postoperative serum vascular endothelial growth factor C and prostaglandin E2, and to explore the potential impact of the anesthetic technique on leiomyomas recurrence and growth after the surgery of abdominal myomectomy.
Uterine Leiomyomas
OTHER: general anesthesia and patient controlled intravenous analgesia|OTHER: spinal anesthesia and continuous postoperative epidural analgesia
Change of vascular endothelial growth factor C before anesthesia and at 48 hours after surgery, Blood samples were sampled before anesthesia and at 48h after surgery for the serum VEGF-C，which were analyzed by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., Before anesthesia and at 48 hours after surgery|Change of prostaglandin E2 before anesthesia and at 48 hours after surgery, Blood samples were sampled before anesthesia and at 48h after surgery for the serum PGE2，which were analyzed by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., Before anesthesia and at 48 hours after surgery
Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores were used to evaluate postoperative pain at 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h and 48h after surgery by the anesthetist, at 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h and 48h after surgery
Uterine leiomyomas is the most common benign tumor of uterus, the most common tumor in women as well. Like many other forms of tumor, it requires an independent blood supply to enlarge. This process, angiogenesis, is mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Several studies have confirmed that VEGF-C has a high level in patients with uterine leiomyomas, which has also been demonstrated that it was related to occurrence and growth of uterine leiomyomas because it's capable of promoting angiogenesis, mitogenic, and vascular permeability-enhancing activities. Also, some researchers suggested that suppression of prostaglandin synthesis (including PGE2) via cyclooxygenase type-2 (COX-2) enzyme inhibition may reduce the incidence of some tumor. The aim of this study is to verify the effect of anesthetic technique on the change of postoperative serum VEGF-C and PGE2, and to explore the potential impact of the anesthetic technique on leiomyomas recurrence and growth after the surgery of abdominal myomectomy.
