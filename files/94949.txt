Nal-IRI and 5-FU Compared to 5-FU in Patients With Cholangio- and Gallbladder Carcinoma Previously Treated With Gemcitabine-based Therapies
is an open label, randomized, multicenter phase II trial
Cholangiocarcinoma Non-resectable|Cholangiocarcinoma Metastatic|Cholangiocarcinoma of the Gallbladder|Cholangiocarcinoma Advanced
DRUG: nal-IRI|DRUG: 5-FU|DRUG: leucovorin
progression-free survival, approx 42 months
Overall survival, approx 42 months|Objective tumor response rate (ORR) according to RECIST 1.1, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1.), approx 42 months|Toxicity/Safety, according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, approx 42 months|Health related Quality of Life, EORTC QLQ-C30, approx 42 months
biomarkers, Ca-19-9, CEA, CRP serum levels, approx 42 months|Immunohistochemistry of Carboxylesterase (CES), approx 42 months|Analyse whole blood, will be collected to potentially identify factors that may correlate with tumour response, sensitivity or resistance to nal-IRI, approx 42 months|Analyse plasma, will be collected to potentially identify factors that may correlate with tumour response, sensitivity or resistance to nal-IRI, approx 42 months
The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of nal-IRI in gemcitabine pre-treated patients with advanced, unresectable and metastatic cholangio- and gallbladder carcinoma eligible for treatments after failure to respond to a gemcitabine-based treatment
