Dabrafenib/Trametinib, BRAF or BRAF AND MEK Pre-op With BRAF and MEK Post-op, Phase IIB, Melanoma With Brain Mets,Biomarkers and Metabolites
This is a global, multi-centre, open-label, study of GSK2118436 conducted in up to 30 evaluable subjects with resectable, BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive metastatic melanoma to the brain. All subjects in this study are required to have accessible extracranial metastases and are agreeable to undergo repetitive biopsies. The first cohort of 15 subjects will receive dabrafenib orally 150mg twice daily (BID) for 7 to 14 days prior to surgery (Cohort A); the second cohort of 15 subjects will receive the combination of dabrafenib 150 mg BID and trametinib 2 mg once daily for 7 to 14 days prior to surgery (Cohort B). The primary purpose of this study is to determine levels and distribution of dabrafenib, its metabolites, and trametinib (Cohort B only) in parenchymal brain metastases, extracranial metastases, and peripheral blood (plasma) within two cohorts of subjects with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive melanoma that has metastasized to the brain. All subjects will be followed for survival and new anti-cancer therapy for a total of two years or until death or the subject wishes to withdraw from further follow-up.

Optional collection of CSF was obtained in the operating room on the day of brain metastasis resection. CSF samples for only one participant were collected and analyzed., Day 15|Number of Participants With Changes in Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Pathway Markers, Changes in MAPK pathway markers in paired extracranial biopsies taken pre-treatment, during craniotomy, and at disease progression, and changes in markers between post-operative intracranial and extracranial biopsies was planned but not performed as the study was terminated due to low enrollment., Up to Day 15|Number of Participants With Changes in Radiographic Tumors, Changes in the radiographic characteristics of the tumors were planned to be compared to (1) levels of dabrafenib, its metabolites and trametinib (where appropriate) in the brain metastases, plasma, and CSF, and (2) MAPK pathway activation status in tumors at the time of surgery. Results were planned to be compared to the analysis of early clinical responses in extracranial metastases, as determined by the Positron emission tomography (PET-CT) imaging. This analysis was planned but not performed as the study was terminated due to low enrollment, Up to 2 years|Percent Change From Baseline to Pre-surgery in the Sum of the Longest Diameters (SLD) of Intracranial Target Lesions, The change from Baseline to the pre-surgery intracranial disease assessment in the SLD of intracranial target lesions was planned to be calculated as a percentage change from the baseline SLD. It was planned to be reported for the V600E and V600K analysis populations for each cohort and also aggregately if appropriate. This analysis was planned but not performed as the study was terminated due to low enrollment., Up to 2 years|Maximum Percent Change From Baseline in the SLD of Unresected Intracranial Target Lesions, The maximum change from Baseline in the SLD of unresected intracranial target lesions was planned to be calculated as a percentage change from the baseline SLD. It was planned to be reported for the V600E and V600K analysis populations for each cohort and also aggregately if appropriate. This analysis was planned but not performed as the study was terminated due to low enrollment., Up to 2 years|Percentage of Participants With Overall Extracranial Response Rate in Unresected Lesions, Overall Extracranial Response Rate was defined as the percentage of participants with Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR) at anytime as per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence and is determined programmatically based on the investigator's assessment of response at each time point. Overall Extracranial Response Rate was planned but not analyzed as the study was terminated due to low enrollment., Approximately 2 years or death whichever occurs first|Percentage of Participants With Overall Survival, Overall survival, defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to death for any reason, was planned to summarize using Kaplan-Meier quartile estimates along with two sided 95% confidence intervals. But were not performed as the study was terminated due to low enrollment., Approximately 2 years or death whichever occurs first|Number of Participants With Abnormal Vital Signs, Vital sign measurements including temperature, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate were planned to be performed but were neither summarized nor listed as the study was terminated., Up to 2 years|Number of Participants With Abnormal Physical Examinations, A complete physical examination was planned which included assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, thyroid, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen (liver and spleen), lymph nodes, and extremities. Height and weight was also planned to be measured and recorded. A complete physical exam including a thorough genitourinary examination for female participants, inspection of the head and neck region, and digital rectal examination for both male and female participants was planned to be performed at Screening, and Month 12 or at discontinuation if discontinuation occurs prior to Month 12. If the participants had a genitourinary and rectal exam within 6 months of screening, these assessments need not to be repeated at screening.
