Safety and Efficacy of Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine in Immune-related Myopathy (Myasthenia Gravis and Inflammatory Myopathy) Patients ï¼ša Prospective Observational Study
This study is a prospective observational study. We aim to investigate the safety and efficacy of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between immune-related myopathy (myasthenia gravis and inflammatory myopathy) patients and health controls. The main study factors include adverse events following immunization (AEFI), serum specific antibody (Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody, Anti-MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) antibody, myositis antibody) and virus neutralizing antibody titers.
