3D Printed Breast Models in the Surgical Management of Breast Cancer
To learn if providing a 3-D printed model of the breast can help breast cancer patients make decisions related to their care. During this study, some study participants will receive the 3-D printed model and some study participants will receive traditional breast imaging scans to learn if the 3-D printed model
Breast Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 3D printed model
Decision Conflict Scale (DCS) score questionnaires, Score scale ranges: Strongly Agree 1, Agree 2 Neither agree or Agree 3 Strongly Disagree 4, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective:

â€¢The objective of this prospective study is to determine the impact of 3D printed breast models, compared to 2D imaging, on breast cancer patients' decisional conflict related to treatment decision-making.

Secondary Objective:

* To observe if patients will change their initial desired surgical option (mastectomy versus lumpectomy) after viewing the 3D printed models
* To evaluate the quality of the communication between surgical providers and patients with and without the 3D printed models
* To assess the surgical outcome including the margin status
* To evaluate patient satisfaction and well-being post-surgery between the 3D printed model group and the control group as well as mastectomy versus lumpectomy subgroups
* To assess surgical providers' response to the acceptability and utility of the model
