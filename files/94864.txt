A Safety Study of SEA-CD70 in Patients With Myeloid Malignancies
This trial will look at a drug called SEA-CD70 with and without azacitidine, to find out if it is safe for participants with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It will study SEA-CD70 to find out what its side effects are and if it works for AML and MDS. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer.

This study will have seven groups or "parts."

* Part A will find out how much SEA-CD70 should be given to participants
* Part B will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SEA-CD70 is and if it works to treat participants with MDS.
* Part C will use the dose found in Part A to find out how safe SEA-CD70 is and if it works to treat participants with AML.
* Part D will find out how much SEA-CD70 with azacitidine should be given to participants
* Part E will use the dose found in Part D to find out how safe SEA-CD70 with azacitidine is and if it works to treat participants with MDS or MDS/AML that has not been treated.
* Part F will use the dose found in Part D to find out how safe SEA-CD70 with azacitidine is and if it works to treat participants with MDS or MDS/AML.
* Part G will find out how much SEA-CD70 with azacitidine and with venetoclax should be given to participants with AML. Also, to evaluate safety and tolerability of PF-08046040 in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax in participants with previously untreated AML who are unfit for standard induction chemotherapy.

This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-finding, and dose expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of SEA-CD70 monotherapy and SEA-CD70 in combination with azacitidine in adults with myeloid malignancies. The study will be conducted in up to 6 parts.

* Part A is a dose-escalation cohort designed to identify the MTD or recommended expansion dose of SEA-CD70 monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory (hypomethylating agent \[HMA\]-failure) MDS.
* Part B is an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory (HMA-failure) MDS.
* Part C is an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 monotherapy in participants with relapsed/refractory AML.
* Part D contains dose-finding/dose optimization cohorts designed to evaluate the safety/tolerability and identify the recommended expansion dose of SEA-CD70 in combination with azacitidine in participants with 1) relapsed/refractory (HMA-failure) MDS or MDS/AML, and 2) previously untreated higher-risk per IPSS-M (Moderate High, High or Very High) MDS or MDS/AML.
* Part E is an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 in combination with azacitidine in participants with previously untreated higher-risk per IPSS-M (Moderate High, High, or Very High) MDS or MDS/AML.
* Part F is an expansion cohort designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SEA-CD70 in combination with azacitidine in participants with relapsed/refractory (HMA-failure) MDS or MDS/AML.
