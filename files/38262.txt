Study of Safety and Efficacy of Iberdomide (CC-220) and CC-99282 Combined With R-CHOP to Treat Lymphoma
This is a Phase 1b study consisting of 2 parts: a dose escalation (Part 1) of CC-220 or CC-99282 added to the standard R-CHOP-21 regimen for first-line treatment of a-BCL. The dose escalation (Part 1) will consist of 2 parallel arms in combination with Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone (R-CHOP-21); CC-220 and R-CHOP-21 or CC-99282 and R-CHOP-21. Part 1 will be followed by a randomized dose expansion (Part 2) with CC-220 and/or CC-99282 at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) in combination with R-CHOP-21. A polatuzumab-R-CHP regimen in combination with CC-220 or CC-99282 will be explored with the addition of a new cohort only after the RP2D for the CC-220 and/or CC-99282 and R-CHOP-21 combination has been defined.
