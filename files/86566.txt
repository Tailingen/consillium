High-Dose Chemotherapy Plus Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Compared With Intermediate-Dose Chemotherapy Plus Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation With or Without Isotretinoin in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, thiotepa, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells. Isotretinoin may be effective in preventing recurrence of glioma. It is not yet known which regimen of chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation with or without isotretinoin is more effective in treating recurrent high-grade glioma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying high-dose chemotherapy or intermediate-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation to see how well it works compared to high-dose chemotherapy or intermediate-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation and isotretinoin in treating young patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.

BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: isotretinoin|DRUG: thiotepa|PROCEDURE: autologous bone marrow transplantation|PROCEDURE: peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
Event-free survival, The primary endpoint for the evaluation of treatment efficacy will be event-free survival (EFS), om study entry to disease progression, disease relapse, occurrence of a second malignant neoplasm, or death from any cause. assessed up to 4 years|Toxic death attributable to complications of treatment in the absence of tumor progression as assessed by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, Toxic death will be monitored separately in each of the two chemotherapy groups, Up to 4 years after completion of study treatment
Overall survival (OS), Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), which is defined as the time from study entry to death from any cause, assessed up to 4 years, ondary e ndpoints include overall survival (OS), which is defined as the time from study entry to death from any cause assessed up to 4 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Compare the event-free survival and overall survival of pediatric patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas treated with a single course of high-dose carboplatin, etoposide, and thiotepa and autologous stem cell transplantation vs multiple courses of intermediate-dose carboplatin and thiotepa and autologous stem cell transplantation with or without isotretinoin.
* Compare the number of hospital days and time to engraftment in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the toxic death rate in patients treated with these regimens.
* Compare the tolerability of isotretinoin in patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to pathologic diagnosis (glioblastoma multiforme vs anaplastic astrocytoma vs other high-grade glioma).

* Chemotherapy and autologous stem cell reinfusion (ASCR): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

  * Arm I (high-dose chemotherapy and ASCR): Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy comprising carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days -8 to -6; thiotepa IV over 3 hours and etoposide IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -3; and filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) or bone marrow are reinfused on day 0.
  * Arm II (intermediate-dose chemotherapy and ASCR): Patients receive intermediate-dose chemotherapy comprising carboplatin IV over 4 hours and thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days 1-2 and G-CSF IV or SC once daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover. Autologous PBSC or bone marrow are reinfused on day 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 3 courses.
* Maintenance therapy: After recovery from chemotherapy (approximately day 30 post-transplantation), all patients are further randomized to 1 of 2 maintenance arms.

  * Arm I: Patients receive oral isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 6 courses.
  * Arm II: Patients do not receive maintenance therapy. In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80-150 patients (40-75 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
