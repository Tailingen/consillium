Retrospective Evaluation of 3 Colonic Adenoma Detection Strategies
Retrospective study, single blind (patient), allowing a posteriori clinical data collection of 90 patients during their passage to the ambulatory endoscopy circuit, to consider 3 groups and thus to deduce a colonic adenoma detection rate for each arm :

* Colonoscopy Only Group
* Artificial intelligence only group (IA GI GENIUS ™ alone)
* Endoscopic Cap and Artificial Intelligence Group (endoscopy cap associated with the GI GENIUS ™ IA System)
Adenoma Colon|Colorectal Cancer|Colorectal Polyp|Colonic Adenocarcinoma
Colonic Adenomas Detection Rate according to the use of the Combine Techniques GENIUS software - Cap or Only GENIUS software, number of colonoscopies with the discovery of at least 1 colonic adenoma out of the total number of colonoscopies according to the use of colonoscopy alone / artificial intelligence alone / artificial intelligence combined with the endoscopic cap., 4 months
Adenomas Rate according to their morphology, according to Paris classification, 4 months|Adenomas Rate according to their size, \< 0,5mm / 0-5-10mm / \> 10mm, 4 months|Adenomas Rate according to their histology, according to Vienne classification, 4 months|Caecal Intubation Rate, Complete colonocopy rate, 4 months|Withdrawal time, 4 months|Adverse effects, Haemorrhages, Perforation, 4 months
