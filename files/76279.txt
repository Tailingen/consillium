The Role of Induction Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in the Era of IMRT
The purpose of this study is to verify that induction gemcitabine and cisplatin plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is non-inferior to concurrent weekly cisplatin plus IMRT for patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: cisplatin|RADIATION: Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy
Failure-free survival, Failure-free survival rate is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of treatment failure or death from any cause, whichever is first., 2 years
Overall survival, Overall survival is calculated from randomization to death from any cause., 2 years|Locoregional failure-free survival, Locoregional failure-free survival is calculated from randomization to the first locoregional failure., 2 years|Distant failure-free survival, Distant failure-free survival is calculated from randomization to the first remote failure., 2 years|Overall response rate, Overall response rate at 3 months after completion of IMRT, 3 months after completion of IMRT|Number of participants with adverse events, Incidence of acute and late toxicity, 2 years|Quality of life during treatment, Quality of life is measured by FACIT questionnaire., During whole chemotherapy and IMRT treatment.For experimental arm, an expected average of 12 weeks; for active comparator arm, an expected average of 6 weeks.
Patients with non-keratinizing NPC T1-4N2-3或T3-4N0-1M0 (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) are randomly assigned to receive induction chemotherapy or CCRT alone. Patients in experimental group receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² d1,8) and cisplatin (80mg/m² d1) every 3 weeks for 2 cycles before intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Patients in control group receive IMRT concurrently with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m² up to 7cycles.

IMRT is given as 2.0-2.33 Gy per fraction with five daily fractions per week for 6-7 weeks to a total dose of 66 Gy or greater to the primary tumor.

Our primary endpoint is failure-free survival (FFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS) rates and toxic effects. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population, and the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
