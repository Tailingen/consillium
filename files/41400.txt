The trial is a randomized, comparative, double-blind trial comparing the efficacy and safety of pentaisomaltose (PentaHibe®, Pharmacosmos A/S, Holbæk; termed PIM in the following) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), when used for preservation of harvested hematopoietic stem cells. Approximately 150 subjects with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma or malignant lymphoma (a minimum of 30 % of each diagnosis and an equal distribution in each preservation group) and undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) will be included.

The subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive ASCT preserved in the following cryo-protective agent (CPA):

* A: PIM 16 %
* B: DMSO 10 %
