Weight Loss Intervention for the Reduction of Cancer Risk and Health Disparities in Rural Ohio
This study determines the feasibility of a telephone-based weight lost intervention in reducing cancer risk and health disparities in rural Ohio. Obesity is the leading preventable cause of cancer, and obesity-related inflammation is linked to elevated cancer risk, independent of obesity itself. Rural populations are a vulnerable population in need of increased access to tailored strategies and benefit from weight loss interventions. This study aims to see whether a telephone-based intervention may help obese people in rural area to reduce body weight, so as to prevent obesity-related cancer.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 15-week telephone-based weight loss intervention among overweight/obese rural residents.

II. To estimate the preliminary efficacy of the lifestyle modifications on weight loss, body composition (fat mass, percent body fat), inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, and C-recreative protein \[CRP\]), and other disease risk factors (lipid profiles).

OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Participants receive weekly telephone-based weight loss intervention for 15 weeks, including dietary recommendations tailored to their current weight and weight loss target, home-based aerobic and resistance exercise, and weekly telephone counseling session over 30-45 minutes.

ARM II: Participants receive education brochures describing the American Institute for Cancer Research physical activity and dietary guidelines.
