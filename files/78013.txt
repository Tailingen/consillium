A Study of Vantictumab (OMP-18R5) in Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in Previously Untreated Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer
This is an open-label Phase 1b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of vantictumab when combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.
Pancreatic Cancer|Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Vantictumab|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Phase 1b: Safety and tolerability of vantictumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated Stage IV pancreatic cancer, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined in patients treated with vantictumab in combination with weekly nab-paclitaxel, Subjects will be treated and observed for DLT through the end of the first cycle (Days 0-28)
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of vantictumab when administered in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine to patients with previously untreated Stage IV pancreatic cancer, Apparent half life, AUC, clearance, volume of distribution, Vantictumab will be administered IV on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine will be administered IV on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.
Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been determined, up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of vantictumab combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Up to approximately 34 patients may be enrolled into the study.
