Chemo-Immunotherapy Followed by Durvalumab and Ceralasertib in Treatment Na√Øve Patients With Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The primary objective of this single arm study is to estimate the progression free survival of previously-untreated patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. Patients will receive initial chemo-immunotherapy followed by maintenance therapy with durvalumab and oral ceralasertib.
Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Ceralasertib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the initiation of treatment (C1D1) to the time when the criteria for disease progression is met as defined by RECIST v1.1 OR death due to any cause. The PFS is subject to right censoring due to loss to follow-up or at the end of study duration., From enrollment until the time of disease progression, assessed for a maximum of 24 months
Time to disease progression, Time to disease progression: Will be measured from C1D1 of treatment until the criteria for disease progression is met as defined by RECIST 1.1, From enrollment until the time of disease progression,assessed for a maximum of 24 months|Time to CNS Progression, Time to CNS progression: Will be measured from C1D1 of treatment until the criteria for disease progression is met in the CNS (intracranial) by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Patients with CNS -only progression or those with concurrent CNS and systemic progression will be included in this analysis., From enrollment until the time of cns progression, assessed for a maximum of 24 months|Time to Systemic Progression, Time to Systemic progression: Will be measured from C1D1 of treatment until the criteria for systemic disease (extracranial) progression is met by RECIST 1.1. Patients with systemic-only or those with concurrent CNS and systemic progression will be included in this analysis., From enrollment until the time of systemic progression, assessed for a maximum of 24 months|Progression free survival for maintenance therapy, Progression free survival for maintenance therapy: Will be measured from C5D1 of first maintenance therapy until the criteria for disease progression is met as defined by RECIST 1.1, From Cycle 5, Day 1 of maintenance therapy until disease progression, assessed for a maximum of 19 months|Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR): Will include complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) and will be determined as per RECIST1.1, 24 months|Duration of Response, Duration of Response: The period measured from the time that measurement criteria are met for complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since treatment started)., 24 months|Disease Control Rate, Disease control rate: The disease control rate is the proportion of all subjects with stable disease (SD) for 8 weeks, or partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) according to RECIST v1.1, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment)., 8 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival: Will be measured from D1 to death from any cause, 24 months|Toxicity Profile, Describe the toxicity profile of durvalumab and ceralasertib combination therapy by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v5., 24 months
