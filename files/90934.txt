Neoadjuvant IBI308, Bevacizumab, Plus Pemetrexed and Carboplatin Followed by Surgery in Unresectable Stage III NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to studying neoadjuvant IBI308, bevacizumab, plus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
Lung Cancer Stage III
DRUG: IBI308|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin|PROCEDURE: Thoracic surgery
Resectability rate, Resectability rate was defined as the percentage of patients who were able to undergo surgery after induction., 3 months
Number of participants with perioperative complications, Safety, 2 years
Event-free survival, Event-free survival was defined as the time from registration to disease progression (local relapse or distant metastases) or death from any cause, whichever came first., 2 years|Overall survival, Overall survival was assessed from randomization to death as a result of any cause., 2 years
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the recommended therapeutic approach for patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although surgery offers the chance of cure. With combined-modality therapy with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis of stage III NSCLC remains poor. IBI308 (sintilimab) is a recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody. This study is to studying neoadjuvant IBI308, bevacizumab, plus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by surgery to see how well it works in treating patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.
