A Study to Evaluate Long-term Safety of CC-486 (Oral Azacitidine) in Subjects With Hematological Disorders
Rollover study supporting hematological disorder indications from Celgene sponsored CC-486 (oral azacitidine) protocols eligible for participation in the study.
Hematologic Neoplasm|Neoplasms|Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: CC-486
Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology., Approximately 5 years
Overall Survival, Time from randomization until death from any cause.

If required by the parent CC-486 study protocol., Up to 5 years
The open-label, multicenter, multinational rollover study is intended to evaluate the safety of CC-486 (oral azacitidine), while providing continued treatment with CC-486 for subjects who are receiving single agent CC-486 at the time of transition to the rollover study and tolerated the protocol prescribed regimen in Celgene-sponsored trials, and whom in the opinion of the Investigator may derive clinical benefit from continuing treatment with CC-486. Subjects' survival will also be followed if required by the parent CC-486 study protocol. If approved by Celgene, subjects from any ongoing or future Celgene sponsored CC-486 studies in hematological disorders will be included in this protocol.
