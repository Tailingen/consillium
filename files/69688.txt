Study to Evaluate MEDI-507 in Patients With CD2-Positive Lymphoma/Leukemia
For primary objectives, we will determine the MTD and examine clinical responses and immune cell populations to determine an OBD, and describe the safety and tolerability of MEDI-507.

For the secondary objectives we will look at the antitumor activity of MEDI 507, PK, serum concentrations, and immunogenicity of MEDI-507, as well as time courses of depletion and recovery of CD2 positive and total T-Cell populations.
Lymphoma|Leukemia|Cancer
DRUG: MEDI-507
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the optimal biological dose|(OBD) of MEDI-507 based on safety and tolerability of MEDI-507 in patients with|CD-2 positive lymphoproliferative disorders.
For primary objectives, we will determine the MTD and examine clinical responses and immune cell populations to determine an OBD, and describe the safety and tolerability of MEDI-507.

For the secondary objectives we will look at the antitumor activity of MEDI 507, PK, serum concentrations, and immunogenicity of MEDI-507, as well as time courses of depletion and recovery of CD2 positive and total T-Cell populations.
