A Protocol of Irinotecan for Carcinoma of the Lung
The goal of this trial is to demonstrate the potential clinical benefit of irinotecan chemotherapy in patients with a specific NSCLC phenotype, ISG15-positive. The use of irinotecan in subjects with ISG15-positive NSCLC will be associated with an improved rate of clinical benefit (objective response, disease stability, and time to progression) compared to historical controls that were not previously selected for ISG-15 expression.
