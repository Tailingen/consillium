HOPE Against Cancer Recurrence in HCC
Liver transplantation is often performed to treat liver cancer, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in patients with impaired liver function due to cirrhosis. A shortcoming, however, is tumor recurrence after transplantation. Approximately 15 % of patients receiving livers develop recurrence and this depends on the quality of the liver received.

Machine liver perfusion, for example, hypothermic oxygenated liver perfusion (HOPE), which means that the organ is perfused with an oxygen-rich fluid in a cold environment before transplantation, is a novel method to improve the quality of livers before implantation. The standard of care is cold storage without perfusion.

The objective of this study is to compare the survival after tumor recurrence of patients after liver transplantation for HCC between perfused and not perfused livers. This study's hypothesis is that survival without tumor recurrence is improved when the liver is perfused before implantation.

The study involves transplant centers worldwide, and adults with HCC waiting for liver transplantation are included. 220 Patients will be recruited within 12 months and then observed for at least 2 years after transplantation. To provide the most valid results, the patients will be randomly allocated to either the organ perfusion group or a control group with standard-of-care cold storage of the organ.
Liver Transplantation|HCC|Oncological Outcomes
PROCEDURE: Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion|PROCEDURE: Conventional cold storage
Recurrence free survival, Post transplant HCC recurrence free survival, i.e. the time interval a patient is alive without HCC recurrence after transplantation, i.e., until either HCC recurrence is observed, or the patient dies from any cause., 24 months
HCC recurrence (while alive), Number of HCC recurrences, 24 months|HCC recurrence (while alive), Time to recurrence of HCC, 24 months|HCC-related death, Death related to HCC, 24 months|HCC-related death, Time to HCC related death, 24 months|Death from any other causes than HCC, Death not related to HCC, 24 months|Death from any other causes than HCC, Time to death not related to HCC, 24 months|Mean number of circulating tumour deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood, This will be measured before transplantation (baseline), at discharge and at 6 months after transplantation. This endpoint will add information on the risk of tumour recurrence by seeding circulating cells., 6 months|Mean number of high-mobility-group-protein B1 (HMGB-1) in blood, This will be measured at the time of transplantation (baseline) and 1 week after transplantation.

This endpoint will add information on danger signalling in both study arms during early and late reperfusion., 1 week|Median Rejection Activity Index, The Rejection Activity Index (RAI) in liver histology (biopsy) is performed at 6 months after transplantation. This endpoint assessed in liver histology (biopsy) will show endothelial and T cell activation in implanted livers within the first months after 6 months.

The RAI can be used to score liver allograft biopsies with acute rejection. The scale is from 1 to 9, higher scores mean more severe signs of rejection., 6 months|Liver related complications, This endpoint will allow to assess the association between initial graft injury and liver specific complications in both study arms., 24 months
