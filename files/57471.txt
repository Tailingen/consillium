Combining MRI and CEUS to Diagnose Small Cervical Lymph Node Metastases in NPC Patients
This is a single-center diagnostic accuracy study, with the purpose to define the criteria to diagnose small cervical lymph node metastases in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma by combining MRI scanning and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and evaluate the diagnostic performance of the criteria.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MRI Scanning|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Ultrasound-guided Lymph Node Aspiration
Combined Diagnostic Criteria to Diagnose Small Cervical Lymph Node Metastases, The criteria to diagnose small cervical lymph node metastases in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma by combining MRI scanning and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with specific ultrasound contrast agents (Sonazoid)., The pathologic results of the lymph nodes are expected to be obtained within one week after the MRI scanning, CEUS examination, and ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration.|Sensitivity and Specificity of the Combined Diagnostic Criteria, The pathologic results of the lymph nodes are expected to be obtained within one week after the MRI scanning, CEUS examination, and ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration.
Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Optimal Cut-off Value of Each Characteristics of Small Lymph Nodes in MRI Scanning and CEUS Examination, The receiver operating characteristic curve of each characteristics of small lymph nodes in MRI scanning and CEUS examination will be plotted. The area under the curve will be calculated. And the optimal cut-off value of each characteristics will be determined based on the receiver operating characteristic curve., The pathologic results of the lymph nodes are expected to be obtained within one week after the MRI scanning, CEUS examination, and ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration.|Diagnostic Performance of Each Characteristics of Small Lymph Nodes in MRI Scanning and CEUS Examination Based on the Optimal Cut-off Value, The diagnostic performance of each characteristics of small lymph nodes in MRI scanning and CEUS examination will be evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio., The pathologic results of the lymph nodes are expected to be obtained within one week after the MRI scanning, CEUS examination, and ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration.|Inter-operator Agreement of Each Characteristics of Small Lymph Nodes in MRI Scanning and CEUS Examination, The inter-operator agreement of qualitative characteristics of small lymph nodes in MRI scanning and CEUS examination will be evaluated with Cohen's kappa coefficient. The inter-operator agreement of quantitative characteristics of small lymph nodes in MRI scanning and CEUS examination will be evaluated with Bland-Altman analysis and paired t-test., The pathologic results of the lymph nodes are expected to be obtained within one week after the MRI scanning, CEUS examination, and ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration.|Diagnostic Performance of the Combined Diagnostic Criteria, The diagnostic performance of the combined diagnostic criteria will be evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Youden index, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio., The pathologic results of the lymph nodes are expected to be obtained within one week after the MRI scanning, CEUS examination, and ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration.|Inter-operator Agreement of the Combined Diagnostic Criteria, The inter-operator agreement of the combined diagnostic criteria will be evaluated with Cohen's kappa coefficient., The pathologic results of the lymph nodes are expected to be obtained within one week after the MRI scanning, CEUS examination, and ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration.
For newly diagnosed and histologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients staged as T1-4, N0-1/N3, M0 (AJCC 8th), if no metastatic lymph nodes were found on MRI according to the current diagnostic criteria, but there were small lymph nodes with a minimal axial diameter â‰¥ 5 mm (6 mm for lymph node in level IIA) on at least one side of the patient's neck, they will be eligible for this study. The MRI image of the small lymph nodes will be evaluated in details by experienced radiologists. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with specific ultrasound contrast agents (Sonazoid) and ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration will be performed. Subsequently, the lymph node tissue obtained from ultrasound-guided lymph node aspiration will be subjected to pathologic evaluation. Using the pathologic diagnosis of the lymph node as the gold standard, diagnostic performance of MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography will be evaluated. Resonable criteria to diagnose small cervical lymph node metastases by combining MRI scanning and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography will be explored. And the diagnostic performance of the criteria will be evaluated.
