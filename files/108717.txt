The Effect of Preoperative Hemotologic Markers on Postoperative Long-term and Short-term Outcomes for Laparoscopic Gastrectomy
The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of preoperative hemotologic markers on postoperative long-term and short-term outcomes for laparoscopic gastrectomy.
Stomach Neoplasms
3-year disease overall survival rate, 36 months
overall postoperative morbidity rates, Refers to the incidence of early postoperative complications. The early postoperative complication are defined as the event observed within 30 days after surgery., 30 days|3-year disease free survival rate, 36 months|3-year recurrence pattern, 36 months|Time to first ambulation, The data of postoperative recovery course., 10 days|The number of lymph node dissection, 1 day|The variation of weight, The variation of weight on postoperative 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, 12 months|The daily highest body temperature, The daily highest body temperature before discharge, 7 day|Time to first flatus, 10 days|Time to first liquid diet, 10 days|Time to soft diet, 10 days|Duration of hospital stay, 10 days|Intraoperative lymph node dissection time, intraoperative lymph node dissection time includes infrapyloric area lymph node,suprapancreatic area lymph node,splenic hilar area lymph node, cardial area lymph node and jejunal lymph nodes adjacent to the anastomosis., 1 days|The amount of abdominal drainage, 10 days|Blood transfusion, 10 days|The number of positive lymph nodes, 1 day|Intraoperative morbidity rates, The intraoperative postoperative morbidity rates are defined as the rates of event observed within operation., 1 day|The rate of conversion to laparotomy, 1 day|The variation of cholesterol, The variation of cholesterol in millimole/liter on postoperative 3, 6, 9 and 12 months are used to access the postoperative nutritional status and quality of life., 12 months|The variation of albumin, The variation of album in gram/liter on postoperative 3, 6, 9 and 12 months are used to access the postoperative nutritional status and quality of life., 12 months|The results of endoscopy, the results of endoscopy on postoperative 3 and 12 months, 12 months|The values of white blood cell count, The values of white blood cell count from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The values of lymphocyte count, The values of lymphocyte count from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The values of monocyte count, The values of monocyte count from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The values of neutrophil differential count, The values of neutrophil differential count from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The values of platelet count, The values of platelet count count from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The values of hemoglobin, The values of hemoglobin in gram/liter from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The values of C-reactive protein, The values of C-reactive protein IN milligram/liter from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|The values of prealbumin, The values of prealbumin in gram/liter from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded to access the inflammatory and immune response., Preoperative 3 days and postoperative 1, 3, and 5 days|Visual Analog Score for pain, the values of visual analog score for pain before operation and on postoperative day 1 to day 7 are recorded., 7 days
A prospective cohort study will be performed to explore the effect of preoperative hemotologic markers on postoperative long-term and short-term outcomes for laparoscopic gastrectomy.The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative complications and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
