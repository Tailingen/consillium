Probiotics for Treatment of Chalazion in Adults
There is growing evidence encouraging probiotics use in several diseases. The aim of the investigator's study is to define the possible beneficial impact of probiotics on adults suffering from chalazia.
Chalazion
OTHER: conservative treatment|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: probiotics
healing time, healing time changes with a complete resolution of chalazion, 3 months
recurrences, evaluation of recurrences in both arms, six months
Prospective comparative pilot study on 20 adults suffering from chalazion randomly divided into two groups. The first group, received conservative treatment with lid hygiene, warm compression, and dexamethasone/tobramycin ointment for at least 20 days. The second group, in addition to the conservative treatment, received a mixture of probiotic microorganisms once a day up to 3 months. Chalazia were classified according to their size into three groups: small (â‰¤2 mm), medium (2-4 mm), or large (\>4 mm). When conservative treatment (with and without probiotics supplementation) failed to resolve the lesion, invasive methods were used, (intralesion steroid injection in medium size chalazion and surgical incision and curettage for the largest ones).
