Trial of Tumor Vaccine Used for Adjuvant Therapy in Post Radical Operation Patients With Lung Cancer
Tumor vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. This research study is evaluating a new type of tumor vaccine termed as "Neoantigen Tumor Vaccine". The purpose of this phase I/II trial study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of neoantigentumor vaccine in post radical operation patients with stage IIIA lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Tumor Vaccine
Disease-free Survival (DFS), The time that participants stay free of cancer after surgery following administration of tumor vaccine, Approximately 2 years|Adverse Events (AEs), Number of participants experiencing clinical and laboratory adverse events, 30 days from first study vaccine administration
Outline: After successful vaccine manufacturing, patients receive neoantigen tumor vaccine hypodermically (5 injections for each 3 days and then 1 injection for each 3 months till recurrence or up to 2 years). Treatment continues in the absence of disease recurrence and metastasis or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients are followed for 2 years or up to the absence of disease recurrence and metastasis.

Projected accrual: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
