Study of Recombinant Interleukin 21 in Combination With Sorafenib for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether recombinant IL-21 used in combination with sorafenib is safe for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: rIL-21 only|DRUG: rIL-21 + sorafenib
Safety profile, including incidence and severity of adverse events, During treatment and 28 days after last dose of rIL-21
Objective response rate at recommended dose of rIL-21, Every 6 weeks during treatment and then every 3 months after last dose of rIL-21 until 3 months after median survival is reached|Progression-free survival at recommended dose of rIL-21, Every 6 weeks during treatment and then every 3 months after last dose of rIL-21 until 3 months after median survival is reached|Pharmacokinetic profiles of rIL-21 and sorafenib, rIL-21: During treatment and 15 days after dosing; sorafenib: During treatment and 22 days after dosing
This is a Phase 1/2 open-label dose-escalation study of rIL-21 given in combination with sorafenib to patients with metastatic RCC. The Phase 1 part of this study will estimate the maximum tolerated dose of rIL-21 given for 1 treatment course (consisting of two 5-day cycles of rIL-21) in combination with a standard dose of sorafenib administered during a 6-week treatment course. Increasing doses of rIL-21 will be studied sequentially in different groups of patients. The Phase 2 part of the study will further evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of rIL-21 at the dose recommended from Phase 1 in combination with sorafenib. Patients will be evaluated for safety over the course of the study. Disease evaluation (tumor restaging) will be performed during the last week of each 6-week treatment course. Patients with stable disease or better at this evaluation may go on to receive additional treatment courses. Patients may be in the study for 2 to 7 months.
