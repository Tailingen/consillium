Detection of FGFR Gene Mutations in the Tumor Tissue and Urine of Patients With Urothelial Carcinoma
This study aims to compare the correlation between FGFR mutations found in bladder cancer tissues and urine to develop a companion diagnostic method for predicting the effect of FGFR inhibitors using urine samples of the patients with urothelial cancer.
Bladder Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: FGFR test
Correlation between FGFR mutations found in bladder cancer tissues and urine before and after treatment, The ratio of patients with matching test results to total patients, Up to two weeks before and after surgery
Changes in FGFR mutations in tissues before and after treatment, Changes in FGFR mutations in tissues before and after treatment will be observed in the patients with muscle-invasive and non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and transurethral bladder tumor resection, respectively, due to recurrence., Up to two weeks before and after treatment|Patient prognosis, recurrence-free, six months and one year after treatment|Patient prognosis, progression-free, six months and one year after treatment|Patient prognosis, cancer-specific survivals, six months and one year after treatment|Patient prognosis, overall survivals, six months and one year after treatment|PD-L1 expression, PD-L1 expression level will be measured using immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, and other suitable methods to analyze the bladder cancer subtypes, Up to two weeks before and after treatment
This study targets 92 patients with urothelial cancer, whose tissue (from scheduled surgery) and urine samples can be obtained, regardless of the treatment stage.

â–  Examination Methods

* FGFR mutations in bladder cancer tissues will be analyzed using next-generation sequencing and current companion diagnostic methods.
* FGFR mutations in urine samples obtained from patients with bladder cancer will be analyzed using nanowires.
* Bladder cancer subtyping will be performed by RNA sequencing of tumor tissues or other methods.
* Analysis of paired tissues before and after chemotherapy will be performed on transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TUR-BT) and cystectomy tissues before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
