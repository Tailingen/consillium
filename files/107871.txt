Three-port Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Surgery for Colorectal Cancer
This study is designed to evaluate the short-term and long-term results after three-port laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer（TLSC） compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer（CLSC）.

At present，surgical treatments is the main means to cure colorectal cancer（CRC）.The use of four or more ports has been routine in most laparoscopic colorectal resections. However，the drawbacks are the need for added manpower, consisting of another assistant to provide counter-traction, as well as costs and the unaesthetic effects of additional ports. In order to minimize surgical trauma, improve cosmesis ,reduce manpower，single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is attracting increasing attention. But it is challenging and highly demanding techniques. Becoming proficient at three-port laparoscopic surgery can make the transition to SILS more nature.Few studies about three-port laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer（TLSC） have been reported currently.More studies, especially large-scale, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the best indications for TLSC. This is a single-center, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial. A total of 282 eligible patients will be randomly assigned to TLSC group and CLSC group at a 1:1 ratio. It will provide valuable clinical evidence for the objective assessment of the the feasibility, safety, and potential benefits of TLSC compared with CLSC.
