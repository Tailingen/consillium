AsiDNA (a DNA Repair Inhibitor) Administered IntraVenously in Advanced Solid Tumors
The aim of the study is to assess:

* Part A: the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of AsiDNA in patients with advanced solid tumors.
* Part B: the safety and preliminary efficacy of AsiDNA in combination with Carboplatin with or without Paclitaxel in patients with Advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: AsiDNA
Determine dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of iv infusions of AsiDNA., DLTs will be based on the toxicities observed during the first 3 weeks of study treatment (i.e, cycle 1: from Day 1 to Day 21) for Part A and during the 4 weeks of study treatment (i.e, cycle 1: from Day 1 to Day 28) for Part B.

MTD is defined as the dose immediately below the unacceptable dose or defined as the highest tested dose if no DLT observed at this dose., At Cycle 1 (a cycle is 21 days for Part A and 28 days for Part B) for all patients
Collection of new Adverse Events and follow-up of all ongoing Adverse Events assessed, Adverse Events will be reported and graded based on the National Cancer Institute \[NCI\] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (AE) \[CTCAE\] scale, version 4.03., At Cycle 1 (at Day 1; Day 3; Day 8; Day 15) and at Cycle 2 (at Day 1; Day 8; Day 15) and at each subsequent cycles in any (at Day 1; Day 8; Day 15) for all patients|Elimination half-life (t1/2) of iv infusions of AsiDNA, The following standard plasma PK parameter for IV AsiDNA will be analyzed:

elimination half-life (t1/2) in hours, At Cycle 1 (at Day 1; Day 3; Day 8; Day 15) and at cycle 2 (at Day 1) for all patients|ECG evaluation for safety assessment, 12-lead ECG will be performed before each cycle (e.g at Day 1 of cycle 1; Day 1 of cycle 2 and Day 1 of each subsequent cycles if any) per usual center's practice., Before each cycle (e.g at Day 1 of cycle 1; Day 1 of cycle 2 and Day 1 of each subsequent cycles if any) per usual center's practice.|Peak plasma concentration of iv infusions of AsiDNA, The following standard plasma PK parameter for IV AsiDNA will be analyzed:

peak plasma concentration (Cmax) in ng/mL, At Cycle 1 (at Day 1; Day 3; Day 8; Day 15) and at cycle 2 (at Day 1) for all patients|Time to peak plasma concentration of iv infusions of AsiDNA, The following standard plasma PK parameter for IV AsiDNA will be analyzed:

time to peak plasma concentration (tmax) in hours, At Cycle 1 (at Day 1; Day 3; Day 8; Day 15) and at cycle 2 (at Day 1) for all patients|Area under the curve of iv infusions of AsiDNA, The following standard plasma PK parameter for IV AsiDNA will be analyzed:

area under the curve (AUC) in mg\*h/L., At Cycle 1 (at Day 1; Day 3; Day 8; Day 15) and at cycle 2 (at Day 1) for all patients|Accumulation factor based on total plasma exposure of iv infusions of AsiDNA, The following standard plasma PK parameter for IV AsiDNA will be analyzed:

accumulation factor between Day 1 and Day 3 based on total plasma exposure., At Cycle 1 (at Day 1) and at cycle 2 (at Day 1) for all patients
The aim of the study is to assess:

* Part A: the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of AsiDNA in patients with advanced solid tumors.
* Part B: the safety and preliminary efficacy of AsiDNA in combination with Carboplatin with or without Paclitaxel in patients with Advanced solid tumors.
