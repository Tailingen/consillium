Study of SGR-2921 in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose (RD) of SGR-2921.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia|High-Risk and Very High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: SGR-2921
Dose Limiting Toxicities, From first dose until the end of Cycle 1 (approximately 28 days, up to 42 days).|Adverse Events, Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events (AEs) as assessed by the NCI CTCAE v5.0., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.|Electrocardiograms in Singlicate and Triplicate, Uncorrected QT interval, QTcF, PR duration, QRS interval, and RR interval., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.
SGR-2921 Maximal Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Concentrations of SGR-2921 in plasma are measured at various timepoints following its administration to calculate typical exposure/PK parameters, including, but not limited to, the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax)., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.|SGR-2921 Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin), Concentrations of SGR-2921 in plasma are measured at various timepoints following its administration to calculate typical exposure/PK parameters, including, but not limited to, the minimum plasma concentration (Cmin)., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.|SGR-2921 Time to Maximal Plasma Concentration (tmax), Concentrations of SGR-2921 in plasma are measured at various timepoints following its administration to calculate typical exposure/PK parameters, including, but not limited to, the time to maximal plasma concentration (tmax)., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.|SGR-2921 Area Under the Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC), Concentrations of SGR-2921 in plasma are measured at various timepoints following its administration to calculate typical exposure/PK parameters, including, but not limited to, the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC)., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.|Composite Complete Remission (CR) Rate for Subjects with AML, The percentage of subjects with CR, CR with Partial Hematologic Recovery (CRh), and CR with Incomplete Blood Count Recovery (CRi)., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) for Subjects with AML, The percentage of subjects achieving CR, CRh, CRi, morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) and Partial Response (PR)., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) for Subjects with MDS, The percentage of subjects achieving CR and PR., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.|Duration of Response (DOR) for Subjects with AML, The time from first response (CR, CRh, CRi, MLFS, or PR) to the date of initial objectively documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.|Duration of Response (DOR) for subjects with MDS, The time from first response (CR or PR) to the date of initial objectively documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Throughout the study, up to 26 months.
This is a study of SGR-2921, an oral, small molecule inhibitor of cell division cycle 7-related protein kinase (CDC7), in subjects with Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose (RD) of SGR-2921.

Exploratory cohorts may evaluate additional PK, PD, preliminary anti-tumor activity, and safety to establish the SGR-2921 RD. A planned amendment will evaluate SGR-2921 in combination with other approved AML/MDS treatments such as hypomethylating agents (HMA), BCL2 inhibitors, IDH inhibitors or FLT3 inhibitors, in patients with AML and/or MDS.
