Trial of Individual Psychosocial Interventions for Cancer Patients
The aim of the study is to compare the benefits of three types of individual treatment programs for cancer patients: Meaning-Centered counseling, Supportive counseling, and Enhanced Usual Care.

We would like to train therapists in administering these types of counseling, so that they have expertise to work on the study. The therapists will administer either the Meaning-Centered counseling or the Supportive counseling, as part of their training.

Many cancer patients use counseling or other resources to help with the emotional burden of their illnesses. Counseling often helps them cope with cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. "Meaning-Centered" counseling aims to teach cancer patients how to maintain or even increase a sense of meaning and purpose in their lives, despite cancer. "Supportive" counseling is intended to help the patient cope with cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings and get support. Enhanced Usual Care is intended to offer the patient referrals and resources that are matched to their individual needs in addition to the care they are already receiving at MSKCC.

Participant Meaning Making Scores Using the Life Attitude Profile-Revised (LAP-R), The Life Attitude Profile-Revised (LAP-R) is a 48-item self-report measure of discovered meaning and purpose in life and the motivation to find meaning and purpose in life. There are 6 subscales: Purpose (8 items, Minimum 8, Maximum 56, Higher is better), Coherence (8 items, Minimum 8, Maximum 56, Higher is better), Life control (8 items, Minimum 8, Maximum 56, Higher is better), Death acceptance (8 items, Minimum 8, Maximum 56, Higher is better), Existential transcendence (16 items, Minimum 16, Maximum 112, Higher is better), Personal Meaning (16 items, Minimum 16, Maximum 112, Higher is better), Goal Seeking (8 items, Minimum 8, Maximum 56, Higher is better): LAP-R total score (48 items, Minimum 72, Maximum 504, Higher is better). The LAP-R total score is derived by summing all subscales., baseline meaning making measures and again at post-intervention (approximately week 8)
Clinical and Demographic Variables That May Correspond to Differential Responses to Individual Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy, The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWB) comprises 12 items, each on a 0 ('Not at All') to 4 ('Very Much'). The SWB total score is derived by summing the responses, with a higher score representing high spiritual well-being. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 48., baseline meaning making measures and again at post-intervention (approximately week 8)|The Relative Impact of Individual Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy on Different Aspects of Meaning (e.g., Purpose, Coherence, Existential Vacuum), as Well as on Different Aspects of Spiritual Well-being (Meaning Versus Faith),, Single Item Scale (SIS) from the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL): The McGill Quality Of Life Questionnaire is a 17-item scale, with each item rated on a scale of 0 to 10, divided into four domains (the Single-Item Scale (SIS), physical symptoms, feelings and thoughts, and social). It is a brief, self-report instrument designed to assess various domains of psychological, spiritual, and physical functioning among terminally ill patients. In this study the SIS from the MQOL was used. For each scale participants rate their current functioning on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being Very Bad and 10 being Excellent, higher is better., baseline meaning making measures and again at post-intervention (approximately week 8)|Whether an Enhanced Sense of Meaning "Explains" (Mediates) Improved Psychological Well-being (i.e., Increased Quality of Life, Decreased Psychological Distress)., The Schedule of Attitudes towards Hastened Death (SAHD) comprises 20 TRUE/FALSE questions on the presence or absence of attitudes towards hastened death. A scale score is derived by tallying the number of items endorsed. The minimum score is 0 (better, no thoughts on hastened death) and the maxim score is 20 (worst, many thoughts on hastened death)., 4 years
