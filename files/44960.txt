Neurocognitive Risks in Children With Solid Tumors
The survival rate of children with cancer has improved significantly in recent years thanks to the progress of different therapies. The neurocognitive sequelae related to treatments and illness are more or less well known. Four factors seem to be associated with neurocognitive sequelae: treatment, the tumor itself, environmental factors like the socio-economic status of parents and biological factors.

Main purpose of the study is to establish a score to assess the risk of neurocognitive sequelae in these children based on these factors (treatment, tumor, and environmental factors)
