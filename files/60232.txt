Study of the Pan-DAC Inhibitor AR-42 and Pazopanib in Advanced Sarcoma and Kidney Cancer
This phase 1 study was developed to identify recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) of AR-42 and pazopanib when given in combination for subsequent clinical trials and may have potentially identified candidate pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers.
Renal Cell Carcinoma|Soft Tissue Sarcoma|Metastatic Disease
DRUG: AR-42|DRUG: Pazopanib
The Recommended Phase 2 Doses (RP2Ds) of AR-42 and Pazopanib When Given in Combination., To determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) for AR-42 and pazopanib that are the same as or less than the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs). The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period will be the first treatment cycle. Patients must have taken a minimum of 6 AR-42 doses and a minimum of 21 pazopanib doses during cycle 1 to be considered evaluable for DLT, if DLT has not been observed at the delivered dose. Patients' treatment dose level, dose modification, evaluability for DLT, and DLTs will be listed and summarized by basic descriptive statistics such as frequency and proportion. The maximum tolerated dose(MTDs)/recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) will be found based on the criteria in the protocol., 1 month
Number of Participants With Adverse Events That Were Related to Treatment, AR-42 and Pazopanib Combination., The safety and toxicity of AR-42 and pazopanib when given in combination. Adverse Events (AEs) were characterized and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0) to determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of AR-42 and pazopanib. All AEs regardless of grade were recorded from the beginning of the study procedures through 30 days following the end of study treatment., 5 months|The Antitumor Effects of the AR-42 and Pazopanib Treatment Regimen in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) or Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS)., Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI:

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).

Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., 5 months
This study was a single-arm, open-label, dose escalation phase 1 trial to determine the RP2Ds of AR-42 and pazopanib when given in combination to patients with advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) or Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS). Eligible patients had recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic RCC or STS for which pazopanib was an appropriate therapy.

AR-42 was taken orally once per day on 3 non-consecutive days each week during the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle. Pazopanib was taken by mouth once daily continuously during each cycle.

A modified 3+3 dose-escalation design was to be followed until the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) were determined. The initial cohort of patients were assigned to an AR-42 dose of 20 mg taken once per day on 3 non-consecutive days during the first 3 weeks of each 4-week cycle and a pazopanib dose of 600 mg once daily continuously. Additional patients would be enrolled until a total of 12 patients were treated at the MTDs.

The protocol specifies a dose escalation plan that initially impacts only the pazopanib dose. The starting dose of pazopanib (600 mg) was planned to be escalated early so that the FDA-approved full dose of pazopanib (800 mg) would be reached before escalating the AR-42 dose. In subsequent dose-escalation steps, the dose of AR-42 was planned to be increased in 10-mg increments from a starting dose of 20 mg to a maximum dose of 40 mg.

If the number of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT) showed that the MTD was exceeded with a pazopanib dose of 800 mg , the pazopanib dose was planned to be decreased to 600 mg and the AR-42 dose increased in 10-mg increments regardless of relationship of the DLT to one or both study medications.

Toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0). The DLT evaluation period was the first treatment cycle. A minimum of 6 doses of AR-42 and 21 doses of pazopanib were required for a patient to be DLT-evaluable (if DLT was not observed with the delivered dose). DLT was defined as any ≥ grade 3 toxicity occurring during the DLT evaluation period and attributed to one or both of the study medications EXCEPT the following:

* The first incidence of grade 3 PPE at any dose level (subsequent incidences of grade 3 PPE will be considered DLT)
* Grade 3 nausea and vomiting in the absence of adequate prophylaxis and/or responsive to medical management within 48 hours
* Grade 3 diarrhea in the absence of adequate prophylaxis and/or responsive to medical management within 48 hours
* Grade 3 fatigue responsive to medical management • Grade 3 asymptomatic hypertension lasting ≤ 7 days
* Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that are corrected within 48 hours and, when corrected, can be maintained
* Grade 3 asymptomatic lipase elevation lasting ≤ 7 days
* Grade 3 decrease in platelet count if no clinically significant hemorrhage has occurred
* Grades 3 and 4 decrease in white blood cell count
* Grade 3 decrease in neutrophil count
* Grade 4 decrease in neutrophil count lasting ≤ 7 days
* Grades 3 and 4 decrease in lymphocyte count

Dose escalation was planned to continue until the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), defined as one dose level below the dose in which dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed in \>1 of the participants (e.g., in at least 2 participants in a cohort of at least 3). In the cohort of 12 patients at the MTD, no more than 3 DLTs were allowed to confirm the MTD. The RP2D was defined as equal to or less than the MTD, with an allowance to consider an RP2D below the MTD given the overall tolerability of the regimen including the frequency of AEs that were not DLTs and the frequency of dose modifications.
