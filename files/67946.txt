Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) in Patients With Unresectable Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases Who Failed Prior Intraarterial Pump Chemotherapy
This study is being done with a new therapy called "Selective Internal Radiation Therapy" (known as SIRT). Radiation is an effective treatment for destroying tumors. It is widely used in cancer treatment. However, radiation can harm normal tissue. SIR-Spheres are tiny plastic beads. They contain a radioactive agent called Yttrium-90. These beads can be delivered through a small tube inserted into the blood vessel that goes directly to the tumor. The radiation goes directly to the tumor. This spares healthy parts of your liver.

DEVICE: SIR-spheres® (Selective Internal Radiation Therapy)
To determine the safety, toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of SIR-Spheres® in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver (CLM) who have received previous hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAC)., 2 years
To obtain preliminary evidence of any clinical efficacy of the SIRT therapy in these heavily pretreated patients with unresectable CLM who have received hepatic arterial infusion pump and have failed at least one line of prior chemotherapy., 2 years
