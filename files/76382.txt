Combination Study of BMS-754807 and Herceptin速 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Her-2-positive Breast Cancer
This is a Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety profile, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics following daily oral doses of 50 to 200 mg of BMS-754807 in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin速) in subjects with advanced or metastatic Her-2-positive breast cancer. In addition, the study is expected to identify the recommended dose or dose range of BMS-754807 in combination with trastuzumab for Phase II studies and provide preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity in Her-2-positive breast cancer subjects after trastuzumab failure
Breast Cancer
DRUG: BMS-754807|DRUG: trastuzumab (Herceptin速)
The dose escalation portion will determine the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose or dose range of BMS-754807 when administered orally on a daily schedule in combination with trastuzumab administered at standard doses IV on a weekly basis, Every 30 days until MTD is reached
Assess anti-tumor activity of combination at MTD of BMS-754807 (dose expansion cohort), Every 8 weeks|Evaluate safety and tolerability of the combination regimen, Ongoing|Assess effect of combination therapy on glucose metabolism, At 30 days, then every 8 weeks|Explore whether co-medication with oral anti-hyperglycemic agent can enable adequate tolerability of the combination therapy if BMS-754807 induces hyperglycemia, Ongoing|Obtain BMS-754807 plasma concentrations vs time data for future population PK analysis, Days, 1,8,15,22
