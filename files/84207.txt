Afatinib (GILOTRIFÂ®) in Patients Suffering From Tumors Harboring Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) Gene Alterations (Specifically NRG1 Gene Fusion-positive Advanced Solid Tumors)
Gene fusions are defined as two separate genes joined together (gene 1, gene 2), generating a novel fusion gene. NRG1 fusions are rare and complex with regard to the fusion/fusion partner. The specific NRG1 gene fusion will be identified by a specialized molecular testing lab.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: afatinib
Afatinib is provided on a single-patient protocol basis to patients suffering from tumors harboring NRG1 fusions, a disease for which no satisfactory authorised alternative therapy exists.

In the context of this mechanism it is planned to collect and analyze limited clinical data in order to investigate the safety and efficacy of afatinib in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumours harboring NRG1 gene fusions.
