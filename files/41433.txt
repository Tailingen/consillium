R-ESHAP Followed by Autologous Transplantation for Refractory or Relapsed Diffused Large B-cell Lymphoma
The aim of study is to prove R-ESHAP regimen followed by autologous stem cell transplantation as salvage treatment in patients with refractory or relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is effective.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: R-ESHAP
Overall response rate, 6 weeks
3-year progression-free survival rate, 3 years|3-y overall survival rate, 3 years
The standard treatment in patients with refractory or relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous transplantation for responsive patients. However, the standard of salvage chemotherapy remains uncertain. This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of R-ESHAP regimen in a multi-center basis.
