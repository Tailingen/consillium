Olaparib in Recurrent IDH-mutant Glioma
Recent data demonstrate that in IDH-mutant gliomas, 2 hydroxy-glutarate production induces a homologous recombination defect that renders tumor cells exquisitely sensitive to poly(adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, including olaparib (Lynparza; AstraZeneca). The aim of this open-label phase 2 study is to evaluate the efficacy of olaparib in in recurrent IDH-mutant high grade gliomas based on 6 months progression-free survival.
