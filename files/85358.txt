Exercise in Breast Cancer Survivors
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of aerobic exercise to usual care in women treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for non-metastatic breast cancer
Breast Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Aerobic Exercise
Change in VO2peak, Peak oxygen uptake during a treadmill based cardiopulmonary exercise test, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)
Systolic- and diastolic heart chamber dimensions, Cardiac morphology and function will be assessed by 2D and 3D Echocardiography and 2D strain echocardiography, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)|Systolic- and diastolic longitudinal strain, Cardiac morphology and function will be assessed by 2D and 3D Echocardiography and 2D strain echocardiography, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)|Lean body mass, Body composition will be assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)|Fat mass, Body composition will be assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)|Blood volume, Hemoglobin mass and blood volume will be assessed using the carbon monoxide rebreathing method, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)|Muscle fiber type, Change in muscle morphology will be assessed in muscle biopsies using immunohistochemistry, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)|Muscle fiber area, Change in muscle morphology will be assessed in muscle biopsies using immunohistochemistry, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)|Muscle mitochondria mass, Change in mitochondrial proteins will be assessed in muscle biopsies using western blot, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)|Quality of life: Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C-30, Relevant patient reported outcomes will be obtained using validated Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) C-30, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)|Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression, For a sub-group of participants, muscle biopsies will be further processed for RNA and DNA, From baseline to five months (post-intervention)
In this study, we will compare the effects of exercise between women previously treated with breast cancer to women with no history of any cancers. Therefore, in addition to a randomized controlled trial in women with previous breast cancer (i.e., an exerciser group and a control group), we also include a reference group comprising age-matched women with no history of any cancer diagnosis. Women in the reference group will undergo a similar exercise intervention and the exercise group. This study recruits through invitation only.

The primary endpoint in this study is the change in cardiorespiratory fitness, measured as VO2peak. Secondary endpoints include common risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cardiometabolic health, endpoints derived from the cardiopulmonary exercise test and lung function assessments, cellular muscle endpoints derived from muscle biopsies obtained from m. vastus lateralis, also patient-reported outcomes.
