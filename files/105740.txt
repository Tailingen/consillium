DEVICE: Stool Sample Collection Kit
To provide stool and blood specimens to assess new markers for the detection of CRC, 33 months
To provide stool and blood specimens for use as controls when assessing new markers for the detection of neoplasms in other locations within the digestive tract (esophagus, stomach, pancreas, etc.), 33 months|To provide stool and blood specimens for a biorepository for future cancer-related diagnostic test development, 33 months|To provide quality control material for use in assessing performance of developed assays, 33 months
This is a multi-site, prospective sample collection study. Subjects will be men and women, 40-90 years of age, inclusive, each with a colonoscopic biopsy-based diagnosis of CRC and/or a pre-malignant colorectal lesion with large enough residual lesion to require subsequent surgical excision or complex colonoscopic polypectomy.

One stool sample from approximately 300 subjects will be collected in this study. A blood sample will also be collected from subjects.
