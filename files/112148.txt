Search for Predictors of Therapeutic Response in Ovarian Carcinoma
In order to search for predictors of response to chemotherapy in patients with ovarian carcinoma of the ovary, the fallopian tube or peritoneal serous-type advanced stage, we will define the comparative profiles of miRNA expression of serum polymorphisms and determine differential in 2 patient populations (with or without recurrence 6 months after completion of chemotherapy) with (i) the miRNA profile of serum before treatment and (ii) identification of polymorphisms or SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in particular genes involved in the metabolism of chemotherapy agents In the case of miRNA, expression profiles will also be studied during the first course in response to chemotherapy. Indeed, the miRNA profile of serum may be different at baseline among the 2 types of populations (or non-recurrence at 6 months).

search for predictors of response to chemotherapy, the search for predictors of response to chemotherapy in patients with carcinoma of the ovary, the fallopian tube or peritoneal serous-type advanced by using (i) the miRNA profile of serum before treatment with chemotherapy and (ii) the identification of polymorphisms or SNPs (Single Nucleotide polymorphism) in particular genes involved in the metabolism of chemotherapy agents, 12 months after beginning treatment
profiling miRNA expression, - Characterization of the response to treatment with profiling miRNA expression after the first course of chemotherapy in patients with carcinoma of the ovary, the fallopian tube or peritoneal serous-type advanced, 1 month|study of changes in serum miRNA expression, - The study of changes in serum miRNA expression identified as predictive of tumor response during chemotherapy treatment., 6 months
