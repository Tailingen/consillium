Individualized First Maintenance Doses of Voriconazole Through a Multiparametric Algorithm
The goal of this interventional single-arm study is to evaluate the interest of a multiparametric algorithm for individualization of first voriconazole maintenance doses for improvement of initial voriconazole exposure in adult patients with haematological malignancies. The main objective it aims is to determine the percentage of patients with initial voriconazole trough concentrations in the therapeutic range after individualization of first maintenance doses.

Participants will benefited from individualization of first voriconazole maintenance doses through a previously developed and validated multiparametric algorithm (publication in progress) taking into account CYP2C19 genotype, C reactive protein level and age.

The currently recommended therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole has improved the efficacy of this treatment and reduced its adverse effects, especially for treatment and prophylaxis of invasive aspergillosis. However, dose adjustments made as part of this therapeutic drug monitoring only occur at the earliest 3 to 5 days after the initiation of treatment, whereas it is essential to achieve effective concentrations from the start of treatment. Simple a priori dose adjustment approaches based on CYP2C19 genotype have been shown to improve voriconazole exposure and treatment response. However other factors such as the patient\&#39;s inflammatory status or age also influence voriconazole exposure, suggesting that strategies for individualizing initial voriconazole doses could be improved by integrating all covariates influencing voriconazole pharmacokinetics. In this line, a previous multicenter and international study has developped and validated an algorithm for calculating the first maintenance doses integrating not only the CYP2C19 genotype, but also the inflammatory status, the patient\&#39;s age, and the presence (or not) of hematological malignancy. Here, the investigators propose to evaluate the interest of this multiparametric algorithm for improving initial exposure (within the first 4 days) to voriconazole in patients suffering from haematological malignancies.
