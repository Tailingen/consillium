HLA-mismatched MST vs HLA-matched NST for AML in Intermediate-risk
Patients with de novo AML enrolled in the study. Patient who has a HLA-identical donor is assigned to receive NST therapy with GVHD prophylaxis and who has no HLA-identical donor is assigned to receive MST therapy without GVHD prophylaxis.

The optimal therapy for intermediate-risk patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1) is uncertain. Recent studies shown that microtransplantation (MST) can improve survival in AML-CR1 patients. However, a comparison study between the MST and nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) is lacking. 156 intermediate-risk AML-CR1 patients aged 9 to 59 years were enrolled in this study. Patients with de novo AML enrolled in the study. Patient who has a HLA-identical donor is assigned to receive NST therapy with GVHD prophylaxis and who has no HLA-identical donor is assigned to receive MST therapy without GVHD prophylaxis.
