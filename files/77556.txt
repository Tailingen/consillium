Blinded Resection in Case of the Pancreatic Insulinoma
The blinded resection avoided in case of pancreatic insulinoma
Insulinoma; Pancreas
PROCEDURE: Pancreatic resection
No hidden insulinomas, To improve the diagnostics of the tumor before and during the surgery. The "hidden" insulinomas haven't been diagnosed. The frozen section have to be routinely performed. The surgery haven't been finished before the morphologic confirmation of the resected lesion., 2010 June - 2020 June
Despite of the technique and technology developement there are still a lot of troubles to verify small benign-looking pancreatic NETs. It can be especially important in case of insulinoma. The organic hyperilsulinism and severe hypoglicemia causeb by the insulin/proinsulin - producing lesion can lead to severe complications and evem death.

There are some cases of the blinded resections of the pancreas in patients with the "hidden" insulinoma when the tumor can't be revealed during the preoperative diagnostics and intraoperatively. Unfortunately, blind resection do not solve the problem of the hypoglicemia but also cause the specific pancreatic complications.
