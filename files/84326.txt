Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) for Spine Metastases
The purpose of this study is to collect information on the effect of minimally invasive spine tumor decompression on treated patients. This treatment option is less invasive that the standard surgical decompression and is expected to result in better wound healing, decreased tissue trauma, and decreased pain after surgery.
Spine Metastases
Survival time, Survival time in days, up to 2 years
Ambulation Index, Hauser Ambulation Index to assess mobility by evaluating the time and degree of assistance required to walk 25 feet. Scores range from 0 (asymptomatic and fully active) to 10 (bedridden)., up to 2 years|Cobb Angle, The Cobb angle is used to quantify the magnitude of spinal deformities., up to 2 years
This is a prospective study designed to analyze the impact that minimally invasive spine tumor decompression has upon quality of life, neurological morbidity, pain, and mortality. Prospective findings will be compared with historical controls to determine whether the minimally invasive approach offers better outcomes than traditional treatment methods.
