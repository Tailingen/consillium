Methionine and PBR28-PET (Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors) in Brain Metastases Following Radiosurgery
The goal of this protocol is to evaluate the potential of PET imaging of amino acid transport and microglial activation to improve the differentiation of tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis in patients with brain metastases after treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) who have re-growing lesions. These state-of-the-art imaging tools will be used in combination with standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS) and FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose).
Brain Metastasis
PROCEDURE: Standard of Care FDG-PET Imaging
Change in Regrowing Tumor Rate from Radiation Effect, 6 months
The investigators hypothesize that by using two different PET tracers, one sensitive to tumor metabolic activity, and one sensitive to inflammatory processes, investigators can separately identify metabolically active tumor from radiation necrosis related inflammation. This can be accomplished with quantitative assessments of tracer uptake using kinetic modeling techniques, as well as by high-resolution imaging to assess the distribution of tracer uptake in the tumor region. All participants in the study will have the receive the same diagnostic tests.
