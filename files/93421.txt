Response Adaptive Radiotherapy Following Immunotherapy-based Induction for Non-HPV Related HNSCC
The aim of this study is to develop an adaptive radiation therapy plan for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma receiving induction therapy containing immunotherapy and chemotherapy. The therapy plan is based on clinical remission, in order to reduce treatment-related toxic side effects without sacrificing clinical efficacy and improve the quality of life of patients.
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: radical radiotherapy (60Gy)|RADIATION: radical radiotherapy (66Gy)|RADIATION: radical radiotherapy (70Gy)|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody
Progression-free survival, defined as the time from random assignment to documented local or regional relapse, distant metastasis, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first after 2 years of treatment, 2 years
Overall survival, defined as the time from random assignment to death from any cause or censored at the date of last follow-up, 2 years|Deep partial response, Defined as maximum tumor diameter retreat â‰¥ 50%, 2 years|Local-Regional failure survival, defined as the time from random assignment to documented local or regional relapse, whichever occurred first after 2 years of treatment, 2 years|Toxicity Adverse events, Analysis of acute and late adverse events (AEs) are evaluated. Numbers of patients of treatment-related adverse events (acute toxicity) and late radiation toxicities were assessed by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, 2 years
Induction chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy has shown promising efficacy in locally advanced head and neck cancers. However, the appropriate dose and range of the following radical radiotherapy treatment remains unknown. Eligibility patients were assigned to three arms depending on the degree of clinical remission: clinical complete response (radiotherapy 60Gy + concurrent chemotherapy + immunotherapy maintenance), deep partial response (radiotherapy 66Gy + concurrent chemotherapy + immunotherapy maintenance, non-deep partial response (radiotherapy 70Gy + concurrent chemotherapy + immunotherapy maintenance). Progression-free survival, overall survival, and treatment-related toxicity would be calculated to evaluate the efficacy of treatments.
