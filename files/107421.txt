Phase I Study of TSN084 in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors.
TSN084 is a novel type II protein kinase inhibitor with demonstrated anti-tumor effects in vitro and in vivo and targets multiple tyrosine kinases, such as c-MET, FLT3, TRK and serine/threonine kinase CDK8/19. This first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of TSN084 in advanced or metastatic malignancies.
Cancer (With or Without Metastasis)
DRUG: TSN084
Number of patients with dose limiting toxicity, Number of patients with dose limiting toxicity., Every subject's DLT observation window is 28 days.|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Incidence of adverse events, Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), Serious Adverse Event (SAE), their relationship with the investigational product and respective severity. Adverse events and laboratory test values will be graded according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0., From first dose to 28 Â±7 days after last dose
