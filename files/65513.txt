Survivorship Care Plans in a Community Oncology Practice
This is a two part observational study evaluating the feasibility of implementing an EHR-based model within a community oncology practice.
Breast Cancer|Prostate Cancer|Colorectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Survey
EHR-based SCPs and care planning, Asses whether barriers to EHR-based SCPs and care planning have been mitigated, based on clinician survey., Up to 2 years
Feasibility of providing EHR-based care planning, measured by SCP provision rates, Measured by SCP provision rates (percentage of survivors with EHR-based SCPs), Up to 2 years|Feasibility of providing EHR-based care planning, measured by the EHR, Measured by survivor access to SCPs, per the EHR, Up to 2 years|Self-reported change in satisfaction, using survey, The impact of providing EHR-based care planning measured in change of satisfaction with perceived care coordination (assessed prior to and at 4 weeks after SCP provision), Up to 2 years|Impact of providing EHR-based care planning, Measured by reported SCP usability, usefulness, and content (assessed prior to and at 4 weeks after SCP provision), Up to 2 years
Part 1: The research team will use a sociotechnical work systems model, developed by researchers at the University of Wisconsin (UW) Systems Engineering Initiative for Patience Safety (SEIPS), to guide analysis of the work system barriers and facilitators to implementing an EHR-based care planning model in community oncology practice, collected from direct observations.

Part 2: The research team will measure reach/maintenance (percentage of survivors with EHR-based survivorship care plans (SCPs) over a 9-month time period) and impact (pre/post survey of patient satisfaction and perceived care coordination).
