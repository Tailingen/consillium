Cryoablation Combined With Camrelizumab and Apatinib for Multiprimary Lung Cancer
Objective: This study is to observe the safety and therapeutic effect of cryoablation combined with pd-1 antibody immunotherapy and anti-angiogenesis therapy in multiple primary lung cancer (MPLC) patients.

Methods: In this study, 20 patients with MPLC who conform to the admission criteria are enrolled and began to receive treatment with Camrelizumab combined with Apatinib after cryoablation.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Camrelizumab and Apatinib
Safety score, The occurrence of grade 3 to 5 adverse reactions was assessed by CTC AE v5.0, three weeks
ORR, objective response rate, six weeks|DCR, Disease control rate, six weeks|PFS, progression free survival, six weeks|OS, Overall survival, six weeks|DOR, Duration of response, six weeks
biomarker, To explore biomarkers in tumor tissue and blood that could potentially predict the efficacy of Camrelizumab and Apatinib like PD-L1, ctDNA, CEA， CA125， CA153., three months
Subjects who meet the admission criteria will be treated with Camrelizumab and Apatinib until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal of the patient or the researchers determined that the drug must be discontinued.

The primary end point of this study is safety of cryoablation combined with carillizumab and apatinib for MPLC. The secondary endpoints include objective response rate, disease control rate, time to progression, progression free survival and overall survival. Exploratory endpoint is to explore biomarkers in tumor tissue and blood that could potentially predict the efficacy of Camrelizumab and Apatinib.
