Prediction of Impaired Survival in Elderly Bladder Cancer Patients Opting for Radical Cystectomy
The investigators proposes a prospective cohort study in patients with high risk bladder cancer who have opted for radical cystectomy. The investigators aim to correlate pre-operative measures of body composition, cognitive and functional status with impaired survival at 6 months after cystectomy. Impairment in this context will be a compilation of several specific objective measures including: 1) death from any cause, 2) major complication (Clavien score7 ≥ 3), 3) loss of independent living status, 4) performance status, and 5) global well-being. The study team believes that Impairment Free Survival is an important endpoint as it accounts for many aspects of a patient's functional status that might alter a patient's choice to proceed with radical surgery.
Bladder Cancer
Impairment Free Survival, Impairment-free survival is defined as the time from radical cystectomy to the identification of: 1) major complication (Clavien score7 ≥ 3), 2) loss of independent living status, 3) ECOG performance status ≥ 3 beyond 4 weeks from RC, 4) global well-being or 5) death from any cause. Patients who drop-out before the 6-month end of study and who have not had an impairment event will be censored at their time of drop-out., 6 months
