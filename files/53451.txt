Study to Assess for Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) in Multiple Myeloma Patients
This study is to assess for Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) in multiple myeloma at a deeper level than what is currently available by combining novel imaging and laboratory techniques, determine if patients who are MRD-negative by these multiple modalities can safely and effectively discontinue post-transplant maintenance therapy, and determine if liquid biopsies is a more accurate and/or less invasive sampling technique for multiple myeloma.

The purpose of this research is to determine if patients who are MRD-negative by multiple modalities ("multimodality MRD-negative") can safely and effectively discontinue post-transplant maintenance therapy (single agent lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, or ixazomib) after receiving at least one year of maintenance therapy.

Determine the MRD conversion rate, Determine the MRD conversion rate from 1 in 1,000,000 cells and 1 in 10,000,000 cells negative to positive after discontinuation of maintenance therapy., 3 years|Median Progression Free Survival rate, Assess progression free survival of double MRD-negative (1 in 1,000,000 cells negative/1 in 10,000,000 cells negative) patients and of the 1 in 1,000,000 cells negative/1 in 10,000,000 cells positive patients who have discontinued maintenance therapy, 3 years|Median overall survival rate, Assess overall survival of double MRD-negative (1 in 1,000,000 cells negative/1 in 10,000,000 cells negative) patients and of the 1 in 1,000,000 cells negative/1 in 10,000,000 cells positive patients who have discontinued maintenance therapy., 3 years
NGS-based Minimal Residual Disease testing determined by the ClonoSeq assay, Determine the feasibility of performing NGS-based MRD testing of bone marrow aspirate samples that have undergone CD138+ immunomagnetic cell separation (i.e. 1 in 10,000,000 cells depth) will be determined by the rate of achieving 20 million cells in raw aspirate sample with a sufficient DNA for analysis as determined by the ClonoSeq assay., 3 years|Determine the difference in MRD detection by NGS, Determine the difference in MRD detection by NGS in the bone marrow at depths of 1 in 1,000,000 cells and 1 in 10,000,000 cells., 3 years
