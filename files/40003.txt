Phase 2 Study of Pracinostat With Azacitidine in Patients With Previously Untreated Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to determine the safety and efficacy of pracinostat compared to placebo when combined with azacitidine, and FDA approved treatment for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: pracinostat|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Azacitidine
Estimate efficacy, Estimate the relative efficacy, measured by complete remission rate of treatment wiht pracinostat plus azacitidine versus placebo plus azacitidine, 6 months
Overall response rate, Estimate the overall response rate \[ORR = CR + complete remission + partial response (PR)\], 6 months|Hematologic Improvement, Estimate the overall hematologic improvement (HI) response rate by review of hematologic lab values each cycle including bone marrow blast counts, platelets and erythrocytes., 6 months|Duration of response, Estimate the duration of response, 6 months|Progression free survival, Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) duration of pracinostat plus azacitidine and the relative benefit of that combination versus placebo plus azacitidine as assessed by the PFS hazard ratio, 12 months|Rate of leukemic transformation, Estimate the rate of leukemic transformation at landmark time points (6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months) using clinical review of hematologic lab counts each cycle, 6 - 24 months|Overall survival, Estimate the overall survival (OS) duration of pracinostat plus azacitidine and the relative benefit of that combination versus placebo plus azacitidine as assessed by the OS hazard ratio, 6-24 months|AE profile, Assess the adverse event (AE) profile of pracinostat and placebo when combined with azacitidine by clinical review of safety events by grade, relationship and event outcomes., 12 months
