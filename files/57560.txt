The composite score obtained by H-score is derived by adding of the percentages of cell staining at each intensity level multiplied by the weighted intensity of staining (0 \[no staining\], 1+ \[weak staining\], 2+ \[medium staining\], 3+ \[strong staining\]). The H-score has a range of 0 to 300. Lower H-scores represent lower expression of pMCM2 (Ser40) in the tissue sample, while higher scores represent stronger expression of pMCM2 (Ser40) in the tissue samples., Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose up to any dosing day after 3 consecutive days post-dose (up to Cycle 1 Day 8 [Schedule A and D]; Cycle 1 Day 7 [Schedule B]; Cycle 1 Day 12 [Schedule D]) (Cycle Length of Schedules A and D = 21 days; and Schedule B= 28 days)|Schedule A, B and D: Change From Baseline in pMCM2 (Ser40) Levels in Skin Based on Positive Index After Multiple Doses Of TAK-931, Positive index was calculated by taking the number of cells staining positive for the marker over the total number of cells., Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose up to any dosing day after 3 consecutive days post-dose (up to Cycle 1 Day 8 [Schedule A and D]; Cycle 1 Day 7 [Schedule B]; Cycle 1 Day 12 [Schedule D]) (Cycle Length of Schedules A and D = 21 days; and Schedule B= 28 days)|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as percentage of participants who had achieved complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST V 1.1). CR: was disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeter (mm). PR: was at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of diameter (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD., From date of first dose to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, which ever occurred first (up to Month 45)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, as measured by RECIST V1.1. PD: 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PFS was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method., From date of first dose to the date of first documentation of PD or death due to any cause, which ever occurred first (up to Month 45)|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR was defined as the time from the date of first documentation of a response (CR or PR) to the date of first documentation of PD, as measured by RECIST V 1.1. CR: was disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) had to be reduced in short axis to \<10 mm. PR: was at least a 30% decrease in SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD. PD: 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. DOR was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method., From the date of first documentation of response to the date of first documentation of PD (up to Month 45)
The drug being under investigation in this study is called TAK-931. The effect of TAK-931 is being evaluated in up to 100 participants who have nonhematologic (solid) neoplasms. This study will look at the safety, tolerability, and PK to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TAK-931.

This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall study duration is approximately 42 months for total of dose escalation cohorts and the safety expansion cohort. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic with final visit approximately 30-40 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
