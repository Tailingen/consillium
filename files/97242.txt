Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs), Graded Using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03., Phase 1b primary endpoint, 30 days after last dose, up to 8 months
Treatment will be administered in two phases, an induction and a maintenance phase, as described below. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year. Treatment in the study will be discontinued if the subject experiences progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance phase of the study. Subjects who experience ongoing stable disease (SD) or an ongoing partial response (PR) at 1 year may enter the maintenance phase at the Investigator's discretion. Subjects may remain on the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1 year. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase until the subject experiences PD or unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. The maximum time on study treatment, including both the induction and maintenance phases, is 2 years.
