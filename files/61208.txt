SRK-181 Alone or in Combination With Anti-PD-(L)1 Antibody Therapy in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors (DRAGON)
This was a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), dose-escalation, and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of SRK-181 administered alone and in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study was divided into 3 treatment parts (Part A1, Part A2, and Part B) and a Long-Term Extension Phase (LTEP).
