The V600E gene lesion of B-raf, specific and almost always present in patients with hairy cell leukemia, correlates with the presence of neoplastic cells, therefore of active disease. The measurement of the fractional abundance of the mutated gene, by ddPCR, could therefore constitute a method of molecular assessment of the minimal residual disease. In addition, the values of fractional abundance (FA) of the mutated allele obtained can be integrated coherently in patients' clinical context, along with their PB counts and BM findings.

Primary objective Verify whether the absence of mutation at the end of treatment, indicative of a state of complete molecular response to therapy, can represent a predictor of long treatment-free survival.

Secondary objectives Verify the association between the absence of mutation and the duration of response in patients who do not need treatment for at least 5 years after only one treatment with purine analogues (cladribine and pentostatin) and judged in CR according to current criteria.
