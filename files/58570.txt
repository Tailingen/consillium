The intention with NXC-201 (formerly HBI0101) CART is to follow the chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CART) approach, as for approved products, but target the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) rather than the CD19 antigen targeted by KYMRIAHTM (tisagenlecleucel) and YESCARTATM (axicabtagene ciloleucel).

Importantly, successful results from at least three clinical trials of a BCMA targeted CAR T therapy were published (Zhao 2018, Brundo 2018, Raje 2019), with excellent results obtained for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patients, that validate the approach.
