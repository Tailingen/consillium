Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Albumin-bound Docetaxel
This trial is an open-label, single-center, dose-escalation and cohort-expansion Phase I clinical study in patients with advanced solid tumors. The aim of this study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of albumin-bound formulation of docetaxel for intravenous infusion in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: Albumin-bound docetaxel
Number of participants who experienced AE during cycle1., AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE., 21 days.|Number of participants who experienced DLT during cycle1., A DLT was graded using the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.02 and defined as any of the following: grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic adverse events unless they were not optimally treated with supportive care; grade 3 or 4 asymptomatic laboratory abnormal values lasting \>7 days; prolonged grade 2 toxicity (lasting more than 2 weeks) leading to treatment interruption and/or dose reduction; pancytopenia with a hypocellular bone marrow and no marrow blasts lasting ≥6 weeks (AL participants); grade 3 neutropenia with fever or infection (OHM participants); grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding (OHM participants); or grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, regardless of symptoms and lasting ≥3 days (OHM participants)., 21 days.|Classic 3+3 design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (if available) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Albumin-bound Docetaxel., Through study completion, an average of 1 year.

Biomarkers of Albumin-bound Docetaxel., The correlation between the AAG level(in plasma) and albumin-bound docetaxel., 21 days.
This study was conducted in two stages. The first stage (Stage I) is a dose-escalation study. A classic 3+3 design will be used to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Patients with advanced solid tumors will be assigned to receive sequentially higher doses of albumin-bound formulation of docetaxel once every three weeks (a Cycle) by intravenous infusion, starting at a dose of 50mg/m2. Patients will receive the albumin-bound formulation of docetaxel
