A Phase I, Dose-escalation Study of AS703569 Given Orally to Subjects With Haematological Malignancies
EMD Serono decided to terminate enrollment based on a review of the available clinical data and low probability of completing the trial based on the observed recruitment rate. Subjects already enrolled in the study continued participation in the study, consistent with the protocol, to study completion.
Haematological Malignancies
DRUG: AS703569|DRUG: AS703569
Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Dose-escalation part - The number of subjects experiencing at least a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), judged to be related to the study medication, evaluated over the first cycle only for each dose level and regimen, independently., 21 days or 1 cycle|Preliminary anti-tumour activity, Cohort expansion part - Preliminary anti-tumour activity in four selected cohorts of haematological malignancies as assessed every two cycles, 42 days or 2 cycles
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), Dose-escalation and Cohort expansion parts The proportion/number of subjects experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) after the first cycle and during multiple cycles, in each cohort for each of the 2 dose-regimens., minimum 21 days or 1 cycle
The goal of this research study is to investigate for the first time the safety and tolerability of a new drug (AS703569), called an aurora kinase inhibitor, being tested to treat blood cancers in patients with different blood cancers. The research study will also assess how the body breaks down AS703569 and what changes occur in the blood after oral doses of AS703569. It will also look to see if there is any improvement in your blood cancer. The use of AS703569 in this study is experimental.
