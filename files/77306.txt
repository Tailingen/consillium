A Study to Assess the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Antitumor Activity of Oral TACH101 in Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Cancer
The main objective for part 1a of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of oral TACH101 in participants with advanced and metastatic solid tumors. For part 1b, the main objective is the objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by radiographic progression measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.

DRUG: TACH101
Phase 1a Dose Escalation: MTD of TACH101, Day 1 to End of Treatment (up to approximately 201 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: RP2D of TACH101, Day 1 to End of Treatment (up to approximately 201 days)|Phase 1b Dose Expansion: ORR, Day 1 to End of Treatment (up to approximately 201 days)
Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Number of Participants Who Experience Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Cycle 1 Day 1 up to Cycle 1 Day 28 (cycle length = 28 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), A TEAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participants that happened after study drug administration. Any clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, or electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be recorded as adverse events (AEs)., Lead-in Day 1 to End of Treatment (up to approximately 204 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) for TACH101, Lead-in Day 1 to Cycle 8 Day 1 (cycle = 28 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of TACH101, Lead-in Day 1 to Cycle 8 Day 1 (cycle = 28 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Observed Predose Plasma Concentration During Multiple Dosing (Ctrough) of TACH101, Lead-in Day 1 to Cycle 8 Day 1 (cycle = 28 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Time to Reach Maximum Concentration (tmax) for TACH101, Lead-in Day 1 to Cycle 8 Day 1 (cycle = 28 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Apparent Terminal Elimination Half-life (t1/2) of TACH101, Lead-in Day 1 to Cycle 8 Day 1 (cycle = 28 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Apparent Volume of Distribution During the Terminal Phase After Extravascular Administration (Vz/F) of TACH101, Lead-in Day 1 to Cycle 8 Day 1 (cycle = 28 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Apparent Clearance After Extravascular Administration (CL/F) of TACH101, Lead-in Day 1 to Cycle 8 Day 1 (cycle = 28 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: ORR, Day 1 to End of Treatment (up to approximately 201 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Duration of Response (DOR), Day 1 to End of Treatment (up to approximately 201 days)|Phase 1a Dose Escalation: Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Day 1 to End of Treatment (up to approximately 201 days)|Phase 1b Dose Expansion: Number of Participants With TEAEs, A TEAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in participants that happened after study drug administration. Any clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, or ECGs will be recorded as AEs., Lead-in Day 1 to End of Treatment (up to approximately 203 days)|Phase 1b Dose Expansion: Concentration at 2 Hours Postdose (C2h) of TACH101, Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 10 Day 1 (cycle = 28 days)|Phase 1b Dose Expansion: Cmax of TACH101, Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 10 Day 1 (cycle = 28 days)|Phase 1b Dose Expansion: Ctrough of TACH101, Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 10 Day 1 (cycle = 28 days)|Phase 1b Dose Expansion: DOR, Day 1 to End of Treatment (up to approximately 201 days)|Phase 1b Dose Expansion: CBR, Day 1 to End of Treatment (up to approximately 201 days)
