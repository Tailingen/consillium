Does Immediate Lymphatic Reconstruction Decrease the Risk of Lymphedema After Axillary Lymph Node Dissection
The researchers are doing this study to see if having immediate lymphatic reconstruction after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can decrease the development of lymphedema, a side effect of ALND. Other purposes of the study include:

Comparing the approach of immediate lymphatic reconstruction after ALND with the approach of ALND alone Looking at whether having immediate lymphatic reconstruction after ALND improves a person's quality of life Seeing if adding standard of care radiation therapy to either study approach (immediate lymphatic reconstruction after ALND or ALND alone) has an effect on development of lymphedema

PROCEDURE: Axillary Lymph Node Dissection with Immediate Lymphatic Reconstruction|PROCEDURE: Axillary Lymph Node Dissection without Immediate Lymphatic Reconstruction|OTHER: quality-of-life questionnaires|OTHER: measured by arm volume
the number of patients that had a decrease incidence of lymphedema, as measured by arm volume will be a â‰¥10% increase in arm volume, up to 2 years
