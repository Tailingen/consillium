Exploring the Molecular Mechanism Based on KIT Mutation
Imatinib remains suboptimal for recurrence/metastasis and unresectable GIST response rates. With the maturity of genomics and metabolomics, people gradually realize the role of gut microbiota in tumor therapy. The gut microbiota may affect tumor treatment by regulating the tumor microenvironment or the host immune system, and some bacteria can fight tumors by activating the immune system. Growing evidence shows that the effect of tumor therapy is related to the composition of the gut microbiota of patients, and that the composition of the gut microbiota of patients sensitive to drug treatment has certain characteristics, and these characteristics may be used as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of treatment. At present, it remains unclear whether the efficacy of imatinib is related to the gut microbiota in GIST patients. Therefore, precise mining of microbial information and the development of reasonable and feasible microbial interventions are expected to optimize the treatment strategy of GIST to a large extent and provide a basis for individualized treatment of advanced GIST.
GIST
DRUG: Imatinib
Degree of tumor regression, We used the RECIST 1.1 evaluation criteria to evaluate the response to the imatinib therapy and accordingly divided patients into two groups,Response and No Response., 6 months
Taking Chinese patients with unresectable C-kit9/11-mutated GIST as the research object, the treatment effect was observed after standardized treatment with imatinib mesylate. To explore the relationship between intestinal flora and the efficacy of imatinib treatment, to find new biomarkers to predict the efficacy of imatinib, and to provide reference for individualized treatment of imatinib
