Bespoke ctDNA Assay for Recurrence and Treatment Response Monitoring in Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
This prospective observational study is to assess the dynamics of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) undergoing surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors until disease progression or the end of the study. All patients will be closely monitored throughout the course of disease by a tumor-informed bespoke ctDNA assay as well as traditional methods of surveillance, such as CA125 and imaging. This study may provide preliminary evidence for ctDNA-guided treatment decisions in future clinical practice.
Ovarian Cancer
OTHER: ND-EOC or platinum-sensitive rEOC
Progression free survival (PFS), Determine PFS in ctDNA positive versus ctDNA negative groups., Two years
Overall Survival (OS), Determine OS in ctDNA positive versus ctDNA negative groups., Two years
This observational study is designed for exploring prognostic and predictive values of the tumor-informed bespoke ctDNA assay in advanced EOC. Newly diagnosed patients who are eligible for radical surgery or relapsed patients from platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy who are eligible for secondary cytoreductive surgery will be enrolled. The patients will be treated with SOC adjuvant therapies followed by PARP inhibitor for maintenance.

To evaluate ctDNA dynamics, tumor tissue collected from surgery will be sequenced with whole-exome sequencing (WES) to design patient-specific 16-plex panel. At planned monitoring timepoints, blood samples will be drawn, and ctDNA will be sequenced with ultra-deep ctDNA high-throughput sequencing methods.

Traditional surveillance methods will be applied as comparison, including but not limited to carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125)/ human epididymal protein 4 (HE4)/ carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)/ carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), etc., as well as standard imaging.

Survival analyses will be conducted based on ctDNA status (positive/negative) after surgery. Recurrence rate of each subgroup, positive predictive values and negative predictive values etc. will be examined. Changes in ctDNA levels (Î”ctDNA) during treatment will be used to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy comparing traditional biomarkers,
