A Phase 1/2 Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Anti-CD7 Allogeneic CAR-T Cells (WU-CART-007) in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory T-ALL/LBL
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, recommended dose, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of WU-CART-007 in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL).
T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Lymphoblastic Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: WU-CART-007
Incidence of Adverse Events of WU-CART-007 as assessed by CTCAE v5, Safety is based on evaluation of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) from the time of consent until end of study visit, 24 months|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Maximum tolerated or administered dose of WU-CART-007, up to 28 days from first dose|Composite Complete Response Rate, Defined as proportion of patients that achieve a complete remission (CR) + complete remission with incomplete hematologic recover ( CRi) + CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), 24 months
Overall Survival, Time from study drug administration (Day 1) to death on study, 24 months|Objective Response Rate, ORR is defined as proportion of patients that achieve complete remission (CR) + complete remission with incomplete hematologic recover ( CRi) + CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), morphologic leukemia free state (MLFS, and partial response (PR) in patients with EMD only, 24 months|Duration of Response, Time of response to the time of disease relapse, progression or death due to any cause. whichever occurs first, 24 months|Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) rate, Rate of successful transition to HSCT through study treatment, 24 months
This is a first-in-human, multicenter, Phase 1/2, single-agent study in patients with R/R T-ALL/T-LBL who have exhausted other treatment options. The study will consist of two phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. During the Dose Escalation segment (Phase 1) up to 24 patients will be treated with 1 dose of WU-CART-007, in up to 4 dose levels until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) is determined. The dose escalation segment will enroll successive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients using a standard 3 + 3 design. Once the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is defined, the Phase 2 portion (Cohort Expansion) will enroll expansion cohorts.
