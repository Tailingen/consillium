Haploidentical Donor Natural Killer Cell Infusion With IL-15 in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML)
This is a single center, "modified standard design" dose escalation study designed to determine the maximum tolerated, minimum efficacious dose (MTD/MED) of IL-15 (Intravenous Recombinant Human IL-15) and incidence of donor natural killer (NK) cell expansion by day +14 when given after haploidentical donor NK cells in patients with relapse or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: Preparative Regimen|BIOLOGICAL: Intravenous Recombinant Human IL-15 (rhIL-15)
Maximum Tolerated/Minimum Efficacious Dose, Determine the maximum tolerated, minimum efficacious dose (MTD/MED) of recombinant human IL-15; dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurring during the first 42 days after the NK cell infusion; MED = if 2 of 3 patients or 4 of 6 patients has an in vivo NK cell count \>2500, then dose escalation with cease as it will be in the range of a biologic dose which may achieve the goal of in vivo expansion without pushing IL-15 doses higher to toxicity., Day 42
Incidence of Expansion of Natural Killer Cells, defined by measuring an absolute circulating donor-derived NK cell count of \>100 cells/Î¼l in the patient's peripheral blood by day +14 after the NK cell infusion., Day 14 after Infusion|Treatment Related Mortality (TRM), In the field of transplantation, toxicity is high and all deaths without previous relapse or progression are usually considered as related to transplantation., Day 1 of Treatment until Day of Death|Rate of CRp, defined as leukemia clearance (\< 5% marrow blasts and no peripheral blood blasts) and neutrophil recovery without platelet recovery., Day 28-42
Once the MTD/MED for IL-15 is determined, this cohort will be expanded to a total of 19 patients. The primary goal of this extended phase will be to establish a correlation of the clinical endpoint, CRp defined as leukemic clearance (\< 5% marrow blast and no peripheral blood blasts) and neutrophil recovery without platelet recovery, with in vivo expansion.

Patients achieving a complete remission and neutrophil recovery (ANC \> 500) for at least 4 weeks will be considered for allogeneic transplant to prolong remission independent of this study.

All patients, including those who go on to transplant, will be followed to determine disease free survival, treatment related mortality, and time to relapse.
