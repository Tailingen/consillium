Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero Extrapolated to Infinity(AUC0-inf) for Part 1, AUC0-inf of trilaciclib in plasma was determined from individual concentration-time data by non-compartmental analysis methods. The actual sampling times in relation to dosing were used., Day1 and Day 3( or Day 5) of Cycle 1 for a 21-day cycle|Duration of Severe Neutropenia in Cycle 1 (DSN), DSN in Cycle 1 was defined as the number of days from the date of the first ANC value \< 0.5 x 10\^9/L in Cycle 1 to the date of the first ANC value ≥ 0.5 x 10\^9/L. The date of the first ANC value ≥ 0.5 x 10\^9/L should meet the following requirements: (1) occurred after the ANC value was \< 0.5 x 10\^9/L, and (2) there were no other ANC values \< 0.5 x 10\^9/L between this date and the end of Cycle 1 (otherwise, if this patient entered Cycle 2, it was counted as Day 1 of Cycle 2). DSN in Cycle 1 was scored as 0 if the patient did not experience any SN during Cycle 1., At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration(Cmax) of Trilaciclib for Part 1, Cmax of trilaciclib in plasma was determined from individual concentration-time data by non-compartmental analysis methods. The actual sampling times in relation to dosing were used. For estimation of Cmax, a concentration that was below the limit of quantification (BLQ) was assigned a value of zero if it occurred in a profile before the first measurable concentration. If a BLQ value occurred after a measurable concentration in a profile, and was followed by a value above the lower limit of quantification, then the BLQ was treated as missing data. If a BLQ value occurred at the end of the collection interval (after the last quantifiable concentration) it was treated as missing data. If two BLQ values occurred in succession after Cmax, the profile was deemed to have terminated at the first BLQ value and any subsequent concentrations were omitted., Day1 and Day 3( or Day 5) of Cycle 1 for a 21-day cycle

This is a multi-center Phase 3 clinical trial with an open-label single-arm safety run-in and PK evaluation part and a randomized double-blind, placebo controlled part in patients with ES-SCLC to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic profile of Trilaciclib based on completed clinical studies abroad.

The study consists of 2 parts. The first part, safety run-in and PK evaluation, enrolled approximately 12 patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer, 6 patients each with 1st line ES-SCLC and 2nd/3rd line ES-SCLC to receive Trilaciclib in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (EC regimen) or with topotecan, and based on evaluable data from Cycle 1, evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy (prevention of myelosuppression) of Trilaciclib. The second part is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy validation study, and approximately 80 patients with ES-SCLC will be enrolled in Part II, stratified by 1st line vs 2nd/3rd line ES-SCLC, ECOG PS (0-1 vs 2), and presence vs absence of brain metastases, and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Trilaciclib and placebo, in which patients with 1st line ES-SCLC receive Trilaciclib/placebo combined with EC regimen (Trilaciclib-EC group and placebo-EC group), and patients with 2nd/3rd line ES-SCLC receive Trilaciclib/placebo combined with topotecan (Trilaciclib-TPT group and placeboTPT group), and the efficacy of Trilaciclib (prevention of myelosuppression) will be evaluated with duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in Cycle 1 as the primary endpoint. The planned dose of Trilaciclib is 240 mg/m2. If the safety data from the first part of the study suggest that the dose of Trilaciclib needs to be adjusted, 12 additional patients (6 patients each for 1st line ES-SCLC and 2nd/3rd line ESSCLC) will be enrolled in the first part of the study to explore the PK and safety of Trilaciclib 200 mg/m2. The study process includes screening period, treatment period, safety followup and survival follow-up.

The end of the study was defined as death in 75% of subjects, or 12 months after the last subject was enrolled, or the sponsor decided to terminate the study, whichever came first.
