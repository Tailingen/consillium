The Gene Profiles of Primary and Heterogeneous Metastases of Colorectal Cancer
The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in China's cancer disease spectrum is on the rise, and it is a common malignant tumor that harms the health of Chinese residents.In patients with synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer, RAS status is highly consistent in primary focus and metastasis, so NCCN guidelines recommend RAS testing of primary or metastatic tissue is feasible .However, there are also some reports that the difference of RAS status between primary and metastatic lesions was up to 22%.In additiont,there are few studies on whether the gene profile of the metastatic lesion is the same as that of the primary lesion in patients with postoperative heterogeneous metastasis in patients with stage III colorectal cancer.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Mutation Consistency of metastatic and primary sites of colorectal cancer patients with postoperative metastasis, We do NGS sequencing of both the primary and metastatic tissue sample of the CRC patients. The gene mutation data will be analysis, and the percentage of same and different mutation of the samples will be compared., through study completion, an average of 2 years.
Mutation Consistency of tissue and blood sample, The gene mutation data will be analysis, and the percentage of same and different mutation of the samples will be reported. The consistency between the gene mutation of ctDNA test in blood and the gene mutation of tissue test is analyzed to determine whether the blood ctDNA test could replace the tissue gene test, through study completion, an average of 2 years.
prediction accuracy of survival rate, We will use the gene mutation data and follow-up data of the patients to construct a prediction model, and the accuracy of model to anticipating the 2-year survival rate of patients will be analyzed. To analyze the relationship between different gene mutations and patients' recurrence and prognosis, and to clarify the prognostic role of new mutations in heterogeneous metastasis., through study completion, an average of 2 years.
The incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in China's cancer disease spectrum is on the rise, and it is a common malignant tumor that harms the health of Chinese residents. Now NCCN guidelines recommend targeted drugs for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer mainly including cetuximab and panizumab whic targeting EGFR , as well as the bevacizumab and arber regofini, etc which targeing anti-angiogenic.Cetuximab and panizumab are only effective in patients with RAS wild type.

Previous studies have shown that In patients with synchronous metastatic colorectal cancer, RAS status is highly consistent in primary focus and metastasis, so NCCN guidelines recommend RAS testing of primary or metastatic tissue is feasible .However, there are also some reports that the difference of RAS status between primary and metastatic lesions was up to 22%.In additiont,there are few studies on whether the gene profile of the metastatic lesion is the same as that of the primary lesion in patients with postoperative heterogeneous metastasis in patients with stage III colorectal cancer.

Therefore, it has important clinical significance to compare the difference of gene profile between metastatic lesion and primary lesion in patients with postoperative metastasis of stage III colorectal cancer.
