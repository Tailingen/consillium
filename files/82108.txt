Study Evaluating the Parent-child Relationship During the Hospitalisation of a Parent in Long-term Protective Isolation
The intensive treatments of certain cancers and haemopathies require the implementation of a protective isolation from external micro-organisms for a period of several weeks. This isolation implies a limitation of visitors and sometimes prohibits access to young children. This raises questions concerning the maintenance of family links, and in particular the parent-child relationship as well as the psychological and emotional isolation of hospitalised patients and the resulting psychological effects.

Telepresence robots are increasingly used as a means of remote communications, especially for teleconsultations and/or access to various public services (cultural events, education, etc.). In the context of long-term hospitalisation, they can be used for various purposes, such as access to cultural events, university activities, contact with patient's home and maintenance of family links. Some studies have analyzed the use of these robots and their effects in academic settings or the suitability of their use with elderly populations for continuing care.

To our knowledge, no study has evaluated the interest for the parent-child relationship of the use of a telepresence robot during the hospitalisation in protective isolation for a long period of a patient with young child(ren).

We propose to conduct this observational, multi-center prospective study aiming at evaluating the parent-child relationship following the setting up of a mobile telepresence robot for patients with children aged 15 years or less and hospitalised in long-term protective isolation.
