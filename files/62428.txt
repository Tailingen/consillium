OCTANE: Adjuvant Liposomal Doxorubicin and Carboplatin for Early-stage Triple-negative Breast Cancer
This clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and exploratory measures of liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin combination therapy in the adjuvant setting for early stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients.

The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin in reducing the risk of recurrence for early stage TNBC patients.

The secondary objectives involve characterizing the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy. Adverse events rates will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.

The exploratory objectives of the study focus on evaluating changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). This measure will provide insights into the potential utility of ctDNA as a biomarker for treatment response and disease progression.

By addressing these objectives, the study aims to contribute to the understanding of the benefits and risks associated with liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin combination therapy in the adjuvant setting for early stage TNBC, potentially leading to improved treatment outcomes and patient care.

Disease-Free Survival (DFS) Rate, The disease-free survival (DFS) rate is used to evaluate the efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin in the adjuvant setting. It assesses the proportion of participants who remain free from disease recurrence or progression after receiving the combination treatment as an adjuvant therapy for their cancer.

DFS rate is calculated by dividing the number of participants who have not experienced disease recurrence or progression within a specified timeframe by the total number of participants enrolled in the clinical trial.

DFS Rate (%) = (Number of participants with no disease recurrence or progression / Total number of participants enrolled) Ã— 100 A higher DFS rate indicates a greater efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin as an adjuvant treatment, suggesting their ability to delay or prevent disease recurrence or progression in participants. A higher DFS rate implies a better prognosis and improved disease control in the adjuvant setting., From the start of the study up to 5 years
Safety and Toxicity Profile of the Study Treatment as measured by Adverse Events Rates and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 (CTCAE v.5), The outcome measure aims to characterize the safety and toxicity profile of the study treatment by assessing the occurrence and severity of adverse events (AEs) as measured using the CTCAE v.5). The CTCAE v.5 utilizes a standardized grading scale to assess the severity of adverse events. The scale consists of grades ranging from 1 to 5, with each grade corresponding to a specific level of severity. The grades are:

Grade 1 Mild Event is asymptomatic or mild, requiring minimal or no medical intervention.

Grade 2 Moderate Event minimal to moderate interference with daily activities, and some medical intervention.

Grade 3 Severe Event causes significant interference with daily activities, and medical intervention or treatment is required.

Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling Event poses immediate risk to life or function, requiring urgent medical intervention or treatment.

Grade 5 Death Event results in death related to the adverse event., From the start of the study up to 5 years
Changes in Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) Levels. Monitoring ctDNA Dynamics Pre and Post Treatment, The outcome measure aims to evaluate changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels as a marker of treatment response. It involves monitoring and comparing the levels of ctDNA before and after the administration of the treatment to assess the impact of the treatment on tumor burden and disease progression.

The levels of ctDNA will be measured at multiple time points, including baseline (pre-treatment) and post-treatment intervals. This can be done using various techniques such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays targeting specific tumor-associated genetic alterations. The quantitative analysis of ctDNA will provide insights into the changes in tumor burden and the potential efficacy of the treatment., Baseline and (on cycle four) at sixteen weeks,6,12,18,24 months up to five years post treatment
Background Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. TNBC is associated with a higher risk of recurrence and poorer prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes. Currently, the standard of care for early stage TNBC includes adjuvant chemotherapy, typically consisting of anthracyclines and taxanes. However, this regimen is associated with significant toxicities and adverse effects.

This clinical trial aims to evaluate the combination of liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin as an adjuvant therapy for patients with early stage TNBC. Previous studies conducted in the neoadjuvant setting have shown promising results with this combination, indicating a reduction in the risk of recurrence. Additionally, the combination has demonstrated a more favorable tolerability profile compared to the current standard of care. Therefore, this trial seeks to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin in the adjuvant setting for TNBC.

The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin as adjuvant therapy for early stage TNBC. The efficacy will be measured by evaluating the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate at a specified time point.

The secondary objectives of this study include: Characterizing the safety and toxicity profile of the combination therapy, as measured by the incidence and severity of adverse events using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Assessing the overall survival (OS) rate in patients receiving liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin. Evaluating the pathological complete response (pCR) rate following the treatment regimen. Analyzing the disease-free survival (DFS) rate in patients treated with the combination therapy. In addition to the primary and secondary objectives, this study also aims to explore the following: Investigating changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels as a potential biomarker for treatment response and disease progression. Exploring correlations between specific genetic markers and treatment outcomes.

This study is a multicenter, open-label, phase II clinical trial. The study will enroll patients with early stage TNBC who have undergone surgical resection of the primary tumor. Patients in the study will receive adjuvant therapy consisting of liposomal doxorubicin and carboplatin. The dosing and administration schedule will be determined based on established guidelines and previous studies.

The sample size calculation will be based on statistical considerations, taking into account the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival. A predetermined number of patients will be required to achieve adequate statistical power.

Eligible patients will be enrolled and undergo baseline assessments, including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment will be initiated according to the predetermined dosing and administration schedule. Patients will be closely monitored throughout the study for treatment response, adverse events, and disease recurrence.

Follow-up visits will be scheduled at specified time intervals to assess long-term outcomes and collect additional data.
