Misoprostol for Reduction of Blood Loss During Fibroid Surgery
The aim of this research work is to assess the impact of a single preoperative dose of buccal misoprostol in reducing blood loss during abdominal fibroid surgery.
Fibroids
DRUG: Misoprostol|DRUG: Placebo
Estimated Intra-operative Blood Loss, Estimate of blood loss occurring during the surgical procedure as determined by anesthesia staff and documented by anesthesia, nursing and surgical staff as per hospital protocol., Intra-operative
Duration of Procedure, Intra-operative time, Intra-operative|Length of Inpatient Hospitalization, Participants will be followed for the duration of their stay, defined as the number of days of post-operative inpatient hospitalization, an expected average of 3 days., Number of days the patient is hospitalized post-operatively, an expected average of 3 days and a maximum of 90 days post-operatively|Post-operative Blood Transfusion, Whether or not a patient receives a post-operative blood transfusion, defined as a transfusion occurring in the immediate post-operative period (during post-operative inpatient hospitalization)., From time of surgery completion through discharge from hospital, an expected average period of 3 days
This is a trial of women undergoing fibroid surgery at a university-affiliated tertiary care center. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive preoperative 400ucg buccal (under the tongue) misoprostol or placebo on the basis of total fibroid volume, location, parity. Intra-operative blood loss will be compared between groups.
