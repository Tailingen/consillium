Imaging Study to Investigate Safety and Diagnostic Performance of 18F rhPSMA 7.3 PET Ligand in Suspected Prostate Cancer Recurrence
A prospective, Phase 3, multi center, single-arm, imaging study investigating the safety and diagnostic performance of rhPSMA 7.3 (18F) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) ligand in men with suspected prostate cancer recurrence based on elevated Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) following prior therapy.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) Injection|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Positron emission tomography scan
Patient-level CDR and Region-level PPV of rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PET for BCR of Prostate Cancer Using Histopathology or Imaging as a SoT, The CDR was defined as the percentage of all patients scanned who had at least one TP lesion (localized correspondence between rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging and the reference standard) regardless of any coexisting FP findings. When determining the region-level PPV, all rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PET-positive regions (maximum of three per patient) were categorized as TP or FP regions using histopathology or imaging., Conventional images within 90 days of rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PET, followed by biopsy within 60 days post-PET scan or confirmatory imaging within 90 days post-PET scan
Patient-level CDR and Region-level PPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET in Patients Who Had Negative Baseline Conventional Imaging, Patient-level CDR was defined as the percentage of all patients scanned who had at least one TP lesion (localized correspondence between rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging and the reference standard) regardless of any co-existing FP findings.

Region-Level PPV is defined as the regions which are true positive out of all regions with positive lesions., Conventional images within 90 days of rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PET, followed by biopsy within 60 days post-PET scan or confirmatory imaging within 90 days post-PET scan|Patient-level CDR and Region-level PPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET for Recurrence in Those Patients With and Without Reference Standard Histopathology Available, Patient-level CDR was defined as the percentage of all patients scanned who had at least one TP lesion (localized correspondence between rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging and the reference standard) regardless of any co-existing FP findings.

Region-Level PPV is defined as the regions which are true positive out of all regions with positive lesions., Conventional images within 90 days of rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PET, followed by biopsy within 60 days post-PET scan or confirmatory imaging within 90 days post-PET scan|Patient-level CDR of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET Stratified by PSA Level, Patient-level CDR was defined as the percentage of all patients scanned who had at least one TP lesion (localized correspondence between rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging and the reference standard) regardless of any co-existing FP findings. The last PSA level before the PET scan will be used to stratify the patients, Conventional images within 90 days of rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PET, followed by biopsy within 60 days post-PET scan or confirmatory imaging within 90 days post-PET scan|CDR of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET in the Following Regions: Prostate/Prostate Bed, Pelvic Lymph Nodes, Other, Patient-level CDR was defined as the percentage of all patients scanned who had at least one TP lesion (localized correspondence between rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET imaging and the reference standard) regardless of any co-existing FP findings. The analysis was performed for each region and for each of the blinded independent readers, Conventional images within 90 days of rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PET, followed by biopsy within 60 days post-PET scan or confirmatory imaging within 90 days post-PET scan|Percentage of Patients in Whom rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET Imaging Results Changed the Intended Patient Management (Major and Other Changes), This analysis used patients in the EAP who had documented patient management plans in the EDC before and after the rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET scan, Conventional images within 90 days of rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PET, followed by biopsy within 60 days post-PET scan or confirmatory imaging within 90 days post-PET scan|Reader Kappa Statistics of rhPSMA7.3 (18F) Scan Interpretation by the Blinded Independent Readers, The Cohen's kappa statistic will be calculated to assess pairwise agreement between any 2 blinded independent readers, PET Scan on Day 1|Region-level PPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET Stratified by PSA Level, Region-Level PPV is defined as the regions which are true positive out of all regions with positive lesions.. The last PSA level before the rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET scan was used to stratify patients., Conventional images within 90 days of rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PET, followed by biopsy within 60 days post-PET scan or confirmatory imaging within 90 days post-PET scan|Region-level PPV of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) PET for Recurrence in Those Patients With and Without Reference Standard Histopathology Available, Region-Level PPV is defined as the regions which are true positive out of all regions with positive lesions. The data are analysed by whether the patients have had histopathology as reference standard., Conventional images within 90 days of rhPSMA7.3 (18F) PET, followed by biopsy within 60 days post-PET scan or confirmatory imaging within 90 days post-PET scan
The primary objective of this study was to assess the patient-level correct detection rate (CDR) and region-level positive predictive value (PPV) of rhPSMA-7.3 (18F) positron emission tomography (PET) for biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer using histopathology or imaging as a standard of truth (SoT).
