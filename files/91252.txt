Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Immediate Release (IR) Formulation|DRUG: Gastro-Retentive (GR) Formulation|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Pomalidomide
Number of Participants Who Experienced Dose-Limiting Toxcity (DLT), DLTs were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 and included the below, if judged by the investigator/medical monitor to be possibly related to study treatment: Non-hematologic DLTs were any ≥ Grade 3 toxicity, except: Grade 3 asymptomatic electrolyte abnormalities (except hypophosphatemia \> 24 hours); Grade 3 nausea, vomiting and diarrhea \< 3 days; Grade 3 fatigue \< 14 days; ≥ Grade 3 hyperglycemia/toxicity due to dexamethasone; ≥ Grade 3 rash due to pomalidomide. Hematologic DLTs included: Grade 4 neutropenia if absolute neutrophil count \< 0.5 x 10\^9/L ≥ 7 days; febrile neutropenia; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia ≥ 7 days; Grade ≥ 3 with ≥ Grade 2 bleeding/requiring platelet transfusion., Day 1 to day 28 of cycle 1, where each cycle was 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Each Formulation of Oprozomib in Combination With Pomolidomide and Dexamethasone, The MTD was the dose with the highest posterior probability of having a DLT rate within the target toxicity interval (15% to 25%), while the posterior probability of excessive/unacceptable toxicity (\>25% to 100%) is \<40%.

GR only: cycle 1 day 8: 8 hours post-dose|Best Overall Response (BOR) According to Revised International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria (IMWG-URC), BOR was the best response per IMWG-URC from best to worst: stringent complete response (sCR; complete response \[CR\], normal serum free light chain ratio, no clonal cells in bone marrow \[BM\]), CR (negative immunofixation on serum and urine, soft tissue plasmacytomas disappearance, \< 5% plasma cells in BM), very good partial response (VGPR; serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation or ≥ 90% reduction in serum M-protein \[urine M-protein level \< 100 mg/24-h\]), partial response (PR; ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or \< 200 mg/24-h), minimal response (MR; 25-49% reduction of serum M-protein and 50-89% in 24-h urinary M-protein, exceeding 200 mg/24-h), stable disease (SD; not CR, VGPR, PR or progressive disease \[PD\]), and PD (≥ 25% increase in serum or urine M-component, development of new or increased size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas, hypercalcemia attributed to the plasma cell proliferative disorder)., Day 1 of cycle 1 up to the end of study visit (where each cycle was 28 days); median treatment duration in Part 1 was 11.43 weeks and in Part 2 was 28 weeks|Overall Response Rate (ORR) According to IMWG-URC, The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a BOR of sCR, CR, VGPR, and PR per the IMWG-URC. Complete response (CR): Negative immunofixation on serum and urine, soft tissue plasmacytomas disappearance, \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow (BM). Stringent CR (sCR): CR and normal serum free light chain ratio and no clonal cells in BM. Very Good Partial Response (VGPR): Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation or ≥ 90% reduction in serum M-protein (urine M-protein level \< 100 mg/24-h). PR: ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and 24-h urinary M-protein by ≥ 90% or to \< 200 mg/24-h.

The number of participants who had a PFS event or who were censored are presented. PFS events were an assessment of progressive disease according to the IMWG-URC or death due to any cause. PFS data was censored: participants alive and no documented disease progression at time of analysis were censored at date of last disease assessment; participants alive with no disease assessment were censored at the first study dose date; participants alive without documented disease progression, with withdrawn consent were censored at date of last disease assessment before consent withdrawal; and for participants who started anti-cancer therapy other than study treatment prior to documentation of disease progression were censored at date of last disease assessment prior to starting new therapy., Day 1 of cycle 1 up to the end of study visit (where each cycle was 28 days); median treatment duration in Part 1 was 11.43 weeks and in Part 2 was 28 weeks|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of PFS, PFS was defined as the number of months from a participant's first dose of study treatment to the earlier of disease progression or death due to any cause. Median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 95% CIs were estimated using the method by Klein and Moeschberger (1997) with log-log transformation. PFS data was censored: participants alive and no documented disease progression at time of analysis were censored at date of last disease assessment; participants alive with no disease assessment were censored at the first study dose date; participants alive without documented disease progression, with withdrawn consent were censored at date of last disease assessment before consent withdrawal; and for participants who started anti-cancer therapy other than study treatment prior to documentation of disease progression were censored at date of last disease assessment prior to starting new therapy., Day 1 of cycle 1 up to the end of study visit (where each cycle was 28 days); median treatment duration in Part 1 was 11.43 weeks and in Part 2 was 28 weeks|Kaplan-Meier Estimate of Duration of Response (DOR), DOR, presented in months, was defined as the number of days between the date of the first tumor assessment indicating an objective response (PR or better) through to the subsequent date of progression or death due to any cause, or where applicable date of censoring (date of first progressive disease assessment or death or date of censoring - date of the first objective response result + 1/30.4). Median PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the method by Klein and Moeschberger (1997) with log-log transformation., Day 1 of cycle 1 up to the end of study visit (where each cycle was 28 days); median treatment duration in Part 1 was 11.43 weeks and in Part 2 was 28 weeks
A multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, dose-exploration study evaluating two new formulations of oprozomib plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone in participants with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 will evaluate the formulations of oprozomib in combination with dexamethasone only. Part 2 will evaluate the formulations of oprozomib administered at increasing dose levels (dose escalation) in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone.
