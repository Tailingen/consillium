Efficacy of FOLFOX Versus FOLFOX Plus Aflibercept in K-ras Mutant Patients With Resectable Liver Metastases
Patients presenting with multiple innumerable liver metastases will probably never come to resection, however, for all others, including patients with numerous multiple metastases or large metastases, resection should be considered after limited chemotherapy.

There is consensus for a backbone chemotherapy consisting of fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin. FOLFOX was used in the previous EORTC study and is again recommended.

The addition of targeted agents to standard chemotherapy in the perioperative strategy for mCRC might increase the ORR and R0 resectability, without significant increase in toxicity, therefore translating to a better outcome.

BOS2 (EORTC 40091) was designed to test this hypothesis in patients with a KRAS wold-type profile.

It was decided in parallel to design an open label, randomized, multi-center, 2-arm phase II-III study this time aimed at enrolling KRAS mutated patients.

Arm A: (standard) mFOLFOX6 + Surgery Arm B: (experimental) mFOLFOX6 + Aflibercept + Surgery
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic|Liver Metastases|KRAS Mutated Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Modified FOLFOX6|BIOLOGICAL: Aflibercept|PROCEDURE: Surgery
Progression free survival, Increase in progression free survival rate at 1 year in the experimental arm (mFOLFOX6 + aflibercept) compared to mFOLFOX6 alone arm., 1 year
Pathological response rate, Increase in major pathological response rate between mFOLFOX6 alone arm and each experimental arm., 4 years|Resection rate, Compare the percentage of patients with total resection with these three treatments., 4 years|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of death. Patients who are still alive when last traced will be censored at the date of last follow-up., 8 years|Safety, All adverse events will be recorded; the investigator will assess whether those events are drug related (reasonable possibility, no reasonable possibility) and this assessment will be recorded in the database for all adverse events., 4 years
