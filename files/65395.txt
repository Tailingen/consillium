Bevacizumab and Endothelium Dependent Vasodilation
The introduction of angiogenesis inhibitors has remarkably improved treatment of patients with several types of cancer. One of the most reported side effects of angiogenesis inhibitors is hypertension. In patients treated with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, hypertension had an overall incidence up to 32%. The increase in blood pressure occurs early in treatment. The etiology of hypertension caused by treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors is unclear. Understanding the pathogenesis of this side effect is essential for optimal treatment with this class of drugs.

The primary objective is to explore the effect of bevacizumab infusion on endothelium-dependent vasodilation of forearm resistance arteries.
