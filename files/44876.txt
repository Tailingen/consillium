Study on Clinical Features and Outcomes of Breast Sarcoma
This is multi-institutional retrospective study in order to identify the most relevant clinical characteristics, treatment strategies, to explore the impact on principal clinical outcomes and finally, to suggest some principles for management and treatment of breast sarcomas.

The study will collect data about patients affected by breast sarcoma referred to participating Institutions between January 2000 and June 2020
Breast Sarcoma

In the field of soft tissue sarcomas, breast sarcomas are a truly peculiar family of rare tumors for both their clinical history and biology of disease.

Surgery (if feasible) is the main therapeutic approach for all the patients with localized disease, while a pharmacological (chemotherapeutic) and/or radiotherapeutic treatment is reserved to those with high-risk/recurrent-relapsing/metastatic disease.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of specific prospective trials in breast sarcoma to guide the clinical decision-making and breast sarcoma patients are often sent to sarcoma referral centers only after surgery Due to sarcoma-specific clinical features, it is clear that both diagnostic and clinical strategies mandate a different approach compared to epithelial tumors. This is of key importance to reach the correct diagnosis, design the best therapeutic decision-making and subsequent follow-up.

Even if retrospective data limitations and biases, in the lack of prospective data collection, these data may be a unique and precious source of information For this reasons this multi-institutional retrospective study is aimed to identify the most relevant clinical characteristics, treatment strategies, to explore the impact on principal clinical outcomes and finally, to suggest some principles for management and treatment of breast sarcomas.
