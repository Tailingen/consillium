To Compare Relative Bioavailability of Two Clinical Formulations of Linifanib.
A pharmacokinetic study to compare 2 clinical formulations of linifanib.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: linifanib
To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of linifanib in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors., Blood samples for the pharmacokinetics (PK) of linifanib will be collected at designated time points and assayed., At various time points from Day 1 through Day 5 of Periods 1 and 2
Safety: Adverse Events - The number of participants with adverse events will be reported as a measure of Safety., The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and lab evidence of adverse events on a routine basis through out the study., Throughout the study|Safety: Physical Examination and Vital Signs - Physical examination will be performed and vital signs will be assessed for participants as a measure of safety., Complete physical exam, including body weight, will be done at Screening. A symptom-directed physical exam, including bodyweight, will be done at Day 1, Periods 1 and 2, Day 5, Period 2/Final Visit and 30 day safety follow-up., Physical exam at Screening, Day 1 of Periods 1 and 2 and Day 5, Period 2/Final Visit and 30 day safety follow-up; Vital Signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) will be done at all visits.|Safety: Clinical Lab Tests will be performed for each participant as a safety measure., Chemistry, hematology, urinalysis lab tests, Screening, Day 1, Periods 1 and 2, Day 5, Period2/Final Visit and 30 day safety follow-up.
This study is designed to evaluate the bioavailability of linifanib from 2 formulations. Subjects may enroll in a separate extension study to continue receiving linifanib after completion of this study.
