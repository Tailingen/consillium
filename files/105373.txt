Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is the duration from date of randomization to date of death from any cause. Participants were censored at the date they were last known to be alive., Baseline to date of death from any cause (up to 37.06 months)
Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) (Overall Response Rate), Overall Response Rate (ORR) is the number of participants with a Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR) divided by the total number of randomized participants per arm, then multiplied by 100. Response is based on the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0) criteria. Complete Response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions compared to baseline or the complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) and no new lesions., Baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 37.06 months)|Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD) (Disease Control Rate), Disease Control Rate (DCR) is the number of participants with a Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD) divided by the total number of randomized participants per arm, then multiplied by 100. Response is based on the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.0) criteria. Complete Response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR) was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions compared with baseline or the complete disappearance of target lesions, with persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) and no new lesions. Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as at least 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions compared with the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since the start of treatment or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion(s). Stable Disease (SD) was defined as small changes that did not meet above criteria., Baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 37.06 months)|Progression Free Survival Time, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of objective disease progression or death due to any cause. Participants were censored at date of last PFS assessment prior to the cutoff date or the date of initiation of subsequent systemic anticancer therapy, whichever was earlier., Baseline to measured progressive disease or date of death from any cause (up to 33.54 months)|Time to Progressive Disease, Time to progressive disease was defined as the time from randomization to the first date of objective disease progression. Participants were censored at date of last PFS assessment prior to the cutoff date or the date of initiation of subsequent systemic anticancer therapy, whichever was earlier., Baseline to measured progressive disease (up to 37.06 months)|Safety and Toxicity Profile of Study Treatments, Safety and toxicity profile was defined as serious and other non-serious adverse events. A summary of serious and all other non-serious adverse events is located in the Reported Adverse Event module., Baseline to study endpoint (up to 37.06 months)|Duration of Hospitalizations Per Participant, Length of hospitalization in participants hospitalized during the study or within 30 days of discontinuation regardless of whether the hospitalization was or was not due to study drug., Baseline to study endpoint (up to 37.06 months)|Number of Participants Who Received a Transfusion, Baseline to study endpoint (up to 37.06 months)|Number of Participants Receiving Concomitant Medication, Baseline to study endpoint (up to 37.06 months)|Change From Baseline in Participant Reported Outcomes as Assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), The FACT-G is a validated instrument used to measure quality of life (QOL) in participants with cancer consisting of the 27-item questionnaire and is organized into subscales, each designed to assess a QOL domain: physical well-being (PWB)-7 items; social/family well-being (SWB)-7 items; emotional well-being (EWB)-6 items; functional well-being (FWB)-7 items. Each item uses a 5 point rating scale (0="not at all" and 4=equals "very much"). FACT-G Total is the sum of the scores of all 4 subscales and ranges from 0 to 108. Higher scores indicate better QOL. Least squares mean (LSmean) change is calculated using the linear-mixed model (LMM) analysis controlled for treatment, baseline value, time point and treatment by time point interaction., Baseline, up to first 10 cycles (4 induction and 6 maintenance cycles, cycle=21 days)|Change From Baseline in Participant Reported Outcomes as Assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L), FACT-L is a valid instrument used to measure quality of life (QOL) in participants with cancer consisting of the 27-item FACT-General (G) and 9-item lung cancer subscale (LCS).
