REDEEM-CAD is a prospective multi-centre study in which a process of evaluating the risk of coronary artery disease is studied in cancer survivors 40-70 years with chemotherapy or radiotherapy \>5 years ago. The efficacy of this CAD risk evaluation will be compared with the broad community in two existing studies - CAUGHT-CAD and EDCAD. This unique Screening/Management Plan (SMP) has 2 components; 1) A novel clinical and imaging-based screening algorithm to select those most likely to develop coronary artery disease, 2) A clinical review to ensure optimal risk factor control and cardio protection.

Follow-up of treated patients will continue for an average of 36 months, with clinic reviews at 12, 24 and 36 months. The results will define the prevalence of subclinical coronary artery disease, and the feasibility and the efficacy of the SMP.
