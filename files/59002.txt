Chemotherapy and Irreversible Electroporation in the Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
Compare the efficacy and tolerability of IRE in combination with either FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
Pancreas Cancer
PROCEDURE: Irreversible Electroporation (IRE)|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: FOLFIRINOX
Incidence of Adverse and Serious Adverse events will be captured (safety and tolerability), Adverse and Serious Adverse events will be collected and analyzed, Time from first dose until subject has reached 90 days post last active study treatment
Progression free survival, Triphase CT scan will be performed within one month of IRE procedure. Triphase CT scans will then be obtained every 3 months to check disease status., Time from first dose date to first date of confirmed disease progression, assessed for 90 days
Phase II study in which all patients undergoing IRE for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma will receive either FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine as peri-ablation treatment.
