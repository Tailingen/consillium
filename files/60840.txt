A Phase II Clinical Study of HRS-7058 in Combination With Antitumor Drugs in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumour
This study is a multicentre, open phase II clinical study of dose escalation, dose extension and efficacy extension of HRS-7058 in combination with antitumor drugs in subjects with advanced malignant tumour. To evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of HRS-7058 in combination with antitumor drugs.
Advanced Malignant Tumour
