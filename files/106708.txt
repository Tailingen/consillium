Nivolumab in Combination With Metronomic Chemotherapy in Paediatrics Refractory / Relapsing Solid Tumors
The study is a two-stage trial:

1. First stage (closed - 16 patients recruited in France):

   Phase I feasibility trial to evaluate the safety of the combination of Nivolumab + metronomic chemotherapy considering three possible metronomic chemotherapy regimens
2. Second stage (opened - 86 patients expected in France and Belgium):

   Phase II randomized controlled balanced 1:1 open-label trial comparing the efficacy of the metronomic chemotherapy regimen selected at the end of the previous stage (arm C: cyclophosphamide, capecitabine, vinblastine), with or without nivolumab.
3. "Trans-MetroPD1" ancillary sub-study is partially implemented since April 2022, and proposed to patients participating to second stage

Adverse events according to the NCI-CTCAE V5., First Stage Secondary Outcome 1 \& Second Stage Secondary Outcome 1, up to 2 years|Tumor response in terms of complete/partial response or stable/progressive disease (using RANO, RAPNO, WHO, INRC, or RECIST v1.1) and overall survival, Second Stage Secondary Outcome 2, up to 2 years|Dose-intensity for each drug (ratio between the computed dose-intensity, and the protocol dose-intensity), First Stage Secondary Outcome 2 \& Second Stage Secondary Outcome 3, up to 2 years|Description of molecular profile (number of genetic alterations) on individual tumor ; the data will be collected from large-scale analysis programs performed in Europe (Mappyacts, France Genomic 2025) in agreement with the Sponsors, Second Stage Secondary Outcome 4, At study entrance|Health Related Quality of Life using the age-appropriate KINDL-R questionnaire (self- and proxy-assessment), Second Stage Ancillary Outcome 1, from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date corresponding to the end of treatment, assessed up to 24 months|Dosage of circulating progastrine (hPG80) on blood-derived samples., Second Stage Ancillary Outcome 2, from date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date corresponding to the end of treatment, up to 24 months|Counting of immune cells (number of: B cells, T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells subsets, and monocytes populations at each timepoint) on blood and blood-derived samples with flow cytometry analysis, Second Stage Ancillary Outcome 3, At day-0, Day-8, Day-15, Day-28, Day-42, and until the date of first documented progression (assessed up to 24 months)
1. First stage (closed):

   * Arm A: Nivolumab + Cyclophosphamide-Vinblastine
   * Arm B: Nivolumab + Capecitabin
   * Arm C: Nivolumab + Cyclophosphamide-Vinblastine + Capecitabin

   Arm A and Arm B have been allocated sequentially (A/B/A/B/A/B). Arm C has been opened, since arm A and Arm B were deemed safe.

   In each arm, the second patient was not recruited before the first patient has been observed for a 28-day duration.
2. Second stage (opened):

   Following the analysis of safety data from first stage, and according to IDMC's recommendations on December 2020, the metronomic chemotherapy selected for second stage was arm C: cyclophosphamide, capecitabine, vinblastine

   Randomization will be balanced 1:1, controlling for:
   * histological type: embryonal brain tumor, ependymoma, low-grade glioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and other solid tumors after approval from coordinators,
   * and treating center, using a dynamic allocation of treatment (minimization program) with a random factor set at 0.8.
3. Trans-MetroPD1 is divided into 3 axes:

   * to evaluate the health-related quality of life
   * to measure the kinectis of progastrin/hPG80, a biomarker over-expressed in a wide range of cancers
   * to determine the distribution of immune cells within blood tissue
