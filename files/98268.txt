A Phase II Clinical Study of Epigallocatechin-3-gallate in Patients With Esophageal Squamous Cancer
The investigators conduct this phase II study to evaluate safety and effectiveness of EGCG in patients with dysphagia. Swallowing-related dysphagia and pain scores were recorded using the numerical rating scale (NRS) daily . Barium meal radiography was utilized to measure the luminal size and the length of the lesion area both before and after a week of EGCG treatment. The scales are translated into Chinese and guides in Chinese are developed instructing how to use the scales and perform the assessments.

Choking symptom objective response rate, Choking when swallowing was assessed by Stooler's dysphagia score (0-4, with 0 being none and 4 being completely unable to feed orally), baseline and up to 7 days post-treatment|Pain symptom objective response rate, Pain when swallowing was assessed by numerical rating scale (0-5, with 0 being none and 5 being worst pain imaginable), baseline and up to 7 days post-treatment|Imaging objective response rate, Response rate of esophageal stenosis was determined by X-ray barium meal examination and/or contrast-enhanced CT, Change from Baseline esophageal stenosis size at 7 days
prealbumin change, The prealbumin values were tested by biochemical analysis, baseline and up to 7 days post-treatment|Albumin change, The albumin values were tested by biochemical analysis, baseline and up to 7 days post-treatment|Number of Participants with Adverse Events, participants will be followed for the duration of EGCG treatment, baseline and up to 7 days post-treatment
