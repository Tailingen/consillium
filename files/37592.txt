Nudge to Gynecologic Oncology
Ovarian cancer lacks an effective screening test, and prompt treatment at diagnosis is the only way to improve outcomes. Referral to gynecologic oncology at diagnosis of adnexal mass is recommend by guidelines from every major medical organization. Yet, 1 in 4 patients with ovarian cancer nationwide and at Penn Medicine never see a gynecologic oncologist. Even when referred to gynecologic oncology, patients from historically-marginalized groups have twice as long duration from diagnosis to seeing gynecologic oncology. In this project, the investigators will pilot a clinician nudge to gynecologic oncology referral and compare the impact to historical controls.

BEHAVIORAL: Nudge
Adoption, The primary implementation outcome is adoption, operationalized as the proportion of patients who are referred to gynecologic oncology within 30 days of diagnosis by study arm, to be evaluated overall and for historically marginalized patients., 30 days
Gyn Onc Visits, The proportion of patients completing gynecologic oncology visits for surgical evaluation., 90 days|Gyn Onc Visits, Time to first gynecologic oncology visit (in days from radiologic or pathologic diagnosis), also to be evaluated overall and for historically marginalized patients., 90 days|Adherence to Treatment, Adherence to evidence-based treatment within 365 days of patient follow-up., 365 days|Progression Free and Overall Survival, Progression-free and overall survival within 365 days of patient follow-up., 365 days
The study consists of one intervention, a clinician nudge to gynecologic oncology referral. Referral to gynecologic oncology is recommended when patients are diagnosed with a complex adnexal mass on imaging (i.e., Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System \[O-RADS\] 4 or 5 on ultrasound or Magnetic Resonance Imaging \[MRI\]). When patients are identified as having a complex adnexal mass, the order will be pended by the clinical research coordinator and sent to the ordering provider with a message to sign. The message will include content about national guidelines on referral to gynecologic oncology with opt-out framed language.
