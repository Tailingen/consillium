Preoperative Immunonutrition in Normonourished Patients Undergoing Fast-track Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery
Immunonutrition (IN) appears to reduce infective complications and in-hospital length of stay (LOS) after gastrointestinal surgery. More specifically, it seems to be beneficial also in colorectal cancer surgery. Potential benefits of combining preoperative IN (PIN) with protocols of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in reducing LOS in laparoscopic surgery are yet to be determined.
