A Real-life Study to Learn About the Use and Effects of the CDK4/6 Inhibitors in Canadian Patients With Breast Cancer.
CDK4/6 inhibitors are approved medicines indicated for the treatment of a kind of advanced/metastatic breast cancer, called hormone receptors positive (HR+)/ Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) disease. They are given orally in combination with hormonal therapies.

The purpose of this study is to better understand how the CDK4/6 inhibitors combinations are used in real-life conditions and their clinical impact for the treatment of Canadian patients affected by (HR+)/ (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

Female patients aged 18 years old or more presenting the following conditions will be selected for the study:

* HR+/HER2- breast cancer diagnosis with confirmed metastatic or advanced disease
* Diagnosis of ABC/MBC between 01 January 2016 and 01 July 2021
* Treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor

Information will be collected from one single Canadian institution, on each selected real-life patient treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors.
Breast Cancer
Number of Participants Classified According to Treatment Pattern, Number of participants according to the treatment patterns for first line, second line and third line were reported in this outcome measure. CDK4/6i included abemaciclib, palbociclib and ribociclib. Endocrine therapy (ET) included anastrozole, exemestane, fulvestrant, letrozole and tamoxifen. Chemotherapy included capecitabine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, doxorubicin, eribulin, gemcitabine and paclitaxel., From date of ABC/MBC diagnosis until date of death, date of last follow-up or the end of the study period, whichever came first (maximum follow-up of 67.6 months); available data evaluated over approximately 4.5 months of this retrospective study
Number of Participants Classified According to Type of Treatment Before Introduction of CDK4/6 Inhibitor, From date of ABC/MBC diagnosis until introduction of CDK 4/6 inhibitor(anytime between Jan 2016 to May 2016, approximately 4 months); available data evaluated over approximately 4.5 months of this retrospective study|Number of Participants Classified According to Type of Treatment After Introduction of CDK4/6 Inhibitor, From date of introduction of CDK4/6 inhibitor until date of death, date of last follow-up or the end of the study period, whichever came first (approximately 33 months); available data evaluated over approximately 4.5 months of this retrospective study
