Optimization of the Patient Care Pathway in Immuno-oncology
This study compares the care pathway of melanoma patients treated by immunotherapy in two ambulatory care structures. The aim is to measure if a care structure specialized in immuno-oncology could rationalize the care of patients.

This protocol will be based on two different follow-up during the treatment period:

* dedicated and coordinated e-follow-up (IUCT-O in Toulouse)
* standard follow-up (University Hospital Center in Bordeaux)

Patients will be followed from the first cycle of immunotherapy until 3 months after the initiation treatment.
