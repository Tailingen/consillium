CANPOS: Predictive Biomarkers of Tumor Progression in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
CANPOS is a non-interventional study aiming at evaluate at the time of initial surgery the value of new serum markers to predict the occurrence of metastases in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. This would represent a rational to develop personalized follow-up and prevention strategies
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Serum and plasma samples
The Serum levels of osteoprotegerin, The serum levels of osteoprotegerin, as assessed by standard ELISA methods, will be measured to to evaluate at the time of initial surgery, the value of new serum markers to predict the occurrence of metastases in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer., At the time of initial surgery
