Study of Early-stage Lung Adenocarcinoma for Early Detection and Effective Treatment Strategy
to determine the values of imaging and genetic biomarkers for prediction of tumor aggressiveness and prognosis in patient with early stage lung adenocarcinoma to Identify unique copy number alteration in patient with early stage lung adenocarcinoma to evaluate the long-term change of ground-glass nodule combined with lung adenocarcinoma to suggest a guideline for planning an appropriate follow-up examination and management
