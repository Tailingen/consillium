The Effectiveness of HemopatchÂ® in the Reduction of Post-surgical Serous Drainage
Hemopatch is an alternative to reduce morbidity associated with axillary lymphadenectomy surgery, possibly contributing to improved patient management, clinical outcomes, and hospital costs. We propose a multicenter, controlled, and randomized trial to study the efficacy of Hemopatch in reducing serous wound drainage.
