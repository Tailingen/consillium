Natural Killer(NK) Cell Therapy in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is a phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), open-label, multicohort study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of iPSC NK cells in patients with relapsed/refractory AML or AML Minimal Residual Disease (MRD).
AML, Adult|Minimal Residual Disease
DRUG: CD33/CLL1 dual CAR-NK cell|DRUG: Cyclophosphamid|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: CD33 CAR-NK cell|DRUG: super NK cell
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], 28 Days from first dose of iPSC NK cell infusion|Incidence of subjects with Dose Limiting Toxicities within each dose level cohort, 28 Days from first dose of iPSC NK cell infusion
Overall Response Rate(ORR), Up to approximately 2 years after last dose of iPSC NK cell infusion|MRD negative rate, 28 Days from first dose of iPSC NK cell infusion|Event-free survival, Up to approximately 2 years after last dose of iPSC NK cell infusion]|Relapse-free survival, Up to approximately 2 years after last dose of iPSC NK cell infusion|Overall survival (OS), Up to approximately 2 years after last dose of iPSC NK cell infusion|Determination of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of iPSC NK cells in peripheral blood, The PK of iPSC NK in peripheral blood will be reported as the relative percentage of product DNA versus patient DNA (% chimerism) measured from blood samples at the specified time points., Up to approximately 2 years after last dose of iPSC NK cell infusion
