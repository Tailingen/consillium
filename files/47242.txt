Decision Aid for Education and Support About Cancer Treatment
The goals of this clinical trial are to evaluate DECIDES, a web-based decision support application that provides education about cancer and cancer treatment and provides support to encourage adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients, their caregivers, and oncology health care providers to make informed decisions about cancer treatment together.

The main questions this study aims to answer are:

* Is DECIDES acceptable, usable, and feasible for AYA, caregivers, and oncology health care providers?
* Is DECIDES helpful for AYA, caregivers, and oncology health care providers that are making cancer treatment decisions together?

AYA and caregiver participants will complete a questionnaire and be randomly assigned to participate in one of three groups: (1) Usual Care, (2) DECIDES, or (3) DECIDES+. Participants in 'Usual Care' will continue to have access to their oncology health care team for questions related to cancer and cancer treatment, as per usual standard of care. Participants in both 'DECIDES' and 'DECIDES+' groups will receive access to DECIDES, and those in 'DECIDES+' will receive additional live, coach-assisted support. After 8 weeks, AYA and caregivers will complete a follow-up questionnaire and those in the 'DECIDES' and 'DECIDES+' groups will complete a semi-structured qualitative interview. Oncology clinicians of participating AYA will be invited to participate in a semi-structured qualitative interview. Researchers will compare groups to see if AYA and caregivers that receive access to DECIDES (with an informational handout vs. coach-assisted support) report more positive decision-making processes compared to those that receive standard of care.

BEHAVIORAL: Decision Aid for Education and Support about Cancer Treatment (DECIDES Intervention)
Acceptability of Decision Aid, This is a 12-item study-team developed measure used to obtain acceptability ratings from AYA and caregivers (that completed participation in DECIDES or DECIDES+). This measure is based on The Ottawa Hospital's measure of acceptability regarding comprehension of components of a decision aid, its length, pace, amount of information, balance in presentation of information about options, and overall suitability for decision-making. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). The average across 12 items is calculated to produce a total score that ranges from 1-5. Higher scores reflect greater acceptability. Two items related to the DECIDES Coach are not answered by participants in DECIDES who did not have access to a coach., 8 weeks post-randomization|Usability of Decision Aid, This is a 10-item scale collected from AYA and caregivers (that completed participation in DECIDES or DECIDES + coach) and oncology health care providers to measure perceptions of DECIDES usability. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree) and summed to produce a total score that ranges from 0 to 100. Scores are normalized to produce a percentile ranking. A score \>80.3 reflects letter grade "A" (adjective rating "excellent"); 68-80.3 reflects letter grade "B" (adjective rating "good"), 68 reflects letter grade "C" (adjective rating "OK"); 51-67 reflects letter grade "D" (adjective rating "poor"); and \<51 reflects letter grade "F" (adjective rating "awful")., 8 weeks post-randomization
Perceived Involvement in Shared Treatment Decision-Making Process, The SDM-Q-9 is a valid and reliable 9-item patient-reported questionnaire collected from AYA to measure their perceived involvement in the process of shared treatment decision-making with their oncology clinician. The physician version of the SDM-Q-9 (SDM-Q-Doc) was adapted for use with caregivers in this study to measure AYA involvement in shared decision-making with their oncology clinician, from the caregiver's perspective. Total scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores reflect greater degree to which AYA were involved in a shared treatment decision-making process., 8 weeks post-randomization|Perceptions of Physician Engagement in Decision-Making Process, This is a 5-item scale that measures AYA and caregiver perceptions of the extent to which clinicians engaged in five key elements of the decision-making process (e.g., discuss the available options with you in a way you could understand?, encourage you to ask questions or express any concerns you had about the available options?, involve you as much as you wanted in the decision making process?). The overall physician style score ranges from 0-100. Higher scores reflect more optimal communication with physician., 8 weeks post-randomization|Knowledge of Cancer Clinical Trials, This is a 25-item true/false questionnaire used to assess participant understanding of clinical trials and informed consent processes. Items are scored based on % correct, with higher scores reflecting more knowledge., 8-weeks post randomization|Attitudes Toward Cancer Clinical Trials, This is a 35-item measure of AYA and caregiver attitudes toward clinical trials. Continuous scores were calculated from PRPQ items reflecting 'Perceived Benefits' (with a higher score suggesting positive attitudes) and from PRPQ items reflecting 'Perceived Barriers' (with a higher score suggesting negative attitudes). A 'Decision Balance' score was computed by converting the 'Perceived Benefits' and 'Perceived Barriers' scores to Z-scores, and then subtracting the 'Perceived Barriers Z-scores' from the 'Perceived Benefits Z-scores'. A 'Decision Balance' Z-score of 0 represents the population mean; a positive valence (3) reflects more positive attitudes to clinical trials and negative valence (-3) reflects more negative attitudes., 8 weeks post-randomization|Uncertainty in Cancer Treatment Decision-Making Process, This is a valid and reliable 16-item scale collected from AYA and caregivers to measure uncertainty in making cancer treatment decisions, including factors that contribute to uncertainty about cancer treatment options and perceptions of effective decision-making. Total scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict)., 8 weeks post-randomization|Regret About Cancer Treatment Decision-Making Process, This is a valid and reliable 5-item scale collected from AYA and caregivers to measure distress or remorse about a cancer treatment decision. Total scores range from 0 (no regret) to 100 (high regret)., 8 weeks post-randomization|Satisfaction With Cancer Treatment Decision-Making Process, This is a valid and reliable 6-item scale collected from AYA and caregivers to measure satisfaction with the cancer treatment decision that was made. Total scores range from 6 to 30, with higher scores reflecting higher satisfaction., 8 weeks post-randomization|Self-confidence in Cancer Treatment Decision-Making Abilities, This is a valid and reliable 11-item scale collected from AYA and caregivers to measure self-confidence in decision-making abilities. Total scores range from 0 (not confident) to 100 (extremely confident)., 8 weeks post-randomization
DECIDES is a developmentally appropriate, engaging, and interactive web-based decision support application that has been designed to address health literacy and includes:

* Education on cancer and cancer treatments, including clinical trials
* An exercise to identify perceived barriers and benefits to treatment options
* An exercise to clarify personal goals for treatment that align with life goals
* Resources to support communication with the oncology health care team
