NIR Fluorescence Imaging During Neck Dissection in Head and Neck Cancer Patients After iv Injection of ICG
The purpose of this study is to determine if NIR fluorescent imaging is an effective approach to detect the margins of head and neck tumours or lymph nodes draining the tumour
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Indocyanine Green
Evaluation of the capacity of ICG to detect cervical lymph nodes after IV injection, After IV injection of Indocyanine Green just before the surgery to head and neck cancer patients, we will study the fluorescence due to ICG in cervical lymph nodes and in the primary lesion., 7 months
Primary objective:

definition of the distribution of intravenously injected ICG in the normal and pathological lymph nodes draining the dissected tumor in head and neck cancer patients or in nodes recurrences in head and neck cancer

Secondary objectives:

* Evaluation of the ability of NIR fluorescence imaging to determine the tumoral volume, specifically the margins of the tumoral tissues (in the operating room and in the pathology department)
* Analysis of the correlation between ICG fluorescence and tumoral invasion in the dissected lymph nodes
