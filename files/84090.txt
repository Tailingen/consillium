Expectations and Priorities of Elderly Patients for a First Medical Treatment for Cancer
The main objective of study is to describe the priorities of elderly patients (70 years and over) undergoing a first medical treatment for cancer, at initiation of treatment and after 3 months of treatment. The main criterion is a prioritization of 4 items per patient from a list of 8 expectations regarding the objectives of their treatment: treatment efficacy, life expectancy, autonomy, daily activities, social activities, heaviness of treatment, toxicity, economics.

For the primary endpoint assessment, this self-administered patient questionnaire will used an opinion scale (Not at all, A little, Moderately, Enough, Many) to explore the eight domains. Next to the completion of the expectations questionnaire, patients will have to order 4 of the different 8 items that they prioritized in regard of the first line treatment that has just been prescribed by their physician.

Secondary endpoint will focus on those 8 proposed expectations of patients at different periods of time since treatment initiation. Patients' priorities will be compared to physician's priorities (using the same prioritization grid) before medical treatment and after 3 months of treatment and to younger patients' priorities (18-69 years). Associations between elderly patients' characteristics (social, medical...) and their priorities will be search.
