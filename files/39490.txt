Study of NEO-201 in Solid Tumors Expansion Cohorts
The open label, first-in-human, phase 1, dose escalation component in refractory solid tumors has been completed. The Maximum Tolerated Dose and Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) was determined to be 1.5mg/kg.

The Expansion Phase of this study is currently enrolling subjects with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), cervical and uterine cancers who progressed on front line therapy. Subjects will be treated with NEO-201 at the RP2D (1.5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks in combination with pembrolizumab, given 1 day after the NEO-201, at 400 mg IV every 6 weeks.

DRUG: NEO-201 in combination with pembrolizumab
Determine the safety of the combination of NEO-201 with pembrolizumab the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., To evaluate toxicity a safety lead in of 3 to 6 subjects will be conducted. The safety lead in will be 42 days long, consisting of 3 doses of NEO-201 and 1 dose of pembrolizumab followed by a 2 week assessment.

All appropriate treatment areas will have access to a the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm., 1.5 years|Determine Objective Response Rate (either Complete Response or Partial Response) as determined by RECIST v1.1 guidelines, For the purposes of this study, subjects will be re-evaluated for response every 12 weeks.

Response will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) \[Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009\]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria., 1.5 years|Determine Progression Free Survival as determined by RECIST v1.1 guidelines, For the purposes of this study, subjects will be re-evaluated for progression every 12 weeks.

The experimental drug called NEO-201 (the "study drug") is a monoclonal antibody that is being tested and is not approved for use in the United States by the FDA.

As stated above the RP2D was determined at 1.5 mg/kg and in the current Expansion Phase it will be administered in combination with pembrolizumab. .

A safety lead in will be conducted in the first 3 to 6 subjects to evaluate toxicity prior to expanding accrual. The safety lead-in will be 42 days in length, consisting of 1 dose of pembrolizumab and 3 doses of NEO-201 followed by a 2-week assessment for safety, in subjects with any of the expansion cohorts' targeted disease types. The third patient in the safety lead in must complete the 30-day assessment (1 dose of pembrolizumab and 3 doses of NEO-201 followed by a 2-week safety evaluation) and be evaluated for toxicity prior to treating additional patients.

Following completion of the lead-in, expansion cohorts will accrue subjects with NSCLC, HNSCC, cervical and uterine cancers who progress on frontline therapy.
