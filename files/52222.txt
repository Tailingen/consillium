Pre-emptive US Guided Superior Hypogastric Plexus Block in Pelvic Cancer Surgeries : a Randomized Double-Blinded Study
The superior hypogastric plexus (SHP) is a retroperitoneal structure with a predominance of afferent sympathetic nerve fibers. The perception of central pelvic pain is thought mainly to involve transmission through this plexus. Therefore, blocking or of SHP has been used to treat pelvic pain.
Analgesia
PROCEDURE: Superior Hypogastric Plexus Block
morphine consumption, Total 24 hours morphine consumption in milligrams, baseline till 24 hours postoperative
Visual analogue scale (VAS), scale in which 0 is least pain and 10 is sever pain, Visual analogue scale (VAS) at baseline till 24 hours postoperative
Ultrasound guided superior hypogastric plexus block there is 2 equal groups:

Group S (SHPB group 18 patients) ultrasound guided SHPB is done after induction of balanced general anesthesia (fentanyl, propofol and rocuronium) using 20 ml Bupivacaine 0.5% before skin incision, Group C (Control group 18 patients) in which same technique will be done but using normal saline 0.9% instead of bupivacaine. Patients of both groups will receive patient controlled analgesia using morphine with continous background infusion of morphine 1.5 mg/h with adding granisterone 2mg/60 ml and ability to give bolus of 0.5 mg morphine on demand.

â€¢ Dosing and administration; Group S (SHPB group 18 ultrasound guided SHPB ) using 20 ml Bupivacaine 0.5% before skin incision.

Group C (Control group 18 patients) in which same technique will be done but using normal saline 0.9%
