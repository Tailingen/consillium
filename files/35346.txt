A Phase 3 Study of Duvelisib Versus Ofatumumab in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory CLL/SLL (DUO)
A Phase 3 clinical trial to examine the efficacy of duvelisib monotherapy versus ofatumumab monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL).
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
DRUG: Duvelisib|DRUG: Ofatumumab
Progression-free Survival (PFS), The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was PFS, defined as time from randomization to the first documentation of PD as determined by blinded independent review or death due to any cause., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is a key secondary efficacy endpoint with overall response defined as best response of CR, CRi, PR, or PRwL, according to the modified IWCLL/IWG Response Criteria, with modification for treatment-related lymphocytosis as defined in the protocol., Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity assessed up to 6 years|Number of Subjects With Hematologic Improvements, Subjects with hematologic improvement included those subjects with abnormally high values for neutrophil count, hemoglobin, or platelet count at Baseline determined to have consistently met the criteria of an improvement for those parameters for a period of at least 60 days during which the subject did not have a transfusion or exogenous cytokines., 3 years|Overall Survival, A stratified Cox regression analysis was used to test for any treatment effect., Every 6 months for up to 3 years after first dose|Lymph Node Response Rate, Lymph node response defined as greater than or equal to 50% decrease in the SPD of target lymph nodes, 3 years|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response is defined only for subjects demonstrating a response (eg, CR, CRi, PR, PRwL), with the response and progression statuses both determined by the blinded, central independent review. The analysis will be descriptive for each treatment group only., Time from the first documentation of response to first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Changes in Safety Laboratory Values, An analysis of TEAEs with an onset within the first 24 weeks of treatment was performed to examine and compare the incidence of events across an equal period for each treatment arm.Twenty-four weeks was anticipated to be the median exposure to ofatumumab., From 04 Feb 2014 till 19 June 2018|Number of Subjects With Samples Available for Duvelisib Pharmacokinetics (PK), Number of subjects with samples available for duvelisib Pharmacokinetics (PK), Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and Cycle 7
This is an open-label, two- arm, randomized phase 3, superiority trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of duvelisib compared to ofatumumab administered to patients who have been diagnosed with CLL/SLL whose disease is relapsed or refractory.

Approximately 150 subjects will receive a starting dose of 25 mg duvelisib BID initially over the course of 21-day treatment cycle followed by 28-day treatment cycles for up to 18 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (whichever comes first). After 18 complete cycles of treatment, subjects may receive additional cycles of duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity if they, in the judgment of the Investigator, may derive benefit from continued treatment, and if the subject meets the criteria for additional treatment at Cycle 19 Day 1.

Approximately 150 subjects will receive a starting dose of 300 mg ofatumumab on Day 1 followed by seven weekly doses of 2000 mg. Thereafter, subjects will receive 2000 mg ofatumumab once every month for four months. Administration of ofatumumab will not exceed the 12 doses (within 7 cycles).
