Novel Form of Nutritional Supplementation in Cancer Patients
This study evaluates if a novel form of oral nutritional Supplement application in the form of gumdrops may serve as an alternative to common sip Feeds in cancer patients with high risk for malnutrition. Within this context the Impact of these two different supplements on General condition, Quality of life, muscle function, Body composition, Appetite and Nutrition Status are investigated. Patients are randomly allocated either to a study group with oral Supplementation in the form of sip feed or to a study Group receiving gumdrops for 4 weeks. After a washout period of 5-7 days study Groups are switched for another 4 week Intervention period.
