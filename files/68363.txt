Clinical Study of Ametinib Combined With Bevacizumab in First-line Treatment of Advanced NSCLC With EGFR-mutations.
To explore the intracranial/extracranial ORR, PFS, QoL, safety, dynamic changes of tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma DNA in patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation with/without brain metastasis given first-line treatment with almonertinib combined with bevacizumab at the initial stage of treatment, during treatment and after drug resistance, and the correlation between early clearance of sensitive mutations and survival.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Ametinib combined with bevacizumab
Objective Response Rate, It refers to the proportion of patients (mainly solid tumors) whose tumor has shrunk to a certain extent and remained there for a certain period of time, including Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR), 2 years|Progression Free Survival, The length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse, 2 years
Intracranial Objective Response Rate, It refers to the proportion of patients with brain metastasesï¼Œwhose Intracranial tumor has shrunk to a certain extent and remained there for a certain period of time, including Complete Response (CR) and Partial Response (PR), 2 year|Intracranial Progression Free Survival, The length of time during and after the treatment of lung cancer, that a patient with brain metastases lives with the tumor but it does not get worse, 2 year|Overall Survival, Time from randomization to death from any cause, 3 year|Quality of life score, Quantitative scoring system for patients' self-subjective self-assessment of current symptom tolerance, 3 year|Adverse event, It refers to all adverse medical events that occur after a subject receives an investigational drug, which may be manifested as symptoms, signs, diseases, or abnormalities in laboratory tests, but may not necessarily be causally related to the investigational drug

This is a one-arm prospective study to evaluate the first-line treatment of amitinib in combination with bevacizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations Effectiveness and safety. Subjects received amitinib and bevacizumab during the treatment cycle and were evaluated for efficacy every 6-8 weeks. Subject receives medication until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival as measured by the solid tumor Response Assessment Criteria (RECIST v1.1). Primary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free period (PFS), and secondary endpoints included objective response rate (iORR), progression-free period (iPFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life (QoL), and safety.
