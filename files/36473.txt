A Multicenter, Open-Label, Non-Inferiority Randomized Controlled Trial of Postoperative VTE Prevention in Chinese Patients After Colorectal Cancer Surgery
research objective

1. Optimize VTE prevention management after CRC surgery.
2. Improve the prevention and treatment level of VTE in current perioperative patients.
3. Reduce the social burden of VTE related diseases.

Participants will:

1. start low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis within 24 hours post-surgery.
2. The prophylactic regimen for the experimental group lasted 14 days, while the control group received it for 28 days. Low molecular weight heparin is given subcutaneously at a dose of 0.3ml once daily.
3. atients underwent lower limb color Doppler ultrasound on postoperative days 7 ± 2, 14 ± 3, and 28 ± 5, which included screening for thrombosis in the proximal deep veins (femoral, popliteal), distal deep veins (posterior tibial, fibular, and muscular veins), and their perforating branches.
