Radiofrequency Ablation in Resectable Colorectal Lung Metastasis
Lung metastasectomy is the only therapeutic option to provide a long-survival in patients with colorectal lung metastases. Recent studies have shown that radiofrequency (RF) ablation is a safe and useful therapeutic option for the treatment of unresectable lung metastases. In this phase-II trial, clinical utility of lung RF ablation will be evaluated in patients with resectable colorectal lung metastases.
Lung Metastasis|Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: Lung radiofrequency ablation
Primary Outcome Measures:3-year survival, 3 years
Secondary Outcome measures:safety, change in respiratory function, cancer-specific survival, and local tumor progression, Radiological studies, 3 years
This will be a phase-II clinical trial.

Lung metastasectomy is the only therapeutic option to provide a long-survival in patients with colorectal lung metastases. Recent studies have shown that radiofrequency (RF) ablation is a safe and useful therapeutic option for the treatment of unresectable lung metastases. In this clinical trial, clinical utility of lung RF ablation will be evaluated.

Patients with resectable lung metastases will receive lung RF ablation.

All subjects will be followed for overall survival, safety, change in respiratory function, cancer-specific survival, and local tumor progression.
