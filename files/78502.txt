Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Grade Greater than or equals to (>=) 3 Related Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant, is considered or defined as an important medical event, or abnormal pregnancy outcomes., Up to approximately 3 years and 7 months
