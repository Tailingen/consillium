The Preoperative chemoradiotherapy with surgery is the standard treatment in NCCN guideline. But many patients refused or abandon radiotherapy because of the intolerable adverse effects. We designed a single-arm, open-label, phase II trial of pembrolizumab plus paclitaxel, cisplatin followed by Da Vinci robot radical surgery for locally advanced (stage III) esophageal squamous cell cancer. The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety.
