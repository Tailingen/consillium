CESAR Study in Prostate Cancer With Temsirolimus Added to Standard Docetaxel Therapy (CEPTAS)
In this Phase I study safety of the combination of Docetaxel and Temsirolimus needs to be shown before the study can be expanded into a Phase II study to examine the activity of a safe combination of Temsirolimus and Docetaxel in a comparison with Docetaxel alone.
Prostatic Neoplasms
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Temsirolimus
recommended dose, Phase I Part: Primary endpoint is the Recommended Dose (RD) for the Phase II Part chosen between the three DLs based on the dose escalation scheme., 10 months|disease progression-free survival, Phase II Part: Primary endpoint is to evaluate the activity of the addition of Temsirolimus to standard treatment on the disease progression-free survival (DPFS Chemotherapy) in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer receiving first-line Docetaxel chemotherapy., 24 months
safety as defined as occurence of treatment related adverse events, Phase I Part: Secondary endpoint is the collection of safety data on the dose levels used in this part., 10 months|overall response, Phase II Part: Responses of measurable disease (RECIST 1.1 criteria) including the overall response rate (RR, CFR+PR) and the disease control rate (PR+CR+SD). In addition to the overall response rate RR, the trial will also evaluate the number of responders based on PSA evaluation only (RR-PSA) and the number of responders based on RECIST evaluation only (RR-RECIST) among those who are evaluable by that criterion, respectively. RR is only evaluated for the chemotherapy part of the Phase II part of the trial., 24 months|1-year Disease-Progression Free Survival Rate, Phase II Part: 1-year Disease-Progression Free Survival Rate (DPFS-1yR); defined as the quotient defined exactly in the same way as DPFS-6mR with the landmark time point equal to 1 year, +/- 4 weeks for assessment one year after randomization., 24 months|DPFS time, Phase II Part: DPFS time measured as failure time between 1st randomization and disease progression or death whatever occurred first. Patients lost-to follow-up, dropping out (e.g. when withdrawing consent) or patients surviving progression free at the end-of-study time point are treated as censored cases., 24 months|TTP-PSA, Phase II Part: Time to PSA progression (TTP-PSA) measured from randomization until PSA progression as defined in Scher et al. "Decline from baseline: record time from start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir, and which is confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later (ie, a confirmed rising trend)†", 24 months|toxicity based on treatment-related toxicities using CTCAE v4.0, Phase II Part: Evaluation of toxicity using CTCAE v4.0, 24 months|PSA, Phase II Part: Proportion of patients with drop of PSA of \> 30% in the evaluation period compared to baseline compared to baseline., 24 months|quality of life, Phase II Part: Quality of life using the EORTC questionnaire, 24 months|overall survival, Phase II Part: overall survival (OS) measured from randomization until death or lost to follow up (censored survival time), 24 months|Frequency of medication for pain, Phase II Part: Frequency of medication for pain, 24 months
The purpose of this Phase I study is to evaluate feasibility of dose levels DL1, DL2 and DL3 (which are combinations of Temsirolimus and Docetaxel) and defining a recommended dose (RD) for the Phase II part using these dose levels in a dose escalating scheme.

Secondary objectives are the collection of safety data on the dose levels used in this part.
