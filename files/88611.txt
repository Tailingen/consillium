Phase II Study of TAS-109 to Treat Advanced Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate progression free survival primarily. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the antitumor activity, as assessed by objective tumor response, duration of clinical benefit, overall survival, and the safety profile of TAS-109
Advanced Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: TAS-109
Percentage of Progression Free Survival, The primary endpoint was percentage of progression free survival as defined by the percentage of patients without progressive disease(PD)or death, whichever came first, at 3 months of therapy., From date of randomization until date of the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 months.
Antitumor Activity, Per RECIST Criteria and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall response rate was defined as percentage of patients of CR plus PR in ITT population., From the date of initial treatment until the date of the first objective documentation of PD or death from any cause.|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the period from the date of first dose of TAS-109 to death date., From the initial treatment until 12 months after enrollment of the last patient.
