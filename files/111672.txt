A Clinical Gene Therapy Study with Hematopoietic Stem Cells for the Treatment, with Single Dose of Temferon, of Patients Suffering from Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
This is an open label, single-centre phase 1/2 study involving a single dose of Temferon, an investigational Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP), to treat patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with evidence of disease progression following at least two lines of standard of care (SoC) treatments.

GENETIC: Temferon|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Cabozantinib
Tolerability and safety of conditioning and Temferon, over the first 90 days following administration, as determined by the incidence of adverse events, To assess tolerability and safety of conditioning and Temferon over the first 90 days following Temferon administration, as evaluated by the incidence of \>=CTCAE Grade 2 adverse events., First 90 days|Biological activity of Temferon, over the first 90 days following administration, as determined by the presence of Temferon-derived progeny in the tumor (IFN gene signature), To assess the biological activity of Temferon in the tumor of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, over the first 90 days following Temferon administration, as determined by the change in IFN (interferon) gene signature in the tumor, First 90 days
Long term tolerability and safety of Temferon as determined by the incidence of adverse events up to 1 year following Temferon administration according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria, 1 year following Temferon administration|Incidence, severity and duration of adverse events of special interest as indicated on the study protocol, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Proportion of patients achieving hematological recovery by Day +30, Day 30|Overall response rate per RECIST version 1.1, Defined as the proportion of patients who achieved a complete or partial response as their best overall response, RECIST criteria used at Screening, Baseline, Day +72, Day +120, Day +180, Day +210, Day +270, Day +360 or at any time disease progression or a secondary malignancy is suspected|Disease control rate following Temferon infusion, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
During Part A (Phase 1) of the study, Temferon will be administered to up to 12 patients, who are going to be split into two cohorts according to immune checkpoint inhibitor -ICI- therapy received in the six months prior to entry into the study, with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic RCC and evidence of disease progression following at least two lines of SoC treatments.

At D+30 after Temferon, patients will start to receive pembrolizumab providing they have not received ICI in the 6 months prior to entry into the study. Patients allocated to pembrolizumab will receive pembrolizumab 400mg IV every 6 weeks commencing at D+30.

In the event that a patient has received ICI in the 6 months prior to study entry, they will be allocated to the cabozantinib arm. Patients allocated to cabozantinib, will initiate treatment with 40mg QD once PD occurs as assessed at D+30 or at subsequent visits.
