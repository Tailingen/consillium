Electro-acupuncture for the Prevention and Treatment of Oxaliplatin-induced Neurotoxicity in Colorectal Cancer Patients
In this study, a 24-week randomized, sham-controlled, single-blind, multicenter clinical trial will be conducted to explore the effect of electroacupuncture for prevention and treatment of both acute and chronic neurotoxicity through both clinical and biological indicators.

Score Changes on the FACT/GOG-Ntx questionnaire, The questionnaire includes 11 questions covering sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy, hearing neuropathy, and dysfunction associated with neuropathy, which results in a cumulative score ranging from 0 to 44, with the lower scores reflecting worse neuropathy symptoms., 0-24 weeks; weekly
numerical rating scale (NRS), Patients will be asked to rate their average neuropathy symptoms within one week, on an 0 to 10 scale (0=no symptoms; 10=worst possible symptoms), those \<4 of 10 NRS will be considered as mild neuropathy while â‰¥4 of 10 NRS will be considered as moderate to severe neuropathy., 0-24 weeks; weekly|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORCTC) quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30, A 30-items questionnaire assessing five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptoms scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), and other symptoms and problem in cancer patients (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhoea, and financial difficulties)., 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24 weeks|Constitution of Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ), CCMQ has 60 items measuring the 9 body constitution types: gentleness, Qi-deficiency, Yang-deficiency, Yin-deficiency, phlegm-wetness, wetness-heat, blood-stasis, Qi-depression, and special diathesis., 0,12,24 weeks|Vibration sense test, It will be assessed using the graduated Rydel-Seiffer tuning fork (U.S. Neurologicals, Poulsbo, WA), with printed directions for use and its normative data. Readings will be averaged and recorded as the vibration value., 0-12 week; weekly|Light touch test, It will be assessed with standard 10g monofilaments, contained within the Neuropen (Owen Mumford, Woodstock, UK). During testing, the fiber will be applied perpendicular to the plantar surface of the great toe and the palmar surface of the index finger until the fiber begins to bend and will be held in place for 1 second and then removed. This procedure will be repeated 3 times and the patient will be asked to report the ability to feel the fibe., 0-12 week; weekly|Short Form 12 item(version 2) Health Survey (SF-12V2), The SF-12V2 is a widely used generic HRQoL instrument, and its Chinese version has been validated and normed in the general Chinese population in Hong Kong. It consists of 12 questions measuring eight domains of health, including physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health. The scores are generated using an algorithm to generate a combined physical and mental health score for comparison with normative data. In the normative data: 1) the mean score was set to 50; 2) a score \> 50 indicated better physical or mental health than the mean; 3) a score \< 50 indicated worse physical or mental health than the mean., 0-12 week; weekly
This is a prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded and multiple center trial on electro-acupuncture for preventing and treating symptoms of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity in patients with colorectal cancer. A total of 150 candidates will be recruited in this study four weeks before chemotherapy for best preventive effect. They will be assigned randomly into either the electro-acupuncture or the sham-control group with 1:1 ratio. Both groups will receive a total of 24 sessions of interventions (4 weeks before chemotherapy and 8 weeks during chemotherapy, with 2 session per week), and will be followed up regularly for up to 12 weeks after completion of the acupuncture.
