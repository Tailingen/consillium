SABR-SCAN Trial for Pulmonary Oligometastases
Rationale:

SABR (Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy) is one of the standard treatment options besides surgical resection for limited lung metastases (oligometastases) from colorectal cancer. High efficacy in terms of local control of metastatic lesions treated has been shown. Nevertheless, the precise effect of SABR upon progression-free- and overall survival in these patients is unknown. To further evaluate and develop local treatment options in metastatic disease, more information is necessary regarding the impact upon - and the pattern of - disease progression of local treatment options such as SABR.

Objective:

To determine the effect upon progression free survival and upon tumorload relative to baseline, both at one year after randomisation of immediate SABR versus delayed SABR (a scan-and-personalise policy). Secondarily, patterns of progression, patient-reported symptoms and quality of life will be monitored.
