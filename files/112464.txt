Study of LM-108 as a Single Agent or in Combination With Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is a first-in-human, Phase I/II, open-label, multi-centre, dose escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary anti-tumour activity of LM-108 as a single agent or in combination with an anti-PD-1 mAb in subjects with solid tumours.
