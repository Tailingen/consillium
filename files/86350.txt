Higher scores for functioning scales and for the Global Health Status or Global HRQoL scales indicate a higher level of functioning and a better HRQoL respectively, whereas higher scores in symptom scales represent a higher level of symptoms., Baseline, up to 5 years|Change From Baseline in the Physical Functioning Domain of the EORTC QLQ-C30, The EORTC-QLQ-C30) is a multi-item questionnaire measuring the following content five (5) multi-item functional scales, three (3) multi-item symptom scales, one (1) global health status scale, and one (1) global health-related quality of life (HRQoL) each scale is measured from 0 to 100 after a linear transformation. Higher scores for functioning scales and for the Global Health Status or Global HRQoL scales indicate a higher level of functioning and a better HRQoL respectively, whereas higher scores in symptom scales represent a higher level of symptoms., Baseline, up to 5 years|Change From Baseline in the Global Health Status Quality of Life Scale of the Low Grade Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma-20 (NHL-LG20), The NHL-LG20 is is a 20-item supplement questionnaire that was specifically developed to assess HRQoL in participants with low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas (such as follicular lymphoma). The NHL-LG20 includes multi-item scales of symptom burden, physical condition/fatigue, worries/fears on health and functioning, and emotional impact; and is administered in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ-C30. Each scale is measured from 0 to 100 after a linear transformation. Higher scores for functional scales and for the global health status or global HRQoL scales indicate a higher level of functioning and a better HRQoL, whereas higher scores in symptom scales represent a higher level of symptoms., Baseline, up to 5 years|Change From Baseline in the Physical Functioning Domain of the NHL-LG20, The NHL-LG20 is is a 20-item supplement questionnaire that was specifically developed to assess HRQoL in participants with low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas (such as follicular lymphoma).

Higher scores for functional scales and for the global health status or global HRQoL scales indicate a higher level of functioning and a better HRQoL, whereas higher scores in symptom scales represent a higher level of symptoms., Baseline, up to 5 years|Changes From Baseline in the European Quality of Life Five Dimensions Five Levels Scale (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value. The EQ-5D-5L comprises 2 components: a questionnaire covering 5 dimensions and a tariff of values based upon direct valuations of health states using a visual analog scale (VAS). Rating gets recorded on a vertical VAS in which the endpoints are labeled best imaginable health state is 100 (on the top) and worst imaginable health state is 0 (on the bottom). Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health., Baseline, up to 5 years|Changes From Baseline in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Scores, The EQ-5D-5L VAS is a 20-cm VAS for recording self-rated current HRQoL state and is used to describe the participants health status on the day of the assessment. The EQ-5D-5L VAS score is recorded by each participant for his or her current HRQoL state and scored 0 ("the worst health you can imagine") to 100 ("the best health you can imagine"). Higher scores indicate better health., Baseline, up to 5 years
Five years after the last study participant is randomized, participants who have received axicabtagene ciloleucel will transition to a separate Long-term Follow-up study (study KT-US-982-5968) to complete the remainder of the 15-year follow-up assessments.
