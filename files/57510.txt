Collection of Cerebrospinal Fluid and Tumor Tissue in Subjects With Metastatic Melanoma and Controls
This study has two ultimate goals:

1. Understand how the original melanoma from the skin spreads to the CNS. In order to study this we need to collect (and compare) the original skin melanoma, the CNS melanoma, as well as any other melanoma that has not metastasized to the CNS.
2. Develop a diagnostic blood test that will early identify subjects at high risk for developing CNS metastasis or patients who may already have CNS metastasis but the MRI or the CAT scan cannot yet detect it. Thus, the investigators plan to collect CSF from subjects like you who have melanoma CNS metastases in order to confirm the presence of this biomarker.
