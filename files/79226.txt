Volatil Organic Compounds in Exhaled Air and Sweat After Thoracic Surgery for Carcinological Resection
Bronchopulmonary cancer, with 39 000 new cases and 30 000 deaths per year, is a main issue in public health in France. It is the leading cause of cancer death in France. A lot of progress in medical care has been made, but surgery remains the most effective treatment, when it is still possible. The goal is to detect and manage the lung cancer as early as possible. Alongside screening strategies by annual thoracic scanner, new approaches with innovative technologies open up for cancer detection and therapeutic follow-up.

The study of volatile organic compounds (VOC) detected in exhaled air or in sweat, is an innovative research area for respiratory diseases. The volatolomic analysis can be done either by the technique of the mass spectrometry which allows the identification of each VOC in the exhaled air or by the technique of electronic nose, simpler and faster, which provides an idea of the general profile of the VOC without identifying them. The VOC have shown their interest in some situations, such as diagnostic or prognostic tool in patients followed for thoracic tumorous pathology or bronchial or pulmonary vascular diseases.

The composition of VOC in exhaled air and sweat is altered in patients with lung cancer. The VOC analysis and their variation could be used particularly in the follow-up of patients treated for lung cancer.

The purpose of this clinical research is to identify the VOCs related to lung cancers by comparing the VOC profiles in exhaled air and in sweat from patients diagnosed with localized lung cancer before and after resection surgery.
