Dynasplint Therapy for Trismus in Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the use of the Dynasplint Trismus System to routine trismus treatment in improving the ability of opening the mouth in a randomized trial. This study will also determine what effects, good and/or bad, this procedure has on the participant. Participants will be randomly assigned to the Dynasplint Trismus System or to routine treatment with tongue depressors.
Trismus
DEVICE: Dynasplint Trismus System|OTHER: Tongue Depressors
Number of Participants Demonstrating Improved MIO Using Either the Dynapslint System or Tongue Depressors, Number of participants who demonstrated improved maximal incisial opening (MIO), the distance from the tips of the upper and lower incisors on maximal effort. Successful improvement is defined as \> 5mm improvement from the baseline measurement., 12 months
This trial is a single-institution, randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of the Dynasplint Trismus System (DTS) for patients with trismus. Improvement of mouth opening and quality of life of participants using DTS will be compared to improvement of mouth opening and quality of life of participants using standard therapy. Standard therapy will be the use of tongue depressors. Crossover from standard therapy to DTS will be implemented if at three months there is no improvement in mouth opening when using tongue depressors.
