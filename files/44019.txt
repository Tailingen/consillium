Multi-omics Model for Pancreatic Cancer Screening Using cfDNA
This is a prospective case-control study, aiming at developing a cell free DNA (cfDNA) multi-omics precise diagnostic model for screening of pancreatic cancer.

Performance of cfDNA multi-omics model for discriminating patients with pancreatic cancer and precancerous lesions versus healthy individuals., Sensitivity of cfDNA multi-omics model at specificity of 95% for discriminating patients with pancreatic cancer and precancerous lesions versus healthy individuals., 12 months|Performance of cfDNA multi-omics model for discriminating precancerous lesions versus healthy individuals., Sensitivity of cfDNA multi-omics model for discriminating precancerous lesions versus healthy individuals., 12 months|Performance of pre-defined model in clinical sub-groups of interest., Sensitivity of cfDNA multi-omics model for pancreatic cancer at different stages or in different pathological subtypes., 12 months
Peripheral blood samples from participants with new diagnosis of pancreatic cancers, precancerous lesions and healthy individuals will be collected to characterize the cancer-specific signatures by low-pass whole-genome sequencing and target methylation sequencing using cfDNA. An ensemble multi-omics model will be trained aided by machine learning algorithm and validated in test set. The performance of this multi-omics model distinguishing pancreatic cancer from non-cancer will be evaluated.
