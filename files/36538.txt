Efficacy and Safety of Maintenance Apatinib Combined With Pemetrexed in Advanced Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
Lung cancer is a malignant tumor that causes the highest morbidity and mortality, and the main pathological type is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most of them present with advanced stage at diagnosis. This design is to study maintenance therapy with pemetrexed plus apatinib after first line induction therapy four cycles for advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. XQonc-0007
