STK-012 Monotherapy and in Combination Therapy in Patients With Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, phase 1a/1b, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation study of STK-012 as monotherapy and in combination therapy in patients with selected advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Malignant Melanoma|Renal Cell Carcinoma|Cervical Cancer|Microsatellite Instability High|Gastric Cancer|GastroEsophageal Cancer|Urothelial Carcinoma|Mismatch Repair Deficiency
DRUG: STK-012|DRUG: pembrolizumab|DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: carboplatin
Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Incidence of adverse events (AEs) meeting protocol defined DLT criteria and determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the RP2D of STK-012 as a single agent and in combination therapy, 1 cycle (21 days)|Adverse events, Assess the safety and tolerability of STK-012 as monotherapy and in combination therapy by review of AEs including treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation, and adverse events resulting in death., From 1st dose of STK-012 through 90 days after last dose of STK-012
Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed CR or confirmed PR, based on RECIST Version 1.1 after STK-012 administration as monotherapy and in combination therapy, Up to 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment with STK-012 until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first after STK-012 administration as monotherapy and in combination therapy, Up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment with STK-012 until death due to any cause after STK-012 administration as monotherapy and in combination therapy, Up to 24 months|Area under the curve (AUC) of STK-012, The AUC of STK-012 will be measured at different timepoints after STK-012 administration as monotherapy and in combination therapy, From 1st dose of STK-012 through 30 days after last dose of STK-012|Maximum concentration (Cmax) of STK-012, The Cmax of STK-012 will be measured at different timepoints after STK-012 administration as monotherapy and in combination therapy, From 1st dose of STK-012 through 30 days after last dose of STK-012|Time of maximum concentration (Tmax) of STK-012, The Tmax of STK-012 will be measured at different timepoints after STK-012 administration as monotherapy and in combination therapy, From 1st dose of STK-012 through 30 days after last dose of STK-012|Half-life (T1/2) of STK-012, The T1/2 of STK-012 will be measured at different timepoints after STK-012 administration as monotherapy and in combination therapy, From 1st dose of STK-012 through 30 days after last dose of STK-012|Immunogenicity, The immunogenicity of STK-012 will be assessed by summarizing the number of patients who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) at different timepoints after STK-012 administration as monotherapy and in combination therapy, From 1st dose of STK-012 through 30 days after last dose of STK-012
The phase 1a portion of the study is a dose escalation design to evaluate STK-012 as monotherapy and in combination therapy in patients with selected solid tumors. The phase 1b portion of the study includes dose expansions to evaluate STK-012 as monotherapy and in combination therapy at the candidate recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in selected solid tumor types.
