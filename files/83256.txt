Effectiveness of an N-acetylcysteine and Urea-based Cream in Prevention of Capecitabine-induced HAND-foot Syndrome in Breast Cancer Patients
Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequent tumour in women. To date, among the available treatments, the use of Capecitabine, an oral prodrug of fluorouracil, has been shown activity in different setting. In advanced disease, Capecitabine is often used as monotherapy in patients pretreated with anthracycline, taxane or both.

One of the most frequent toxicities reported by patients receiving capecitabine is hand-foot syndrome (HFS), with an incidence of grade 3 HFS of 28%. HFS, also known as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, is initially characterized by palmoplantar numbness, tingling, or burning pain. These symptoms usually coincide with sharply demarcated erythema with or without edema, cracking, or desquamation. In advanced stages, blistering and ulceration may occur. Although HFS is not considered life threatening, it can be painful and interfere with daily activities, thusseriously compromising quality of life (QoL), therefore this toxicity is considered dose limiting.Moreover, consistent with the theory that Capecitabine and its metabolites induce an inflammatory effect, the use of COX-2 inhibitors is an emerging strategies, but more evidence are needed from largest study to confirm their efficacy.

Similarly, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, mucolytic and nephroprotective agent, that affects pathways involved in inflammatory conditions and that has demonstrated to be effective in several dermatologic conditions, could be useful in the management of Capecitabine-induced HFS.

From this arises the present study that has the objective of evaluating the role of NAC plus urea-based cream in the prevention of Capecitabineinduced HFS in patient affected by breast cancer.
