PAZOFOS: Phase Ib and Phase II Trial of Pazopanib +/- Fosbretabulin in Advanced Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
The first part of this study is to find the recommended dosages of a combination of two drugs: pazopanib and fosbretabulin, which will be given to female patients with relapsed ovarian cancer.

The second part of the study involves comparing the recommended dose of pazopanib and fosbretabulin in combination against pazopanib alone in female patients with relapsed ovarian cancer to determine whether the combination is more beneficial that pazopanib on it's own.
Ovarian Neoplasms|Neoplasms, Ovarian|Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Pazopanib|DRUG: Fosbretabulin
Phase Ib: Dose Limiting Toxicities of Dose of Pazopanib and Fosbretabulin, To determine the dose of Pazopanib and Fosbretabulin in combination by recording Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) at each cohort level as categorised by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Assessment of toxicity will take place over the 4-week period that constitutes one cycle, 4 weeks after starting treatment (1 cycle)|Phase II: Progressive disease, To determine whether fosbretabulin and pazopanib in combination improves progression free survival compared to pazopanib alone measured by RECIST

Computed Tomography (CT) scans are taken every 8 weeks for the first 6 cycles and evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria.

After 6 cycles of fosbretabulin and pazopanib patients will receive pazopanib alone and CT scans will be undertaken every 3 months (12 weeks)., Progressive disease (average of 4 months from start of treatment) measured by RECIST
Phase I: Biomarker changes on a cohort-by cohort basis, Circulating markers of angiogenesis: VEGFA (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor), VEGFR2, Ang1 (Angiopoietin), Ang2 and Tie (Tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains) 2 will be measured from samples taken pre-treatment and during cycle 1 of treatment, Samples taken within the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of drug and during first cycle (weeks 2 and 3) and then at progressive disease (average of 4 months from start of treatment)|Phase Ib and Phase II: Safety and Toxicity profile of Pazopanib and Fosbretabulin in combination, The Phase Ib component is estimated to last approximately 9 months with the total duration of the trial expected to last 45 months. All adverse events will be recorded and categorised by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)

Patients will receive up to six cycles of fosbretabulin and pazopanib after which treatment will be continued with pazopanib alone until progressive disease. It is estimated each patient will be on the trial for approximately 4 months., Adverse Events recorded within the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of drug is administered and during the first 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle of treatment for 6 cycles, then every month until progressive disease (average of 4 months from start of treatment)|Phase II: Biomarker signature for Progression Free Survival, To investigate whether the pre-treatment biomarker signature can predict which patients have a response and a longer progression free survival

Circulating markers of angiogenesis: VEGFA, VEGFR2, Ang1, Ang2 and Tie 2 will be measured by ELISA and compared to progression free survival data, Samples taken within the 4 weeks prior to first dose of drug|Phase II: Response rates by RECIST and GCIG CA-125 criteria, The response rate in the pazopanib and combination arms according to RECIST and Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) criteria

CT scans every every 8 weeks for the first 6 cycles then every 3 months until progressive disease (average of 4 months from start of treatment). CA125 taken twice per cycle for first 6 and then every month until progressive disease, Progressive disease (average of 4 months from start of treatment) measured by RECIST and CA125 biomarkers|Phase II: Biomarker response in combination arm, To investigate whether biomarkers can demonstrate additivity of the combination in comparison with single agent pazopanib

Circulating markers of angiogenesis: VEGFA, VEGFR2, Ang1, Ang2 and Tie 2 will be measured from samples taken pre-treatment and during cycle 1 of treatment and at progression.

Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (CEPCs) from these samples will be counted., Samples taken within the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of drug, Cycle 1 (weeks 2 and 3) and at progression (average of 4 months from start of treatment)
Ovarian cancer is the fourth biggest contributor to female cancer mortality, accounting for 4% of all malignancies diagnosed in women. In the United Kingdom (UK), there are seven thousand new cases of ovarian cancer annually and four thousand two hundred deaths from the disease. The standard treatment approach currently consists of surgical debulking and chemotherapy, usually based around a combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. Most ovarian cancers are initially chemo-responsive however the majority of patients whose disease initially responds subsequently develop recurrent disease.

Once patients recur, treatment options become less numerous and less effective. Progression free survival rates for platinum-sensitive disease are only about 13 months and the outlook for patients with platinum-resistant disease is much worse.

This study is exploring a new combination of drugs fosbretabulin, a vascular disrupting agent and pazopanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. There is scientific rational for combining these two types of drugs as they should be able to work in combination through contrasting mechanisms of action.

The first part of the study is a dose finding exercise with cohorts of patients being given drugs with in combination until the recommended dose of both drugs is found. Patients in each cohort will be monitored closely for safety and drug toxicity.

The second part of the study has a randomised component where patients will receive the combination of drugs or pazopanib alone with the aim to determine whether there is an advantage in progression free survival for patients that receive pazopanib and fosbretabulin. This will be monitored by RECIST.
