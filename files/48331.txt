A Study to Determine the Safety of BTP-114 for Treatment in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors With BRCA Mutations
This is a phase 1, Open-label, multicenter Dose Escalation study of BTP-114, a novel platinum product, in patients with advanced solid tumors and BRCA or other DNA repair mutation. This clinical study is comprised of 2 sequential parts: Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Expansion). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and the anti-cancer activity of BTP-114.

Part 1 - Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BTP-114 determined during the dose escalation phase of study based on number of patients experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity., From the date of the first dose up to approximately 52 weeks.|Part 1 - Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of BTP-114 based on the MTD, review of adverse event data and review of AUC, Tmax and t1/2 obtained from PK data during the dose escalation phase of the study., From the date of the first dose up to approximately 52 weeks.|Part 1 - Number of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.3 during the study., From the date of first dose up to approximately 52 weeks.|Part 2 - Proportion of patients with an objective response (ORR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1 or the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria., From the date of the first dose to documented disease progression assessed up to approximately 52 weeks.|Part 2 - Proportion of patients whose disease is controlled (DCR) using RECIST, Version 1.1 or PCWG2 criteria., From the date of the first dose to documented disease progression assessed up to approximately 52 weeks.|Part 2 - Duration of response (DOR) measured from the date of first CR or PR until the first date of progressive disease or death from any cause., Assessed up to approximately 52 weeks.|Part 2 - Progression-free survival (PFS) measured as the time from the date of initiation of BTP-114 treatment to the documented disease progression (PD) or death from any cause., Assessed up to approximately 52 weeks.
Part 1 - Proportion of patients with an objective response (ORR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1 or the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria., From the date of the first dose to documented disease progression assessed up to approximately 52 weeks.|Part 1 - Proportion of patients whose disease is controlled (DCR) using RECIST, Version 1.1 or PCWG2 criteria., From the date of the first dose to documented disease progression assessed up to approximately 52 weeks.|Part 1 - Duration of response (DOR) measured from the date of first CR or PR until the first date of progressive disease or death from any cause., Assessed up to approximately 52 weeks.|Part 1 - Progression-free survival (PFS) measured as the time from the date of initiation of BTP-114 treatment to the documented disease progression (PD) or death from any cause., Assessed up to approximately 52 weeks.|Part 1 - Plasma Pharmacokinetics (PK) estimates of platinum concentration, Area under plasma Concentration (AUC) 0 to t., Time points on Day 1, Day 3 or Day 4, Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of subsequent cycles.|Part 1 - Plasma Pharmacokinetics (PK) estimates of platinum concentration, time of Maximum concentration (Tmax)., Time points on Day 1, Day 3 or Day 4, Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of subsequent cycles.|Part 1 - Plasma Pharmacokinetics (PK) estimates of platinum concentration Half-life (T1/2)., Time points on Day 1, Day 3 or Day 4, Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of subsequent cycles
