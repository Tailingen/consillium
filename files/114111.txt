A Phase II Combined Modality Protocol of Debulking Surgery With HIPEC Followed by Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Recurrent Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal & Fallopian Tube Cancers
The primary objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility, tolerability and safety of surgical debulking and resection with heated intraoperative chemotherapy (HIPEC) followed by repeated intraperitoneal chemotherapy for treatment of recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopian tube carcinomas.
Recurrent Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer
DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Doxorubicin
Adverse Event Rate and/or Laboratory Changes, The adverse event rate and laboratory changes will be used to investigate the safety of surgical debulking with heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) combined with repeated intraperitoneal chemotherapy., 5 years|Toxicity Rating Based on NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, Patients will be rated for toxicity prior to each cycle using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (NCICTC; see the CTCAE, Version 4.0)., Up to 5 years
Time to Serum Ca-125 Nadir and/or CT Response (RECIST Criteria), Efficacy of surgical resection with HIPEC combined with repeated intraperitoneal chemotherapy: The end point will be the objective response rate and progression-free survival as well as the overall survival, if feasible. We will analyze the time to serum Ca 125 nadir and/or CT response based on Recist criteria., Up to 5 years (survival)|Kaplan-Meier Curves for Patient Overall Survival, Kaplan-Meier analysis will be done using PROC LIFETEST in Statistical Application Software (SAS)., Up to 5 years, survival
This is a phase II , open label, single center study of surgery followed by heated intraoperative cisplatin in patients with recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers. Approximately twenty patients will receive surgery and intraoperative (hyperthermic) cisplatin followed by four consecutive courses of outpatient intraperitoneal cisplatin and doxorubicin given on days 1 and 8 during a 3 week cycle.
