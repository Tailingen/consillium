Dose-finding Adaptive Phase I/IIa Study to Assess Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of IPP-204106N on Advanced Solid Tumors
The experimental plan will consist in:

The dose-finding Bayesian adaptive phase I portion of the study is designed to determine the optimal and recommended dose of IPP-204106N using a Bayesian "with memory" design with combined toxicity and pharmacokinetic endpoints to determine doses for successive cohorts of three patients. The Bayesian methodology allows updating information as the trial progresses and stopping the trial as soon as the information obtained is deemed to be sufficient. Preclinical toxicokinetic studies of N6L and IPP-204106N in dogs and the first phase I clinical trial with N6L will be used to inform the prior distribution in the present study.

The decisional part, according to the results of the phase I portion of the study, will define the optimal dose recommended for the phase IIa portion of the study.

The phase IIa portion of the study will confirm the optimal dose, and is designed to evaluate the safety and the preliminary efficacy of IPP-204106N in an expanded patient population treated at the recommended dose of IPP-204106N.
All Solid Tumors
DRUG: Drug
Recommended optimal dose of intravenous IPP-204106N administered for at least 5 consecutive days., Toxicity assessed during cycle 1 (until day 12): number of patients experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) according to the NCI-CTCAE (v 4.0, May 2009), defined as:

* Hematological drug-related toxicity: grade 4 neutropenia ≥7 days, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia with hemorrhage/bleeding, and febrile neutropenia.
* Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea grade ≥3 despite optimal treatment.
* Any other drug-related biological or clinical grade ≥3 toxicity.

Plasma exposure assessed during cycle 1 (on day 1): number of patients reaching targeted plasma drug exposure, i.e. plasma N6L concentration ≥5 µM for at least two hours. This concentration corresponds to active concentration in vitro in human tumor cell lines., up to 18 months
Overall safety of IPP-204106N., number of participants with DLT, up to 18 months|tumor response rate, Each patient's best objective response will be determined. The categories for best objective response are CR, PR, SD, PD or NE., up to 24 months|Time to progression (TTP) of IPP-204106N at the recommended dose., Analysis of time to progression (TTP) will be performed using in the ITT population using non-parametric method of Kaplan Meier and survival curves (PROC LIFETEST with SAS® software)., up to 15 months|genomic and proteomic tumor biomarkers identification, Genomic and/or proteomic biomarkers analyses may be performed as exploratory analyses, to identify the patients who, based on their individual tumor signature, will be most likely to respond and benefit from IPP-204106N therapy, and will be detailed in a further statistical analysis plan., up to 15 months|tumor response duration of objective responses, The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study)., up to 15 months|tumor response duration of stabilizations., Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest summon study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD)., up to 15 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) of IPP-204106N at the recommended dose., Analysis of progression-free survival (PFS) will be performed using in the ITT population using non-parametric method of Kaplan Meier and survival curves., up to 15 months|To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of IPP-204106N during the dose-escalation phase of the study., up to 18 months|to evaluate the tumor growth rate (GR), The tumor GR analyses may be performed as exploratory analyses, up to 24 months|To evaluate the early metabolic effects of IPP-204106N as measured by 18FDG-PET CT, up to 24 months
