QUILT 2.023: A Study of N-803 in Combination With Current Standard of Care vs Standard of Care as First-Line Treatment for Patients With Stage 3 or 4 NSCLC.
This is a phase 3, open-label, 4-cohort study (3 randomized cohorts and 1 single-arm cohort). Participants enrolled in each cohort will be treated as detailed below. Each study cohort will be analyzed separately. Treatment will continue for up to 2 years, or until the patient experiences confirmed progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity, withdraws consent, or if the investigator feels that it is no longer in the patient's best interest to continue treatment. Patients will be followed for disease progression, post-therapies, and survival through 24 months after the first dose of study drug.

Participant enrollment will only occur for Cohort D. Cohort D will evaluate the efficacy and safety of N-803 in combination with chemoimmunotherapy containing approved CPIs (nivolumab plus ipilimumab) as first-line treatment for participants with stage III or IV squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC.
