MASCT-I in Patients With Metastatic or Recurrent Solid Tumors Who Failed Standard Therapy.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MASCT-I in patients with metastatic or recurrent solid tumors who failed standard therapy.
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: MASCT-I injection
Adverse events and serious adverse events related to MASCT-I, Assessed by CTCAE V5.0, 8 weeks
Adverse events and serious adverse events related to MASCT-I, All adverse events and serious adverse events related to MASCT-I during the study, 2 years|Immune response to tumor-associated antigens, Measured by enzyme linked immunospot assay, 2 years|Concentration of Cytokines (IFNγ、IL2、IL4、IL6、IL10 and TNF), Measured by flow cytometry or other methods, 2 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The length of time from enrollment until the time of progression of disease, 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of patients with PR and CR in the total number of patients., 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate is defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) based on RESIST v1.1 criteria, 2 years
The study is divided into two stages. The first stage is divided into two groups, both of which adopted 3+3 design. The first group is given MASCT-I by administration method 1, and the second group is given by method 2. One of the administration method will be used in the second stage according to DLT and adverse events found in the first stage.
