OPTIMOX-aflibercept as First-line Therapy in Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Evaluation of feasibility of adding aflibercept to an oxaliplatin-based regimen rather than a continuous administration of chemotherapy until progression, in order to decrease the risk of severe toxicities.
Unresectable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: aflibercept
Progression free survival at 6 months, time interval from inclusion to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Assessed at 6 months.
Median Progression Free Survival, time interval from inclusion to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Assessed up to 3 years after the beginning of the study|duration of disease control (DDC), DDC excludes:

* Intervals between disease progression and re-initiation of treatment,
* PFS of inactive treatment if PD occurs at first evaluation after treatment re-initiation, sum of PFS of each active treatment course. Assessed up to 3 years after the beginning of the study|Overall Survival, time interval from inclusion to the date of death from any cause. Assessed up to 3 years after the beginning of the study.|tumor Response Rate (RR), assessed using RECIST version 1.1 per sequence of therapy., Assessed every 2 months during treatment period (- Estimated treatment duration per patient : 16 months).|Health related Quality of life, EORTC QLQ C-30, Assessed from study entry to 1 month after last study drug administration and up to 3 years after the beginning of the study.|Safety, The study will take into account all adverse events observed during and after drug administration, with a particular interest for:

* Any AE
* Any AE related to study treatment
* Any serious AE
* Any serious AE related to study treatment
* Any NCI-CTC grade 3 or 4 AE
* Any NCI-CTC grade 3 or 4 AE related to study treatment
* Any AE causing discontinuation of study treatment
* Any AE causing discontinuation of selected treatment only
* Any AE related to study treatment causing discontinuation
* Any AE causing a dose reduction of study medication
* Any AE leading to death
* Any AE related to study treatment leading to death., Assessed from study entry to 1 month after last study drug administration, assessed up to 3 years after the beginning of the study|Curative salvage surgery, The number of patient with R0 and R1 curative salvage surgery will be assessed globally and per sequence of therapy., assessed up to 3 years after the beginning of the study
The addition of aflibercept to the standard FOLFIRI regimen as second-line therapy was evaluated in a large phase III study (EFC10262-VELOUR). This new combination significantly improved both PFS (4.7 to 6.9 months, HR=0.76; P=.00007) and OS (12.1 to 13.5 months, HR=0.82; P=.0032). In the evaluable population (86.5%), the tumor response rate was also improved when adding aflibercept (ORR=19.8% \[16.4-23.2\]) to the FOLFIRI regimen (ORR=11.1% \[8.5-13.8\]).

This trial will evaluate the feasibility of adding aflibercept to an oxaliplatin-based regimen as a first-line therapy , using the OPTIMOX strategy rather than a continuous administration of chemotherapy until progression, in order to decrease the risk of severe toxicities.
