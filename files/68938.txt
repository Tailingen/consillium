Combining Sodium Valproate With Standard-of-care EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) Monoclonal Antibody Treatment in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of combining the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor sodium valproate (VPA) with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (panitumumab or cetuximab) maintenance in the first-line treatment of patients with RAS wild type metastatic CRC.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Sodium Valproate|DRUG: Panitumumab|DRUG: Cetuximab
Progression free survival, Progression free survival (PFS) will be defined as the interval from date of registration or randomisation to the date of first evidence of disease progression (measured by RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death whichever occurs first, in each treatment arm., 12 Months from randomisation
Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the interval from date of registration or randomisation to date of death from any cause., 12 Months from randomisation|Objective response rates (ORRs), ORRs will be calculated as the proportion of participants in each arm who are assessed as having a complete or partial response measured by RECIST v1.1., 12 Months from randomisation|Quantification of the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events according to CTCAE V5.0, Safety of each treatment arm will be assessed by evaluating the number and severity (grade) of adverse events reported according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0)., 12 Months from randomisation
Health-related quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will be determined by the global and subscale scores outlined in the EORTC user manual and scoring guidelines. Scores are from 0-100, with higher scores indicating better quality of life., 12 Months from randomisation|Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D-5L will be used to derive utility scores suitable for quality adjusted survival analyses. The scale has five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), each of which are scored at one of five levels ranging from no problems to extreme problems., 12 Months from radomisation|Quantification of histone acetylation levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), Exploratory analysis detecting changes in levels of histone acetylation in PBMCs during treatment, 12 Months from radomisation|Quantification of total circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), Exploratory analysis detecting the levels of ctDNA during treatment, 12 Months from radomisation
The primary objective is to evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in patients with RAS wild type metastatic CRC treated in the first-line with VPA plus panitumumab or cetuximab maintenance, or panitumumab or cetuximab maintenance alone.

The secondary objectives are (i) to evaluate overall survival (OS) and objective response rates (ORRs; RECIST v 1.1) in patients with RAS wild type metastatic CRC treated in the first-line with VPA plus panitumumab or cetuximab maintenance, and panitumumab or cetuximab maintenance alone; and (ii) to evaluate the safety (NCI CTCAE v5.0) of first-line maintenance treatment with VPA plus panitumumab or cetuximab, and panitumumab or cetuximab maintenance alone in patients with RAS wild type metastatic CRC.

The tertiary and exploratory objectives are:

* To evaluate Health-Related Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L) in patients with RAS wild type metastatic CRC treated in the first-line with VPA plus panitumumab or cetuximab maintenance, and panitumumab or cetuximab maintenance alone.
* Exploratory analyses including, but not limited to:

  (i) Determining whether changes in levels of histone acetylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are associated with improved efficacy with VPA plus anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody maintenance treatment; and (ii) determining whether potential resistance-conferring mutations in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) are associated with efficacy outcomes in patients treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody maintenance.
