Gemcitabine/Oxaliplatin and Photodynamic Therapy in Cholangiocarcinoma
In patients with cholangiocarcinoma therapeutic effects have been reported for Gemcitabine/Oxaliplatin. Furthermore, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has significantly improved patients survival in two randomised trials. PDT induces tumor necrosis only in an area of few millimetres, while tumor parts which are located beyond this area remain untreated. An additive effect could result from PDT as a local therapy in combination with systemic chemotherapy.
Cholangiocarcinoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin, Photodynamic therapy (PhotosanÂ®)
Progression free survival 6 months after study start, 6 months after study start
Progression free survival 12 months after study start Progression free interval Overall survival Life quality, Until 12 months after study start
Patients entered in the study receive a sequential therapy consisted of photodynamic therapy followed by systemic chemotherapy (Gemcitabine/Oxaliplatin) 4 weeks later. Systemic chemotherapy every 2 weeks is scheduled 9 times in each cycle. Thereafter, another cycle of PDT followed by chemotherapy is intended.
