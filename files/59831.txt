Efficacy and Safety of Osimertinib for HK Chinese With Metastatic T790M Mutated NSCLC-real World Setting.
To assess the efficacy of single-agent osimertinib in relation to EGFR T790M mutant allele fraction (AF) in a real-world setting.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib
Association between T790M mutant status and overal survival, To assess the association of EGFR T790M mutant allele fraction (AF) level with the overall survival (OS) of subjects with advanced/metastatic EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC treated with osimertinib, Followed up to 2 years after last patient in

This study will assess the efficacy and safety of single-agent osimertinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC within the context of the early access program in Hong Kong. In particular, osimertinib treatment efficacy will be assessed in the context of the relationship between EGFR T790M mutant AF and survival outcomes, particularly overall survival. In a real-world setting, analysis of overall survival benefit is considered less sensitive to differences in healthcare systems and standards. Other clinical outcomes including response rate (based on physician's judgement) and time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) will be examined. This study will also describe current practice for molecular testing and EGFR mutation profiles in this patient population.
