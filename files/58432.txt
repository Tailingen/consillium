Altered Tumor Oxygenation by Metformin, a Potential Step in Overcoming Radiotherapy Resistance in LACC
Poor tumor oxygenation (hypoxia) is an established negative prognostic and predictive factor in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). Hypoxia-modifying measures implemented in the clinic are lacking.

Metformin is a well-known, well-tolerated and low-cost drug used for decades in the treatment of type 2- diabetes. Recent studies suggest an improved tumor oxygenation by metformin potentially improving radiotherapy response and patient outcome.

This study is a randomized, phase II, open label study in patients with LACC where patients are randomized to standard cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy +/- Metformin.

Metformin will be started one week prior to the start of chemoradiotherapy, and will be continued throughout the entire radiation treatment.

Tumor oxygenation will be evaluated by gene signatures and MRI- parameters.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: Metformin|DRUG: Cisplatin
Metformin dependent changes in hypoxia-related gene expression., * A hypoxia related 6-gene expression signature analyzed by RNA-sequencing will be obtained before and after one week of metformin
* The signature consist of the following six genes: ERO1A, DDIT3, KCTD11, P4HA2, STC2, UPK1A, baseline and one week
Metformin dependent changes in MRI-parameters., * Diffusion-weighted MRI and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI will be obtained before and after one week of metformin.
* Hypoxic tumor fraction on MRI will be calculated using the combined information from DWI- and DCE-MRI, baseline and one week|Metformin dependent change in acute toxicity, - Physician-reported acute toxicity will be assessed with validated questionnaires (CTCAE version 3 and 4)., baseline, 4 weeks, end of treatment (about 7 weeks), 3 month follow-up|Metformin dependent change in tumor volume during treatment, - Tumor volume will be measured on T2W-MRI before the start of treatment and at the first fraction of brachytherapy, Baseline and about 4 weeks
