Neoadjuvant Adebrelimab + DOS in Locally Advanced Resectable Gastric Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adebrelimab combined DOS in neoadjuvant treatment of locally advanced resectable gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Adebrelimab combined with DOS
Pathological complete response rate（pCR）, Pathological complete response rate according to Becker standard, 7 days after surgery
Major pathologic response (MPR), MPR is defined as less than 10% residual viable tumor after neoadjuvant therapy., 7 days after surgery|Disease-free survival（DFS）, The length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer, Long term follow-up will continue until the death of the subject or the end of the study, at least three years|R0 resection rate, Proportion of R0 level surgery performed., postoperative 6 hours|Overall Survival（OS）, Overall survival (OS) refers to the time that researchers evaluate from recording the first chemotherapy to death (of any cause)., Long term follow-up will continue until the death of the subject or the end of the study, at least three years|Objective response rate（ORR）, Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) using Investigator assessments, is defined as the number (%) of patients with response of Complete Response or Partial Response., 7 days before surgery|Event-free survival（EFS）, The length of time after primary treatment for a cancer ends that the patient remains free of certain complications or events that the treatment was intended to prevent or delay., Preoperative progression, postoperative recurrence, and death from any cause|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Adverse reactions to chemotherapy and immunotherapy were graded according to the NCI-CTCAE4.0 grading criteria, Long term follow-up will continue until the death of the subject or the end of the study, at least three years
This prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical trial aims to enroll 42 treatment-naïve patients diagnosed with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma who are deemed operable. Following informed consent, patients will undergo screening to confirm eligibility. Subsequently, eligible participants will receive the standard dosage of Adebrelimab in combination with the DOS regimen for three cycles as neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgery. Within 3-6 weeks after completing the third cycle, preoperative imaging will be conducted to assess the efficacy of the novel neoadjuvant treatment and feasibility of achieving radical D2 resection. Patients will then undergo radical surgical resection for gastric cancer, with pathological complete response (pCR) being observed.
