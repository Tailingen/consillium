A Phase 1 With Extension Cohort, Single Arm, Single Center, Open Label Trial of Belantamab Mafodotin for the Treatment of High-Risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma
This is a single-center, single arm, phase I study designed to determine the safety and find the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum dose level (MTD) of Belantamab Mafodotin in patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma. The study will have a dose-finding part and a dose-expansion part. The maximum number of enrolled patients will be 30 with 18 patients for the dose-finding part and 12 patients for the dose-expansion part. Once we determine the MTD or RP2D in the dose-finding part, we will enroll and treat 12 additional patients at the MTD or RP2D in the expansion part. Efficacy will be assessed through the overall response rate (ORR) at the end of the study. With the limited number of patients for the dose-expansion part, we will not have formal futility monitoring rule.
Myeloma
DRUG: Belantamab mafodotin
To establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose of single agent belantamab mafodotin in high risk SMM., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objective: To obtain the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum tolerated dose of single agent belantamab mafodotin in high risk SMM.

Secondary Objectives: Overall response rate per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria. Progression free survival at 2 years, overall survival, duration of response, safety and clinical benefit rate.

Exploratory Studies: Evaluate correlative endpoints including immune, cellular and molecular profiling, minimal residual disease, BCMA staining of bone marrow, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and mechanisms of resistance to belantamab mafodotin.
