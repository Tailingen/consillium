This protocol will enable the Pediatric Branch to follow selected children with cancer or HIV infection who are not immediately eligible for protocol enrollment but who are likely, within the next year, to become candidates for protocol entry. It will also enable the Pediatric Branch to follow children who present with either clinical findings that constitute important educational experiences for the NCI trainees or who have unique or unusual medical problems that are likely to benefit from the research expertise of the NCI.
