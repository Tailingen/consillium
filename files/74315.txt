A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in symptoms.

For patients with Polycythemia Vera, queried symptoms included fever, itching/pruritus, bone pain and night sweats., Baseline and Week 4 (Cycle 2, Day 1)|Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Essential Thrombocythemia Symptoms, Patients were asked to rate their symptoms on a scale of 0 (none) to 10 (worse possible) for the prior week giving the worst level of symptoms experienced during the preceding 7 days. A negative change from baseline score indicates improvement in symptoms.

For patients with essential thrombocythemia, queried symptoms included itching/pruritus, bone pain, night sweats, paresthesias (tingling or numbness), and weakness., Baseline and Week 4 (Cycle 2, Day 1)|Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Health-related Quality of Life, Health-related Quality of Life was assessed using the Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale of the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). This scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher quality of life., Baseline and Week 4 (Cycle 2, Day 1)
The study consisted of a 2-stage design, which included a dose-ranging phase (during which patients received treatment at their randomized dose) and an expansion phase (after adjustment of dose/regimen to achieve an optimal balance of efficacy and safety). During the dose-ranging phase, patients in each disease group (PV or ET) were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio independent of each other to receive 1 of 3 treatment regimens with Ruxolitinib, 10 mg twice daily (bid), 25 mg bid, or 50 mg once daily (qd). After patients completed 2 cycles of treatment with Ruxolitinib at the randomized dose, Investigators were permitted to adjust the dose/regimen on an individual basis using their discretion in order to achieve an optimal balance of efficacy and safety. During the expansion phase (ie, after optimization of dose), additional patients with PV or ET were enrolled to receive Ruxolitinib at the dose that was selected upon review of data from the dose-ranging phase. Treatment continued until a patient met a withdrawal criterion, had intolerable toxicity, progression of disease, or withdrew consent.
