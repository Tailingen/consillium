A Randomised Trial of ATRA in a Novel Drug Combination for Pancreatic Cancer
This is an open-label, multi-centre, randomised, stratified, phase IIb clinical trial of ATRA administered in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with laPDAC.
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: ATRA|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: nab-paclitaxel
To assess the efficacy of ATRA when given in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel based on progression free survival (PFS)., PFS defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of first documented tumour progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Assessed 8 weekly until progression or death or end of trial, whichever comes first
To assess the efficacy of ATRA when given in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel based on objective response rate (ORR)., ORR defined as the number of patients with an objective response (OR) divided by the number of patients analysed. OR is defined as the number of patients with at least one confirmed response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). OR will be calculated in patients with measurable disease at baseline., Assessed 8 weekly until progression or death or end of trial, whichever comes first|To assess the efficacy of ATRA when given in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel based on overall survival (OS)., OS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation to death from any cause., Assessed 8 weekly until progression or death and then 3 monthly for at least 12 months after the last safety visit|To assess the safety and tolerability of ATRA when given in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel over the first 6 cycles., The worst recorded toxicity grade for each patient on the NCI-CTCAE toxicity scale (version 5.0) over the first 6 cycles of treatment, 6 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days)|To assess the surgical resection rate of ATRA when given in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel., Surgical resection rate defined as patients undergoing complete resection of known pancreatic primary and associated lymph nodes at any point after enrolment, in each arm., From consent to at least 12 months after the last safety visit, but further if required as per physician decision - through study completion|To assess the resection margin negative (R0) surgical resection rate of ATRA when given in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel., R0 surgical resection rate defined as histologically confirmed complete resection of known pancreatic primary from those resected., From consent to at least 12 months after the last safety visit, but further if required as per physician decision - through study completion|To assess quality of life (QOL) of patients receiving ATRA in combination with Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel: EQ-5D-5L, QoL scores for the five dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) will be used to calculate weighted health status scores., Assessed at the beginning of each cycle until progression (1 cycle = 28 days)
Patients will be randomised to receive gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel + ATRA. Treatment will be administered in 28 day cycles. ATRA will be administered for 6 cycles whereas gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel will be administered until disease progression. Treatment may be discontinued earlier due to unacceptable toxicities or death or because the patient requests to be withdrawn from study treatment. If treatment with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel is stopped prior to the patient completing 6 cycles of treatment with ATRA (if allocated), the patient may continue on treatment with ATRA alone until the 6 cycles are completed, at the discretion of the treating physician.
