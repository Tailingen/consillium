A Study of SHR-1210 in Combination With Capecitabine + Oxaliplatin or Apatinib in Treatment of Advanced Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this trial is to estimate overall response rate (ORR) of SHR-1210 combined with capecitabine and oxaliplatin or with apatinib as first-line treatment in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.

BIOLOGICAL: SHR-1210|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Apatinib
Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 6 months.
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per RECIST 1.1, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on blinded independent central review or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months.|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1, For participants who demonstrate CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression per RECIST 1.1 based on assessments by blinded independent central review or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to 24 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Per RECIST 1.1, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a CR, PR or SD per RECIST 1.1., Up to 24 months.|Number of Subjects With Treatment-related Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03., Up to 24 months.
Approximately 110 participants will be assigned to SHR-1210 + capecitabine + oxaliplatin combination therapy (Cohort 1), or SHR-1210 + apatinib combination therapy (Cohort 2).
