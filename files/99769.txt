Evaluation of Atezolizumab-Venetoclax-Obinutuzumab Combination in Relapse/Refractory Lymphomas
This study is a multicenter phase II trial which primary objective is to assess the anti-lymphoma activity of atezolizumab associated with a BCL-2 inhibitor (GDC-199, venetoclax) and an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (obinutuzumab) in three separate cohorts:

* relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) patients
* relapsed/refractory aggressive (DLBCL) lymphoma patients
* relapsed/refractory other indolent (iNHL) lymphoma patients (MZL and MALT)
Follicular Lymphoma|Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Venetoclax
FL and DLBCL cohorts : Overall Metabolic Response Rate (OMRR) at the end of induction, Assessment of disease response according to Lugano 2014, 8 months (8 cycles)|for iNHL cohort : Overall Response Rate (ORR) at the end of induction, Assessment of disease response according to Lugano 2014, 8 months (8 cycles)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), time from inclusion to the first observation of progression, 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), time from inclusion to death, 4 years|Duration of Response (DR), from a confirmed Complete Metabolic Response / Complete Radiologic Response (CMR/CRR) or Partial Metabolic Response / Partial Radiologic Response (PMR/PRR) the first observation of progression, 4 years|for FL and DLBCL cohorts : OMRR, According to Lugano 2014, 4 months, 18 months|for iNHL cohort : ORR, According to Lugano 2014, 4 months, 18 months|Best response, Percentage of each response type according to Lugano 2014, 18 months
