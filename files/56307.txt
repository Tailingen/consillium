Compare the Prognostic Differences Between SBRT and Surgery for NSCLC Patients With Interlobular Fissure Invasion.
The goal of this observational study is to compare the prognostic differences between SBRT and Surgery for NSCLC patients with interlobular fissure invasion. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. Explore the survival differences.
2. Explore of the lung function changes before and after different treatments.

Main purpose:

Explore the survival differences between SBRT and surgery for NSCLC patients with interlobular pleural invasion.

Secondary purpose:

1. Longitudinal exploration of the differences in heart and lung function changes before and after treatment between SBRT and surgery of NSCLC patients with interlobular pleural invasion
2. Longitudinal exploration of dynamic changes in lung lobe volume before and after treatment in NSCLC patients with interlobular pleural invasion treated with SBRT and surgical intervention.
