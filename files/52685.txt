Study of IFN-α Combined With CAR-T Cell Therapy in Relapsed and Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia（R/R-ALL）
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IFN-α combined with CAR-T cell therapy in relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R ALL).
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: IFN-α combined with CAR-T cell therapy
Overall response rate (ORR), ORR includes CR, CRi, MLFS and PR. Complete remission (CR)：Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0x 10\^9/L; platelet count \>100x10\^9/L. CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi)：All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0x10\^9/L) or thrombocytopenia (\<100x10\^9/L). Morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS): Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required. Partial remission (PR): All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5% to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%., 2 years
Overall survival (OS), time from enrollment to the date of death from any cause, 2 years|Leukemia-free survival (LFS), time from enrollment to the date of primary refractory disease, or relapse from CR, or death from any cause, 2 years|Cumulative incidence of relapse(CIR), time from the date of achievement of a remission until the date of relapse, 2 years|the duration of CAR-T cells in patients, the time of CAR-T cells' persistence in blood and the copies of CAR-T cells, 2 years|Number of adverse events, adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V5.0, 2 years
This is a phase 2, single-center study. The patients will receive IFN-α combined with infusion of CAR T-cells in R/R B-ALL patients. The study participation will be 5 years including treatment and follow-up periods.
