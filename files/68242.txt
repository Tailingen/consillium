An Appearance-Based Intervention to Reduce Teen Skin Cancer Risk
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a skin cancer prevention website is effective at reduce female teenagers' desire to use indoor tanning and ultimately their use of indoor tanning over an 18 month period.

BEHAVIORAL: Appearance-Focused Website Intervention|BEHAVIORAL: Control Website
Indoor Tanning Behavior, Self-report measure of the number of times the teenager has indoor tanned over 12 month time period. The self-report measure has been validated in previous studies., 12 months|Indoor Tanning Intentions, A validated measure of the teenagers intentions to use indoor tanning in the next 12 months. Indoor tanning intentions are measured on a scale that ranges from 1 (definitely do not intend to indoor tan; better) to 7 (definitely do intend to indoor tan; worse)., 12 months|Indoor Tanning Willingness, Scale that measures adolescents willingness to indoor tan in the future. Indoor tanning willingness is measured on a scale that ranges from 1 (definitely not willing; better) to 7 (definitely willing; worse)., 12 months
The project is designed to improve the understanding of, and ability to affect UV risk behavior in teenage populations. The International Agency for Research in Cancer classifies indoor tanning as "carcinogenic to humans." There is evidence that female indoor tanning use increases dramatically from freshman to senior years of high school (e.g., 25-40% of older high school girls) making high school a critical time period for anti-tanning interventions to be carried out. This proposal assesses the effectiveness of a skin cancer prevention website for a nationally representative sample of high school teens in a randomized controlled trial. Teens exposed to the website will report reduced indoor tanning intentions, frequency and overall percentage of users while increasing sun protective behaviors at long-term (i.e 18 month) follow-up.
