Colonoscopic Removal of Aberrant Crypt Foci: a Prospective, Randomized, Blinded Trial
We hypothesized that aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are precursors of colon cancer; their prevention would correlate with cancer risk and their elimination would reduce that risk. In this study we wished to (1) establish the feasibility of stain-enhanced magnification colonoscopy, (2) determine whether colorectal cancer is asociated with increased numbers of ACF, and (3) investigate the natural history of ACF and the durability of their elimination.
Colorectal Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Surgical removal of ACF|PROCEDURE: Colonoscopic evaluation only
number, size, and location of ACF identified, initially and after one year
complications of stain-enhanced, magnification colonoscopy, initially and after one year
Subjects are randomly assigned at the time of stain-enhanced magnification colonoscopy to have any ACF removed or merely observed. Subjects are evenly divided into those with and those without a personal history of colon cancer. ACF are tabulated by an observer blinded to the subject's personal history. All subjects are then re-evaluated after one year by an observer blinded to the original procedure.
