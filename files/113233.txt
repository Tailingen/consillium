Number of Participants With All Causality and Treatment-related Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Withdrawals Due to TEAEs, An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as newly occurring AEs or those worsening after first dose. AEs comprised both SAEs and non-SAEs. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death余 initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization余 life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying)余 persistent or significant disability/incapacity余 congenital anomaly. Causality assessment was made by the investigator. Grading was per the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) version 3.0: Grade 1=mild, Grade 2=moderate, Grade 3=severe, Grade 4=life-threatening, Grade 5=death related to AE., Baseline up to 28-35 days after treatment discontinuation (up to Day 280)|Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities, Number of participants with laboratory test abnormalities without regard to baseline abnormality.

All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than \[\<\] 10 millimeters \[mm\]). No new lesions. PR was defined as more than or equal to (\>=) 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease.
