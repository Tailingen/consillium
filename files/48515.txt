A Study of MM-121 in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Gynecologic and Breast Cancers
This study was a Phase 1 and pharmacologic open-labeled dose-escalation trial of MM-121 in combination with paclitaxel using a "3+3" design.
Locally Advanced/Metastatic or Recurrent Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer,|Primary Peritoneal Cancer or Endometrial Cancer|Locally Advanced/Metastatic Her2 Non Overexpressing Breast Cancer
DRUG: MM-121|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Dose Escalation: To Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of Escalating Doses of the MM-121 Plus Paclitaxel Combination Via Reporting of Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), To establish the safety of escalating doses of MM-121 in combination with paclitaxel in order to determine the recommended phase 2 dose. Dose-escalation conducted using standard 3+3 model to determine maximum tolerated dose. Reports of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) were assessed to determine the MTD., From date of first dose to 30 days after termination, the longest 163 weeks|To Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MM-121 in Combination With Paclitaxel: MM-121 Dose Level, Using a 3+3 dose escalation model, the maximum tolerated dose of each combination was determined by assessing dose-limiting toxicities in each cohort.

Part 1 Cohort 1: MM-121: 20 mg/kg loading dose followed by 12 mg/kg QW IV )20/12) + Paclitaxel: 80mg/m2 IV QW Part 1 Cohort 2: MM-121: 40 mg/kg loading dose followed by 20 mg/kg QW IV (40/20) + Paclitaxel: 80mg/m2 QW IV Part 2 Cohort 1: MM-121: 40/20 mg/kg IV + Paclitaxel: 80mg/m2 QW IV Part 2 Cohort 2: MM-121 20 /12 mg/kg IV QW + Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m2 QW IV Part 2 Cohort 3: MM-121 40mg/kg IV QOW + Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m2 QW IV Part 2 Cohort 4: MM-121 - 40 mg/kg loading dose followed by 20 mg/kg weekly IV for 3 weeks, followed by one week of rest + Paclitaxel: 80mg/m2 weekly IV for 3 weeks, followed by one week of rest, From date of first dose to 30 days after termination, the longest 163 weeks|To Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MM-121 in Combination With Paclitaxel: Paclitaxel Dose Level, Using a 3+3 dose escalation model, the maximum tolerated dose of each combination was determined by assessing dose-limiting toxicities in each cohort.

To Characterize the Efficacy of the Combination of MM-121 and Paclitaxel Using Objective Response Rate, To determine the number of patients reporting an objective response using RECIST v 1.1 where a Partial Response (PR) is defined as \>20% decrease in tumor burden from baseline and a Complete Response (CR) is defined as complete disappearance from tumor burden from baseline. Objective Response is presented as the total # patients with PR or CR., patients were assessed for response during their time on study, the longest of which was 163 weeks|To Determine the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of MM-121 When Administered in Combination With Paclitaxel, Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation was performed on plasma samples obtained weekly for the first cycle of the study and then on day 1 of each additional cycle to assess pre-treatment trough concentrations of MM-121. Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was performed to calculate standard PK parameters, including the maximum observed concentration (Cmax). Serum levels of MM-121 were measured at a central lab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data is presented per dose level of MM-121 (20/12 mg/kg weekly, 40/20 mg/kg weekly, 40 mg/kg Q2W, or 40/20 mg/kg QW x 7 plus a rest week)., Collections taken at for all patients at Cycle 1, Week 1 (pre-treatment/pre-infusion, at the end of the infusion, and 2.5, 4, 6 and 24 hours after starting the infusion of MM-121) and pre-treatment at Cycle 1, Week 3 and Cycle 2, Week 1|Pharmacokinetic Parameters (AUClast), Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation was performed on plasma samples obtained weekly for the first cycle of the study and then on day 1 of each additional cycle to assess pre-treatment trough concentrations of MM-121. Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was performed to calculate standard PK parameters, including the maximum observed concentration (Cmax). Serum levels of MM-121 were measured at a central lab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data is presented per dose level of MM-121 (20/12 mg/kg weekly, 40/20 mg/kg weekly, 40 mg/kg Q2W, or 40/20 mg/kg QW x 7 plus a rest week).

Immunogenicity data is not available., Collections taken at for all patients at Cycle 1, Week 1 (pre-treatment/pre-infusion, at the end of the infusion, and 2.5, 4, 6 and 24 hours after starting the infusion of MM-121) and pre-treatment at Cycle 1, Week 3 and Cycle 2, Week 1|Immunogenicity, Samples were collected to determine the presence of an immunologic reaction to MM-121 (i.e. human anti-human antibodies)., Samples were collected for all patients pre-dose on all cycles for duration of treatment, the longest of which was 163 weeks, and a collection was made post-infusion in any case of infusion reaction
Successive cohorts of three or more patients were treated at escalating doses until a maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 1 dose was identified. Once the maximum tolerated dose was identified, an Expansion Cohort was enrolled at that dose to further characterize safety and to explore pharmacodynamic endpoints.
