Integration of the PD-L1 Inhibitor Atezolizumab and WT1/DC Vaccination Into Platinum/Pemetrexed-based First-line Treatment for Epithelioid Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
In this multicenter phase I/II trial, the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor atezolizumab and dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with the mesothelioma-associated tumor antigen WT1 will be integrated into platinum/pemetrexed-based first-line chemotherapy for the treatment of epitheloid malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The general objective is to provide the first-in-human experimental demonstration that the combination of platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy with atezolizumab and WT1/DC vaccination is feasible and safe, has clinical activity and enables the induction of mesothelioma-specific immune responses in patients with MPM.

Proportion of patients that experienced (S)AEs possibly, probably or definitely related to pemetrexed and/or cisplatin/carboplatin and/or atezolizumab and/or WT1/DC vaccination, The relationship of an AE to the investigational agents will be determined by the Investigator as either related or non-related, based on their clinical judgment., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Number and grade of AEs and SAEs, AEs are defined and graded according to the latest version of the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), through study completion, an average of 2 years|Proportion of patients who completed study treatment schedule, Study treatment schedule = administration of four platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy cycles (CT1-4) in combination with four atezolizumab treatments (A1-4) and four WT1/DC vaccinations (V1-4)., After the chemoimmunotherapy treatment (+/- 18 weeks after entry to trial)
Best overall response, Best overall response will be determined per patient as the best overall response designation. The BOR categories are complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD)., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Duration of response, Duration of response will be calculated for patients with an objective response as the time between the first date of the first documented tumor response (CR or PR) and the subsequent date of the objectively documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, or the last tumor assessment in case of censoring., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Disease control rate, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of patients whose BOR is either CR, PR or SD, where the dominator is the total number of evaluable patients., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Objective response rate, Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patients whose BOR is either CR or PR, where the dominator is the total number of evaluable patients., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time (in months) between start of the platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy treatment and the date of progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. At the time of analysis, patients without a recorded event will be censored at the time of the last objective disease assessment., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time (in months) between diagnosis/start of treatment and death due to any cause. At the time of analysis, patients without a recorded event will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive., through study completion, an average of 2 years|Functional WT1-specific T cell responses, Change in the proportion of T cells exhibiting functional WT1-specific T cell responses as measured by flow cytometry, After the fourth DC vaccine, at the time of disease progression (if applicable) and 12 months after the start of 1L chemo-immunotherapy in case of sustained disease control
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive and in virtually all cases fatal cancer that is tightly associated with prior asbestos exposure. Despite some improvement over time, the prognosis of patients diagnosed with MPM remains dismal with a median overall survival from diagnosis of only 9-16 months.

In this single arm phase I/II trial the investigators want to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of integrating the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor atezolizumab and WT1-targeted dendritic cell vaccination in epitheloid MPM patients in conjunction with first line platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy. In addition, chemo-immunotherapy-induced immunogenicity will be studied and patient's clinical outcome will be documented for comparison with current patient's outcome allowing indication of the added value.

Fifteen patients diagnosed with histologically proven epithelial MPM (stage I-IV) will be included. Patients should be able to undergo leukapheresis, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Patients who underwent prior treatment for MPM or with a history of another malignancy within the last three years will be excluded.

The intention of this study is to administer four 3-weekly (±3 days) platinum/pemetrexed-based chemotherapy cycles (CT1-4) combined with atezolizumab treatments (A1-4) and autologous WT1 messenger (m)RNA-loaded dendritic cells (V1-4) at day 0 and day 14 (±3 days) of each chemotherapy cycle, respectively.

Additional atezolizumab doses and/or WT1/DC vaccines after the chemo-immunotherapy study scheme can be administered to the patient if consent for continuation of atezolizumab treatment and/or WT1/DC vaccination was obtained and residual WT1/DC vaccine aliquots are available. In that case, atezolizumab and/or WT1/DC vaccines will be administered on a 4-weekly basis (±1 week). The WT1/DC vaccines will be administered within 1 week after atezolizumab administration.

After the final WT1/DC vaccination and/or atezolizumab administration, patients will enter a follow-up phase that lasts for up to 90 days after final WT1/DC vaccination and/or atezolizumab administration or 24 months after diagnosis, whichever occurs later.
