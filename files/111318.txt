Relationship Between Metabolic Profiles and Chronic Diseases and Neoplasms
Metabolic disorders are involved in the occurrence and development of a variety of chronic diseases and tumors. There are many common risk factors between chronic diseases and tumors. However, the mechanisms of chronic diseases and tumors caused by metabolic disorders are not completely clear. By observing the relationship between metabolic indexes and chronic diseases and tumors, the investigators intend to explore the possible mechanisms of metabolic status participating in the occurrence and development of chronic diseases and tumors.
Metabolic Diseases
metabolic disorder, The degree of metabolic disorder liking the levels of glycolipids, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Chronic disease, The occurrence of chronic disease, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Tumor, The occurrence of tumor, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Metabolic disorders are involved in the occurrence and development of a variety of chronic diseases and tumors, for example, metabolic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, etc.) can mediate the progression of chronic diseases such as heart failure and ischemic encephalopathy. Obesity can increase the risks of endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, etc. There are many common risk factors between chronic diseases and tumors, such as age, sex, smoking, genetics, obesity, unhealthy diet and lack of exercise. However, the mechanisms of chronic diseases and tumors caused by metabolic disorders are not completely clear. By observing the relationship between metabolic indexes and chronic diseases and tumors, the investigators intend to explore the possible mechanisms of metabolic status participating in the occurrence and development of chronic diseases and tumors.
