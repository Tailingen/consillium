Imaging-Guided Classification for Endophytic Renal Tumors: PN Strategies & Outcomes
Study Title:

Imaging-Guided Classification \& Surgical Outcomes in Endophytic Renal Tumors

Study Goal:

This observational study investigates whether an imaging-guided classification system improves partial nephrectomy (PN) outcomes for completely endophytic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Main Question:

Does preoperative imaging classification reduce complications (e.g., ischemia time, urinary leakage) in PN for endophytic RCC compared to traditional methods?

Methods:

Patients undergoing PN for endophytic RCC will be grouped based on preoperative imaging classification. Surgical outcomes (complications, renal function) will be tracked for 5 years and compared to non-classified PN cases.

Significance:

Aims to optimize PN planning, minimize risks, and improve long-term renal preservation in complex RCC cases

I. Background of the study Completely endogenous renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is challenging to perform partial nephrectomy (PN) due to the extensive contact area between normal renal parenchyma and RCC and the inability to accurately determine its location from the renal surface.Considering the anatomical complexity and the high risk of complications associated with PN, urologists had favored radical nephrectomy (RN) for completely endophytic RCC to mitigate complications .Advances in robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery and the use of intraoperative ultrasound have led some clinicians to report prognostic and perioperative outcomes similar to those of RN treatment using PN for these complex endogenous RCCs .Although these studies suggest that PN is an available treatment option for fully endogenous RCC, PN treatment of fully endogenous RCC is usually associated with higher intraoperative and perioperative complications, including longer thermal ischemia time (WIT), higher rates of urinary leakage, and higher rates of positive surgical margins, when compared with PN treatment of non-endogenous RCC .Therefore, performing accurate preoperative planning is essential to help clinicians perform PN for fully endogenous RCC and to minimize associated complications.

In surgery with preservation of renal units, precise preoperative assessment and personalized surgical strategies are crucial for the preservation of postoperative renal function, reduction of complications, and improvement of long-term survival of patients .Therefore, the development of an imaging-based classification system to optimize surgical techniques for completely endophytic tumors is of great clinical importance.

The core objective of this study was to establish a scientific classification system for completely endophytic renal tumors through an imaging-guided preoperative classification method, to explore individualized surgical strategies for preserving renal units, and to analyze their performance in terms of postoperative clinical outcomes to provide new ideas and guidance for clinical practice .
