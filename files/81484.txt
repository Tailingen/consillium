Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of JNJ-42756493 (Erdafitinib) in Participants With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine recommended Phase 2 dose \[RP2D\]) and the objective response rate of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) participants with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 amplification.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib)
Part 1:Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), RP2D will be determined based on pharmacodynamics, biomarker response or clinical response, as well as the incidence rate and nature of the toxicities observed., Up to Part 1 Day 84 (Cycle 3, Day 28) (approximately 84 days)|Number of participants with Objective Response, Objective response based on assessment of confirmed Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) for HCC. CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to less than 10 millimeter (mm). PR defined as at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of the diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study for at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response., up to Month 12
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product., up to Month 12|Time to Progression (TTP), Time interval in months between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death due to progression, whichever occurred first., up to Month 12|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR defined as the proportion of participants with complete response \[CR\], partial response \[PR\], or stable disease \[SD\]), and duration of objective response (DOR)., up to Month 12|Progression-free Survival, Time from date of randomization to date of first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., up to Month 12|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib), Up to Part 2 Day 84 (Cycle 3, Day 28) (approximately 84 days)|Time of Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib), Up to Part 2 Day 84 (Cycle 3, Day 28) (approximately 84 days)|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to End of Dosing Interval (AUCtau), The AUCtau is the measure of the plasma drug concentration from time zero to end of dosing interval. It is used to characterize drug absorption., Up to Part 2 Day 84 (Cycle 3, Day 28) (approximately 84 days)|Half life of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib), Up to Part 2 Day 84 (Cycle 3, Day 28) (approximately 84 days)|Apparent Volume of Distribution at Steady-State of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib), Up to Part 2 Day 84 (Cycle 3, Day 28) (approximately 84 days)|Total Clearance of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib), Up to Part 2 Day 84 (Cycle 3, Day 28) (approximately 84 days)|Accumulation Index of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib), Up to Part 2 Day 84 (Cycle 3, Day 28) (approximately 84 days)|Duration of Objective Response (DOR), Up to Month 12
This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), 2 parts (First, dose escalation Phase and second, dose expansion Phase) study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical responses of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) in Asian participants with advanced HCC. The duration of study will be approximately 11 months per participant. The study consists of 2 periods: Screening (28 days before study commences on Day 1); Open-label Treatment (dose escalation portion of the trial \[Part 1\]), participants are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) in 28 day treatment cycles. Part 2, the cohort expansion part of the trial, will further explore the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) as determined in Part 1; and follow-up Phase (up to 6 months). Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and predictive biomarkers at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for JNJ-42756493 (erdafitinib) will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
