Dose Dense TC + Pegfilgrastim Support for Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of giving standard TC chemotherapy on a dose dense schedule (ddTC) as well as evaluating the nature and frequency of ddTC side effects.
Female Breast Cancer
DRUG: docetaxel + cyclophosphamide + pegfilgrastim
Feasibility for Dose-dense TC Therapy: Number of Participants Receiving at Least 90% of Total Dose of Therapy, Evaluate feasibility of delivering 4 cycles (1 cycle = 2 weeks) of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) on a dose-dense (q2week) schedule with pegfilgrastim support. This regimen will be referred to as dose-dense (dd)TC. Feasibility defined by at least 60% of patients receiving 90% of the total dose of therapy within 10 weeks., 4 cycles each 2 weeks in length for a total of 8 weeks, up to 10 weeks
Incidence of Febrile Neutropenia, Neutropenic fever was anticipated to be a clinically significant toxicity that would limit the maximal density of TC therapy., Up to 10 weeks|Incidence of Neuropathy, Neuropathy was anticipated to be a clinically significant toxicity that would limit the maximal density of TC therapy., Up to 10 weeks
A standard chemotherapy treatment option for breast cancer after surgery (adjuvant therapy) is docetaxel + cyclophosphamide (TC). This study looks at a different schedule for giving the same adjuvant chemotherapy so that treatment can be completed faster (in 8 weeks rather than 12 weeks). This study uses a growth factor drug, pegfilgrastim, to help build blood cells that are lowered because of chemotherapy, making it possible to receive TC treatment every 2 weeks (referred to as "dose dense TC" or "ddTC") instead of the standard 3 week schedule. The main study procedures are blood draws, chemotherapy treatment, physical exams, and pegfilgrastim injections.
