Hepatic Xenetix-CT Perfusion
The purpose of this study is to prospectively determine the diagnostic value of Xenetix-CT perfusion for the discrimination between well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and poorly/moderately differentiated HCC, in histo-pathologically proven HCC, and with the aim to cover the entire liver.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Xenetix-CT perfusion imaging
Blood Volume (BV) According to Degree of Lesions Differentiation, The mean level of each CT perfusion parameter was compared between well differentiated and moderately/poorly differentiated lesions according to WHO classification evaluated off-site., Within a week from CT perfusion to surgery|Blood Flow (BF) According to Degree of Lesions Differentiation, The mean level of each CT perfusion parameter was compared between well differentiated and moderately/poorly differentiated lesions according to WHO classification evaluated off-site., Within a week from CT perfusion to surgery|Permeability Surface (PS) According to Degree of Lesions Differentiation, The mean level of each CT perfusion parameter was compared between well differentiated and moderately/poorly differentiated lesions according to WHO classification evaluated off-site., Within a week from CT perfusion to surgery
Arterial Liver Perfusion (ALP) According to Degree of Lesions Differentiation, The mean level of each CT perfusion parameter was compared between well differentiated and moderately/poorly differentiated lesions according to WHO classification evaluated off-site., Within a week from CT perfusion to surgery|Portal Venous Liver Perfusion (PVP) According to Degree of Lesions Differentiation, The mean level of each CT perfusion parameter was compared between well differentiated and moderately/poorly differentiated lesions according to WHO classification evaluated off-site., Within a week from CT perfusion to surgery|Total Liver Perfusion (TLP) According to Degree of Lesions Differentiation, The mean level of each CT perfusion parameter was compared between well differentiated and moderately/poorly differentiated lesions according to WHO classification evaluated off-site.

TLP = ALP + PVP, Within a week from CT perfusion to surgery|Hepatic Perfusion Index (HPI) According to Degree of Lesions Differentiation, The mean level of each CT perfusion parameter was compared between well differentiated and moderately/poorly differentiated lesions according to WHO classification evaluated off-site., Within a week from CT perfusion to surgery|Blood Volume According to Immunohistochemistry Parameter (Glutamine Synthetase), Glutamine synthetase is an immunohistochemistry parameter of hepatocellular carcinoma phenotype.

Glutamine synthetase labelling was quantified and in case of positive quantification, classified in the following categories: 1-10%, 10-50% and \>50%. In case of absence of glutamine synthetase labelling, lesions were classified in the "glutamine synthetase 0%" category., Within a week from CT perfusion to surgery|Blood Volume According to Immunohistochemistry Parameter (CD31), CD31 is an immunohistochemistry marker of microvessel density. CD31 labelling was quantified and in case of positive quantification, classified in the following categories: 1-10%, 10-50% and \>50%. In case of absence of CD31 labelling, lesions were classified in the "CD31 0%" category., Within a week from CT perfusion to surgery|Blood Flow According to Immunohistochemistry Parameter (Glutamine Synthetase), Glutamine synthetase is an immunohistochemistry parameter of hepatocellular carcinoma phenotype.

Glutamine synthetase labelling was quantified and in case of positive quantification, classified in the following categories: 1-10%, 10-50% and \>50%.
