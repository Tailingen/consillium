Study With Rituximab-Gemcitabine/Oxaliplatin in Relapsed Indolent Lymphoma
The purpose of the phase I part is to determine the tolerability, the initial safety profile and maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin in combination with gemcitabine for indolent lymphoma. In the phase II part the investigators want to estimate the activity of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with rituximab for patients with relapsed/refractory indolent lymphoma.
