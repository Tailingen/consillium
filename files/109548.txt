An open-label, non-randomized, two-stage, multicenter study evaluating clinical efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics effects of PQR309 in patients with relapsed or refractory Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).

The first stage of the study will enroll a minimum of 12 patients with relapsed or refractory Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) evaluable for the primary study objective. If during the first stage of the study data emerge that 80 mg p.o. qd is not adequately tolerated or is inefficacious in patients with relapsed or refractory Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL), additional patients may be enrolled in the study to evaluate alternative dosing regimens, either a lower daily dose (eg. 60 mg) or a lower weekly dose with administration on 2 consecutive days followed by 5 days without treatment in 7-day treatment cycles (intermittent dosing schedule A).In all cases data from at least 12 evaluable patients will be required on the selected dosing regimen (daily or weekly) before the decision is made to proceed with this regimen into the second stage of the study.Nine (9) additional patients will be enrolled for the second stage of the study, for a minimum of 21 patients on the selected dosing regimen in total, evaluable for the final primary endpoint analysis.All patients evaluable for the primary endpoint will be followed until disease progression or death.

Secondary objectives, PQR309 treatment safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) will be evaluated in all enrolled patients in both study stages.
