Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.03, 7 years
Progression-free Survival, Progression is defined using RECIST V1.1 - at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression., 7 years|Overall Survival, 7 years|Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate is the proportion of subjects in the efficacy-evaluable set with radiologically confirmed measurable disease at baseline, who achieved partial response (PR) or better after infusion as determined by RECIST 1.1. Missing or non-evaluable time points will not be included.

Per RECIST 1.1, a complete response is defined as "disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm." A partial response is defined as "at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.", Month 6
This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of both intravenous administration and local delivery of lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells with and without lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

* Cohort 1 (N=3-6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\^7 huCARTmeso cells/m\^2 on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.
* Cohort 2 (N=3-6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\^7 huCARTmeso cells/m\^2 on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m2 of cyclophosphamide administered 2-4 days prior to huCARTmeso cells (day -4 to day -2).
* Cohort 3 (N=3-6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\^8 /m\^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen. \*\*Cohort 3 permanently closed\*\*
* Cohort 4 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\^8 /m\^2 lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m\^2 of cyclophosphamide administered 2-4 days prior to huCART-meso cells (day -4 to day -2). \*\*Cohort 4 permanently closed\*\*
* Cohort 5 (N=up to 6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\^7 huCARTmeso cells/m\^2 on day 0 by intrapleural infusion (IP) through an indwelling pleural catheter without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen. The safety of this dose level has been established by Cohorts 1 and 2.
* Cohort 6 (N=up to 6): will receive a dose of 1-3x10\^7 huCARTmeso cells/m\^2 via IV infusion on Day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m\^2 of cyclophosphamide administered 2-4 days prior to huCART-meso cells (\~Day -4 to -2). This initial infusion may be followed by up to two additional IV infusions of huCART-meso cells at the same dose level, given between 21-42 days apart, if the subject meets eligibility to receive additional infusions. Cyclophosphamide will not be repeated prior to subsequent doses of huCART-meso cells. Enrollment into Cohort 6 will occur in parallel with Cohort 5.
* Cohort 7 (N = up to 6): will receive a single dose of 1-3x10\^7 huCART-meso cells/m\^2 via intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration, following lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m\^2/day and fludarabine 30 mg/m\^2/day given over 3 days by intravenous infusion. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy will be scheduled such that the last day of chemotherapy is 3 days (+/- 1 day) prior to the 1st infusion of huCART-meso cells. This initial i.p. infusion may be followed by up to two additional infusions of huCART-meso cells via intravenous (IV) administration at the same dose level, given between 21-42 days apart. The subject must meet eligibility to receive additional infusions. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy will not be repeated prior to additional infusions of huCART-meso cells.

The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 0-1 DLT occurs in 6 evaluable subjects tested within the dose range of this study. The maximum tolerated dose has been established as 1-3x10\^7 huCARTmeso cells/m\^2.

Adverse events will be collected and evaluated during the protocol specified adverse event reporting period
