CIK-Cells in Relapsing Patients With Acute Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndromes After SCT.
Multi-site, non-randomized Phase I/II study involving children and adults.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Acute Leukemia
DRUG: CIK-Cells
The occurrence of grade three or four acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGvHD), two until four weeks after CIK-Cell Infusion|Extensive chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD), two until four weeks after CIK-Cell Infusion
Efficacy of CIK-Cells analyzed by progression free survival, one year|Overall survival, one year
This is a phase I/II multicenter-study to investigate the feasibility safety and efficacy of interleukin (IL)-15 activated CIK cells in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) showing evidence of relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).

CIK cell infusions will be given with an interval of 4-6 weeks according to a dose escalation schedule in patients with impending relapse after allogeneic SCT. In presence of acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) â‰¥ grade II, the next scheduled infusion will not be administered.
