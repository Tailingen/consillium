First-in-Man, Dose-escalation Trial of c-Met Kinase Inhibitor EMD 1204831 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
EMD Serono has closed enrollment into this trial prior to determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD). EMD Serono has decided not to pursue the development of EMD 1204831 in patients with advanced solid tumors for reasons other than safety.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: EMD 1204831
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of EMD 1204831 in subjects with advanced solid tumors, After first cycle of treatment
Number and frequency of adverse events, and changes from baseline in laboratory values, vital signs and ECGs will be used to assess safety and tolerability of EMD1204831., Scheduled visits throuhout each 21 day cycle of treatment. Subjects may continue to receive cycles of EMD 1204831 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.|Anti-tumor activity and best overall response will be assessed according to RECIST 1.0 after every two cycles of EMD 1204831. Frequency of subjects with different levels of overall response (CR, PR, SD or PD) and best Overall Response will be presented., Scheduled visits throuhout each 21 day cycle of treatment. Subjects may continue to receive cycles of EMD 1204831 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.|PK parameters will be assessed to characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of EMD 1204831 and summarized by dose level and cycle., Scheduled visits throuhout each 21 day cycle of treatment. Subjects may continue to receive cycles of EMD 1204831 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.|Values and changes over time in pharmacodynamic (Pd) markers in tissue and molecular markers in blood will be assessed, Scheduled visits throuhout each 21 day cycle of treatment. Subjects may continue to receive cycles of EMD 1204831 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.|Exploratory analyses of genes that may be involved in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) of EMD 1204831 will be performed., Scheduled visits throuhout each 21 day cycle of treatment. Subjects may continue to receive cycles of EMD 1204831 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
This is a an open-label, dose-escalation, first-in-man (FIM) study designed to explore the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of an investigational drug, EMD 1204831, in patients with advanced solid tumors who have not responded to previous therapies or for whom no other therapies are available. Subjects will receive EMD 1204831 twice a day (BID) during each 21-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
