Mindfulness for Breast Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) vs. Treatment as Usual (TAU) for depression and anxiety symptoms in breast cancer patients in recovery. Investigators will examine whether MBCT-related improvements in sleep quality, illness-related distress, and rumination (escalating cycles of negative thinking) predict MBCT-related decreases in depression and anxiety symptoms (Aim 2). Exploratory analyses will examine whether demographics (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity), individual differences (e.g., perceived stress, social support), clinical characteristics (e.g., stage/severity of diagnosis), and treatment adherence (e.g., sessions attended, hours of weekly practice) help determine for whom MBCT is most effective (Aim 3).
