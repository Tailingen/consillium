CONcurrent vs SEqueNTial Adjuvant Treatments in Early Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women. For patients candidated for adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy the optimal timing for their has not been clearly defined yet.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Anastrozole or Letrozole or Exemestane|DRUG: Anastrozole or Letrozole or Exemestane
Disease- free Survival (DFS), the primary outcome indicator will be the so called DFS, defined as time elapsing between the date of randomization and the date of one of the following events, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 15 years:

* Local Recurrence of disease
* Regional recurrence of disease
* Distant recurrence of disease
* Contralateral invasive or intraductal breast cancer
* Second primary malignancy other than breast
* Death for any cause, up to 15 years
Overall Survival (OS), time between the date of randomization up to the date of death for any cause, assessed up to 15 years.|Translational Study: genomic analysis, Expression of genes associated with ER and Ki67 expression will be analyzed by Real Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) sections of tumors classified as intermediate risk by clinical and pathological variables (stage I-II, G2, hormone receptors positive) and will be correlated with disease free survival., up to 15 years|Translational Study: epigenetic analysis, miRNA expression analysis by real time PCR and DNA methylation analysis by pyrosequencing will be assessed on FFPE sections of tumors classified as intermediate risk by clinical and pathological variables (stage I-II, G2, hormone receptors positive), up to 15 years|Translational Study: proteomic analysis, The different proteomic profiles identified in FFPE sections of hormone receptors positive G2 tumors will be correlated with DFS, up to 15 years
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women in North America, Europe and Latin America. Because nearly 80% of breast cancers are endocrine-responsive tumors, the majority of patients candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) are also candidates for endocrine therapy (ET). The optimal timing (i.e. concomitant vs sequential administration) for the integration of these two treatments has not been clearly defined yet.

In patients with hormone receptor positive early stage breast cancer who are candidates to adjuvant chemotherapy and endocrine therapy, the optimal timing for the integration of these two treatment modalities has not been clearly defined yet.
