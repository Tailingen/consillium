An Investigational Immuno-therapy Study of Experimental Medication BMS-986179 Given Alone and in Combination With Nivolumab
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tumor-shrinking ability of experimental medication BMS-986179 alone and when combined with Nivolumab, in patients with solid cancers that are advanced or have spread.
Malignant Solid Tumor

Number of Participants With Drug Related AEs, SAEs, AEs Leading to Discontinuation and Deaths., Number of participants with drug related adverse events (AE), drug related serious adverse events (SAE), drug related AEs Leading to discontinuation and drug related deaths, From first dose to 100 days post last dose: Part 1 up to 25.1 months, Part 2 SC up to 17.5 months, RCC Mono up to 28.1 months, Part 2 up to 27.2 months.
Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response (BOR) at Week 24, Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response designation over the study as a whole, recorded between the dates of first dose until the last tumor assessment prior to subsequent therapy. CR or PR determinations included in the BOR assessment must be confirmed by a second scan performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met., from initial treatment to week 24|Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response Rate (ORR) at Week 24, ORR is defined as the percentage of all treated participants whose BOR is either a CR or PR., from initial treatment to week 24|Progression Free Survival Rate (PFSR) at Week 24, PFSR at 24 weeks is defined as the percentage of treated participants remaining progression free and surviving at 24 weeks., from initial treatment to week 24|Median Duration of Response (DOR), DOR (computed for all treated subjects with a BOR of CR or PR) is defined as the time between the date of first response and the date of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., from first measure response approximately up to 25 months|Cmax, Cmax is defined as maximum plasma concentration of the drug, Part 1A Cycle 0 = 14 days Cycle 1 = 28 days Part 1B and Part 2 Q2W regimen Cycle 0 = 14 days Cycle 1 = 28 days Cycle 2 = 28 days Part 1B and 2 Q4W Regimen Cycle 1= 28 days Cycle 2 = 28 days Cycle 4 = 28 days|Tmax, Tmax is defined is the time to maximum plasma concentration, Part 1A Cycle 0 = 14 days Cycle 1 = 28 days Part 1B and Part 2 Q2W regimen Cycle 0 = 14 days Cycle 1 = 28 days Cycle 2 = 28 days Part 1B and 2 Q4W Regimen Cycle 1= 28 days Cycle 2 = 28 days Cycle 4 = 28 days|AUC (0-T), Area under the plasma concentration time-curve. AUC from time 0 to the last time of quantifiable concentration, Part 1A Cycle 0 = 14 days Cycle 1 = 28 days Part 1B and Part 2 Q2W regimen Cycle 0 = 14 days Cycle 1 = 28 days Cycle 2 = 28 days Part 1B and 2 Q4W Regimen Cycle 1= 28 days Cycle 2 = 28 days Cycle 4 = 28 days|AUC (Tau), Area under the plasma concentration time-curve. AUC over the dosing interval., Part 1A Cycle 0 = 14 days Cycle 1 = 28 days Part 1B and Part 2 Q2W regimen Cycle 0 = 14 days Cycle 1 = 28 days Cycle 2 = 28 days Part 1B and 2 Q4W Regimen Cycle 1= 28 days Cycle 2 = 28 days Cycle 4 = 28 days|Ctau, Ctau is defined as the concentration of study drug at the end of the dosing interval, Part 1A Cycle 0 = 14 days Cycle 1 = 28 days Part 1B and Part 2 Q2W regimen Cycle 0 = 14 days Cycle 1 = 28 days Cycle 2 = 28 days Part 1B and 2 Q4W Regimen Cycle 1= 28 days Cycle 2 = 28 days Cycle 4 = 28 days|Mean Change From Baseline in CD73 Assays, Mean change from baseline in CD73 assays at the end of Part 1A treatment period

Assays Measured:

EHC CD73 H-score IHC CD73 Cytoplasm H-Score IHC CDS73 Membrane H-Score

The H-score is given by the ratio of the weighted sum of the number of positive cells to the total number of detected cells. The H-score captures both the intensity and the proportion of the biomarker of interest from the IHC image and comprises values between 0 and 300. The lower the number equals a better prognosis., approximately up to 95 weeks|Number of Participants With a Positive Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) Test., A participant with at least one ADA-positive sample relative to baseline at any time after initiation of treatment with BMS-986179 and nivolumab., From first dose to last dose: Part 1: up to 95 weeks, Part 2 SC: up to 62 weeks, RCC Mono: up to 108 weeks, Part 2: up to 104 weeks
