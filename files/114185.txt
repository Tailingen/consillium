Long-term Treatment Outcome for Stage III NPC Patients and Risk Grouping by Plasma EBV DNA
No previous study reported the treatment outcome of stage III nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. The investigators try to investigate the long-term treatment outcome of stage III NPC patients and do risk grouping by plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA assay for future therapy improvement.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|EBV Related Carcinoma
Overall survival (OS), Diagnosis to death, 5 year
Progression-free survival (PFS), Diagnosis to death to recurrence or metastasis, 5 year|Distant metastasis failure-free survival (DMFFS), Diagnosis to death to distant metastasis, 5 year|Locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS), Diagnosis to death to locoregional failure, 5 year
The stage III NPC patients were the majority group of the patient population of NPC. But most clinical trials focused on the treatment of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition stage IVA/IVB treatment for high risk of recurrence or metastasis. No previous study reported the treatment outcome of stage III NPC patients. The investigators tried to investigate the long-term treatment outcome of stage III NPC patients and do risk grouping by plasma EBV DNA assay for future therapy improvement.
