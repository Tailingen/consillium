Safety/Efficacy Study of SGN-15 (Antibody-Drug Conjugate) Combined With Gemcitabine in Patients With Ovarian Cancer
This is an open-label, randomized phase II trial comparing treatment with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) drug immunoconjugate, SGN-15, administered weekly in combination with weekly Gemzar® (Gemcitabine) to treatment with Gemzar® alone. The primary objectives of this study are to determine the toxicity and safety profile of the combination of SGN-15 and Gemzar®, to estimate the clinical response rate and to estimate the duration of response of this combination therapy administered to patients with advanced ovarian cancer, compared to treatment with Gemzar® alone.
