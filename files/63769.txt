An Open-label, Multicenter, Single-arm Clinical Study on the Use of Doxorubicin Liposome in Combination With CapOX and Bevacizumab Regimen for First-line Treatment of Advanced Colorectal Adenocarcinoma With SMAD4R361H/C Mutation.
This is a prospective, single-arm clinical study designed to evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival rate (6-month PFS rate) of Doxorubicin liposome combined with CapOX and Bevacizumab regimen as first-line treatment for advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma with SMAD4R361H/C mutation. The study plans to recruit 13 patients. After receiving 8 cycles of induction therapy, patients whose efficacy is evaluated as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) (according to RECIST 1.1) will enter maintenance therapy.
