Imaging and Genomic Biomarkers to Predict Response in Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the imaging and gene expression biomarkers in prostate cancer. Participants have high-risk prostate cancer and have indicated they will undergo external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and androgen deprivation therapy (EBRT+BTX+ADT). Participants can expect to be in this study for up to 5 years.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: External beam radiation therapy|RADIATION: Prostate brachytherapy boost|DRUG: Androgen deprivation therapy|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
Imaging markers for mid-treatment response, Evaluate prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/MRI for imaging biomarkers that predict mid-treatment response to ADT and EBRT to identify participants at risk for poor response to radiation therapy and ADT., Mid-treatment (approximately 3 months into treatment)
Genomic signatures correlated with imaging response, Determine if the Decipher and PORTOS genomic scores (high vs low) and basal/luminal genomic subtypes are correlated with change in PSMA standardized uptake value (SUV) pre-to-mid-treatment., Baseline and mid-treatment (approximately 3 months into treatment)|Establish a correlation between PET imaging response and pathologic response, PET images will be assessed for response using change in SUV in order to establish a correlation between imaging response and pathologic response to ADT and EBRT on a lesion-by-lesion basis. Pathologic response will be evaluated considering change in percent core involvement, prostate cancer epithelial/stromal (E/S) ratio, PSMA, CC3 and Ki67 expression. Concordance will be assessed using the Kappa statistic., Baseline and mid-treatment (approximately 3 months into treatment)|Establish a correlation between MRI imaging response and pathologic response, MR images will be assessed for response using change in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in order to establish a correlation between imaging response and pathologic response to ADT and EBRT on a lesion-by-lesion basis. Pathologic response will be evaluated as described in Outcome 3. Concordance will be assessed using the Kappa statistic., Baseline and mid-treatment (approximately 3 months into treatment)|Imaging and genomic markers for prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence., Determine if imaging and genomic markers that predict for mid-treatment pathologic response also predict PSA recurrence., Baseline, 3 months post therapy, every 6 months for 5 years|Evaluate blood-based biomarkers for treatment response., Messenger RNA from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) will be extracted to determine if presence of androgen receptor variants and a neuroendocrine prostate cancer signature (a score based upon the expression of a set of genes) is correlated with pathologic response (determined as outlined in Outcome 3)., Baseline and mid-treatment (approximately 3 months into treatment)
Changes in cancer gene expression during therapy, Evaluate changes in gene expression from pre- to mid-treatment, and their association with response to therapy., Baseline and mid-treatment (approximately 3 months into treatment)|Prognostic significance of higher order radioman metrics, Higher order radiomic metrics (e.g. measures of PET lesion heterogeneity obtained using open-source radiomic software) will be assessed as potential predictive markers for pathologic treatment response (measured as outlined in Outcome 3) to ADT and EBRT., Baseline and mid-treatment (approximately 3 months into treatment)
This is a pilot study to prospectively investigate potential predictive imaging and genomic biomarkers for patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with standard of care EBRT + BTX + ADT. The primary imaging modalities that will be evaluated will be PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) and multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Pre-treatment PET/MRI scans will also be obtained as part of standard of care prior to study enrollment. Response will be assessed on a mid-treatment PET/MRI scan obtained for research purposes after completion of EBRT but prior to brachytherapy boost. PET/CT (computerized tomography) may be used instead if PET/MRI is not technically possible. Imaging response will be compared to pathology from image-directed prostate biopsies taken at the time of the brachytherapy boost. The primary genomic marker that will be evaluated is a clinically available gene-expression array, Decipher, that will be obtained as part of standard of care prior to study enrollment.
