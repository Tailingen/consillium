A Phase III Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Penpulimab in the Relapsed and Refractory Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of Penpulimab vs. standard chemotherapy selected by investigator in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Hodgkin Disease Lymphoma
DRUG: Penpulimab|DRUG: Investigator's choice of Chemotherapy
Progression Free Survival (PFS) assessed by Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRRC) per Lugano Classification 2014, Time from the date of randomization to the date of progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years
Overall Survival (OS), Time from the date randomization to death from any cause., Up to end of study|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR defined as the proportion of subjects who achieves a best overall response of CR or PR based on Lugano 2014 classification., Up to 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR defined as the proportion of subjects' response of CR, PR, or SD based on Lugano Classification 2014., Up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR defined as the time from the date that CR or PR are first occurred to the date of objective disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years|Time to Response (TTR), TTR defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date when the response criteria are first met, based on Lugano Classification 2014., Up to 2 years|Number of subjects with adverse events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment, From the time of signed informed consent through 90 days after the last dose of penpulimab|Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Number of subjects with detectable anti-drug antibody (ADA)., From first dose of penpulimab through to 30 days after last dose of penpulimab
This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy of Penpulimab in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. Participants will be randomized to receive either Penpulimab monotherapy or chemotherapy of investigators' choice. The primary hypotheses of this study are that treatment with Penpulimab prolongs Progression-free Survival (PFS) in participants with relapsed or refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma compared to treatment with Chemotherapy.
