Colorectal Cancer Screening Assessment Study
This study, led by the American Samoa Community Cancer Coalition's INdigenous Samoan Partnership to Initiate Research Excellence (INSPIRE) and the UH Cancer Center's project team including Dr. Cassel, will utilize a community-based and culturally relevant process to assess the uptake of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) using tailored colorectal cancer patient education materials for those with inadequate health literacy. Our primary outcomes include: 1) process to develop "suitable" and "comprehensible" health promotion materials for populations in English and Samoan with various health literacy levels, 2) commitment to use the FOBT Colocare home kit, and 3) use of a FOBT Colocare home kit.

Modified Patient Education Materials, Use a combination of inadequate health literacy recommendations, suitable, and comprehensible assessment methods to develop modified culturally appropriate patient education materials for Colorectal Cancer (CRC)., 1 Month|Increase uptake of FOBT ColoCARE Home kit, Conduct a randomized controlled trial of Indigenous Samoan participants (N=312), age≥ 50 recruited using Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS). This design will compare use of non-tailored instruction for completing ColoCare FOBT home-kits (N=156) versus the experimental condition, using a ColoCare FOBT home-kit with instructions tailored to low health literacy and to enhance CRC-Knowledge Attitudes and Behavior (KAB) - (N=156)., 2 Months|ColoCARE Completion Efficacy, Using data gathered from individual results cards (e.g. response, accuracy, etc.) and qualitative data analysis to determine the influence of tailored materials on timely completion of the ColoCARE FOBT home kit., 3 Months
Utilizing the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use as a conceptual framework and the evidence-based program "Against Colorectal Cancer in Our Neighborhoods" (ACCION) for the Latino population in Texas as a guide, the proposed study will conduct a randomized controlled trial of Indigenous Samoan participants (N=312), age≥ 50 recruited using Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS). This design will compare use of non-tailored instruction for completing ColoCare FOBT home-kits (N=156) versus the experimental condition, using a ColoCare FOBT home-kit with instructions tailored to low health literacy and to enhance CRC-Knowledge Attitudes and Behavior (KAB) - (N=156). Our goal is to test the influence of tailored materials on timely completion of CRC screening using the ColoCARE FOBT.
