Research and Application for New Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment System for HBV Related HCC Liver Transplantation
The study evaluated the protein expression levels of FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and paracancerous tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC). This study aimed to determine the role of FKBP12 in the outcome of liver transplantation recipients with HCC, especially those exceeding the Milan criteria. In addition, we explored how sirolimus administration affected LT recipients'prognosis depending on different FKBP12 expression, aiming to provide some advice for clinical sirolimus application after LT.
