Venetoclax to Augment Epigenetic Modification and Chemotherapy
The investigator is testing the addition of venetoclax to 5-azacitidine and vorinostat followed by standard chemotherapy to enhance treatment response in AML patients.

The investigators are testing if the addition of venetoclax to epigenetic therapy will not only enhance the treatment response for patients with epigenetic lesions but improve the poor response we have observed in those patients without epigenetic lesions. The addition of venetoclax to 5-azacitidine and vorinostat followed by standard chemotherapy will be investigated. This regimen may be tolerable and increase LSC targeting resulting in deeper, more durable responses in children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed or refractory AML

The study will enroll patients in two strata - a primary stratum of eligible patients without Down syndrome, and a secondary stratum of eligible patients with Down syndrome (DS-AML). Subjects will receive two 35 day cycles of therapy.
