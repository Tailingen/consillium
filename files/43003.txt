Laparoscopic Versus Robot-assisted Left-sided Pancreatectomy for Benign and Pre-malignant Lesions (DIPLOMA-3)
The DIPLOMA-3 trial is an international, multicenter, patient-blinded randomized controlled trial comparing laparoscopic and robot-assisted left-sided pancreatectomy. Patients with an indication for elective left-sided pancreatecomy for benign or premalignant lesions in the body or tail of the pancreas and considered eligible will be randomized between laparoscopic and robot-assisted resection.

COMPOS-panc left score, The COMPOS-panc left score is a recently developed, severity-weighted composite outcome measure for pancreatic surgery. It combines perioperative and postoperative outcomes into a single composite outcome measure. This score includes the following parameters, measured at 90-days postoperative: unplanned blood transfusion, emergency conversion to open surgery, postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH), other complications requiring intervention, multi-organ failure, mortality, length of hospital stay and readmission requiring intervention., 90 days
Total hospital-related costs, To examine total hospital-related costs, the following costs will be considered up to 90 days postoperative:

1. Direct cost of the operation
2. Direct cost of the post-operative hospital stay
3. Direct cost of follow-up period, including readmission, outpatient visits, emergency room visits and reintervention, 90 days|Spleen-preservation rate and spleen-preservation technique, Compare L-MILP and R-MILP for spleen-preservation rate and spleen-reservation technique (Kimura versus Warshaw technique), Surgery|Pancreatic surgery specific complications, Complications including pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, postoperative bleeding, wound infection, other gastrointestinal leakage, re-interventions (radiographic, endoscopic, surgical), ICU admission, in hospital, 30- and 90-day mortality., 90 days
