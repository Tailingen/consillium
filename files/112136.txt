Chemotherapy and Lapatinib or Trastuzumab in Treating Women With HER2/Neu-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
This was a multi-center, multinational, randomized, open-label, Phase III study comparing combination taxane-based chemotherapy plus lapatinib to combination taxane-based chemotherapy plus trastuzumab in women with documented evidence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) (by local or central laboratory testing) who had received no prior chemotherapy or HER2 targeted therapy in the metastatic setting.

Subjects were stratified by

* Prior (neo) adjuvant HER2/neu targeted therapy (yes, no)
* Prior (neo) adjuvant taxane chemotherapy (yes, no)
* Planned taxane treatment (once weekly paclitaxel versus docetaxel once every 3 weeks)
* Liver metastasis (yes, no)

Subjects were randomized 1:1 to the following treatments to a planned sample size of approximately 600 subjects (to achieve 536 centrally confirmed HER2 positive subjects):

* Taxane based chemotherapy plus lapatinib for 24 weeks followed by single agent lapatinib
* Taxane based chemotherapy plus trastuzumab for 24 weeks followed by single agent trastuzumab

The choice of taxane (once weekly paclitaxel versus docetaxel once every 3 weeks) was at the discretion of the treating physician and was specified at the time of subject randomization.

A protocol-specified interim analysis was conducted on 27-Apr-2012, following which the participants in the Lapatinib plus taxane based chemotherapy arm could cross over to Taxane based chemotherapy plus Trastuzumab.
