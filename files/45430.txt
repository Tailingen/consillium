Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab vs Carbo-Pacli-Beva-Rucaparib vs Carbo-Pacli-Ruca, Selected According to HRD Status, in Patients With Advanced Ovarian, Primary Peritoneal and Fallopian Tube Cancer, Preceded by a Phase I Dose Escalation Study on Ruca-Beva Combination
This trial is a randomized, open-label Phase I-2 multi-center study designed to evaluate the effect of Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab (in combination and maintenance) vs Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab-Rucaparib (Rucaparib only in maintenance) vs Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Rucaparib (Rucaparib only in maintenance) on progression-free survival in patients with advanced high grade ovarian cancer treated according to HRD status . The trial will test the hypothesis that Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab-Rucaparib and the Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Rucaparib arms will improve the progression-free survival in comparison to standard Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab in HRD negative (HR proficient) patients and that Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Bevacizumab-Rucaparib will improve PFS with respect to Carboplatin-Paclitaxel-Rucaparib in HRD positive patients. The randomized phase of the study will be preceded by a single arm Phase I study which will be conducted only in the National Cancer Institute of Milan, aiming at evaluating the MTD of the combination Rucaparib-Bevacizumab. Once the MTD has been reached, the randomized study will start.

Phase I study design:

This is a single-centre, Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bevacizumab-rucaparib combination and determine the MTD in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

The dose of bevacizumab is fixed in cohort 1, 2 and 3 of the study at 15mg/kg, q 3 weekly.

The dose of rucaparib is evaluated in three cohorts (400 mg BID; 500 mg BID; 600 mg BID).

This trial will enroll at least 3 patients in cohort 1 with dose escalation to rucaparib 500 mg from cohort 1 to 2. Cohort 2 will enroll at least 3 patients with dose escalation to rucaparib 600 mg from cohort 2 to 3.

The standard 3+3 design will be used. Patients will be enrolled in cohort of 3 patients, if no DLT event will be reported among the first 3 patients, a second cohort will be enrolled at the upper dose level. If 1 DLT event is registered in the first cohort, other 3 patients will be enrolled at the same dose.

Phase II study design:

Eligible patients with histological documented high grade Stage IIIB-IIIC-IV ovarian cancer (regardless of residual tumor) will be randomized 1:1:1 according to a molecular driven treatment.

HRD positive patients:

* ARM B: Carboplatin AUC 5 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 q 21 for 6 cycles followed by Rucaparib 600 mg BID q 28 for 24 cycles as maintenance

HRD negative patients:

* ARM A: Carboplatin AUC 5 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 q 21 + Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg for 6 cycles followed by Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q 21 for 16 cycles (Bevacizumab will start from Cycle 2)
* ARM B: Carboplatin AUC 5 + Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 q 21 for 6 cycles followed by Rucaparib 600 mg BID q 28 for 24 cycles as maintenance
