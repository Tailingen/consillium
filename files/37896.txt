Mitomycin as a Hyperthermic Peritoneal Perfusion in Treating Patients With Malignant Ascites
RATIONALE: Hyperthermia therapy kills tumor cells by heating them to several degrees above normal body temperature. Peritoneal infusion of heated chemotherapy drugs, such as mitomycin, may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well mitomycin works when given as a hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion in treating patients with malignant ascites.
Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: mitomycin C
Prevention of malignant recurrence, Week 4 after treatment
Quality of life after treatment, Week 4 after treatment|Comparison of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, Pretreatment and Week 4 after treatment
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the effectiveness of laparoscopic hyperthermic perfusion of mitomycin C in preventing relapse at 4 weeks post-treatment in patients with malignant ascites.

Secondary

* Determine any improvement in the quality of life of patients treated with this procedure.

OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study.

Patients undergo laparoscopic surgery to remove ascitic fluid and any intraabdominal adhesions and to place 2 inflow and 2 outflow catheters. Mitomycin C is infused into the abdominal cavity by hyperthermic perfusion over 60 minutes.

Quality of life is assessed at study entry and at 4 weeks.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.
