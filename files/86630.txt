Evaluation of Response to Biosimilar Erythropoietin Alfa Therapy in Anemic Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome
The primary objective of this study is to describe the response to treatment with biosimilar EPO alpha in MDS patients who had already been treated with "originator" EPO alpha and were responsive, and in patients who started treatment with biosimilar EPO alpha
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
Response and maintenance of ORR, response to treatment (ORR) (assessed according to the response criteria established by the International Working Group (23) in patients who initiated treatment with biosimilar EPO alfa

- maintenance of ORR (assessed according to the response criteria established by the International Working Group (23) from the date of biosimilar drug initiation), in patients previously on treatment and responsive to "originator" EPO alfa who were subsequently treated with biosimilar EPO alfa, 6 months from the start of the study
A measure of the frequency of major clinical outcomes in two groups of patients who had different modes of treatment administration with biosimilar EPO alpha, 1) DOR to EPO alpha: to biosimilar drug only in patients who started treatment with biosimilar EPO alpha; to "originator" drug + biosimilar in patients already on treatment and responsive to "originator" EPO alpha who were subsequently treated with biosimilar EPO alpha ; 2) incidence of adverse events in year/person (in both patient groups) according to NCI-CTCAE v.5.0 ; 3) number of patients who discontinued treatment with the biosimilar drug due to intolerance, loss of response, disease progression (DP), evolution into AML, or death (both groups) ; 4) number of patients who resumed the originator drug due to intolerance or failure to respond to the biosimilar drug ; 5) ORR and incidence of adverse events of patients who resumed treatment with "originator" EPO alfa after discontinuation of the biosimilar drug ; 6) incidence of evolution into AML in year/person (both groups) ; 7) OS and causes of death (both groups), 6 months from the start of the study
To date, therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of symptomatic anemia in patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS) at low to intermediate risk, with the percentage of responsive patients ranging from 15 to 63%, depending on the characteristics of the patients treated, and averaging 45%.

Significant improvement in survival and quality of life was observed in treatment-responsive patients compared with non-responsive patients.

Recently, biosimilar ESAs have been introduced into clinical practice, and in patients with renal failure anemia and anemia associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy, their efficacy and safety have been demonstrated.

However, data on the efficacy and safety of biosimilar ESAs in patients with MDS are scarce to date, and efficacy and safety data for the purpose of their approval have been mainly extrapolated from studies conducted in patients with anemia from renal failure and anemia from antineoplastic chemotherapy. In these conditions bone marrow erythropoiesis is reduced but not qualitatively impaired as in MDS.

These considerations may justify a retrospective study examining the efficacy and safety of biosimilar EPO alpha in a real-life setting in anemic MDS patients.
