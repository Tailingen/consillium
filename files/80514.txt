A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Sintilimab Plus Apatinib and Chemotherapy in Patients With HER-2 Negative Microsatellite Stability (MSS) Advanced or Metastatic Gastric (GC) or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Cancer
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab combined with apatinib and chemotherapy as First-line or second-line Therapy in Treatment of HER-2 negative MSS Advanced or Metastatic GC or GEJ Cancer. At the same time, the correlation between tissue programmed death ligand-1(PD-L1) expression and blood circulating tumor cell(CTC) counts and the efficacy of immune combination therapy was also explored.
