Camrelizumab Plus Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy or Chemoradiotherapy Versus Chemoradiotherapy in Resectable ESCC.
The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant immune combined chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy compared with traditional neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in patients with locally advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma.
Resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Camrelizumab|RADIATION: radiotherapy
EFS assessed by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1, defined as event free survival,defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of tumor progression/recurrence /death, whichever comes first, median EFS approximately over 45 months
OS, defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive, median OS approximately over 80 months|R0 resection rate, defined as complete surgery resection rate, within 28 working days after surgery|DFS, defined as the time from the date of surgery who completed R0 resection to local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first;, median DFS approximately over 40 months|HRQoL, defined as quality and nutrition assessment, approximately 48 months|pCR, pCR is defined as pathological complete response(ypT0/TisN0), within 28 working days after surgery|MPR, MPR is defined as the percentage of subjects with \<10% residual tumor in the primary tumor site, within 28 working days after surgery|Adverse events (AEs), Incidence and grade (including serious adverse events \[SAEs\] and immune-related adverse events \[irAEs\]), determined according to the NCI-CTCAE 5.0 criteria, through study completion, assessed up to 50 months
biomarker testing, explore the correlation between the expression of PD-L1 and outcomes, approximately 48 months
This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT) or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) compared to neoadjuvant CRT alone for resectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
