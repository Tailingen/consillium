Modified CV Regimen in Optic Pathway Glioma
Optic pathway glioma (OPG) can result in visual deterioration. Symptomatic patients often report deficits in visual acuity (VA), visual field, visual-evoked potentials (VEPs), strabismus, proptosis, disc swelling, and other visual/neurological problems. VA itself remains one of the most important outcome measures for OPG patients, with various studies showing strong ties of VA level to overall quality of life and well-being . Maintenance of favorable VA and vision outcomes is of paramount importance in the management of OPG.

In terms of management of OPG, surgery and radiotherapy are used on a more limited basis because of location of the tumors and risk of secondary tumors, respectively. Tumor stabilization often prioritized, and chemotherapy is considered ideal for tumor stabilization in OPG, but vision is not always retained and may worsen in some cases, partially due to low radiographic efficacy and long time interval to response of the current chemotherapy regimen.

In the prior study, the investigators modified the traditional carboplatin combined with vincristine regimen by increasing the dose of carboplatin and combining with an anti-angiogenic drug. Of the 15 OPG patients, objective response rate was 80% and the time to response was only 3.3 months. 8 (53%) patients experienced an improvement in visual acuity during therapy and 6 (40%) were stable, which was higher than the historical studies.

This study was launched to further verify the clinical efficacy of the modified regimen and its effect on visual acuity improvement.
