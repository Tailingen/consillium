CMR Rate of Newly Diagnosed CML-CP Patients Treated With Nilotinib
"This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center study of complete molecular response (CMR) in adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP). The study is designed to evaluate early and deep molecular responses up to 4 years on nilotinib treatment. The primary end point is Rate of confirmed CMR in newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive CML-CP patients."
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia in Chronic Phase
DRUG: Nilotinib
Number of Participants With Confirmed Complete Molecular Response (CMR), CMR was defined as at least 4.5 log reduction of breakpoint cluster region gene/Abelson proto-oncogene (Bcr-Abl) transcipts from the standardized baseline on the international scale (equivalent to Bcr-Abl \<=0.0032% IS) with a minimum of 25,614 ABL control copies. CMR was to be confirmed by a second polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sample drawn 3 months later where the results should be less than or equal to 0.0032% with a minimum of 25,614 Abelson proto-oncogene (ABL) control copies., 4 years
Number of Participants With Complete Cytogenetic Response (CCyR) and Major Molecular Response (MMR), CCyR was defined as 0% Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) metaphases in the bone marrow. MMR was defined as a 3 log reduction of Bcr-Abl transcripts from the standardized baseline on the international scale (equivalent to Bcr-Abl â‰¤ 0.1% IS).

Bcr-Abl transcripts assessed by peripheral blood quatitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) were used for the determination of all molecular responses., 4 years|Time to CMR, CCyR and MMR, Time to CMR, CCyR, and MMR was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of first documented CMR, CCyR and MMR, respectively., 4 years|Duration of CMR, CCyR and MMR, Duration of CMR, CCyR and MMR were defined as the time from the first date of achievement of the response to the date of first documented loss of the response., 4 years|Number of Participants With Progression to Accelerated Phase/Blastic Crisis (AP/BC), Progression to AP/BC is defined as loss of CCyR, MMR, and CMR and was summarized by frequencies and percentages., 4 years|Time to Progression of AP/BC, Time to progression of AP/BC was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of first documented progression of AP/BC., 4 years|Number of Participants With Loss of CCyR, MMR and CMR, Rate of loss of CMR was defined as an increase in the Bcr-Abl transcripts to greater than 0.0032% IS. Rate of loss of CCyR was defined as an increase in the Ph+ bone marrow cells to greater than 0%. Rate of loss of MMR was defined as an increase in the Bcr-Abl transcripts to greater than 0.1% IS., 4 years|Number of Participants With CMR Who Were Dosed to 400 mg b.i.d., CMR was defined as at least 4.5 log reduction of breakpoint cluster region gene/Abelson proto-oncogene (Bcr-Abl) transcipts from the standardized baseline on the international scale (equivalent to Bcr-Abl \<=0.0032% IS) with a minimum of 25,614 ABL control copies. CMR was to be confirmed by a second polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sample drawn 3 months later where the results should be less than or equal to 0.0032% with a minimum of 25,614 Abelson proto-oncogene (ABL) control copies., 4 years|Event-free Survival, Progression-free Survival and Overall Survival, Event-free survival was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of first occurrence of any of the following: loss of Complete Hematological Response (CHR), loss of CCyR, loss of Partial Cytogenetic Response (PCyR), progression to the accelerated phase or blast crisis, and death from any cause. Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of first occurrence of any of the following: progression to the accelerated phase or blast crisis, death, and loss of CMR. Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of enrollment until death due to any cause., 4 years
