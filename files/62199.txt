Electroacupuncture for Preventing Adverse Events of Cancer Immunotherapy
This study aims to investigate the preventive effects of electroacupuncture on immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with malignant solid tumors at the neoadjuvant stage, locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic stages, who are receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) monotherapy, ICIs combined with anti-angiogenic agents, or ICIs combined with chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of electroacupuncture in preventing irAEs in a multicenter setting.

Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|The time to onset of any grade of immune-related adverse events (irAEs)., The time to onset is defined as the period from the initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICIs) treatment to the occurrence of the immune-related adverse event. Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|The incidence of any grade and Grade ≥3 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with ICIs combination therapy., IrAEs are defined as any adverse events potentially related to immune mechanisms that occur during or after ICIs treatment. Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|The incidence of any grade and Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) associated with ICIs combined with chemotherapy., TRAEs are defined as any adverse events caused by ICIs combined with chemotherapy during or after the treatment period. Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|The incidence of any grade and Grade ≥3 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with ICIs monotherapy., IrAEs are defined as any adverse events potentially related to immune mechanisms that occur during or after ICIs treatment. Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|The incidence of any grade and Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) associated with ICIs combined with anti-angiogenic agents., TRAEs are defined as any adverse events caused by ICIs combined with anti-angiogenic agents during or after the treatment period. Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|The incidence of any grade and Grade ≥3 hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism., Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|The incidence of any grade and Grade ≥3 rash., Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|The incidence of any grade and Grade ≥3 hepatitis., Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|The incidence of any grade and Grade ≥3 pneumonia., Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|The incidence of any grade and Grade ≥3 abnormal blood glucose levels., Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., 48 weeks.|Comparison of biomarker changes before and after electroacupuncture treatment., The differences in biomarkers will be monitored through hematological parameters, including: inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and changes in the proportions of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (CD4+, CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells (NK cells), regulatory T cells (Treg cells), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)), as well as tumor markers., 48 weeks.|The incidence of adverse events related to electroacupuncture treatment., Adverse events will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 to determine the proportion of side effects associated with electroacupuncture., 48 weeks.|The evaluation of the difference in quality of life before and after electroacupuncture treatment., Quality of life will be assessed using the EuroQol Five-Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). EQ-5D-5L is a standardized tool for assessing health-related quality of life, which includes five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five levels describing an individual's functional or well-being status in a specific area. Additionally, the EQ-5D-5L includes a visual analogue scale, allowing individuals to rate their overall health status on a scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best health)., 48 weeks.|16.Adherence to electroacupuncture treatment., 48 weeks.
This study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-arm clinical trial aimed at collecting data from patients with malignant solid tumors at the neoadjuvant stage, locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic stages, who are receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) monotherapy, ICIs combined with anti-angiogenic agents, or ICIs combined with chemotherapy. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture in preventing immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be formally enrolled after screening and providing informed consent. Eligible patients will receive electroacupuncture treatment, with the intervention occurring on the day before and the first day of each ICIs treatment cycle. During the treatment period, the incidence, severity, and timing of irAEs will be monitored through follow-up assessments. Additionally, questionnaires will be collected to evaluate the impact of electroacupuncture on quality of life. Blood samples will be collected for analysis of changes in inflammatory cytokines and peripheral blood lymphocyte subset proportions. The study will also assess primary and secondary outcomes, as well as adverse events.
