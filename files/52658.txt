Induction Chemotherapy With GP Versus TPF in the Treatment of Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The present study is a randomized, control, phase II study of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with Gemcitabine plus cisplatin regimen (GP) or Docetaxelï¼Œcisplatin regimen plus 5-Fluorouracil (TPF) induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) prevalence is reported to be highest in southern China, where an average of 80 cases per 100,000 population are reported each year. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is both radiosensitive and chemosensitive. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (version 1, 2013), have recommended use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or without adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) and induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by CCRT plus AC as standard treatment for NPC. However, it was unclear whether patients with NPC could benefit from IC. Recently, many new drugs including docetaxel and gemcitabine have been incorporated in the induction chemotherapy phase of NPC. The investigators designed the present study with induction chemotherapy follow by CCRT for locoregionally advanced NPC, comparing induction chemotherapy regime of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) and docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF).
