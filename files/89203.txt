Stopping TSC Onset and Progression 2B: Sirolimus TSC Epilepsy Prevention Study
This trial is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-site study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early sirolimus to prevent or delay seizure onset in TSC infants.

This study is supported by research funding from the Office of Orphan Products Division (OOPD) of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is caused by genetic mutation in TSC1 or TSC2, resulting in dysregulation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Age at time of seizure onset in TSC infants has been linked to long-term neurodevelopmental outcome in this high-risk population. Sirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor used to treat many of the symptoms of TSC, including epilepsy. This will be the first study to truly evaluate a targeted, disease-modifying drug therapy for preventing or delaying seizure onset in TSC using a rational, mechanism-based therapeutic approach.
