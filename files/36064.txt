RAD001 Plus Carboplatin in Breast Cancer Patients
This study investigates the effectiveness of combination of carboplatin and investigational agent RAD001 in triple-negative breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: RAD001|DRUG: Carboplatin
Clinical Benefit Rate (Complete Response, Partial Response, and Stable Disease That Lasts More Than 6 Months), Clinical benefit rate is defined as the number of patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) that lasts at least 6 months. Response was assessed every 2 cycles of treatment (6 weeks) by computed tomography (CT), CT/positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Overall response evaluation is based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.0 (RECIST 1.0). Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., up to 1 year|Toxicity Profile-Hematological, Reported as percentage of patients who experienced grade 3 and higher hematological adverse events (AEs) related to the study drugs., treatment period (up to 1 year) plus 30 days off treatment|Toxicity Profile-Non Hematological, Reported as percentage of patients who experienced grade 3 and higher non-hematological AEs related to the study drugs., treatment period (up to 1 year) plus 30 days off treatment
Median Progression-free Survival Time, Progression-free survival time is defined as the time from first day of treatment to the first date of disease progression or death as a result of any cause. Progression was assessed every 2 cycles of treatment (6 weeks) by CT, CT/PET, or MRI. Progression is defined using RECIST 1.0, as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., up to 1 year
The primary objective of this study was to determine clinical benefit rate (CBR) i.e.complete remission (CR) + partial remission (PR) + stable disease (SD) lasting â‰¥ 6 months, and the toxicity of RAD001 /carboplatin in women with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. Treatment consisted of intravenous carboplatin at area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) 6, later decreased to AUC 5, and subsequently to AUC 4 every 3 weeks with daily 5mg RAD001.
