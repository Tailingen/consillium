Study of Safety & Efficacy of the Combination of LJM716 & BYL719 in Patients With Previously Treated Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC)
To study the safety and efficacy of the combination of LJM716 and BYL719 against currently available treatments of physician's choice in previously treated esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients.
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: LJM716|DRUG: BYL719|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Irinotecan
Phase Ib primary outcome measure: Incidence rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)., The open-label dose escalation part of the study will be guided by a well-established statistical method/model to estimate the maximum tolerated dose(s) and/or Recommended Phase II Dose (s) guided by the safety (incidence of dose limiting toxicities), efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data., approximately 8 months|Phase II primary outcome measure: Progression free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is the time from date of start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, progression-free survival is censored at the date of last adequate assessment., Every 6 weeks from the date of the baseline computed-tomography (CT) scan until the date of first documented evidence of disease progression or date of death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 24 months.
Safety and tolerability of the LJM716-BYL719, This will be assessed by looking at the number of Adverse Events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs) changes in hematology and chemistry values, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), dose interruptions, reductions and dose intensity., Every 21 days from the date of the baseline visit until the end of study visit (about 5 months)|Best overall response (BOR), per RECIST 1.1 (Ph 1b ), BOR will be used to further assess the anti-tumor activity of LJM716-BYL719 combination versus Paclitaxel, Docetaxel or Irinotecan., Every 21 days from the date of baseline computed tomography (CT) scan until end of treatment visit (about 4 months)|Plasma concentration versus time profiles Plasma PK parameters of LJM716, BYL719, Plasma concentration versus time profiles Plasma PK parameters will be used to characterize the PK profiles of LJM716 and BYL719 when used in combination, Baseline, 2hr,4hr,8hr,24hr,48hr,96hr, 168 hr, every 21 days for 10 cycles (21 days each) and at end of treatment (about 4 months)|Overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 (Ph 1b ), Overall response rate will be used to further assess the anti-tumor activity of LJM716-BYL719 combination versus Paclitaxel, Docetaxel or Irinotecan., Every 21 days from the date of the baseline computed tomography (CT) scan until the end of treatment visit (about 4 months)|Duration of response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1 (Ph 1b ), Duration of response will be used to further assess the anti-tumor activity of LJM716-BYL719 combination versus Paclitaxel, Docetaxel or Irinotecan., Every 21 days from the date of the baseline computed tomography (CT) scan until the end of treatment visit (about 4 months)|Disease control rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1 (Ph 1b ), Disease control rate will be used to further assess the anti-tumor activity of LJM716-BYL719 combination versus Paclitaxel, Docetaxel or Irinotecan., Every 21 days from the date of the baseline computed tomography (CT) scan until the end of treatment visit (about 4 months)|Overall survival (OS) per RECIST 1.1 (for Ph 1b ), Overall survival will be used to further assess the anti-tumor activity of LJM716-BYL719 combination versus Paclitaxel, Docetaxel or Irinotecan., Every 21 days from the date of the baseline computed tomography (CT) scan until the end of treatment visit (about 4 months)|Progression free survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1 (Ph 1b ), Progression free survival will be used to further assess the anti-tumor activity of LJM716-BYL719 combination versus Paclitaxel, Docetaxel or Irinotecan., Every 21 days from the date of the baseline computed tomography (CT) scan until the end of study visit (about 5 months)
The study design included a Phase 1b dose escalation portion to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the combination of LJM716 and alpelisib, followed by an open-label, randomized Phase 2 part to compare anti-tumor activity of LJM716-alpelisib combination versus physician's choice of second-line therapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel, irinotecan). However, the phase 2 part was not conducted as the study was terminated early due to limited anti-tumor activity with LJM716-alpelisib combination observed in phase 1b.
