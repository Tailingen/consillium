Choline PET/CT and MRI for Targeted Prostate Biopsy
This research study will access the using of a radiotracer, 18F-choline PET/CT and MRI for prostate cancer in patients undergoing diagnostic prostate biopsy. Patients receive MRI guided prostate biopsies and metabolomic profiling of prostate biopsy tissues.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Prostate Cancer Imaging
Evaluation whether the odds of primary Gleason â‰¥ 3+4 are greater for image-guided biopsy (based on parametric PET/MRI) than for non-image-guided (standard) biopsy., 4 years
This is an explorative diagnostic basic research study to assess the value of 18F-choline PET/CT and multi-sequence MRI for prostate cancer in patients undergoing diagnostic prostate biopsy. Patients will receive image-guided (targeted) prostate biopsies and metabolomic profiling of prostate biopsy tissues to evaluate underlying metabolic changes in comparison with pathological Gleason grading.
