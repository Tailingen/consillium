SUPERvised Three-month Exercise Program in MEN With Prostate cAncer Receiving Androgen-deprivaTioN thERapy
The goal of this single blind placebo-controlled intervention study is to examine the impact of a supervised training program on disease-related quality of life and physical fitness in patient with advanced prostate cancer compared to usual care. The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

* What is the impact of exercise on quality of life
* What is the impact of exercise on physical fitness

Participants will have an individual training program with supervised training by physiotherapists.

Researchers will compare with usual care to see if advice about exercise has significant less effect than an supervised training program.

The following questionnaires are used: European Organization for Research and Treatment for Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). A higher score represents a higher response level. So a higher score for the functional scale represents a higher level of physical functioning but a higher score for the symptoms scale represents a higher level of symptoms., 6 months|change of quality of life assessed with EORTC QLQ-C30 (0-100 points per scale), To examine the impact of a supervised training program on disease-related quality of life in patient with advanced prostate cancer compared to usual care.

The following questionnaires are used: Short Hebrew International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-sh). Both categorical and continuous indicators of physical activity will be used from the IPAQ short form. There are three categories:1. inactive, 2. minimally active, 3. HEPA active (health enhancing physical activity; a high active category). The continuous score is reported in median MET-minutes (metabolic equivalent of task-minutes). For categorical and continuous score is a higher score equivalent of higher physical functioning., 3 months|change of fitness assessed with IPAQ-sh (categories (1-3) and continues (MET-minutes)), To examine the impact of a supervised training program on disease-related quality of life in patient with advanced prostate cancer compared to usual care.
