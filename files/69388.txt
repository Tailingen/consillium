A Patient-centered Communication Tool (UR-GOAL) for Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Their Caregivers, and Their Oncologists
This is a pilot study to evaluate the usability and feasibility of a patient-centered communication tool (University of Rochester-Geriatric Oncology Assessment for acute myeloid Leukemia or UR-GOAL) among 15 older patients with AML, their caregivers, and oncologists.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BEHAVIORAL: Behavioral: UR-GOAL communication tool
Feasibility (Recruitment Rates), Percentage of patients who consented to the study ultimately completed the study intervention and post-intervention assessment, Four weeks|Usefulness, Usefulness was assessed using the Preparation for Decision Making Scale (mean score range from 1 to 5, and higher scores indicate greater usefulness), Four weeks
Pre-post Changes in the Following Outcomes:Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions (PEPPI), A valid and reliable assessment of perceived self-efficacy of older patients interacting with physicians; score on 5-item scale, ranging 5-25; higher score corresponds to greater perceived efficacy. Pre-post changes from baseline to four weeks., Four weeks|Pre-post Changes in the Following Outcomes: General Anxiety Disorder-7, A 7-item screening tool for anxiety; ranging 7-21; higher score corresponds to greater anxiety symptoms. Pre-post changes from baseline to four weeks., Four weeks|Pre-post Changes in the Following Outcomes: Geriatric Depression Scale-15, A 15-item valid and reliable screening tool for depression in older adults. This will be used for patients; ranging 0-15; higher score corresponds to greater depressive symptoms. Pre-post changes from baseline to four weeks., Four Weeks
Older adults with AML and their caregivers may benefit from help and support in understanding their treatment options. This pilot study seeks to evaluate the usability and feasibility of the UR-GOAL communication tool. The UR-GOAL tool will incorporate conjoint analysis to elicit patient preferences as well as assessments of fitness and prognostic awareness.
