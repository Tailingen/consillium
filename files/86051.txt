A Dose Escalation Study Evaluating CPI-818 in Relapsed/Refractory T-Cell Lymphoma
This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, first in human study of CPI-818, an oral interleukin-2-inducible tyrosine kinase (ITK) inhibitor for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) T-cell lymphoma.. This trial will study the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of CPI-818 as a single drug.
