Administration of ONS Based on Purple Sweet Potato in Head and Neck Cancer Patients With Radiotherapy
The goal of this clinical trial is to compare the effect of local food-based oral nutritional supplements (ONS) containing immunonutrients (omega-3 and anthocyanins) on nutritional status and inflammatory response in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is there any effect of local food-based oral nutritional supplements (ONS) containing immunonutrients (omega-3 and anthocyanins) on the nutritional status?
* Is there any effect of local food-based oral nutritional supplements (ONS) containing immunonutrients (omega-3 and anthocyanins) on inflammatory response?

Participants will participants will receive ONS in powder form ready to brew as much as 2 servings per day for 3 weeks.

Researchers will compare the effect of giving ONS containing immunonutrients compared to standard ONS to see the effect on nutritional status and inflammatory response

The intervention group received ONS which contained immunonutrients with a composition consisting of purple sweet potato flour, egg white flour, whey protein, olive oil, omega 3 powder, sugar, and creamer. While the control group received a placebo in the form of standard ONS (isocaloric) with a composition of powdered skim milk, coconut oil, sugar, maltodextrin, and creamer.
