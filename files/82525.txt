Cancer
DRUG: GSK1120212
evaluate the effect of a high-fat, high-calorie meal on the PK of a single dose of GSK1120212 administered to subjects, â€¢ Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to time t (AUC(0-t)), AUC(0-inf), Cmax, and tmax., Predose - 168 hours post dose period 1 and 2
assess the short-term safety and tolerability of single oral doses of 2.0 mg of GSK1120212 administered to subjects, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests, and AEs, Day 1/periods 1 and 2, Day 8 period 2 and follow-up.
open-label, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, crossover study with incomplete wash-out to evaluate the effect of a high-fat, high calorie meal on the single dose PK of GSK1120212 in subjects with solid tumors. Subjects will be assigned to a fast/fed sequence according to the randomization code provided to the sites by GSK with subjects randomized to one of 2 possible treatment sequences (Table 1) with each sequence consisting of 2 treatments: a single 2.0 mg dose of GSK1120212 administered under fasted conditions and a single 2.0 mg dose of GSK1120212 administered with a high-fat, high-calorie meal
