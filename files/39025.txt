Study of LVGN6051 (CD137 Agonist Antibody) in Advanced or Metastatic Malignancy
The study of LVGN6051-201 is designed to use a bridging dose escalation to quickly establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) as well as the recommended Phase 2 dose(s) (RP2D) of LVGN6051, both as a single agent (monotherapy) and in combination with a fixed dose of anti-PD-1 antibody (Pembrolizumab) in the treatment of advanced or metastatic malignancy.

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including determination of DLTs and serious AEs (SAEs), Adverse events will be assessed, and severity will be assigned by using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0., up to 24 months|MTD or RDE or RP2D, maximal tolerated dose, recommended dose for expansion or recommended phase 2 dose, up to 24 months
DCR, DCR will be documented as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). DCR per RECIST v1.1, iRECIST, and Cheson/Lugano criteria., up to 24 months|PK parameter AUC, Area under the serum concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be determined., up to 24 months|PK parameter Cmax, Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) will be summarized., up to 24 months|PK parameter t1/2, Serum concentration half-life t1/2 will be summarized., up to 24 months|ADA to LVGN6051, The presence of ADA directed against LVGN6051 will be determined., up to 24 months
Based on the dose escalation results from the study of LVGN6051-101, a bridging dose escalation (3+3) is used in study of LVGN6051-201. The traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation algorithm to identify the MTD and/or RDE and RP2D of LVGN6051 as a single agent (monotherapy) and in combination with pembrolizumab. The first stage of the study is the single agent dose escalation and expansion phase (Part A). The second stage of the study is the combination dose escalation and expansion phase (Part B). Patients will be considered evaluable for safety and tolerability if they receive at least one dose of LVGN6051 or pembrolizumab at the specified cohort dose. Patients in all parts of the trial will remain on therapy until confirmed disease progression or for 2 years, whichever occurs first. However, patients who are clinically unstable will discontinue following the initial assessment of disease progression
