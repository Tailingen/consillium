Gefitinib With Chemotherapy or Anti-angiogenesis in NSCLC Patients With Bim Deletion or Low EGFR Mutation Abundance
This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized, phase II clinical trial, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of gefitinib versus combination of gefitinib and doublet chemotherapy or apatinib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R point mutation), accompanied with Bim deletion or low activating EGFR mutation abundance.

DRUG: gefitinib combined with chemotherapy|DRUG: gefitinib combined with apatinib|DRUG: gefitinib single agent
Progression free survival, From start of anti-cancer therapy until progression or death, 8 weeks
overall survival, evaluated in the 36th since treatment begain, 36 months|objective response rate, Evaluated the rate of complete response and partial response in the 8 weeks since treatment began, 8 weeks|disease control rate, Evaluated the rate of complete response，partial response and stable disease in the 8 weeks since anti-cancer therapy, 8 weeks|duration of response, interval between the time which complete response or partial response happened and progressive disease or death, 8 weeks|safety evaluation, Safety observation indexes were listed as following: adverse events and serious adverse events (according to CommonTerminology Criteria Adverse Events Version 4.03), physical exam, vital signs(blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate,body temperature), weight variation, laboratory examination(hematology, blood biochemistry, urinalysis and so on), electrocardiograph(ECG),ultrasonic cardiogram(UCG), ect., 8 weeks|compare quality of life, Quality of Life Questionnaire(including QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13) evaluated since treatment began.At the end of the trial, the differences between the two indicators were compared with Mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM), where the baseline was scored as a covariant and the treatment group as a fixed variable. In addition, the baseline values of the two scores, the value of each visit, and the change value of the baseline were statistically described., 24 months
BIM (bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death) deletion polymorphism and low EGFR mutation abundance were poor clinical response markers to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in NSCLC patients who had EGFR mutations.This is a phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of combination treatment for patients harboring above risk factors.

Advanced EGFR mutated NSCLC Patients with Bim deletion or EGFR low mutation abundance were randomized divided into following three treatment groups:

A: gefitinib 250mg Qd combined with doublet chemotherapy: pemetrexed (500mg/m²，day 1 ，intravenously) plus carboplatin (AUC=5,day 1,intravenously) every 21 days.

B: gefitinib 250mg Qd combined with apatinib 250mg/d intravenously per 21 days. C: gefitinib 250mg Qd
