The purpose of this study is to measure the level of AlloMax™ incorporation (cellular infiltration, collagen production, and neovascularization) in human breast reconstruction. The hypothesis is that the AlloMaxTM will have incorporation equivalent to adjacent breast capsule at the 3-4 month time point.
