Simultaneous Integrated Boost Technique in Breast Cancer Radiotherapy
Adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery has been shown to improve both local control and overall survival. Dose escalation of the tumor bed by addition of a boost after whole breast radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence in invasive breast cancer.

Simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) techniques have been shown to provide more conformal treatment plans than conventional sequential boost, in addition, SIB enables a reduction in the overall treatment time by 1 week compared to conventional boost techniques.

The proposed study is aimed at evaluating radiation-induced toxicity in patients treated with breast-conserving surgery in combination with radiotherapy using SIB technique.
