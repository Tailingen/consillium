Glutaminase Inhibitor CB-839 and Azacitidine in Treating Patients With Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This phase I/II trial studies the side effects of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 in combination with azacitidine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome that has spread to other places in the body. Glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 and azacitidine may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Multilineage Dysplasia|Blasts 20-30 Percent of Bone Marrow Nucleated Cells|Blasts 20-30 Percent of Peripheral Blood White Cells|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia|High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome|IPSS Risk Category Intermediate-2|Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Glutaminase Inhibitor CB-839
Number of Participants With a Response, Response is Complete Remission (CR) + Partial Remission (PR) + Marrow CR = Complete Remission (CR) is \</=5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines\* Persistent dysplasia will be noted, Peripheral blood; hemoglobin\>/=11 g/dL, Platelets \>/= 100x10\^9/L ,Neutrophils \>/=1.0 x 10\^9/L, Blasts = 0%. Partial Remission (PR) is all CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except: Bone marrow blasts decreased by \</=50% over pretreatment but still \>5% Cellularity and morphology not relevant. Marrow CR is Bone marrow: \</= 5% meyloblasts and decreased by \>/= 50% over pretreatmentâ€  Peripheral blood: if HI responses, they will be noted in addition to marrow CR., Up to 5 years, 4 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 (CB-839) in combination with azacitidine (AZA) for patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To explore the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CB-839 in combination with AZA. II. To explore the pharmacodynamics (PDn) of CB-839 in combination with AZA. III. To assess overall survival, event-free survival and duration of response of CB-839 in combination with AZA.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes on days 1-7.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.
