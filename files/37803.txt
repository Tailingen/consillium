Overall survival, Hepatocellular carcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma : Overall survival is defined as the survival 5 years after the inclusion., 5 years
Overall survival, Hepatocellular carcinoma :Overall survival is defined as the survival after 5 years of inclusion., 5 years|Disease free survival, Cholangiocarcinoma : 2 and 5 years after surgical resection, 2 and 5 years|Progression time under chemotherapy, Cholangiocarcinoma : Time of progression under chemotherapy is defined by the delay between the start of chemotherapy and tumor progression (appearance of a new lesion or increase in size of more than 30%), Time of progression under chemotherapy up to 5 years
The collection of data from patients with CHC and cholangiocarcinomas who are cancers with poor prognosis is a major challenge to improve patients'care (diagnosis, prognosis); facilitate the search for new therapeutic targets and the follow-up of clinical studies; and develop personalized treatments.
