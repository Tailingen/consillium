Irradiation-based Myeloablative Conditioning Followed by Treg/Tcon Immunotherapy in HSCT
To evaluate if hyper-fractionated TBI or TMLI followed by Treg/Tcon adoptive immunotherapy improve cGvHD/disease free survival after allogeneic HSCT in patients affected by high-risk acute leukemias or other hematologic malignancy where HSCT is indicated.

chronic GvHD/relapse-free survival, To evaluate if irradiation based myeloablative conditioning followed by Treg/Tcon adoptive immunotherapy improve chronic GvHD/relapse-free survival (GRFS) after allogeneic HSCT in patients affected by acute leukemias or other hematologic malignancies where HSCT is indicated. GRFS will be assessed in subgroups of patients separated according to HLA-matching with the donor and type of disease (acute myeloid lekemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, other), 2 years

Improving cGvHD/disease free survival in patients with high-risk acute leukemias or other hematologic malignancy where HSCT is indicated with the use of a regulatory T cell based protocol. Hyper-fractionated Total Body Irradiation or Total Marrow and Lymphoid Irradiation based conditioning will be followed by the infusion of T regulatory and T conventional cell adoptive immunotherapy and a purified CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell graft. Incidence of Non Relapse Mortality, Relapse, acute Graft versus Host Disease, chronic Graft versus Host Disease, as well as probability of cGvHD/disease free survival will be assessed in patient subpopulations separated according to HLA-matching with the donor (HLA-matched HSCT and HLA-haploidentical HSCT) and type of disease (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, myeloproliferative disease, and other).
