Endoscopic Ultrasound Predict the Sensitivity of Stage II / III Rectal Cancer Preoperative Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy
The purpose of this study is to determine the role of endoscopic ultrasound measurement of the primary tumor maximum diameter changes in absolute / relative values in predicting the tumor regression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer
Endoscopic ultrasound measurement of the primary tumor maximum diameter changes in absolute / relative values, 3 months
We use endoscopic ultrasound to measure the primary tumor maximum diameter changes to predict the tumor regression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer
