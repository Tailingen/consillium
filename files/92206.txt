Implementation of a System-level Tobacco Treatment Intervention
The proposed study plans to adapt and study the implementation and effectiveness of integrating Clinical and Community Effort Against Secondhand smoke Exposure (CEASE) into the thoracic oncology setting using mixed methods.
Smoking Cessation|Lung Cancer
OTHER: CEASE|OTHER: Usual Care Tobacco Treatment Services
Smoking cessation Rate, Biochemical verification of smoking cessation, 6 Months
Documentation of tobacco treatment, Assess documentation of smoking assessment and provision of treatment ( medication and referral for behavioral counseling), 2 months after CEASE
In particular the study aims to see if participants are asked about their smoking status and what services are offered if someone indicates being a former or current smoker. Findings from this study will help improve a standard of care at this clinic and allow us to understand what type of tobacco treatment services are preferred by patients.

* Adaption of CEASE will entail exit interviews with patients and individual interviews with clinical staff to identify and address facilitators and barriers to the implementation process.
* Effectiveness of CEASE will be measured through questionnaires \& biochemical verification of smoking status using a pre-test/post-test study design before (usual care)and after implementation (CEASE)
