Pembrolizumab With Chemotherapy and MK-4830 for Treating Participants With Ovarian Cancer (MK-4830-002)
The primary objective is to evaluate in participants with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), whether the reduction from baseline in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) at Cycle 3 (ΔctDNA) is larger in participants receiving MK-4830 + pembrolizumab in combination with standard of care (SOC) therapy than in those receiving pembrolizumab + SOC therapy.
High-grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma|Ovarian Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|BIOLOGICAL: Avastin|BIOLOGICAL: MK-4830|DRUG: Docetaxel
Change From Baseline in Circulating Tumor Deoxyribonucleic Acid (ctDNA), Blood samples were collected to determine levels of ctDNA. The fold change in the mean mutant/tumor molecules per mL (MTM/mL) at Cycle 3 from baseline is presented., Baseline and Week 7
Change From Baseline in Neoadjuvant ctDNA, Change from baseline in neoadjuvant ctDNA., Baseline and Week 7|Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate, Percentage of participants with all surgical specimens collected during the interval debulking surgery that are microscopically negative for residual tumor by logistic regression modeling of pathological Complete Response (pCR)., Up to approximately 12 weeks|Chemotherapy Response Score (CRS), Percentage of participants with residual disease assessed by logistic regression modeling of chemotherapy response score (CRS). CRS is a 3-tiered scoring system (CRS 1-3) based on the pathological analysis of surgically removed omental masses, with CRS3 (complete or near-complete response) characterized by the lack of residual tumor cells in the omentum or presence of tumor foci up to 2 mm maximum size. A binary response of CRS3 (no residual disease) vs. non-CRS3 (residual disease) will be assessed., Up to approximately 12 Weeks|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study drug., Up to approximately 40 Weeks|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study drug., Up to approximately 28 Weeks
