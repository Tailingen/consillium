Trifluridine/Tipiracil in Combination With Capecitabine and Bevacizumab in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients.
The aim oh this study is to determine the safety and recommended dose of trifluridine/tipiracil plus capecitabine and bevacizumab combination (part 1, dose escalation phase) and to assess its activity in previously untreated mCRC patients who are deemed not eligible for intensive chemotherapy (part 2, expansion phase).

This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and activity of trifluridine/tipiracil in combination with capecitabine and bevacizumab in mCRC. The first part (Part 1) of the study will consist in a dose-escalation assessment of the safety of the treatment in subjects with previously untreated mCRC deemed not fit for irinotecan- and/or oxaliplatin- based regimens (i. e. FOLFOX/XELOX/FOLFIRI/FOLFOXIRI with or without targeted agents).

The second part (Part 2) will be an open-label phase 2 study with a Fleming's single-stage design to evaluate the ORR of the study treatment at the recommended dose established in the first part of the study in the same patients' population.

Trifluridine/tipiracil, capecitabine and bevacizumab will be administered in 28-days cycles until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicities, or patients' refusal.
