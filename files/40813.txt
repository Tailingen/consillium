Newly-diagnosed Pediatric T-cell ALL Protocol
This is a prospective, multicenter study conducted within the Chinese Children's Cancer Group (CCCG). The study aims to evaluate whether the addition of three novel agents, dasatinib, venetoclax and homoharringtonine, can improve the minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative remission rate, enhance event-free survival (EFS), and reduce the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

End-of-induction(EOI) measurable residual diseases (MRD)-negativity rate in patients with non-ETP T-ALL treated with dasatinib plus 4-drug induction compared to those treated with 4-drug induction in CCCG-ALL-2020, For this objective a one-sided comparison of probabilities (proportions) will be made. Let p1 and p2 be the probability of aciieving negative EOI MRD on the CCCG-ALL-2020 (historical control) and the current study respectively, then the one-sided alternative hypothesis H0: p2=p1 vs. H1: p2\>p1 will be tested. The procedure of two-sample comparison of proportions with the Z-statistic (Normal approximation) will be applied.

The current CCCG-ALL2020 data show that among 573 evaluable patients 510 (89%) achaived negative EOI MRD. Benchmarking on these as historical data, a total sample size of n=550 and interim sample size n1=300 provides sufficient popwer for the planned analyses outlined above if the true MRD negativity probability is 0.92 or higher, as shown in the table below.

An interim analysis at n1=300 evaluable patients will be conducted for possible abstract submission or publication., The expected study duration is approximately 5 years.|For non-ETP T-ALL patients with positive measurable residual diseases (MRD) on day 46, to compare MRD-negativity rate before consolidation between those receiving single agent homoharringtonine at dose of 1mg/m2 vs. 2mg/m2 for 7 days, The comparison will be condicted by testing the two-sided hypothesis H0: p1=p2 vs. H1: p1â‰ p2, using the Z test (normal approximation) at alpha=0.10 level.
