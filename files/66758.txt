Research Development（RD）13-02 Chimeric Antigen Receptor(CAR) -T Cell Injection for Patients With r/r Cluster Of Differentiation 7（CD7）+ T-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia(ALL)/T-Lymphoblastic Lymphoma(LBL) /Acute Myelogenous Leukemia(AML)
This is a single-arm, open-label, single-center, phase I study. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of CD7 CAR-T therapy for patients with CD7-positive relapsed or refractory T-ALL/LBL/AML, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of CD7 CAR-T in patients.
