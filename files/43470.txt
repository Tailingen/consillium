Trastuzumab Based Therapy in HER2 Positive AGC
Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is an effective therapy in HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer (AGC). However, the efficacy of routine trastuzumab therapy and its association with clinicopathologic factors remain unclear. The object of the study is to determine whether the addition of trastuzumab to first-line chemotherapy improves efficacy compared with chemotherapy alone in HER2 positive AGC.
Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: H+CT
OS, OS was defined as time from the beginning of first line therapy to death, 8 years|PFS, PFS was measured from the start of first line therapy to the date of progressive disease or death, with censoring of patients who were lost to follow-up., 8 years
A total of 98 patients with HER2 positive AGC were enrolled in this prospective observational study. All patients were treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy as the first line therapy. Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab were analyzed, clinical and pathological data were collected to evaluate the potential prognostic factors on progressive free survival.
