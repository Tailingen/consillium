Rituximab in Combination With Glofitamab and Polatuzumab Vedotin in Patients With Previously Untreated Aggressive B-cell Lymphoma Ineligible for R-CHOP
In the present trial the chemotherapy- light treatment concept R-Pola-Glo will be evaluated that combines the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (R) with the ADC polatuzumab vedotin (Pola) and the (BiMabs) glofitamab (Glo) in elderly and/or medical unfit and previously untreated patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma. The outcome and feasibility data obtained here will be used for further clinical development of this new chemolight triple combination.
Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse
DRUG: Glofitamab|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Polatuzumab vedotin
1 year progression-free survival (PFS) rate of the first 80 patients, defined as the time from the day of inclusion until disease progression (PD) or relapse after complete remission (CR), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, 12 months
Event-free survival (EFS), defined as the time from the day of inclusion until progressive disease or relapse after complete remission, initiation of subsequent systemic antilymphoma treatment, radiation of single PET-CT positive lesions or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., 54 months|Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the day of inclusion until death due to any cause, 54 months|Response rate at different timepoints, Response rates after 2 cycles (during target dose phase), 6 cycles (end of target dose phase before start of consolidation phase) and 12 cycles (end of treatment following completion of consolidation phase). i.e., complete remission (CR) rate, partial remission (PR) rate, overall remission rate (ORR: CR+PR), stable disease (SD) rate and progressive disease (PD) rate, 6 weeks, 18 weeks, 36 weeks|Relapse rate, defined as the number of patients with relapse, divided by the number of patients achieving C, 54 months|Conversion rate of PR to CR, defined as the number of patients achieving mCR at the end of study treatment (including consolidation phase) divided by the number of patients achieving PR after end of target dose phase (before start of consolidation phase), 54 months|Duration of response (DoR), defined as the time from documentation of CR until relapse or lymphoma associated death without documented relapse, 54 months|Rate and type of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), 54 months|Rate of secondary malignancies, defined as the number of patients with secondary malignancies divided by the number of analyzable patients, 54 months|Treatment-related death rate, defined as the number of treatment related deaths during therapy or up to 2 months after the end of study treatment, but before the start of further treatment, divided by the number of analyzable patients, 54 months|Protocol adherence, number and duration of R-Pola-Glo cycles, number and duration of glofitamab maintenance, cumulative and relative doses of rituximab, glofitamab and polatuzumab., 54 months|Patient-reported outcomes for quality of life (QoL): EORTC QLQ-C30, measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 (a 30-item questionnaire developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer). All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., 54 months|Patient-reported outcomes for quality of life (QoL): FACT-Lym, measured by FACT-Lym (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lymphoma; scores from 0 - 4; The higher the score, the better the QOL), 54 months
Rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative patients after end of target phase and at end of treatment, 54 months|Duration of molecular remission for MRD negative patients, 54 months|Outpatient setting w/o hospitalization, Proportion of patients in whom R-Pola-Glo medication can be administered in the outpatient setting as recommended by the safety board (judged before treatment and including modification after cycle 1 or 2) and no hospitalization occurs following 24hrs after last administration., During Cycle 1-6|Outpatient setting with hospitalization, Proportion of patients in whom R-Pola-Glo medication can be administered in the outpatient setting as recommended by the safety board (judged before treatment and including modification after cycle 1 or 2) but are hospitalized within 24hrs after last administration for timely medical assistance from treating physician for symptoms developed following treatment with R-Pola-Glo., During Cycle 1-6|Cycles safely administered in outpatient setting per patient., During Cycle 1-12
