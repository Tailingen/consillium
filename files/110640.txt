SBRT Treatment for Lung Metastasis From Soft Tissue Sarcoma
In this study the investigators treat PM oligometastatic patients with SBRT. Our objective is to evaluate rate of local control of treated lesions in patients treated with Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for lung metastases from STS.
Metastasis From Malignant Tumor of Soft Tissues
RADIATION: Lung metastasis from soft-tissue sarcoma
Local control of treated lesions, Evaluation of proportion of patients free from progression from starting radiotherapy, 12 months
Overall survival of treated patients, Evaluation of proportion of patients alive, 4 years|Disease free survival of treated patients, Evaluation of proportion of patients alive and free from progression, 4 years
The investigators started to treat PM oligometastatic patients with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.

The investigators objective is to evaluate rate of local control of treated lesions in patients treated with Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) for lung metastases from soft-tissue sarcomas. Overall and disease free survival will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.
