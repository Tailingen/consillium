A Study of D3L-001 as Monotherapy in Subjects With HER2-Positive Advanced Solid Tumors
This first-in-human (FIH) study, multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of D3L-001 in subjects with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors.
