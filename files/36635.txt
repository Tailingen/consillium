tMG-E was an extension study designed to provide the participants who completed Study tMG an opportunity to receive tocilizumab and collect clinical data to provide long-term safety and efficacy information on tocilizumab in participants with gMG.

After receiving blinded study treatment (tocilizumab or placebo) in Study tMG for 16 weeks, participants were eligible to enroll in the tMG-E extension study. Participants were to enter Study tMG-E within 8 weeks after completing their Week 16 visit in Study tMG.

Study tMG-E consisted of an Open-Label treatment Phase up to 16 weeks.
