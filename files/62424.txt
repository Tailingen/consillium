Diagnostic positive yield, After biopsy by navigational bronchoscopy, the biopsy tissue was tested for lung cancer pathology. A positive diagnosis was defined when the pathology report was a neoplastic lesion (benign or malignant tumor). A positive diagnosis was also made if the pathology report was a granulomatous lesion (with tuberculosis or fungus). If the pathology was reported as an inflammatory cell infiltration or other non-specific inflammation in the lungs, the subject underwent another pathology biopsy after at least 3 months of follow-up to rule out false-positive results due to a change in the site of the lesion., One month after the patients were enrolled
Adverse events, Patients underwent a follow-up period of 3 days after navigational tracheoscopic biopsy, and subjects were followed for adverse events such as hemoptysis, pneumothorax, and mediastinal emphysema., 3 days after navigational tracheoscopic biopsy
Early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is of great significance, in which navigated tracheoscopic biopsy is an important tool for confirming the diagnosis of early lung cancer. Conventional navigation software realizes airway reconstruction and guides biopsy by recognizing differences in HU values on computed tomography scans. It is difficult for conventional navigation software to recognize the reconstruction due to the special characteristics of small airways that are susceptible to interference and collapse. Therefore, an AI deep learning approach can realize accurate construction of small airways and guide accurate biopsy. This study intends to validate the clinical effectiveness and safety of the AI-constructed airway tree navigation system in the navigational diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPLs).
