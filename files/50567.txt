Sym015 (Anti-MET) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor Malignancies
This is the first study to test Sym015 in humans. The primary purpose of this study is to see if Sym015 is safe and effective for patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies without available therapeutic options.

Part 1: Occurrence of DLTs During Cycle 1 of Sym015 Administration, The primary objective of Part 1 was to assess the safety and tolerability of Sym015 on a Q2W schedule. This was assessed by evaluating the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) during Cycle 1 of Sym015 administration. Q2W = every second week., Cycle 1, the initial 28-day period of Q2W dosing|Part 2: Documented, Confirmed Objective Response (OR), The primary objective of Part 2 was to evaluate the antitumor activity of Sym015 when administered at the Q2W RP2D to patients in the different cohorts. Documented OR was defined as partial response \[PR\] or complete response \[CR\]) as assessed by CT or MRI using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 at any time during trial participation by Investigator assessment. PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters; CR = Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalisation of tumour marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis).

In the first part of the study (Part 1, dose-escalation), Sym015 was evaluated for safety and tolerability. Additionally, the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) was to be determined. Sym015 was given at different dose levels on an every second week (Q2W) dosing schedule. Each patient was given one single weight based dose level.

In the second part of the study (Part 2, dose-expansion), dosing was to be at the RP2D on a Q2W dosing schedule. Three cohorts were included:

* Basket Cohort: Patients with KRAS wild-type (WT) advanced solid tumor malignancies with MET-amplification and without therapeutic options. Patients must have no prior therapy with MET-targeting agents, except a subset of patients having received prior therapy with a MET-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). As of December 2018, accrual to this cohort was suspended.
* Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) MET-Amplified Cohort: Patients with advanced NSCLC with MET-amplification, and without available therapeutic options. Patients may have received prior therapy with MET-targeting and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting agents.
* NSCLC with MET exon 14 skipping alteration (METex14del) Cohort: Patients with advanced NSCLC METex14del, and without therapeutic options. Tumors need not be MET-amplified, and patients may have received prior therapy with MET-targeting and/or EGFR-targeting agents.
