GM-CT-01 Plus 5-Fluorouracil as Third- or Fourth-Line Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a Phase II, multi-center study of GM-CT-01 which has been shown to increase the anti-tumor activity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in mice. 5-FU is a chemotherapy drug commonly used in cancer patients. In this Phase II study, patients with colon cancer which has spread, despite treatment with approved therapies, will receive GM-CT-01 plus 5-FU in monthly cycles for at least 2 cycles or until their disease progresses.

safety of GM-CT-01 plus 5-FU, Frequency and type of AE/SAE and ancillary clinical indicators including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance and quality of life., 20 patients completed treatment
A Phase I study of 40 patients showed that GM-CT-01 in different doses plus 5-FU was well tolerated in patients with different types of solid tumors who failed standard, approved treatments. The main reason for doing this Phase II study in advanced colorectal cancer patients is to verify the safety observations in the early Phase I study and further evaluate the efficacy of these drugs' combination to stabilize tumors, preventing further growth and potentially shrink tumors.
