SS1P and Pentostatin Plus Cyclophosphamide for Mesothelioma
Background:

* Malignant mesothelioma is a form of cancer that develops on the protective lining that covers the body's internal organs. It most often occurs on the lining of the lungs and chest wall or the lining of the abdomen. There is no known cure for malignant mesothelioma, so researchers are searching for new ways to treat it.
* Mesothelin is a protein that is found in mesothelioma and other types of cancer cells. An experimental cancer drug called SS1P is designed to attack cells that have mesothelin while leaving healthy cells alone. Researchers want to test how effective SS1P is when it is given with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide. These drugs help suppress the immune system and may make the SS1P more effective.

Objectives:

- To study the effectiveness of SS1P plus two drugs that suppress the immune system to treat malignant mesothelioma.

Eligibility:

- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have malignant mesothelioma in the chest or abdomen.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests. They will also have imaging studies.
* The first treatment cycle will last 30 days. Up to three 21-day cycles of treatment will follow.
* In the first cycle, participants will have pentostatin on days 1, 5, and 9. They will have cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 12. They will have SS1P on days 10, 12, and 14.
* On the next three cycles, participants will have pentostatin on day 1.They will have cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 4. They will have SS1P on days 2, 4, and 6.
* Participants will have frequent blood tests and other studies. They will receive all four cycles of treatment as long as there are no severe side effects.
* Participants will have regular followup visits as directed by the study doctors.

Response Assessment, Response was assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete response (CR) is complete disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions. Progressive disease (PD) disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions. Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started., 52 months and 4 days|Count of Participants With SS1P Antibody Formation, Development of antibodies following treatment with SS1P. The goal was to delay development of antibodies to SS1P so a patient could get a second cycle of therapy with SS1P., On last day of last dosing cycle, end of cycle 1 (day 30)|Count of Participants With Serious and Non-serious Adverse Events Assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) Who Were Administered SS1P and Pentostatin or Cyclophosphamide, Here is the count of participants with serious and non-serious adverse events assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0). A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence. A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned., Date treatment consent signed to date off study, approximately 64 months and 26 days|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) in Drug Lot FIL129J01, Should any 2 patients within the first 3 to 6 patients experience treatment limiting toxicity requiring cessation of treatment prior to the conclusion of the first cycle, the maximum tolerated dose will have been exceeded and patients will be enrolled to the next lower dose., Days 1, 3, and 5 of a 21 day cycle
Overall Survival, The Kaplan-Meier was used to determine the probability of overall survival from on-study date until death or last follow-up (calculated from the date of study entry until the date of analysis)., 36 months|Progression-free Survival, Defined as the time interval from the start of treatment to documented evidence of disease progression. Progressive disease is assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, and is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study LD (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., 36 months|Duration of Response, DOR is assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and is measured from the time measurement criteria is met for complete response or partial response (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Complete response is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to\<10mm. partial response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. Progressive disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study LD (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study)., up to 2.5 years
Count of Participants SS1P Cycles Received Following Onstudy, Here are the number of participants who had SS1P cycles during cycle 1-6., Cycles 1-6, up to 180 days
BACKGROUND:

Mesothelin is a cell surface glycoprotein present on normal mesothelial cells that is highly expressed in many human cancers including mesothelioma, lung and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. SS1 (dsFv) PE38 is a recombinant anti-mesothelin immunotoxin that has undergone phase I testing and has been evaluated in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. SS1 (dsFv)PE38 is highly immunogenic and the majority of patients develop antibodies to it at end of one cycle. Pre-clinical studies demonstrate that SS1(dsFv)PE38 may be administered multiple times in combination with an immune-depleting regimen consisting of pentostatin and cyclophosphamide.

OBJECTIVES:

Mesothelioma Pilot Objective

-To assess the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of a conditioning regimen of pentostatin

and cyclophosphamide in combination with SS1(dsFv)PE38

-To monitor antibody formation to SS1(dsFv)PE38 and to assess the impact of the conditioning regimen on the formation of these antibodies

Mesothelioma Positive Cancers Dose De-escalation Pilot Objective

-To determine the safety profile and recommended phase 2 dose of SS1P (dsFv)PE38 in

drug lot FIL129J01 using dosing regimen A in patients with mesothelioma, lung and pancreatic adenocarcinoma

Phase 2 and Lung and Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Expansion Pilot Objective

-To evaluate objective tumor response in subjects with pleural mesothelioma, peritoneal

mesothelioma, lung and pancreatic adenocarcinoma using Regimen A

ELIGIBILITY:

* Patients with one of the following histologically confirmed malignancies:

  * malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma with epithelial or biphasic tumors having less than a 50% sarcomatoid component who have previously been treated on at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen with progressive disease documented prior to study entry
  * advanced (Stage IIIB/IV) lung adenocarcinoma who have had at least one prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients who received an approved targeted therapy as first-line treatment should have also received chemotherapy prior to study entry.
  * recurrent, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
* Measurable disease by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for pleural mesothelioma or by RECIST criteria for peritoneal mesothelioma, lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma

DESIGN:

-During the mesothelioma pilot phase of this study, the first eleven mesothelioma patients

enrolled in this study received a conditioning regimen of pentostatin on days 1, 5 and 9 of the first cycle and day 1 of subsequent cycles in combination with cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 12 of the first cycle and days 1 through 4 of subsequent cycles (Regimen A) while the next 8 mesothelioma patients received conditioning regimen of pentostatin on days 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17 of the first cycle and day 1 and 5 of subsequent cycles in combination with cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 20 of the first cycle and days 1 through 8 of subsequent cycles (Regimen B). SS1P was administered every other day for six days (3 doses) beginning on the day after the last pentostatin dose in each cycle for both regimens.

* In the mesothelin positive cancers dose de-escalation pilot study, a maximum of 12 patients with mesothelioma or lung or pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in a 3+3 design to test up to 2 decreasing dose levels of SS1P administered in combination with cyclophosphamide and pentostatin on the Regimen A schedule for safety.
* In the phase 2 mesothelioma and pancreatic and lung adenocarcinoma pilot expansion portions of the study, a two-stage Minimax phase II trial design will be used to enroll up to 16 evaluable subjects with pleural mesothelioma (cohort 1), up to 10 evaluable subjects with peritoneal mesothelioma (cohort 2), up to 10 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (cohort 3)and up to 10 evaluable subjects with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (cohort 4) who will receive treatment on Regimen A.
* Treatment cycles will be repeated for up to four cycles if patients do not develop neutralizing antibodies, which will be assessed by a biological assay 14 and 20 days (+/- 2 days) following the first dose of SS1P in each cycle (corresponding to Days 24 and 30 of Cycle 1, and Days 16 and 22 of Cycles 2 through 4)
* Toxicity will be assessed by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Version 4.0 of Common Terminology Criteria in Adverse Events (CTCAE)
* Tumor response assessments will be performed at the end of 2 cycles and at the end of treatment
* Tumor biopsies will be performed before treatment, after 2 cycles, and after the last cycle or at follow-up.
