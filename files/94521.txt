CT-322 in Combination With Radiation Therapy and Temozolomide to Treat Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme
Rationale:

In light of the demonstrated activity of anti-angiogenesis agents in rGBM, it is reasonable to postulate that adding these agents to standard RT and chemotherapy in the up-front management of newly diagnosed GBM may improve the clinical benefit. This study will examine the safety and tolerability of adding CT-322 to the standard radiation therapy/temozolomide (RT/TMZ) backbone of treatment for newly diagnosed GBM
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: CT-322|DRUG: Temozolomide|PROCEDURE: Radiation Therapy
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of CT-322 administered in combination with standard focal brain RT/TMZ to subjects with newly diagnosed GBM, 15 Â± 5 days post the last dose of study drug|Establish the recommended Phase 2 dose for the QW schedule of CT-322 for use in this combination, Every 4 weeks until MTD or 2.0 mg/kg dose level is reached
To describe the PK of TMZ and its active metabolite (MTIC) when TMZ is administered alone and when it is co-administered with CT-322 to a subset of approximately 12 subjects with newly diagnosed GBM, Cycle 1, day 1 of RT phase of treatment|To describe the peak and trough concentrations of CT-322 when administered alone and when co-administered with TMZ, RT phase treatment weeks 1-3, 5, 7-10, day 1. Post RT phase cycles 1-3, day 1; then day 1 every 3 cycles thereafter; EOS visit|To evaluate the immunogenicity of CT-322 when administered in combination with standard focal brain RT/TMZ to subjects with newly diagnosed GBM, RT phase treatment weeks 1, 5, 7-8, day 1. Post RT phase cycles 1 and 3, day 1; then day 1 every 3 cycles thereafter; EOS visit|To characterize the plasma biomarker response to CT-322 when administered in combination with standard focal brain RT/TMZ to subjects with newly diagnosed GBM, RT phase treatment weeks 1-3, 5, 7-8, day 1. Post RT phase cycles 1-3, day 1, then day 1 every 3 cycles thereafter; EOS visit
