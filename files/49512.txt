Total Marrow and Lymphoid Irradiation and Chemotherapy for High-Risk Acute Leukemia
RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total marrow and lymphoid irradiation before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant helps stop the growth of leukemia cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may achieve brand new hematopoietic recovery. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells, resulting in graft versus-host disease.

PURPOSE: This study is to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of total marrow and lymphoid irradiation conditioning when given together with combination chemotherapy and allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant in treating patients with high-risk acute leukemia.
Acute Leukemia
RADIATION: total body irradiation|RADIATION: total marrow and lymphoid irradiation
Incidence of toxicity, scored on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria version 4.03, Toxicity information recorded will include the type, severity, and the probable association with the study regimen., Up to 100 days after stem cell infusion|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The cumulative incidence of relapse/progression will be calculated as a competing risk using the Gray method., The time from start of protocol therapy to death, relapse/progression, or last follow-up, whichever comes first, assessed up to 2 years
Incidence of transplantation-related mortality, In the field of transplantation, toxicity is high and all deaths without previous relapse or progression are usually considered as related to transplantation., 6 months|Incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after transplantation, Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease is a severe short-term complication created by infusion of donor cells into a foreign host., Day +100|Incidence of chronic GVHD after transplantation, Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease is a severe long-term complication created by infusion of donor cells into a foreign host., 1 Year|Incidence of relapse after transplantation, The return of disease after its apparent recovery/cessation., 1 year and 2 years|Menstrual recovery after transplantation, The percentage of female patients who have resumed menses is usually considered as related to ovarian function., 1 year and 2 years|Overall survival after transplantation, 1 year and 2 years, The percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive for a certain period of time after they were diagnosed with or treated for a disease, such as cancer.
Patient receives preparative therapy including cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) of 10 Gy or total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) of 12-20 Gy, and starts immunosuppressive therapy using cyclosporine or tacrolimus, methotrexate-based prophylaxes, followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration.
