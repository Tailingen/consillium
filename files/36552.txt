Fast Food, Fatigue, and Inflammation
This double-blind, randomized crossover trial assessed inflammation and fatigue following a fast-food-type meal (saturated fat) compared to a healthier meal (monounsaturated fat) in breast cancer survivors and benign controls (women who had an initial abnormal test for breast cancer).
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Saturated Fat Meal|OTHER: Oleic Sunflower Oil Meal
Post-Meal Change in C-reactive Protein, Serum CRP was obtained from blood drawn before the meal as well as 2, 4, and 7 hours post-meal. It was measured with the Vascular Injury Panel 2 Multispot Kit on an MSD Imager 2400 (both Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA), following kit instructions., Blood samples were obtained before the meal (baseline) as well as 2, 4, and 7 hours post-meal|Post-Meal Change in Serum Amyloid A, Serum Amyloid A was obtained from blood drawn before the meal as well as 2, 4, and 7 hours post-meal. It as measured with the Vascular Injury Panel 2 Multispot Kit on an MSD Imager 2400 (both Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA), following kit instructions., Blood samples were obtained before the meal (baseline) as well as 2, 4, and 7 hours post-meal|Change in Intercellular adhesion molecule-1, sICAM-1 was obtained from blood drawn before the meal as well as 2, 4, and 7 hours post-meal. It was measured with the Vascular Injury Panel 2 Multispot Kit on an MSD Imager 2400 (both Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA), following kit instructions., Blood samples were obtained before the meal (baseline) as well as 2, 4, and 7 hours post-meal|Change in Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, sVCAM-1 was obtained from blood drawn before the meal as well as 2, 4, and 7 hours post-meal. It was measured with the Vascular Injury Panel 2 Multispot Kit on an MSD Imager 2400 (both Meso Scale Discovery, Rockville, MD, USA), following kit instructions., Blood samples were obtained before the meal (baseline) as well as 2, 4, and 7 hours post-meal|Fatigue at Follow-Up Visits, The 30-item Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short form assesses behavioral, cognitive, physical, and affective expressions of fatigue. It provides a very good measure of the multidimensional aspects of fatigue, allows for comparisons between fatigued and non-fatigued individuals, and has subscales measuring general, physical, emotional, mental, and vigor aspects of fatigue, as well as a total score., The survey was administered upon admission to the Clinical Research Center before the meal at both visits and at 18- and 30-month follow-up visits.
