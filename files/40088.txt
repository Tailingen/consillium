Neoadjuvant vs Adjuvant in Locally Advanced Recurrent NPC
A multicenter randomized controlled study of surgery combined with neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy for locally advanced recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma in comparison to surgery combined with adjuvant therapy
Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: endoscopic surgery|DRUG: Neoadjuvant therapy,Toripalimab Injection and Gemcitabine based therapy|DRUG: Adjuvant therapy in experimental group,Toripalimab Injection and Gemcitabine based therapy|DRUG: Adjuvant therapy in control group,Toripalimab Injection and Gemcitabine based therapy
EFS, Event free survival, From randomization and any events(like:progression or toxic effects precluding surgery;inability to resect all gross disease; progression;surgical complications precluding initiation of adjuvant therapy; recurrence;death) up to 1 year
OS, Overall Survival, Time interval of randomization and death of any cause, up to 5 years|DFS, Disease free survival, From randomization to recurrence, metastasis or death, up to 1 year|LRFS, Local recurrence free survival, From randomization to local recurrence or death, up to 1 year|DMFS, Distant metastasis free survival, From randomization to distant metastasis or death, up to 1 year|pCR, pathologic complete response, Time point of pathological tumor evaluation after sugery, around 2 weeks after sugery|ORR, Objective response rate,Proportion of CR, PR in all patients., Time point of imaging evaluation before treatment(or randomization) and before surgery,up to 1 year|DCR, Disease Control Rate,Proportion of CR, PR and SD in all patients., Time point of imaging evaluation before treatment(or randomization) and before surgery,up to 1 year|DoR, Duration of response,the time from the first assessment of the tumour as CR or PR to the first assessment of PD or death from any cause (whichever event occurs first)., First date of response to the date of progression, up to 5 years|1-and 2-year PFS rate, one- and two-year progression free survival rate, one- and two-year|1-and 2-year OS rate, one- and two-year overall survival rate, one- and two-year
Eligible patients are randomized into the control group and the experimental group.

Patients in the experimental group would be administrated 2 courses of neoadjuvant therapy before surgery.After endoscopic surgery, patients would continue to receive 2-4 courses of chemotherapy and 8 courses of immunotherapy.

Patients in the control group would firstly receive endoscopic surgery, followed by chemotherapy and immunotherapy. In total, 4 to 6 courses of chemotherapy and 10 courses of immunotherapy would be administrated.
