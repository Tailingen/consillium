Treatment of Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations With SQUID Liquid Embolic Agent (CHOICE)
The objective of this study is to further establish that SQUID, an alternative liquid embolic agent with specific properties, is a safe and effective alternative in bAVM endovascular treatment strategy available to date. Therefore, the performance of SQUID will be documented and its safety of use will be confirmed in current practice.
Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation
DEVICE: SQUID non-adhesive liquid embolic agent
modified Rankin Score (mRS), mRS is a scale used to measure the degree of handicap or dependence in daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological handicap.

The scale ranges from 0 to 6, running from perfect health, without symptoms, to death.

0 - No symptoms

2. - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
3. - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
4. - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
5. - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
6. - Death., 3 to 6 months after the last embolisation session
