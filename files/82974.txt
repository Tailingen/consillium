Study on the Application of Convenient Foot-control Exhaust Method in Endoscopic Thyroidectomy
Endoscopic thyroidectomy developed rapidly in recent years, and the most popular surgical approach was endoscopic thyroidectomy by bilateral areola approach, but some operative steps was required optimization. One of the most annoying problem was the smog blurring endoscopic lens during surgery. The researcher summarized a set of convenient foot-control exhaust method and carried out this prospective study.
Thyroid Cancer|Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma|Thyroidectomy|Endoscopy
DEVICE: used of the Pressure adjustable foot-control method|DEVICE: direct exhaust
Flap separation time, Flap separation time was acquired from endoscopic video was the period from endoscopy into the body to building up operation space., 1 day after surgery|Glandular excision time, Glandular excision time was defined from incising cervical white line to removing Berry ligament., 1 day after surgery|Central lymph node dissection time, Central lymph node dissection time: was from separating central lymph node to the specimen removed., 1 day after surgery
Times of wiping lens, Times of wiping lens calculated from endoscopic video after operation was defined the times of wiping lens from endoscopy into the body to central lymph node removed., 1 day after surgery|Volume of intraoperative blood loss, Volume of intraoperative blood loss was estimated the volume of intraoperative blood loss., 1 day after surgery|Volume of Postoperative drainage, Volume of Postoperative drainage was accurately calculated the total volume while the drainage tube removed after operation., 1 day，2 day，3 day after surgery|The number of identifying parathyroid glands, The number of identifying parathyroid glands was evaluated at postoperation while parathyroid glands was identified during surgery., 1 day after surgery|Blood PTH level, measurement of PTH level in blood, preoperative, first day after operation, one week after surgery, two months after surgery.|Blood calcium level, to measure the blood calcium level in the blood, before surgery, the first day after surgery, one week after surgery, two months after surgery.
The patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma were included according to the inclusive criteria and randomly divided them into two groups (foot-control exhaust group and direct exhaust group). The foot-control exhaust group used the foot-control exhaust method by the way of adjustable Pressure to intermittent exhaust, while direct exhaust group exhaust through the Trocar hole. Comparison of operation time, times of wiping the endoscopic lens, volume of postoperative drainage, and number of identified parathyroid gland between two groups.
