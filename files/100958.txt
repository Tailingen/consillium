A Simple Breath Test to Detect Liver Cancer and Monitor Liver Conditions
Liver cancer is often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. The VOCAL2 study is developing a simple, non-invasive breath test to help detect liver cancer earlier and monitor liver conditions like cirrhosis. The test analyzes tiny chemicals in exhaled breath called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to identify signs of liver disease.

Who can take part?

Adults aged 18 or older who:

Have liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma), or Have liver cirrhosis or primary sclerosing cholangitis, or Have tummy symptoms but a normal liver scan. What's involved?

Participants will:

Give a breath sample after fasting for 6 hours. Answer a few health questions. Allow access to relevant medical records. The appointment lasts about 1 hour at an NHS hospital. Benefits \& Risks

This research could lead to an earlier, easier way to detect liver cancer, but there's no direct health benefit for participants.

There are no risks, as breath sampling is completely non-invasive and safe. Where is the study happening? Led by Imperial College London, running in NHS hospitals across the UK.

Who is funding the study? The study is funded by Rosetrees and Stoneygate Trust.

Diagnostic Accuracy of VOC Analysis for Liver Cancer Detection, This outcome measures the ability of volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis in exhaled breath to accurately detect liver cancer. Breath samples will be analysed using thermal desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). The diagnostic accuracy will be determined by comparing VOC profiles with histological confirmation or radiological imaging as the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU-ROC) will be reported., Day 1
