A Study Comparing of P-GEMD Regimen Versus P-Gemox Regimen With Untreated Early-Stage NUAT or Advanced-Stage ENKTL.
Extranodal natural-killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with a poor prognosis. Notably, patients with advanced-stage disease or early-stage non-upper aero-digestive tract (NUAT) involvement frequently develop hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), necessitating more effective therapeutic interventions. This Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Clinical Study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of P-GEMD and P-Gemox in the treatment of newly diagnosed early NUAT or advanced-stage ENKTL.
NK-T-Cell Lymphoma, Extranodal
DRUG: P-GEMD|DRUG: P-Gemox
Complete Response (CR) Rate, Response is assessed according to the lugano criteria., 5.5years
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Response is assessed according to the lugano criteria., 5.5years|Progression-Free-Survival (PFS), From the time subjects were enrolled to the time of disease progression (in any way) or death from any cause., 5.5years|Duration of Response (DOR), The time between meeting the criteria for treatment effectiveness (first recorded complete or partial response) and the first clear recurrence or progression., 5.5years|Overall survival (OS), From the date of inclusion to date of death, irrespective of cause., 5.5years|EBV-DNA load level (before and after treatment), EBV-DNA was detected at time points before and after treatment., 5.5 years|Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity., The safety of the drug was evaluated by NCI-CTC AE 5.0 standard.Hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity., From the first day of medication to 28 days after the last dose
This Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Clinical Study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of P-GEMD and P-Gemox in the treatment of newly diagnosed early NUAT or advanced-stage ENKTL. The P-GEMD regimen (pegaspargase; gemcitabine; etoposide; mitoxantrone hydrochlorid liposome; dexamethasone) was administered intravenously every 3 weeks until up to 6 cycles of planned therapy. The P-Gemox regimen ( Pegaspargase, Gemcitabine, and Oxaliplatin) was administered intravenously 3 weeks until up to 6 cycles of planned therapy.
