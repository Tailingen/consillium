An Early Phase Study of Abraxane Combined With Phenelzine Sulfate in Patients With Metastatic or Advanced Breast Cancer
This phase 1b study will determine the safety and efficacy of combined treatment of Abraxane and phenelzine sulfate (Nardil) for metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer.

Participants may be eligible to join this study if they are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer or inoperable locally advanced breast cancer.

All participants will receive a combination of intravenous Abraxane and an oral dose of phenelzine sulfate. Abraxane will be administered weekly for the first 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle for 3 consecutive cycles. Phenelzine sulfate will be taken daily for the duration of the 3 cycles. Five patient cohort groups will receive a progressively increasing dose of phenelzine sulfate. Safety and efficacy will be assessed weekly over the 3 cycles of treatment.

Although both drugs have been used in clinical care for more than a decade, they have not been intentionally combined together in a cancer therapy setting. This means that the combined effect of these two drugs has not been documented. This is being addressed in this study.

Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) will be administered intravenously over 3 cycles at a fixed dosage of 100mg/m2 to each study participant. This dose will be administered weekly for the first 3 consecutive weeks, over the 4 week cycle, before commencing the second and third cycles.

In addition to the fixed dose of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, all patients will receive a continuous daily oral dose of phenelzine sulfate across all three cycles,

Each of the five patient cohort groups will receive a progressively higher starting dose of phenelzine sulfate, consecutively. Cohort A will start at 15mg/day and will be increased to 30mg/d by week 2 and further increased to 45mg/d for week 3, which will be maintained throughout the study. Cohort B will start at 45mg/d and will be held constant throughout the Study. Similarly, Cohort C, D \& E will start at 60, 75 and 90mg/d, respectively, and will also be held on this dose throughout the study. The decision to escalate the dose for the next cohort will be made on the basis of the number of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) events observed during the first 8 weeks in the preceding cohort group.

Phenelzine sulfate compliance will be monitored weekly based on drug tablet returns.
