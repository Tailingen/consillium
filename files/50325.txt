Merestinib In Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer And Solid Tumors
This research study is examining merestinib (a targeted therapy) as a possible treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that was found to have a specific change in the MET gene (a MET exon 14 mutation); or as a treatment for solid tumors that have an alteration in the NTRK gene (an NTRK1, 2, or 3 rearrangement).

Overall Response Rate (ORR) - MET Exon 14 Cohort, ORR was defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best response on treatment in MET Exon 14 Cohort based on RECISTv1.1 criteria., ORR evaluation starting at cycle 2 day 28 and at the end of every 2 cycles of treatment thereafter. The median treatment duration is 1.20 months with range (0.26 months - 28.81 months).
Median Overall Survival (OS) - MET Exon 14 Cohort, OS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time from study entry to death or censored at date last known alive., Survival data collection in long-term follow-up every 3 months. Median follow-up for survival is of 24.28 months with range (0.46 months - 32.13 months).|Median Progression-free Survival (PFS) - MET Exon 14 Cohort, PFS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration between randomization and documented disease progression (PD) defined per RECIST 1.1 criteria. or death, or is censored at time of last disease assessment., Disease was evaluated at cycle 2 day 28 and at the end of every 2 cycles thereafter and in long-term survival followed-up every 3 months. Median follow-up for survival is of 24.28 months with range (0.46 months - 32.13 months).|Median Duration of Response (DOR) - MET Exon 14 Cohort, DOR, estimated using the Kaplan Meier method, is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) per RECISTv1.1, until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. Patients without PD are censored at the date of last disease assessment., Radiologic evaluation starting at cycle 2 day 28 and at the end of every 2 cycles of treatment thereafter. The median of treatment duration is 1.20 months with range (0.26 months - 28.81 months).|Grade 4-5 Treatment-related Toxicity Rate, All grade 4-5 adverse events (AE) with treatment attribution of possibly, probably or definite based on CTCAEv4 that are not resolved in accordance with treatment guidelines were counted. Rate is the proportion of treated participants experiencing at least one of these adverse events as defined during the time of observation., AE evaluated on treatment on day 1 and 15 on cycle 1, and day 1 on each cycle thereafter. The median of treatment duration is 1.20 months with range (0.26 months - 28.81 months).
This is an open-label, phase II study of merestinib in patients with advanced NSCLC with a MET exon 14 mutation or patients with advanced cancer harboring an NTRK1, 2, or 3 rearrangement. Twenty patients with a MET mutation will be evaluated in a single-arm design. A small separate cohort of 5 NTRK patients will be evaluated for exploratory purposes.

Merestinib (LY2801653) is a small molecule that has been shown in vitro to be a reversible type II ATP-competitive inhibitor of MET. Pre-clinical testing also has shown merestinib to inhibit several other receptor tyrosine oncokinases including MST1R, FLT3, AXL, MERTK, TEK, ROS1, NTRK1/2/3, and DDR1/2 and the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2.
