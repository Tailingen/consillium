A Study of OMX-0407 in Patients With Previously Treated Solid Tumours That Can't be Removed Surgically
The main purpose of the dose escalation phase of the study is to determine the safety of different doses of OMX-0407.

The dose expansion (phase Ib) part of the study will evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability at a dose determined in the dose escalation,
Solid Tumor
