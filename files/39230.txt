Ramucirumab Combined With Nab-paclitaxel, Lobaplatin, and S-1 in Neoadjuvant Transformation Therapy for Advanced Gastric Cancer
Abstract Objective: Ramucirumab is a VEGFR2 antagonist. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ramucirumab combined with nab-paclitaxel, lobaplatin and S-1 in neoadjuvant and conversion therapy for advanced gastric cancer.

Methods and analysis: This study is a prospective single-center, randomized controlled and open label clinical study containing two cohorts with 140 patients of advanced gastric cancer (Cohort A n=70; Cohort B n=70). The main efficacy indicator is pathological complete response (pCR) of the cancer after neoadjuvant or conversion therapy. The secondary efficacy indicators are R0 resection rate after neoadjuvant or conversion therapy, the incidence of adverse events (AE), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), total response rate and total response time, disease control rate (DCR) and duration of overall response (DOR).

Ethics: Ethics approval has been obtained from the Ethics Committee at the First Affiliated Hospital (Xijing Hospital) of Air force Military Medical University (KY20232220-F-1).
