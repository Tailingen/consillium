Adagrasib + SRS for Patients With Metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC With Untreated Brain Metastases
This is a single arm phase 2 trial is to evaluate the efficacy of SRS plus adagrasib for the treatment of brain metastases for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 30 patients will be enrolled on this study.
