TACE Plus Sorafenib Versus TACE Alone for Recurrent Intermediate Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The study is a multicenter phase III randomized trial. The purpose is to investigate both the efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus sorafenib versus TACE alone for recurrent intermediate hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

COMBINATION_PRODUCT: TACE+sorafenib|PROCEDURE: TACE
Overall Survival, Defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause. Patients who withdraw or who are lost to follow-up will be censored at the date last known to be alive. Patients remaining alive throughout the duration of the study will have their survival time censored on the date last seen alive., 2 years
Progression Free Survival, Defined as the time from randomization until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever happens first. Patients who withdraw or who are lost to follow-up will be censored at the date last known to be alive and progression free. Patients not having an event will be censored at the date last seen alive., 2 years|Time To Progression, Defined as the time from randomization until disease progression., 2 years|Objective Response Rate, The ratio of patients with complete response or partial response among all patients., 2 years|Disease Control Rate, The ratio of patients with complete response, partial response or stable disease among all patients., 2 years|Adverse Events, Grade 3 or severer hematological or non-hematological adverse events during the treatment period using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 4)., 2 years|Scoring of Quality of Life, Using the third edition of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL questionnaire (QLQ-C30)., 2 years
The trial will recruit 162 patients with recurrent intermediate HCC, and they will be randomized (1:1) into two groups (TACE+sorafenib group, TACE group). Patients in TACE+sorafenib group will receive TACE one day following oral sorafenib (initial dose: 400mg BID). Patients in the TACE group will receive TACE alone.
