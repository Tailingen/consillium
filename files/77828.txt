Biomarkers in Young Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is studying biomarkers in tissue samples from young patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Leukemia
GENETIC: western blotting|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Correlations between levels of pY-Stat3 and levels of upstream cytokine receptors|Association of constitutive and/or increased pY-Stat3 and c-kit genotype
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the frequency of ligand-independent phosphorylation of Stat3 in a small cohort of samples from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia including, but not limited to, samples known to express mutated c-kit.
* Measure the level of Stat3 phosphorylation in these samples after stimulation of three key cytokine receptors expressed on hematopoietic cells IL-6R, G-CSFR, and c-kit.

OUTLINE: Cryopreserved samples are analyzed for levels of various components of the Stat3 pathway via western blotting.
