Purpose in Life Survey
At present, there is no empirical data that specifies the likely prevalence of purpose in life disruption among various clinical populations. Between one-third and one-half of cancer survivors report some degree of existential distress during or after their treatment, but these findings are not specific to the domain of purpose in life.

To address the aforementioned gap, we propose to conduct a survey study to determine the prevalence of purpose disruption in two clinical populations and determine if the prevalence of purpose disruption in these populations is different from that of a normative population.
