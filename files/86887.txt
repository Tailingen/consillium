First-in-human Dose Escalation and Expansion Study With the SIRPα-directed Monoclonal Antibody BYON4228
This is the first-in-human study with BYON4228, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against SIRPα.
Lymphoma
DRUG: BYON4228 + Rituximab
Incidence of dose-limiting toxicities, Part 1, 28 days
Objective response rate, Part 2, 2 years
This study includes a dose escalation part (Part 1) in which the MTD and dose regimen for expansion (RDE) will be determined, and an expansion part (Part 2) to evaluate efficacy and safety in specific patient cohorts.

BYON4228 is a humanized IgG1 mAb directed against SIRPα. BYON4228 binds SIRPα expressed on innate immune cells, especially monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. BYON4228 blocks binding of SIRPα to CD47 and inhibits signaling through the CD47-SIRPα axis.
