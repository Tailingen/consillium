Trastuzumab Deruxtecan for Subjects With HER2-Positive Gastric Cancer or Gastro-Esophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma After Progression on or After a Trastuzumab-Containing Regimen (DESTINY-Gastric04)
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) compared with ramucirumab and paclitaxel (Ram + PTX) in participants with HER2-positive gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have progressed on or after a trastuzumab-containing regimen and have not received any additional systemic therapy.
Gastric Cancer, Adenocarcinoma|Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Trastuzumab deruxtecan|DRUG: Ramucirumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Overall Survival in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Compared With Ramucirumab in Combination With Paclitaxel, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of randomization until death from any cause., Time from date of randomization until death (due to any cause), up to approximately 36 months
Progression-free Survival in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Compared With Ramucirumab in Combination With Paclitaxel, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from date of randomization until first objective radiographic tumor progression or death from any cause, based on Investigator assessment., Time from date of randomization until first objective radiographic disease progression or death (due to any cause) whichever occurs first, up to approximately 36 months|Objective Response Rate in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Compared With Ramucirumab in Combination With Paclitaxel, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) criteria as assessed by Investigator., From start of treatment to date of documented disease progression, up to approximately 36 months|Duration of Response in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Compared With Ramucirumab in Combination With Paclitaxel, Duration of response (DoR) is defined time from the initial response (CR or PR) until documented tumor progression or death from any cause and based on Investigator assessment., Time from initial response (CR or PR) to date of documented disease progression or death (due to any cause) whichever occurs first, up to approximately 36 months|Disease Control Rate in Participants Who Were Administered Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Compared With Ramucirumab in Combination With Paclitaxel, Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieved CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for a minimum of 6 weeks during study treatment, based on Investigator assessment., From start of treatment to date of documented disease progression, up to approximately 36 months|Incidence of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), Serious Adverse Events (SAE), Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), and Physical Examination Findings, Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0., From time subjects signs informed consent form up to 40 days after last study dose|Serum Concentrations for Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, total anti-HER2 antibody, and Active Metabolite MAAA-1181a, Cycles 1-4 and subsequent cycles on Day 1 pre- and post-infusion (each cycle is 28 days)|Percentage of Participants Who Are Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA)-Positive (Baseline and Post-Baseline), The immunogenicity of trastuzumab deruxtecan will be assessed., Cycles 1, 2, and 4 on Day 1 pre-infusion, then every 4 cycles on Day 1 pre-infusion, 40 day follow up until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow up whichever occurs first (each cycle is 28 days)|Percentage of Participants Who Have Treatment-emergent ADAs, The immunogenicity of trastuzumab deruxtecan will be assessed., Cycles 1, 2, and 4 on Day 1 pre-infusion, then every 4 cycles on Day 1 pre-infusion, 40 day follow up until death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow up whichever occurs first (each cycle is 28 days)
This study will assess the efficacy and safety of T-DXd compared with Ram + PTX in participants with HER2-positive (defined as immunohistochemistry \[IHC\] 3+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization \[ISH\]+) gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma (based on \[American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines who have progressed on or after a trastuzumab-containing regimen and have not received any additional systemic therapy. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either T-DXd or Ram + PTX treatment. The primary objective will assess overall survival. Secondary objectives will further assess progression-free survival, objective response rate, duration of response, disease control rate, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of T-DXd.
