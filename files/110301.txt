Unusual Toxicity Induced by Radiotherapy
In order to evaluate the physiopathological knowledge of the different pathological manifestations associated with individual radiosensitivity, it seems essential to carry out this pilot study. It has agglomerated homogeneous tissue samples to identify new biomarkers for patient diagnosis and follow-up, and may predict the therapeutic response. These knowledge will help to treatment customization.
Cancer
OTHER: skin biopsy|OTHER: tumor biopsy|OTHER: blood sample
skin fibroblast radiosensitivity, The number of residual double strand break at 24 hours (number of 53BP1 foci) after a dose of 2 Gy will be quantified with indirect immunofluorescence, 2 to 3 months after skin biopsy
tumor cells radiosensitivity, The number of residual double strand break at 24 hours (number of 53BP1 foci) after a dose of 2 Gy will be quantified with indirect immunofluorescence, 2 to 3 months after tumor biopsy
