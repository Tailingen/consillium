A Phase II Trial of CyberKnife Radiosurgery to Perioptic Tumors
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery has on tumors near the critical structures of the eye (optic apparatus).

The investigators hypothesize that hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy via the CyberKnife Â® can deliver tumor ablating doses of radiation to perioptic lesions safely and effectively while sparing the adjacent optic apparatus and normal brain tissues from receiving damaging doses of radiation.

The CyberKnife system is a type of radiation machine that uses a special system to precisely focus large doses of x-rays (radiation) on the tumor. The device is designed to concentrate large doses of radiation onto the tumor so that injury from radiation to the nearby normal tissue will be minimal.
