Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy, Phase 1 Study of CMG901
This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion, Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary anti-tumor activity of CMG901.

The dose escalation phase (Part A) will determine the MTD of CMG901 in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory advanced solid tumor for which there is no available standard therapy likely to confer clinical benefit, or the subject is not a candidate for such available therapy based on a modified 3+3 dose escalation design (an accelerated dose titration design followed by traditional 3+3 dose escalation design).

The dose expansion phase (Part B) will be conducted in subjects with advanced solid cancer with failure of standard treatment or no standard treatment who are Claudin 18.2 positive to preliminarily explore the efficacy and to determine the RP2D of CMG901.
