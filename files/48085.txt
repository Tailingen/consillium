Perioperative Chemotherapy in Gastric Cancer
Patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of stomach or esophagogastric junction without previous therapy will be treated with one of two chemotherapy regimens perioperatively. One group of the patients will receive 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel (FLOT), the second group will receive Oxaliplatin and Capecitabin (XELOX). Primary endpoint of the study is the proportion of patients who complete all allocated treatment.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Fluorouracil|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Proportion of patients who complete all the treatment per protocol, Completed treatment protocol is considered as 4 cycles neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by curative surgery and 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy., Up to 2 months
Chemotherapy toxicity profile, To determine and compare toxicity profile in patients receiving XELOX or FLOT regimen, at the end of XELOX cycle (each cycle is 21 days) and FLOT cycle (each cycle is 14 days)|Surgical complications rate, To determine surgical complication rate and profile after different types of regimens in neoadjuvant settings, up to 90th day after surgery|1-year disease-free survival rate, To determine the efficacy of FLOT regimen compared to XELOX regimen during the first year after the surgery, 1 year after surgery|Correlation between histopathological regression and disease-free survival, To determine correlation between histopathological regression and disease-free survival in different chemotherapeutic settings, 2 years of follow-up after the last cycle of chemotherapy|Median overall survival, To determine the efficacy of FLOT regimen compared to XELOX regimen by assessment of overall survival, 5 year follow up after the last cycle of chemotherapy|Histopathological regression rate (Becker regression criteria), To determine histopathological regression rate after FLOT regimen compared to XELOX regimen in neoadjuvant settings, 2 weeks after surgery
328 Ñ€atients with resectable (T1b-4 and/or N-/+, M0) adenocarcinoma of the stomach or the esophagogastric junction without previous therapy will be included in this study. After staging laparocopy patients will be randomized to receive preoperatively 4 cycles FLOT or 4 cycles XELOX followed by curative surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy will be given as 4 cycles of FLOT or 4 cycles XELOX. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who fully adhered to all the allocated treatment per protocol. Secondary endpoints are pathological regression grade, progression free survival, overall survival, chemotherapy and surgery complications rates.
