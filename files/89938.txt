Dexmedetomidine Addition to Morphine in Patients With Metastatic Cancer
Pain is a common symptom in patients nearing the end of life. Its prevalence varies between 30 and 75%. Nowadays, morphine is the most used molecule as first line treatment of moderate to severe pain. However, this molecule, considering its side effects, may contribute in part to the discomfort of these patients and may increase the pre-existing agitation or delirium. There is therefore a need to find new agents, other than morphine, for pain control at the end of life, without the limitations that the morphine molecule has. The author reviewed the literature on the role of dexmedetomidine in the treatment of refractory symptoms in palliative care, including pain. It is an agonist of the adrenergic alpha 2 receptor having a sedative, analgesic action and a morphine sparing effect demonstrated postoperatively.

This study aims primarily at demonstrating that dexmedetomidine has a beneficial role in the treatment of pain in patients with metastatic cancer.
