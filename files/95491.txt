Zinc as Enhancer in Immune Recovery After Stem Cell Transplantation for Hematological Malignancies
Patients affected by multiple myeloma undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) are enrolled at the moment of stem cell collection. They are randomized 1:1 in two groups at the moment of the graft. Patients of the Control group take only standard antimicrobial prophylaxis after SCT; the Sample group takes in addition a daily oral supplementation of Zinc Sulfate (600 mg/die) from day +5 until day +100 after SCT. Laboratory tests are performed on peripheral blood samples.
Stem Cell Transplant Complications
DRUG: Zinc Sulfate Oral Product|DRUG: Levofloxacin 500Mg Oral Tablet|DRUG: Fluconazole 200mg tab|DRUG: Acyclovir 400 MG
Thymic output improvement by TRECs, Measure of T cell receptor excision circles levels on peripheral lymphocytes (TRECs), calculated as number of copies of TRECs/mcLin droplet digital PCR, increase of TRECs levels from day +30 until day +100 after transplant|Thymic output improvement by flow cytometry, Measure of circulating T naive lymphocytes by 8-colour flow-cytometry. T naive are identified as CD4+/CD8+ lymphocytes with the coexpression of CD45RA, CD27, CD28. The value is estimated as number of T naive/mcL, days +30, +100 after transplant
Variations in circulating lymphocyte populations, Flow cytometry to determine the variations of t cell subpopulations after graft, days +30, +100 after transplant|Immune competence, quantitative polymerase chain reaction on peripheral blood aiming to quantify Torquetenovirus viral load, days +30, +100 after transplant|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], case report form to report side effects, days +30, +100 after transplant
Patients affected by multiple myeloma undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) are enrolled at the moment of stem cell collection. They are randomized 1:1 in two groups at the moment of the graft. Patients of the Control group take only standard antimicrobial prophylaxis after SCT; the Sample group takes in addition a daily oral supplementation of Zinc Sulfate (600 mg/die) from day +5 until day +100 after SCT. The aim of the study is to investigate the immune reconstitution in presence of Zinc, focused on thymic reconstitution. Laboratory tests are performed on peripheral blood samples, collected at 4 time-points: two before transplant (at the moment of the enrollment and the day before conditioning) and two after transplant (day +30 and +100).
