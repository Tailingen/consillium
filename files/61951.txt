Can We Predict of the Response of High Risk Non Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Patients to Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin? The Role of Immunological Markers
Intravesical BCG is the mainstay adjuvant management of high risk NMIBC. Adequacy of immune system stimulation is the determinant factor for patient response to BCG. Immunological markers for BCG-response could be helpful for urologists especially in the era of BCG shortage.

Objectives: To assess the predictive performance of different immunological markers on BCG-response in high risk NMIBC BCG-naïve patients.
Bladder Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Urine ELISA for immunological markers (IL-2 and IL-10)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis
Initial BCG complete response, free cystoscopy/negative cytology at 3 months., 3 months|Recurrence, Recurrence is defined as development of new tumor/positive cytology in patients with ICR, 1 year|Progression, persistent/recurrent tumor during or after treatment with increasing tumor grade or upstaging to muscle invasion after initial complete response, 1 year
