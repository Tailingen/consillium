Role of TIRADS and Bethesda Scoring Systems in Management of Thyroid Nodules
role of TIRADS and Bethesda scoring system in management of thyroid nodules as these methods are ultrasound clasification that helps increase the diagnostic effectiveness of thyroid nodules and reduces the use of preopeative FNA .that nodules are usually divided into diffent categories based on TIRADS and are then referred to FNA and follow up according to variable risk of maligneny.
Thyroid Nodule
PROCEDURE: thyroidectomy opeartion
managemnt thyroid nodules, correlation between TIRADS and Behtesda scoring systems (preoperative) and final histopathology (post opeartive) in cases of thyroidectomy, 6 months
this study is an observational study will be conducted on patiend with thyroid nodules will be admitted to general surgical department at sohag university hospital . patients will be approved to have single or multinodular goitre and thyroid nodules more than 1 cm . thyroid nodules are very common disease with great clinical importance although most cases are benign and only 4.5% to 6.5% are malignant ... itis necessary to distinguish those cases to reduce frequency of unnecessary thyroidectomies ... ultrasound classification and Fine needle aspiration (FNA) are first line diagnostic procedures and help in decrease cases undergoing unnecessary thyroidectomies as 50% of the nodules removed recently are malignant and the number of patients undergoing surgery is significantly reduced.
