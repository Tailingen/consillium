Venetoclax and Irinotecan in Relapsed/Refractory SCLC
This study is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter phase 1/2 trial designed to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of daily oral venetoclax when given in combination with irinotecan in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer|Refractory Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
DRUG: Venetoclax 50 MG|DRUG: Venetoclax 100 MG|DRUG: Venetoclax 200 MG|DRUG: Venetoclax 400|DRUG: Venetoclax 600|DRUG: Irinotecan 60 mg/m2|DRUG: Venetoclax (RP2D)
Phase 1: Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of venetoclax with irinotecan in patients with relapsed or refractory SCLC, Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of venetoclax in combination with irinotecan that is less than or equal to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A 3+3 dose escalation design will be followed until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax has been determined. Patients assigned to a dose level of venetoclax greater than 50 mg will undergo a ramp-up phase during the first week of irinotecan, 90 Days|Phase 2: Evaluate the efficacy of venetoclax with irinotecan in patients with relapsed or refractory SCLC, The RP2D will be used in an expansion cohort based on a Simon's two-stage minimax design to evaluate efficacy., 180 Days
Assess the frequency of adverse events (AEs), Assess adverse events (AEs) characterized and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI CTCAE V 5.0) to determine safety and toxicity of the combination of venetoclax and irinotecan., 120 Days|Evaluate the antitumor effects of venetoclax and irinotecan in combination., Evaluate the anti tumor effects of tumor response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., 180 Days|Observe survival in relapsed or refractory SCLC patients receiving venetoclax in combination with irinotecan, Progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with relapsed or refractory SCLC receiving venetoclax in combination with irinotecan, 180 Days
Irinotecan will be given at 60 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. A 3+3 dose escalation design will be followed until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax has been determined. Once the MTD is established, a RP2D that is the same as or less than the MTD will be determined. If no RP2D can be determined, the study will close to accrual. The RP2D will be used in an expansion cohort based on a Simon's two-stage minimax design to evaluate efficacy.
