Adjuvant Therapy With Anlotinib for HCC
Patients with high risk of disease recurrence after curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) deserve active intervention. However, there's limited treatment choice for these patients. Anlotinib hydrochloride, a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor for both tumor angiogenesis and proliferative signaling in cancer cells, is approved in China for the 3rd line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer. In the current study, we are to evaluate the safety and effects of adjuvant anlotinib therapy for the patients who underwent curative resection for HCC with high risk of tumor recurrence, which is defined by Shanghai Score (Sun, et al. Chin Med J (Engl) 2017).
