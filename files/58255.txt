Study Comparing Standard Dose and High-dose Imatinib Mesylate in Patients With Chronic Phase Philadelphia Chromosome Positive (Ph+) Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)
The study will assess the role of high-dose imatinib mesylate, in patients who have taken imatinib mesylate for at least 1 year at the standard dose, in achieving a major molecular response (a measure of the level of chronic myelogenous leukemia) versus the standard dose.
