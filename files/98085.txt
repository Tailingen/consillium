Colorectal Cancer RECHALLENGE
Primary Objective:

* To demonstrate that re-challenge with an oxaliplatin based regimen (modified FOLFOX-6) will provide a clinical disease control rate (DCR) of at least 20% at the end of the chemotherapy.

Secondary Objective:

* To evaluate other measures of tumour's responses and safety.
