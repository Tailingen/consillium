Phase I/IIa Study of BR1733 in Subjects With Advanced Cancers
This study is a Phase I/IIa, multi-center, open-label study of BR1733 with a dose escalation part followed by a dose expansion part in adult subjects with advanced cancers.

This treatment to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and preliminary antitumor activity.

The study treatment will be administered until the subject experiences unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease, and/or has treatment discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator or the subject, or due to withdrawal of consent.

This is a multi-center, nonrandomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of BR1733 in patients with advance cancer, such as recurrent/refractory follicular lymphoma, peripheral T cell lymphoma(PTCL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma(DLBCL) and advance solid tumors.

Phase Ⅰ (Dose Escalation Phase): According to the incidence of DLT in BR1733 tablets in the treatment of advanced cancers, MTD and the Phase 2 clinical trial dose (RP2D) combining PK, PD, efficacy and safety data were determined.

Phase IIa (Dose expansion stage): Evaluate the efficacy and safety of BR1733 monotherapy (Cohorts 1-5) in five separate cohorts.
