Nivolumab +/- Relatlimab Prior to Chemoradiation With II/III Gastro/Esophageal Cancer
Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) or Anti-PD1/Anti LAG-3- (relaltimab) administration in the pre-operative setting with chemoradiation will be safe and feasible in patients with resectable distal esophageal/gastroesophageal junction cancer and will change cellular and molecular characteristics of the tumor microenvironment that will improve survival.

Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To investigate the safety of induction nivolumab or nivolumab/relatlimab administration prior to concurrent chemoradiation and nivolumab or nivolumab/relatlimab in subjects with resectable stage II/III gastro-esophageal junction cancer., 100 days
Feasibility is assessed through the proportion of eligible patients who proceed to surgery without substantial delay (more than 60 days) due to treatment-related reasons, To investigate the feasibility of induction nivolumab or nivolumab/relatlimab prior to concurrent chemoradiation and nivolumab or nivolumab/relatlimab administration in subject's with stage II/III esophageal and gastro-esophageal junction cancer., 12 weeks|Pathological Complete Response Rate, To determine the pathological complete response rate in patients treated with induction checkpoint inhibition followed by chemo-radiation plus nivolumab prior to surgical resection, 2 years|Approximate quantitation of infused nivolumab bound to PD-1 receptors on the surface of T cells in the peripheral blood and within the resected tumor and lymph node specimens, To explore the association between nivolumab +/-relatlimab exposure and selected pharmacodynamics markers in the peripheral blood and in the tumor microenvironment, including measurement of PD-1 receptor occupancy on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes., 2 years|Changes in Expression of Selected Immune Markers, To measure changes in expression of selected immune markers including changes in the quality and quantity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and the T effector to T-Reg ratio compared to baseline, in the blood, primary tumor tissue and draining lymph nodes, 2 years|Overall Survival, To assess overall survival in patients receiving neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors., 2 years|Recurrence-Free Survival, To assess recurrence-free survival in patients receiving neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors, 2 years
This is a Phase IB study assessing the safety of 2 cycles of induction (Arm A) nivolumab or (Arm B) 2 cycles of induction nivolumab prior to concurrent chemoradiation plus nivolumab (Arm A) or nivolumab/relatlimab (Arm B) before surgical resection in operable stage II/III esophageal/gastroesophageal junction cancer.

Approximately 32 patients will be enrolled on study with 16 enrolled on Arm A and if no unexpected toxicities then an additional 16 patients will be enrolled on Arm B.
