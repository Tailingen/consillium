The Effect of an Exercise Program in Breast Cancer Patients With Joint Pain While Taking Aromatase Inhibitors.
The objective of this study is to determine if patients taking aromatase inhibitors (AI), who are experiencing joint discomfort and stiffness, would have reduction in this discomfort and stiffness by participating in a directed exercise program. The overarching objective is to improve patient compliance with the medication and ultimately clinical outcome.

In this pilot study, we will utilize a scientific approach for proof of concept employing both objective (inflammatory cytokine profiles and Physical Therapy (PT) measurements) and subjective (patient perception) methods to support an evidence based clinical plan. Patients will be divided into two cohorts. Group A will receive AI therapy with a directed exercise program. Group B will receive AI therapy without a directed exercise program. Data will be collected when both cohorts of patients enroll in the study, at the end of PT for Group A and, at the end of 8 weeks for Group B. At these time points, both groups will undergo a PT evaluation; have blood drawn for cytokine profiles; answer questions on an iPad that includes: the Pain Disability Index, the PHQ-4 (Psycological Health Questionaire depression scale, and pain level scale.
