Combination of Temsirolimus and Sorafenib in the Treatment of Radioactive Iodine Refractory Thyroid Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of sorafenib and temsirolimus will have on thyroid cancer. Treatment guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network include sorafenib as a treatment option for thyroid cancer.

Temsirolimus is an intravenous medication that is FDA approved for other type of cancers. In laboratory studies, the addition of temsirolimus to sorafenib works better than sorafenib alone.
Thyroid Cancer
DRUG: Temsirolimus and Sorafenib
Reponse Rate of the Combination Sorafenib and Temsirolimus in I-131 Refractory Thyroid Cancer., Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 2 years
Duration of Study Treatment for Participants With and Without BRAF Mutations, 6 years|Percentage of Participants With Progression-free Survival Under the Combination Sorafenib and Temsirolimus in I-131 Refractory Thyroid Cancer., Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 1 year|Safety and Tolerability for the Combination Sorafenib and Temsirolimus in I-131 Refractory Thyroid Cancer., Participant toxicities evaluated by CTCAE version 4.0, 3 years
