TRAcking Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Evolution Through Therapy (Rx)
To study the NSCLC evolutionary genomic landscape between primary and metastatic sites and the dynamics of intratumour heterogeneity over time combined with detailed clinical, histopathological and cancer phenotypic annotation for each patient, in order to significantly improve the outcomes of NSCLC patients (e.g. reduce their chance of recurrence and improve survival).
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Intratumour heterogeneity, • Define the relationship between intratumour heterogeneity and clinical outcome following surgery and adjuvant therapy (including relationships between intratumour heterogeneity and clinical disease stage and histological subtypes of NSCLC)., Year 5
The importance of intratumour genetic and functional heterogeneity is increasingly recognised as a driver of cancer progression and survival outcome. Understanding how tumour clonal heterogeneity impacts upon therapeutic outcome, however, is still an area of unmet clinical and scientific need. TRACERx (TRAcking non-small cell lung Cancer Evolution through therapy \[Rx\]), a prospective study of patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), aims to define the evolutionary trajectories of lung cancer in both space and time through multiregion and longitudinal tumour sampling and genetic analysis. By following cancers from diagnosis to relapse, tracking the evolutionary trajectories of tumours in relation to therapeutic interventions, and determining the impact of clonal heterogeneity on clinical outcomes, TRACERx may help to identify novel therapeutic targets for NSCLC and may also serve as a model applicable to other cancer types.
