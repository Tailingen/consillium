Prostate Immobilization Device Used During Radiation Treatments to Decrease Rectal Bleeding
During 3D-conformal external beam radiation therapy treatments for prostate cancer, the prostate gland moves. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the placement of a prostate immobilization device into the rectum during radiation treatments will decrease the risk of rectal bleeding that is sometimes seen as a late effect from radiation.

* MRI using an endorectal coil done prior to treatment for staging.
* Baseline Quality of Life (QOL) assessment will be completed prior to treatment.
* Total androgen suppression is initiated and will continue for at least 6 months.
* Prostate Immobilization Device (PID) placed during the planning session.
* PID will be placed daily for the first 15 3D external beam radiation treatments.
* QOL assessment and follow-up will take place every 6 months for 3 years.
