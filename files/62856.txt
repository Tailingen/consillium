Colon Cancer Risk-stratification Via Optical Analysis of Rectal Ultrastructure
This is a study whose focus is on understanding the clinical utility of rectal ultrastructure in detecting colonic neoplasm. The method uses Low-coherence Enhanced Backscattering Spectroscopy (LEBS).
Colon Cancer
DEVICE: LEBS - Low coherence enhanced backscattering
Whether rectal LEBS readings can predict the presence of advanced adenomas in the colon., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
The investigators use an optic probe which is a small device that uses light to assess the colon tissue. This probe will be used to identify subjects who do and do not have precancerous changes in the colon by capturing the light reflected back from the rectal wall and that will be assessed without the need for colonoscopy and bowel preparation (i.e unprepped). This device may detect early cancerous changes in colon tissue with higher accuracy than current tests.
