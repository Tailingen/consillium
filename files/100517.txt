Individualized Dynamic Frailty-tailored Therapy (DynaFiT) in Elderly Patients With NDMM
Frailty is dynamic and confers poor outcomes in elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), mainly because of the high prevalence of treatment discontinuation due to intolerability. We designed a multi-center prospective study (DynaFiT) based on our real-life practice to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of a dynamic frailty-tailored therapy in elderly patients with different fitness/frailty statuses.

Since Dara-based treatment have recently become the new standard regimens, in this amendment of the study, daratumumab added to VRd is recommended as induction therapy regimen.

Overall survival (OS), In each case it is the time from inclusion to the time of death from any cause. Individuals who are lost to follow-up or still alive at the time of analysis will be censored at their last known date to be alive., The time from the date of inclusion to the date of death from any cause, up to 24 months
Rate of treatment discontinued(TD), The effect of intensive or mild treatment based on dynamic frailty status on treatment discontinued(TD) in elderly newly diagnosed multiple myeloma., The time from the date of inclusion to the date of treatment discontinued from any cause, up to 24 months.|Treatment related adverse event(TRAE), Toxicity and safety will be reported based on the adverse events, as graded by CTCAE V5 and determined by routine clinical assessments., Baseline, end of every induction cycle and maintenance cycle, until disease progression or treatment discontinued, up to 24 months.|Early mortality(EM), Early mortality is defined as death within 3, 6, 12 and 24 months (EM3,EM6,EM12 and EM24)., The time from the date of inclusion to the date of death from any cause, up to 24 months.|Overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with presence of stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR) or partial response (PR). ORR assessment will be based on International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria., From the date of inclusion to the date of last follow-up, up to 24 months.|Progression-free survival(PFS), Progression-free survival(PFS) is defined as the time from inclusion to the time of first documented evidence of disease progression or death from any cause. Individuals who are lost to follow-up or progression-free at the time of analysis will be censored at their last known date to be alive and progression-free. Disease progression is defined according to the IMWG Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma., The time from the date of inclusion to the date of first documented evidence of disease progression or death from any cause, up to 24 months.
To establish a new and better comprehensive geriatric assessment system to predict prognosis of elderly NDMM, To establish a new and better comprehensive geriatric frailty assessment system that can predict TD and OS in NDMM patients, combining objective biological markers (biomarkers of sarcopenia, n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, aging biomarkers, and immune markers)., Through study completion, up to 24 months.|To explore the value of sarcopenia in predicting treatment discontinued(TD) and prognosis of the elderly newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, Number of participants with imaging sarcopenia as assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and whole-body low-dose CT;Number of participants with functional sarcopenia as assessed by grip strength and 6-meter walking speed;Number of participants with objective biomarkers in sarcopenia as assessed by peripheral blood test., Through study completion, up to 24 months.|Minimal residual disease (MRD), By using multiparameter flow cytometry and/or next-generation sequencing techniques dynamically monitor MRD status and its effect on OS and PFS, Through study completion, up to 24 months.|Discovery and identification of frailty biomarkers in elderly newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, Discovery and identification of frailty biomarkers in elderly newly diagnosed multiple myeloma., Through study completion, up to 24 months.|To explore the prognostic significance of blood liquid biopsy based on platelet RNA sequencing for multiple myeloma, Heterogeneity of disease as assessed by platelet RNA sequencing to explore the prognostic significance of blood liquid biopsy based on for multiple myeloma., Through study completion, up to 24 months.
Older patients with MM represent a heterogeneous population with different fitness/frailty statuses. Unlike fit patients who can benefit from intensive therapies due to their endurance, frail patients are often susceptible to treatment-related toxicity, leading to treatment discontinuation and poor outcomes. More importantly, frailty can diminish the prognostic impact of disease-related factors over disease trajectory. Thus, it is of utmost importance to determine the fitness/frailty status for treatment decision-making that carefully balances efficacy and safety in this vulnerable population. However, geriatric assessment is often conducted at diagnosis in clinical practice. Although baseline frailty status, as a static risk factor, is significantly associated with OS, its predictive ability decreases over time. Of note, emerging evidence indicates that the fitness/frailty status is highly dynamic because of age increase, disease trajectory, and treatment, raising the notion that frailty-tailored therapy should be designed based on the baseline fitness/frailty status and also according to its longitudinal changes during the treatment course. Thus, current frailty status better predicts OS.

To improve outcomes in elderly patients, this study was designed to investigate an entirely novel therapeutic strategy, the dynamic frailty-tailored therapy, in elderly MM patients with different fitness/frailty statuses.
