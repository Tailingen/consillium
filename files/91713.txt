Detection of Peritoneal Metastases by Diagnostic LAparoscopy in Patients With Locally Advanced Cervical Carcinoma
The study hypothesizes that specific subgroups of LACC patients, (AJCC stage T3/T4, grade 3 tumors, and para-aortic lymph node involvement), have a higher prevalence of peritoneal metastasis. This peritoneal spread may serve as a prognostic factor, and diagnostic laparoscopy could improve staging accuracy, thereby guiding personalized treatment strategies and improving oncological outcomes.

Cervical cancer is the most prevalent gynecologic malignancy worldwide, with poor prognosis particularly in patients diagnosed with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC; FIGO stage IB3-IVA). Although peritoneal metastasis is not included in FIGO staging, it is considered as a distant metastasis. Several studies have reported peritoneal disease in about 20% of LACC patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy, suggesting a potential role for laparoscopy in staging. However, the benefit of laparoscopy in surgical staging is controversial and the impact of peritoneal involvement on prognosis remains unclear.

This is a prospective, observational, single-center study. The primary objective is to assess the prevalence of peritoneal metastasis in specific subgroups of LACC patients (AJCC stage T3/T4, grade 3 cervical cancer, FIGO stage IIIC2) using diagnostic laparoscopy. Secondary objectives include evaluating 3-year disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment response rates to exclusive chemoradiotherapy (if pelvic peritoneal involvement, FIGO IVA) and chemo-immunotherapy (if upper abdominal peritoneal involvement, FIGO IVB) in patients with peritoneal metastasis.
