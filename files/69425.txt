Comparing Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide As GVHD Prophylaxis to Standard of Care for Acute Leukemia Patients
This randomized clinical trial will evaluate two approaches of GvHD prophylaxis; the standard of care GVHD prophylaxis regimen (methotrexate/calcineurin inhibitors) and post-transplant cyclophosphamide with calcineurin inhibitors for their efficacy as a new GVHD prophylaxis strategy.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in Complete Remission|Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Remission
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide 50mg|DRUG: Methotrexate
GRFS (GVHD-free/relapse-free survival), Defined as the non-occurrence of a grade 3-4 acute GVHD, or systemic therapy-requiring chronic GVHD, or relapse, or death during the first post-transplant year., One-year post-transplant
Acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGVHD), The probabilities of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD will be determined. Acute GVHD will be graded according to Glucksberg and NIH 2014 criteria., 100 Day post transplant|Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGVHD), The cumulative incidence of systemic therapy-requiring chronic GVHD will be determined. Moderate and severe chronic GVHD will be defined per the NIH 2014 criteria., One year Post-transplant
An open-label randomized clinical trial will be performed. Eligible patients are females and males, between 14 and 65 years undergoing allo-HCT for treatment of Acute Leukemia (AML or ALL). Patients must have a matching related peripheral blood stem cell donor. Patients from or referred to the KFSH\&RC for allogeneic transplant consideration will be offered the opportunity to participate in this trial.

Treatment Description:

Patients will be randomized on one of the arms; an intervention or a standard of care arm.
