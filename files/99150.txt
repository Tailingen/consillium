Study of Chemotherapy-Induced Hair Changes and Alopecia, Skin Aging and Nail Changes in Women With Non-Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see how many patients develop hair, skin and nail changes due to cancer treatments. The investigators would like to study the clinical factors, genetic markers, and impact on patients' health-related quality of life to learn more about who is at greater risk. We trust that the study will improve our understanding of how cancer patients feel about their skin, hair, and nail conditions. This information will help us determine the burden on breast cancer patients and survivors. It will also help us learn how to prevent these conditions and it may improve the way we treat them and counsel patients.
