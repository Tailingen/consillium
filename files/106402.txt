A Study to Assess a PI3Kδ Inhibitor (IOA-244) in Patients With Metastatic Cancers
The objective of study IOA-244-101 is to determine whether IOA-244 is safe and tolerable in cancer patients (Part A). In addition, the study will assess whether IOA-244 can increase the anti-tumour immune response in patients both as monotherapy and in combination pemetrexed/cisplatin/avelumab (Part B Mesothelioma and NSCLC 1st line), in combination with avelumab (Part B Cutaneous Melanoma and NSCLC 2nd/3rd line) and ruxolitinib (Part B Primary Myelofibrosis)
