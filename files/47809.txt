All patients will receive the study drug, lenalidomide, given PO daily continuously on a 28 day cycle at the starting dose level of either 2.5 mgs or 5 mgs with dose escalations to a target dose of 25mg daily. Oral dexamethasone at 12 mg PO daily will be administered on days 1-7, 14 and 21 of each cycle. Patients will be treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone to 2 cycles past CR or to a maximum of 18 cycles, each cycle of 28 days duration. Primary endpoint is response.
