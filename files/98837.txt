A Phase Ib/III Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of IBI318 in Combination With Paclitaxel Versus Placebo in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Have Failed First-line or Above Chemotherapies
This study is a phase Ib/III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant fully human anti-programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) bispecific antibody injection (IBI318) in combination with paclitaxel versus placebo in combination with paclitaxel in subjects with small cell lung cancer who have failed first-line or above chemotherapies.
