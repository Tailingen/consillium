Aspirin as an Ultraviolet (UV) Protectant in Human Subjects at Risk for Melanoma
This is a phase II placebo-controlled intervention trial assessing aspirin (ASA) as a UV protectant in patients at risk for melanoma.
Melanoma (Skin)
DRUG: Aspirin 81 mg|DRUG: Aspirin 325mg|DRUG: Placebo oral tablet
Change in minimal erythemal dose (MED) from baseline to day 60., Baseline minimal erythemal dose (MED) measurements will will be compared to MED results at day 60. We will use the conventional definition of MED as the lowest UV dose resulting in erythema that completely fills the 8-mm irradiated site (homogeneous erythema)., Change from baseline to day 60|Change in concentration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in plasma from baseline to day 60., Baseline PGE2 levels in plasma specimens will be compared to PGE2 levels at day 60., Change from baseline to day 60|Change in concentration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in nevus tissue from baseline to day 60., Baseline PGE2 levels in tissue specimens will be compared to PGE2 levels at day 60., Change from baseline to day 60
Change in concentration of oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in plasma from baseline to day 60., Baseline 2-HG levels in plasma specimens will be compared to 2-HG levels at day 60., Change from baseline to day 60|Change in concentration of 8-oxoguanine (8-OG) in plasma from baseline to day 60., Baseline 8-OG levels in plasma specimens will be compared to 8-OG levels at day 60., Change from baseline to day 60|Change in concentration of oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in nevus tissue from baseline to day 60., Baseline 2-HG levels in tissue specimens will be compared to 2-HG levels at day 60., Change from baseline to day 60|Change in concentration of 8-oxoguanine (8-OG) in nevus tissue from baseline to day 60., Baseline 8-OG levels in tissue specimens will be compared to 8-OG levels at day 60., Change from baseline to day 60
While melanoma risk is largely genetically determined, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight is the major environmental risk factor. Although sunscreen use can reduce melanoma risk 2-fold, its efficacy has been questioned, and most patients do not apply sunscreens properly.

This study will evaluate the downstream effects of aspirin (ASA) in human blood and skin moles (nevi) following oral ingestion. We will determine if chronic ingestion of ASA can modulate UV-sensitivity of the skin, UV-induced damage in nevi, and PGE2 levels in blood and nevi.
