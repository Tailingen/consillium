Carfilzomib, Rituximab, Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, and Etoposide in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Stage I-IV Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This phase I/Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of carfilzomib when given together with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage I-IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that has returned (relapsed) or that has not responded to treatment (refractory). Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide, also work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving carfilzomib with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide may be a better treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of carfilzomib, followed by a phase Ib study.

Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 10-30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, and 9; rituximab IV over 3-8 hours on day 3; etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 4-6; carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 5; and ifosfamide IV over 24 hours on day 5. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 2 years.
