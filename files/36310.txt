Asymptomatic Brain Metastasis in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The prognosis of NSCLC patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis, who are not treated with SRS or WBRT has not been fully investigated yet. This randomized phase III trial is conducted to determine the exact role of SRS in NSCLC patients with asymptomatic oligo brain metastases whether early treatment with SRS would improve survival even in patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis.
