Different Factors Affecting Patients With Newly Diagnosed Bladder Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying different factors that effect patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer may help doctors learn more about the disease, improve the ability to plan cancer treatment, and help patients live more comfortably.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying different factors affecting patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer.
Bladder Cancer
DRUG: selenium|DRUG: vitamin E|PROCEDURE: biopsy|PROCEDURE: chemoprevention|PROCEDURE: cryopreservation|PROCEDURE: cytology specimen collection procedure|PROCEDURE: diagnostic procedure|PROCEDURE: gene expression analysis|PROCEDURE: immunohistochemistry staining method|PROCEDURE: laboratory biomarker analysis|PROCEDURE: medical chart review|PROCEDURE: mutation analysis|PROCEDURE: polymerase chain reaction|PROCEDURE: quality-of-life assessment|PROCEDURE: questionnaire administration|PROCEDURE: study of socioeconomic and demographic variables
Recurrence-free interval|Progression-free interval
Overall survival time|Incidence of transitional cell carcinoma outside the bladder|Incidence of all other malignancies clinically diagnosed|Incidence of cardiovascular events|Quality of life as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-BLS24 and QLQ-BLM30 questionnaires
OBJECTIVES:

* To assess the effect of lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, dietary habits, fluid intake, or environmental exposures) on the recurrence and progression of bladder cancer.
* To assess the impact of selenium and/or vitamin E on the progression and recurrence of bladder cancer.
* To study health-related quality of life and its association with recurrence and progression of bladder cancer.
* To establish a bladder cancer tissue bank that will comprise blood, urine, and bladder tissue.
* To study the predictive effect of molecular markers on the recurrence and progression of bladder cancer.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

The study will be based on a cohort of patients with newly detected bladder cancer in all 16 urological centres within the West Midlands, commencing in late 2005 for a period of 5 years. This research project consists of 5 individual studies: CRUK-BCPP-2005-01-COHORT, CRUK-BCPP-2005-01-MARKERS, CRUK-BCPP-2005-01-QOL, CRUK-BCPP-2005-01-TISSUE-BANK, and CRUK-BCPP-2005-01-TREATMENT. Patients may participate in all or only some of these individual studies.
