A Phase Ib/II Multicenter Open-label Study of Bemcentinib (BGB324) in Patients With AML or MDS
A Phase Ib/II multicentre open label study of bemcentinib (BGB324) as a single agent in participants with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or in a combination with cytarabine or decitabine in AML participants.

Bemcentinib is a potent selective small molecule inhibitor of AXL a surface membrane protein kinase receptor which is overexpressed in up to half of AML cases.

DRUG: Bemcentinib|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Decitabine
Part A: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Bemcentinib (BGB324), If 1 participant in a cohort experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle 1, the cohort was expanded to 6 participants. If 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 participants in a cohort experience DLT no further dose escalation took place and the dose below was nominated as the MTD. DLT was assessed during the first 3 weeks of treatment (Cycle 1) with bemcentinib.

Notable trends were defined as observations which were outside the normal range for these mentioned parameters as specified by the sponsor., Baseline to end of the study (Part B: Maximum exposure duration was 1424 days)

This study is a dose-escalation of bemcentinib (BGB324), a selective AXL kinase inhibitor, in participants with AML and MDS, followed by a cohort expansion study of bemcentinib either as a single agent in participants with AML or MDS, or in combination with cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside, Ara-C) or decitabine in participants with AML.

The study will run in Germany, Norway, Italy and the US and may enrol up to approximately 90 participants with AML or MDS.

The study consisted of a dose-escalation phase to determine the MTD (maximum tolerated dose) and/or recommended dose for Phase II (RP2D) of bemcentinib in participants with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS (Part A) followed by a cohort expansion phase in five disease-specific cohorts (Part B).

Bemcentinib was administered orally according to a daily schedule, with the first three doses of Cycle 1 serving as a 'loading' dose. Each 21-day (three week) period will constitute 1 cycle of treatment.
