Evaluation of Urinary Exosomes Presence From Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma is diagnosed by imaging, sometimes associated with biopsy. This diagnosis is expensive, invasive and sometimes late. The development of a simple biological test for diagnosis is essential. Exosomes are 30 to 150 nm membrane vesicles secreted into the extracellular space by various living cells. These exosomes can be isolated from biological fluids, including urine. The recent study of urinary exosomes is a promising topic for analyzing tumor markers in urine. The investigator's goal is to develop a reliable technique for detecting tumor exosomes in urine in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The analysis of urinary exosomes could provide a new liquid biopsy tool for the early diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
