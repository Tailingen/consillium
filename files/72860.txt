The Short-term Impact of Vocal Intonation Therapy (VIT) and Therapeutic Singing (TS) on Respiratory Function in Patients With Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to examine the short-term impact of Vocal Intonation Therapy (VIT) and Therapeutic Singing (TS) on respiratory function in patients with lung cancer. As a secondary outcome, this research will evaluate the effect of the music intervention on respiratory quality of life.
Lung Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Vocal Intonation Therapy (VIT)|BEHAVIORAL: Therapeutic Singing (TS)
Change in Maximum Phonation Time (MPT) in seconds, Maximum Phonation Time (MPT) measures the number of seconds a participant can sustain a phonated sound., Baseline, up to 30-minutes (Post-Intervention)|Respiratory Rate, Measured by the number of breaths per minute, Up to 30-minutes|Change in Dyspnea measured by Dyspnea-12 Questionnaire, Scores range from 0 to 3. Higher scores suggest more severity in shortness of breath, Baseline, up to 1 month|Change in Dyspnea measured by Modified Borg Scale, Scores change from 0 to 10. Higher scores suggest more severity in shortness of breath, Baseline, up to 30-minutes (Post-Intervention)|Change in Respiratory Quality of Life measured by St.Georges Respiratory Questionnaire, A composite score will be obtained, ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate worst respiratory quality of life, Baseline, up to 1 month|Change in Dyspnea measured by Cancer Dyspnea Scale, Scores range from 1 (Not at all) to 5 (Very much). Higher scores suggest more severity of dyspnea, Baseline, up to 1 month
