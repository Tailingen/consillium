Accuracy Of Contrast Enhanced Mamography in Predicting Response of Breast Cancer Post Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
The aim of this work to evaluate the accuracy of contrast enhanced spectral mamography in predicting the response to NAC and assessment of residual disease in breast cancer patients
Breast Cancer
Accuracy of contrast enhanced spectral mamography in the predicting of pathological response to NAC and assessment residual disease in breast cancer patients, Basline
Assess best imaging modalities in pedict post neoadjuvant response, Baseline
This a prospective series ,will be performed for 50 patients diagnosed by biopsy as breast cancer who will be scheduled for surgery after completing the full coarse of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
