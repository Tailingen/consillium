MRI-Guided Laser Surgery and Doxorubicin Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme
This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided laser surgery (MLA) and doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a separation of circulating blood from the tissue of the central nervous system, preventing substances in the blood from entering the brain. MLA disrupts the BBB around the tumor which may allow cancer-killing substances to be carried directly to the tumor and the surrounding area. Using MLA prior to chemotherapy may result in a greater concentration of drug in the tumor to kill the cancer cells while limiting side effects.

Ktrans from DSC-MRI, Using a 2 compartment model to calculate a the vascular transfer constant (Ktrans) which will provide a quantitative measure of blood brain barrier leakage, 6 weeks|Peritumoral permeability scores, measured by DSC-MRI and serum biomarkers, Pearson correlation coefficient (r) will be determined for each biomarker and Ktrans value. A minimum r=0.5 is required for inclusion for further analysis and will be used as a peritumoral permeability score. This score will then be correlated with the patient outcome data to determine whether it has a predictive value., 6 weeks|6-month PFS (rate), Assessed using RANO Response criteria. A log-rank test will be used to compare 6-PFS of Arm B and of Arm C to historical controls., 6 months
Overall Survival, Date began MLA treatment to date of death from any cause. A log-rank test will be used to compare OS of Arm B and of Arm C to historical controls., 2 years|Quality of Life, Using Karnofsky performance status and the mini-mental state evaluation to assess patient overall response to treatment., 2 years
Evaluate imaging techniques (MRI) and blood tests (biomarkers) to help figure out the best time for chemotherapy to be initiated after the blood brain barrier is disrupted, as it is immediately following a procedure like MRI-guided laser ablation (MLA-Monteris Neuroblate).
