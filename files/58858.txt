Ablative Therapy in the Management of Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is collect observational data regarding patterns of care and outcomes of focal therapies for prostate cancer, including but not limited to: high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryotherapy, focal laser ablation, irreversible electroporation, photodynamic therapy, and brachytherapy.

Through the use of a pro- and retrospective registry, the investigators will collect information on patient characteristics including age, co-morbidities, imaging and biopsy information, and prior treatments. Information on treatment details will also be captured, including treatment time, anesthesia delivered, and length of stay, when applicable. Oncologic outcomes including PSA, post-treatment biopsy and imaging data, need for re-treatment, and survival outcomes will also be captured. Safety outcomes will be captured using the Clavien-Dindo classification scale, and additional specific GU complications will be recorded, which include urinary retention, urethral stricture, recto-urethral fistula, osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infection. Finally, the investigators will capture functional outcomes using health related quality of life questionnaires including the EPIC questionnaire, IIEF-5, MSHQ-EjD, and IPSS.
