Exploratory Study on POL6326 in Stem Cell Mobilization
The purpose of this study is to determine whether POL6326 is safe and clinically active to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells followed by transplantation
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: POL6326
To assess the ability of POL6326 to mobilise CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells in patients with primary multiple myeloma, Number of patients achieving the minimal number of CD34+ cells (≥2 x 10 mill/kg BW) collected during one to four cycles of apheresis which are considered necessary and safe to proceed with autotransplantation

Number of apheresis cycles required to obtain the minimal number of CD34+ cells necessary for autotransplantation (≥2 x 10 mill/kg BW), Up to four days
To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of POL6326 in patients with multiple myeloma, 2 months|To determine the efficacy of POL6326 in reconstitution of immune system after transplantation, 1 year
The purpose of this study is to determine whether POL6326 is safe and clinically active to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells followed by transplantation
