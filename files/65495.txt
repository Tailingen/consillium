Conventional Photodynamic Therapy vs. Painless Photodynamic Therapy for Actinic Keratosis
This study is being done to compare a new, continuous illumination and short Incubation time regimen of aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy#ALA-PDT) to a conventional regimen for treatment of Actinic Keratosis. The hypothesis is that the continuous illumination approach will be less or even no painful, but equally efficacious, as the old regimen.
Actinic Keratosis
PROCEDURE: Aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy
The clearance rate of Actinic Keratoses, The change rate in lesion clearance of Actinic Keratoses at six weeks after treatment will be measured as the primary outcome, six weeks after treatment
Pain assessment, The pain will be assessed using Vissual Analogue Scale(VAS) with a score range of 0-10.The higher the score,the greater the pain, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the most unbearable pain. Pain will be measured at different time points during and after every treatment, Immediately, 1st minute, 3rd minute, 5th minute, 10th minute, 30th minute, 1hour ,2hour, 4hour, 12hour, 24hour,48hour ,72hour
