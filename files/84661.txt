Ibrutinib and Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Previously-Treated Metastatic Kidney Cancer
This phase Ib/II trial studies how well ibrutinib and nivolumab work in treating patients with previously-treated kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving Ibrutinib and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer.

Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., From baseline to death or progression, assessed for up to 6 months
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03, Number of participants with adverse events graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03, Up to 30 days|Overall Survival, Overall survival, calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method as the duration from start of treatment to death by any cause., Up to 32 months.|Response, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

To assess in a preliminary fashion the feasibility and efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with previously-treated metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate the safety of the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in patients with previously treated mRCC.
