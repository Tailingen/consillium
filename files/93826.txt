A Study of PF-08046052/SGN-EGFRd2 in Advanced Solid Tumors
This study will test the safety of a drug called PF-08046052/SGN-EGFRd2 in participants with advanced solid tumors. It will also study the side effects of this drug. A side effect is anything a drug does to the body besides treating the disease.

Participants will have cancer that cannot be removed (unresectable) or has spread through the body (metastatic).

This study will have three parts. Parts A and B of the study will find out how much PF-08046052/SGN-EGFRd2 should be given to participants. Part C will use the dose found in parts A and B to find out how safe PF-08046052/SGN-EGFRd2 is and if it works to treat solid tumor cancers.

DRUG: PF-08046052
Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention, Through 90 days after last study treatment, up to approximately 1 year|Number of participants with laboratory abnormalities, Through 30-37 days after last study treatment, up to approximately 1 year|Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Up to 35 days|Number of participants with DLTs by dose level, Up to 35 days
Number of participants with antidrug antibodies (ADAs), To be summarized using descriptive statistics, Through 30-37 days after last study treatment, up to approximately 1 year|Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter - Area under the curve (AUC), To be summarized using descriptive statistics, Through 30-37 days after last study treatment, up to approximately 1 year|PK parameter - Maximum concentration (Cmax), To be summarized using descriptive statistics, Through 30-37 days after last study treatment, up to approximately 1 year|PK parameter - Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), To be summarized using descriptive statistics, Through 30-37 days after last study treatment, up to approximately 1 year|PK parameter - Apparent terminal half-life (t1/2), To be summarized using descriptive statistics, Through 30-37 days after last study treatment, up to approximately 1 year|PK parameter - Trough concentration (Ctrough), To be summarized using descriptive statistics, Through 30-37 days after last study treatment, up to approximately 1 year|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with an objective response per Response Evaluation in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 per investigator. A participant is determined to have an objective response if, based on RECIST 1.1, they achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) after initiation of treatment and at or prior to the EOT disease assessment., Up to approximately 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from start of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of tumor progression per RECIST 1.1 or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first, Up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from start of SGN-EGFRd2 to first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first, Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from start of SGN-EGFRd2 to date of death due to any cause, Up to approximately 3 years
