Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Treatment Strategies of Thyroid Nodules.
To investigate the genetic mutations of patients with thyroid carcinoma and find molecular targets for therapy.
Thyroid Cancer
Gene sequencing, 2 weeks
In previous studies, we have found highly prevalent TERT promoter mutations in aggressive thyroid cancers. So we plan to perform further research to investigate the genetic mutations of patients with thyroid carcinoma and find molecular targets for therapy.
