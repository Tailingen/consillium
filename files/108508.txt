Gene Testing in Patients With Colon Cancer
RATIONALE: Analyzing the structure of genes found in a person's cancer cells may help doctors improve methods of treating patients with colon cancer.

PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the genes of patients treated with chemotherapy for colon cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
GENETIC: mutation analysis|GENETIC: tumor replication error analysis
disease free survival, Up to 10 years
overall survival, Up to 10 years|tumor replication error status, Up to 10 years|determine the prognostic and predictive values for response to this therapy, Up to 10 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the relationship between disease free survival, overall survival, and tumor replication error status for patients who have received adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer on CALGB protocol 8896.
* Determine the prognostic and predictive values for response to this therapy in these patients.
