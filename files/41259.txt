Anastrazole, Fulvestrant & Abemaciclib for HR+HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a phase 2, open-label, singled-arm clinical trial determining efficacy of combination therapy with anastrozole, fulvestrant and abemaciclib in subjects with breast cancer. These are subjects who are newly diagnosed advanced or metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer or subjects who have progressed following treatment free interval of more than 12 months following adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment.

DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Anastrozole|DRUG: Abemaciclib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR per RECIST 1.1 criteria assessed at 3 months after study treatment. The rate of objective response is calculated only for patients with measurable disease., Assessed at 3 months after study treatment
Clinical Benefit Rate, Calculated by using the number of patients with a complete or partial response or stable disease as the numerator and the number of all patients (even those in whom a response cannot be assessed or for whom response data are missing) as the denominator, Up to 5 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 5 years|Overall survival, Time from first treatment to death from any cause, Up to 5 years|Number of grade 3-5 adverse events, Safety and toxicity will be examined by the incidence of treatment-emergent, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), and serious adverse events (SAE). Toxicity and adverse events are based on the CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 5.0., Up to 5 years|Number of patients who achieved composite outcome, Absolute values and changes in ctDNA and CTC will be measured and correlated with endocrine resistance. If serial monitoring of ctDNA and CTC can provide markers of resistance, we will quantify endocrine resistance as a composite outcome., Up to 5 years
