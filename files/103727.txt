Antineoplaston Therapy in Treating Children With Brain Tumors
RATIONALE: Current therapies for childhood brain tumors provide limited benefit to the patient. The anti-cancer properties of Antineoplaston therapy suggest that it may prove beneficial in the treatment of childhood brain tumors.

PURPOSE: This study is being performed to determine the effects (good and bad) that Antineoplaston therapy has on children (\> 6 months of age) with brain tumors.
Childhood Brain Tumors
DRUG: Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal)
Number of Participants With Objective Response, Objective response rate per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), disappearance of all disease sustained for at least four weeks; Partial Response (PR), \>=50% decrease in the sum of the products of of the greatest perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions, sustained for at least four weeks., 12 months
Percentage of Participants Who Survived, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months overall survival, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, 48 months, 60 months
OVERVIEW: This is a single arm, open-label study in which children with brain tumors receive gradually escalating doses of intravenous Antineoplaston therapy (Atengenal + Astugenal) until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in children with a brain tumor, as measured by an objective response to therapy (complete response, partial response or stable disease).
* To determine the safety and tolerance of Antineoplaston therapy in children with a brain tumor.
* To determine objective response, tumor size is measured utilizing MRI scans, which are performed every 8 weeks for the first two years, every 3 months for the third and fourth years, every 6 months for the 5th and sixth years, and annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued to this study.
