3D Printed Models for Liver Surgery
Comprehensive preoperative planning and real-time intraoperative guidance are essential prerequisites for achieving precise liver resection. In pursuit of this goal, the investigators have developed innovative 3D printed liver models utilizing a physically crosslinked self-healing elastomer created through the copolymerization of 4-acryloylmorpholine (ACMO) and methoxy poly (ethylene glycol) acrylate (mPEGA). These printed models exhibit exceptional healing capabilities, efficiently restoring their structure within minutes at room temperature, and rapidly recovering within moments after being incised.

Herein, the investigators aim to assess the viability of employing these 3D printed liver models as instrumental tools in designing the optimal surgical approach through an iterative trial-and-error methodology. Concurrently, the investigators aim to determine whether the integration of these 3D printed models into conventional methods (contrast-enhanced CT or MRI) can enhance the safety, ease, and efficiency of hepatic resection procedures.
