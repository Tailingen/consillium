A Phase I Study of Bi-Weekly rBBX-01 in Patients With Solid Tumors
This study will evaluate toxicity associated with escalating doses of rBBX-01 given bi-weekly to patients with solid tumors.
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: rBBX-01
To determine the dose limiting toxicity and safety of bi-weekly courses of rBBX-01 in patients with resistant solid tumor malignancies., Four bi-weekly 5 day courses
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of bi-weekly rBBX-01. To correlate the inter-patient sensitivity to rBBX-01 with in vitro studies on patient blood. To describe any anti-tumor activity of rBBX-01., 4 bi-weekly 5 day courses
This study will evaluate toxicity associated with escalating doses of rBBX-01 given bi-weekly to patients with solid tumors.
