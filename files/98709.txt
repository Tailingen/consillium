Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of AMG 562 in Subjects With r/r Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, or Follicular Lymphoma
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of AMG 562 in adult subjects with DLBCL, MCL, or FL. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or a biologically active dose (e.g., recommended phase 2 dose \[RP2D\])
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma(DLBCL)|Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)|Follicular Lymphoma (FL)
DRUG: AMG 562
Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Day 1 to Day 28|Number of Participants Who Experienced a Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant. TEAEs were any AE that occurred after receiving at least 1 dose of treatment.

Treatment-related TEAEs were those considered related to study treatment by the investigator.

Disease-Related TEAEs were events (serious or non-serious) anticipated to occur in the study population due to the underlying disease.

Any clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECG)s and clinical laboratory tests were recorded as TEAEs., Up to 2 years
Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) of AMG 562, Day 1|Time of Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of AMG 562, Day 1|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to the Time of the Last Quantifiable Timepoint (AUClast) of AMG 562, Day 1|Half-life (t1/2) of AMG 562, Day 22|Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Lugano Classification, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR) as defined by Lugano Classification.

Per the Lugano Classification, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) were defined on the 5-point scale as scores 1, 2, or 3 (where 1 = no uptake above background; 2 = uptake \</= mediastinum; and 3 = uptake \> mediastinum but \</= liver) and PET-positive scans, as scores of 4 or 5 (where 4 = uptake moderately higher than liver; 5 = uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions).

CMR: score of 1, 2 or 3 in nodal or extranodal sites with or without a residual mass.

PMR: score of 4 or 5 with reduced uptake compared with baseline and residual mass(es) of any size., Day 1 up to 2 years|Best Overall Response Per Lugano Classification, Per the Lugano Classification, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) were defined on the 5-point scale as scores 1, 2, or 3 (where 1 = no uptake above background; 2 = uptake \</= mediastinum; and 3 = uptake \> mediastinum but \</= liver) and PET-positive scans, as scores of 4 or 5 (where 4 = uptake moderately higher than liver; 5 = uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions).

CMR: score of 1, 2 or 3 in nodal or extranodal sites with or without a residual mass.

PMR: score of 4 or 5 with reduced uptake compared with baseline and residual mass(es) of any size.

No metabolic response (NMR): score of 4 or 5 with no obvious change in fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake.

Progressive metabolic disease (PMD): score 4 or 5 in any lesion with an increase in intensity of FDG uptake from baseline (and/or new FDG-avid foci consistent with lymphoma)., Day 1 up to 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined as the time from the date of an initial objective response per Lugano classification to the earlier of progression or death. Participants who had not ended their response at the time of analysis had DOR censored at their last disease assessment date., Day 1 up to 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the interval from Day 1 to the earlier of a lymphoma progression or death from any cause; otherwise, PFS was censored at the last radiographic assessment date. If a participant had no post baseline radiographic assessment and a vital status of alive or unknown, PFS was censored at Day 1., Day 1 up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of Day 1 until death due to any cause. Any participant not known to have died at the time of analysis was censored based on the last recorded date on which the participant was alive., Day 1 up to 2 years
