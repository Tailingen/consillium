A Study of Pembrolizumab (+) Berahyaluronidase Alfa (MK-3475A) (Pembrolizumab Formulated With Berahyaluronidase Alfa (MK-5180)) in Japanese Participants With Recurrent or Metastatic Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (R/M cSCC) or Locally Advanced (LA) Unresectable cSCC (MK-3475A-E39)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) pembrolizumab (+) berahyaluronidase alfa in Japanese participants with recurrent or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or locally advanced unresectable cSCC. The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab (+) berahyaluronidase alfa will result in greater than 10% objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR).
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab (+) Berahyaluronidase alfa
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). The percentage of participants who experience CR or PR as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) will be presented., Up to approximately 40 months
Duration of Response (DOR), For participants who demonstrate CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD. DOR as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 40 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined, per RECIST 1.1, as the percentage of participants who demonstrate a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions), PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions), or stable disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD \[at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD.\]).The DCR as assessed by BICR will be presented., Up to approximately 40 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 40 months|Number of Participants who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who experience at least one AE will be reported., Up to approximately 28 months|Number of Participants who Discontinue Due to an AE, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be reported., Up to approximately 25 months
