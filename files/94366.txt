Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Lestaurtinib in Treating Younger Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
This phase III trial studies combination chemotherapy with or without lestaurtinib with to see how well they work in treating younger patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of stop cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Lestaurtinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without lestaurtinib in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) of infants with mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged (MLL-R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with chemotherapy plus the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor lestaurtinib.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To compare the 3-year EFS of infants with MLL-R ALL treated with chemotherapy plus the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib to MLL-R patients treated with chemotherapy alone.

II. To determine a safe, tolerable and biologically active dose of lestaurtinib given in sequential combination with chemotherapy in MLL-R infants.

III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lestaurtinib in infants when given at the proposed dose in sequential combination with chemotherapy.

IV. To identify molecular mechanisms of resistance to lestaurtinib in leukemic blasts.

V. To describe levels of minimal residual disease in infants with ALL within the context of the proposed therapy, and correlate with outcome.

VI. To identify gene expression patterns in diagnostic infant leukemia samples that correlate with outcome within the context of the proposed therapy.

VII. To describe the outcome of infants with MLL-G ALL treated with a modified P9407 chemotherapy backbone that includes an extended continuation phase.
