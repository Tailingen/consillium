Study of Milademetan in Japanese Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of milademetan in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. The milademetan initial dose will be Level 1: 90 mg. No increase in the milademetan dose will be made in the same participant. Dose-limiting toxicity associated with milademetan occurring at each level will be assessed, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be decided using a modified continuous reassessment method (mCRM).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Milademetan
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) Following Administration of Milademetan in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, A dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) is defined as any Grade 3 or higher non-hematological adverse event unless related to the primary disease, course of the primary disease, complications, or concomitant medications, that occurs during the DLT evaluation period (28 days of Cycle 1). The following events will be assessed as DLTs: Grade 4 aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Grade 3 AST/ALT lasting ≥3 days, Grade 3 AST/ALT with Grade ≥2 total bilirubin, and unable to complete at least 75% of the prescribed doses of milademetan in Cycle1 (28 days) as a result of Grade ≥2 events., First 28 Days of Cycle 1|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Following Administration of Milademetan in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event that occurs after the first administration, or that worsens relative to the pre-treatment state. An AE is any untoward or unintended sign, symptom, or disease noted in participants who received the study drug, whether it is considered to be related to the study drug or not., From date of signing of informed consent form up to 30 days after last dose of study drug, up to 1 year
Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Milademetan Following Administration of Milademetan in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) is defined as the maximum observed plasma concentration and was calculated using non-compartmental analysis., Days 1 & 14 of Cycle 1: Pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 hours post-dose (each cycle is 28 days)|Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Milademetan Following Administration of Milademetan in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Time of Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) is defined as time of maximum observed plasma concentration and was calculated using non-compartmental analysis., Days 1 & 14 of Cycle 1: Pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 hours post-dose (each cycle is 28 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of Milademetan Following Administration of Milademetan in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, AUC during 8 hours (AUC8h), AUC during 24 hours (AUC24h), AUC up to the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast), and AUC up to infinity (AUCinf) are presented for Day 1 of Cycle 1 and were assessed using non-compartmental analysis. AUC8h for Day 14 of Cycle 1 is also presented., Days 1 & 14 of Cycle 1: Pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 hours post-dose (each cycle is 28 days)|Terminal Elimination Half-Life (T1/2) of Milademetan Following Administration of Milademetan in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Terminal elimination half-life (T1/2) was assessed using non-compartmental analysis., Day 1 of Cycle 1: Pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 hours post-dose (each cycle is 28 days)|Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of Milademetan Following Administration of Milademetan in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) was assessed using non-compartmental analysis., Day 14 of Cycle 1: Pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 hours post-dose (each cycle is 28 days)|Number of Participants With Best Response Following Administration of Milademetan in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Best response was defined as the best measured response over all response assessments (complete remission \[CR\], CR with incomplete hematological recovery \[CRi\], CR with partial hematological recovery \[CRh\], partial remission \[PR\], morphologic leukemia-free state \[MLFS\], stable disease \[SD\], or progressive disease \[PD\]) at all time points after the start of study treatment. The best response will be SD if the response is assessed as SD three or more times consecutively in the protocol-specified evaluation of the antitumor effect. If the response is not assessed as SD three or more times consecutively, the best response will be Not Applicable (unconfirmed SD)., From the start of study treatment to the end of study treatment, up to 1 year
