Niraparib, Abiraterone Acetate and Prednisone for mHSPC With Deleterious Homologous Recombination Repair Alterations
This is an open label, phase II trial in subjects with treatment naïve, metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) with deleterious homologous recombination repair (HRR) alteration(s). These include pathologic alterations in BRCA 1/2, BRIP1, CHEK2, FANCA, PALB2, RAD51B, and/or RAD54L. A total of 64 people will be enrolled to the study.

Rate of participants with PSA decline to < 0.2 ng/ml, PSA decline is defined as percentage of participants with PSA decline to \< 0.2 ng/ml at 24 weeks of therapy with ADT and niraparib/abiraterone acetate DAT plus prednisone as determined by Cycle 7 Day 1 PSA, 24 weeks
Rate of participants with PSA reduction ≥ 90% (PSA90), Percentage of participants with PSA reduction ≥ 90% (PSA90) after 24 weeks of therapy with ADT and niraparib/abiraterone acetate DAT plus prednisone as determined by Cycle 7 Day 1 PSA, 24 weeks|Percentage of participants with PSA decline to < 0.2 ng/ml (Cohort A), Percentage of participants with PSA decline to \< 0.2 ng/ml at one year in Cohort A, 12 months|Percentage of participants with PSA decline to < 0.2 ng/ml (Cohort B), Percentage of participants with PSA decline to \< 0.2 ng/ml at one year in Cohort B (with additional evaluation of ADT + docetaxel + abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus ADT niraparib/abiraterone acetate DAT plus prednisone), 12 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of subjects achieving either a complete response or a partial response by RECIST 1.1 in subjects with measurable disease and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG 3) criteria for subjects with bone only metastases (1, 2), 4 years|PSA progression free survival (PFS), Defined as interval from start of study treatment to the earliest event of PSA progression or death due to any cause, or the date of last known follow-up without PSA progression, whichever occurs first, according to criteria of the PCWG 3 criteria: for subjects with a decline from baseline, PSA progression is defined as the time from start of therapy to first PSA increase that is ≥ 25% and ≥ 2 ng/mL above nadir which is confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later (2), 4 years|Radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), Defined as duration from the start of study treatment to the date of first documentation of rPFS or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, according RECIST 1.1 in subjects with measurable disease and PCWG3 criteria for subjects with bone only disease (1, 2), 4 years|Safety of ADT and niraparib/abiraterone acetate DAT plus prednisone, Safety of ADT + niraparib/abiraterone acetate DAT plus prednisone through evaluation of the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0)., 4 years|Safety of ADT and docetaxel/abiraterone acetate plus prednisone, Safety of ADT + docetaxel/abiraterone acetate plus prednisone through evaluation of the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0)., 4 years
