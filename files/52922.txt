Etoposide Plus Cisplatin Compared With Temozolomide in Patients With Glioblastoma
Temozolomide provided significant and clinically meaningful benefit in MGMT gene promoter methylation glioblastoma. However, in unmethylated patients, the effect of Temozolomide is limited. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of Etoposide plus Cisplatin and Temozolomide in patients with MGMT gene promoter unmethylation glioblastoma.
MGMT-Unmethylated Glioblastoma
DRUG: Etoposide Plus Cisplatin
OVER SURVIVAL, The length of time from the date of diagnosis to death from cancer, 2 YEARS
PFS, the length of time after primary treatment for glioblastoma ends that the patient survives without any progression of glioblastoma., 1 year
60 Patients with glioblastoma were recruited for this study based on the following eligibility criteria: Age between 18 and 70, performance status of 0-1 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status), histologically confirmed MGMT gene promoter unmethylation glioblastoma, no cerebrospinal fluid and distant metastatic disease. All patients had adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Patients younger than 18 years; patients with a prior (i.e. within 5 years) or synchronous malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin cancer; and those with significant comorbidities were excluded.

60 patients were randomly divided into two groups and compared the difference of efficacy between the two groups
