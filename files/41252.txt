Erlotinib 100mg qd Versus Gefitinib 250mg qd for EGFR Mutant Nsclc
This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label Phase II trial that compares reduced dose erlotinib 100mg daily and standard dose gefitinib 250mg daily in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who harbor EGFR mutations. The primary endpoint is disease control rate (DCR) and the key secondary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS). A total of 224 eligible patients will be randomized to receive either erlotinib 100mg daily or gefitinib 250mg daily in a 1:1 ratio until patients experience disease progression. Independent assessment of the major endpoints will be completed in a treatment-blinded manner. Randomization will be stratified based on treatment-lines (first-line vs. maintenance vs. second-line therapy). Tumor response and progression will be assessed according to RECIST 1.1.
