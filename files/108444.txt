Diagnostic Accuracy of Ferumoxytol-Enhanced MRI for Detecting Lymph Node Metastases in Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in detecting lymph nodes that have been invaded by tumor cells in patients with colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Ferumoxytol|OTHER: Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in the setting of colorectal cancer with histopathologic analysis as the gold standard., 3 years
This study will investigate the accuracy of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in detecting lymph nodes that have been invaded by tumor cells in patients with colorectal cancer. This study will be performed in addition to any ongoing routine care and will not serve as a substitute for any imaging tests that would be routinely performed prior to surgery.
