A Study of Hydroxychloroquine vs Placebo to Prevent COVID-19 Infection in Patients Receiving Radiotherapy
The researchers are doing this study to find out whether the study drug hydroxychloroquine can prevent infection with the COVID-19 virus, compared with placebo, in people who are receiving radiation therapy for their cancer. The placebo used in this study is a tablet that looks the same as the study drug and is taken in the same way, but it does not contain any active ingredients.

Cumulative Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection, Any patients who are enrolled and subsequently test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (outside RT-PCR test results allowed) at any point during the 9 weeks following enrollment will be an event that is considered in the 9-week SARS-CoV-2 infection rate primary endpoint., within 9 weeks from randomization
