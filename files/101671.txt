CD8 DLI for Patients With Relapse or Residual Disease Following Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
Primary Objectives:

To evaluate response rates of acute or chronic Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following CD8 depleted DLI (Depleted Donor Lymphocyte Infusions) in patients with Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NLM), Multiple Myeloma (MM) and Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HD).

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate safety and treatment related mortality after CD8 depleted DLI.
* To evaluate the time to onset of GVHD following DLI and response to GVHD treatment.
* To evaluate the incidence and timing of pancytopenia following DLI.
* To evaluate disease-free survival, overall survival and relapse rates in three cohorts of patients; early relapse CML, late relapse CML and lymphoproliferative disorders (HD, CLL, NHL and MM).
* To evaluate the need and efficacy of second or subsequent CD8 depleted donor lymphocyte infusions.
* To evaluate the number of apheresis procedures needed to collect appropriate doses of CD4+ cells.
