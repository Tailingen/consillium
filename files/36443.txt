REFRaME-O1: A Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Luveltamab Tazevibulin Versus Investigator's Choice (IC) Chemotherapy in Women With Ovarian Cancer (Including Fallopian Tube or Primary Peritoneal Cancers) Expressing FOLR1
A Phase 2/3 study to investigate the efficacy and safety of luveltamab tazevibulin versus IC chemotherapy in women with ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancers) expressing FOLR1.

DRUG: Luveltamab tazevibulin|DRUG: Pegfilgrastim|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin|DRUG: Topotecan
Progression Free Survival (PFS), time between the date of first dose and the first date of documented progression or death, up to 24 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.1., up to 24 months
Overall Survival (OS), Time between date of first dose and date of death due to an cause or end of study., up to 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Confirmed CR or PR from the first documented response to the date of documented disease progression or death., up to 24 months|Incidence and severity of adverse events [Safety and tolerability], Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory abnormalities., up to 24 months|Quality of life (QLQ-OV28), Quality of Life Questionnaire Ovarian Cancer 28 is a 28-item ovarian cancer supplemental module that evaluates the quality of life of ovarian cancer patients. It assesses abdominal/gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, other chemotherapy side-effects, hormonal/menopausal symptoms, body image, attitude to disease/treatment and sexual functioning., up to 24 months
This is a randomized, multicenter, international, open-label, 2-part, Phase 2/3 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of luveltamab tazevibulin versus IC chemotherapy in subjects with relapsed platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer expressing FOLR1.

Part 1 will consist of 2 luveltamab tazevibulin dosing cohorts (Cohort A and Cohort B), with subjects randomized 1:1. Part 1 will be used to select the optimized dosing regimen.

Part 2 will further evaluate the efficacy and safety of the selected dosing regimen versus IC chemotherapy.

Luveltamab tazevibulin will be administered intravenously (IV) over a 1-hour infusion time every 3 weeks.
