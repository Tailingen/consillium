Carmustine Wafer in Combination With Retifanlimab and Radiation With/Without Temozolomide in Subjects With Glioblastoma
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and survival of carmustine wafers and radiation and retifanlimab with or without temozolomide (TMZ) in newly-diagnosed adult subjects with glioblastoma multiform after carmustine wafer placement.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Retifanlimab|DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Safety of combination retifanlimab and radiation with and without temozolomide as assessed by number of participants who experience adverse events, Number of participants who experience grade 1 or higher adverse events, as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0)., Up to 2 years|Feasibility of combination retifanlimab and radiation with and without temozolomide as assessed by number of participants who experience adverse events, Number of participants who experience grade 1 or higher adverse events, as defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0)., Up to 2 years|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) as determined by number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Maximum tolerated dose will be determined by the maximum dose at which the least number of participants experience dose-limiting toxicity. The dose limiting toxicity is defined using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)., Up to 2 years
