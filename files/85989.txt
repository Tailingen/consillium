Cardiac Safety Study of Entinostat in Men and Women With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of entinostat on heart rate and other electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of entinostat, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters.

Number of Participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAES) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is an AE that occurs after the first dose of study drug. A SAE is defined as any AE that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage., First dose through 30 days post-dose or through resolution of acute toxicities (Up to 31 days)|Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Laboratory Values Reported as a TEAE, Standard safety laboratory tests included Chemistry, Hematology. Any hematologic or clinical chemistry abnormality considered by the investigator to be clinically significant was reported as a TEAE., Baseline (pre-dose) through 14 days post-dose or 30 day safety follow-up visit (if applicable)|Change from Baseline in Vital Signs, Vital signs included temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiration rate, Baseline (pre-dose) through 14 days post-dose or 30 day safety follow-up visit (if applicable)|Change from Baseline in ECG Values, A 12-lead continuous ECG recording (via a Holter) was recorded on Day 1 for 25 hours. Safety ECGs were read and interpreted by the Investigator on-site for the purpose of safety monitoring and were transmitted electronically to the central ECG laboratory for clinical interpretation by a cardiologist, Baseline ()pre-dose through 14 days post-dose or 30 day safety follow-up visit (if applicable)|Change from Baseline in QTc, Pre-dose through 24 hours post-dose|Cmax (Maximum Plasma Concentration) of Entinostat when given as a Single Supratherapeutic Dose, Pre-dose and multiple time-points through 24 hours post-dose and 14 days post-dose|Tmax (Time of Maximum Plasma Concentration) of Entinostat when given as a Single Supratherapeutic Dose, Pre-dose and multiple time-points through 24 hours post-dose and 14 days post-dose|AUC0-24 (Area under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to 24 hours) of Entinostat when given as a Single Supratherapeutic Dose, Pre-dose and multiple time-points through 24 hours post-dose and 14 days post-dose|AUC0-t (Area under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve from Time Zero to the Last Measurable Concentration) of Entinostat when given as a Single Supratherapeutic Dose, Pre-dose and multiple time-points through 24 hours post-dose and 14 days post-dose|AUC0-inf (Area under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve from 0-time Extrapolated to Infinity) of Entinostat when given as a Single Supratherapeutic Dose, Pre-dose and multiple time-points through 24 hours post-dose and 14 days post-dose|t1/2 (Elimination Half-life and Apparent Plasma Terminal Phase Elimination Rate Constant) of Entinostat when given as a Single Supratherapeutic Dose, Pre-dose and multiple time-points through 24 hours post-dose and 14 days post-dose|Î»z (Terminal Elimination Rate Constant) of Entinostat when given as a Single Supratherapeutic Dose, Pre-dose and multiple time-points through 24 hours post-dose and 14 days post-dose

This is a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, single dosing schedule, double-blinded study to evaluate the effect of entinostat as compared to placebo on the electrical activity of the heart in patients with advanced solid tumors. Thirty patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either entinostat or placebo. Study treatment will be blinded to patients and the Investigator. ECG analysts will be blinded to the patient, visit, and treatment allocation. Patients will be on study up to 30 days following study drug administration. Total study duration is expected to be 9 months. After completing this study and at the discretion of the Investigator, patients may elect to enroll into a separate continuation study (SNDX-275-0141).
