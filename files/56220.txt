A Study of Intraperitoneally Administered AVB-001 in Patients With Serous Adenocarcinoma of the Ovary
This is an open-label, First-in-Human, Phase 1/2, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of AVB-001. AVB-001 is an encapsulated cell product engineered to produce native human interleukin-2 (hIL-2). It is delivered intraperitoneally (IP) to patients with high grade serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary, primary peritoneum, or fallopian tube.

This is an open-label, First-in-Human, Phase 1/2, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of AVB-001. AVB-001 is an encapsulated cell product engineered to produce native human interleukin-2 (IL-2). It is delivered intraperitoneally (IP) to patients with high grade serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary, primary peritoneum, or fallopian tube.

The study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 is the Dose Escalation Phase using a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) model-assisted design in which a single dose of 1 of 4 dose levels of AVB-001 will be administered intraperitoneally (IP) in up to 24 patients. The four ascending dose levels of AVB-001 are targeted to produce hIL-2 levels of 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, and 3.6 Î¼g hIL-2/kg/day. The purpose of Part 1 is to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) level.

Part 2 is the Dose Expansion Phase 2 in which a single dose of AVB-001 at the RP2D will be administered in up to 20 additional adult patients with platinum-resistant, high-grade, serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary, primary peritoneum, or fallopian tube. Additional expansion cohorts may be opened in Part 2 either as monotherapy or as an exploratory combination strategy.
