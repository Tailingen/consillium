Fecal Helicobacter Pylori Gene Detection for Gastric Cancer
This is a prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study. The efficacy of fecal H. pylori gastric cancer susceptibility testing in predicting gastric cancer was evaluated by comparing fecal H. pylori gastric cancer susceptibility testing with the "gold standard" imaging tests, such as CT, gastroscopy, and/or pathology, in the enrolled population.
Gastric Adenocarcinoma|Helicobacter Pylori
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Fecal Helicobacter pylori gastric cancer susceptibility gene test
completed all phases of the study, The endpoint of the study will be reached if the participant has completed all phases of the study according to the study protocol (i.e., has completed sample collection, testing, and obtained "gold standard" gastroscopy and/or pathology results) or has withdrawn informed consent., Baseline
Primary study objective: to assess the sensitivity and specificity of fecal H. pylori gastric cancer susceptibility locus-based testing applied to predict gastric cancer.

Secondary research objectives: 1. the accuracy, kappa value, area under the ROC curve, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, positive predictive value, negative predictive value of fecal H. pylori gastric cancer susceptibility locus test applied to predict gastric cancer; 2. whether the predictive ability is significantly higher than that of the conventional tumor markers, such as CA19-9, CEA, and CA72-4, etc.; and 3. combined with fecal methylation detection Predictive ability assessment.

The "fecal H. pylori-based gastric cancer susceptibility locus test" was compared with the "gold standard" CT, gastroscopy and/or pathology, and the results were analyzed for consistency.
