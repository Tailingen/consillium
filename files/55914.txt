Cadonilimab (AK104) Plus Chemotherapy in Patients With Recurrent or Advanced Endometrial Cancer
This is an open-label, multi-center Phase II study of cadonilimab (AK104) combined with chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer. The primary objective is to evaluate objective response rate of cadonilimab plus chemotherapy.
Endometrial Cancer|Endometrial Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Cadonilimab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of patients with best response of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, from the first drug administration up to two years
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of patients whose best overall response is either CR, PR, or SD, from the first drug administration up to two years|Duration of response (DOR), Time from first documented response (CR or PR) until documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, from the first drug administration up to two years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, from the first drug administration up to two years|Overall survival (OS), Time from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of death due to any cause, from the first drug administration up to two years|Adverse event (AE), Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), and clinically significant abnormal laboratory results, From the subject signs the ICF to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment or initiation of other anti-tumor therapy, whichever occurs first
Biomarkers associated with the response to cadonilimab plus chemotherapy, Exploration of biomarkers that predict the efficacy of cadonilimab combined with chemotherapy, Samples taken prior to the first dose of drug to confirm the result of MSI-H/dMMR and PD-L1
