A Study to Evaluate PEEL-224 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, dose escalation, repeat-dose, multi-center, open-label study evaluating safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary antitumor activity of PEEL-224 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This is a first-in-human, dose escalation, repeat-dose, multi-center, open-label study evaluating safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary antitumor activity of a novel topoisomerase I inhibitor (PEEL-224) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Dose escalation will be guided by the modified toxicity probability interval-2 (mTPI-2) design with a target toxicity rate of 25% and an acceptable DLT interval of 20% to 30%. Cohorts of 2 or more patients will be sequentially enrolled at progressively higher dose levels of PEEL-224. For each dose level, all patients must complete Cycle 1 before the decision to dose escalate the next cohort of patients is made.
