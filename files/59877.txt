This is a first in human, Phase 1/2, open label, dose escalation and dose expansion study that consists of two stages:

Phase 1: A dose escalation stage to determine the MTD/RP2D of ORIN1001 when given as a single agent in up to 30 subjects with advanced solid tumors. In addition, a dose escalation stage to determine the MTD/RP2D of daily ORIN1001 in combination with Abraxane given intravenously in up to 18 subjects with relapsed refractory metastatic breast cancer (TNBC or ER+ HER2-).
