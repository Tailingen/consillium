A Study of HLD-0915 in Patients With Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
Assessment of the safety and efficacy of HLD-0915 as monotherapy in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) that have progressed on prior systemic therapies, once a recommended dose for expansion (RDE) has been determined in Phase 1 of the trial.

This is a Phase 1/2, open-label study of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumor activity of oral single-agent HLD-0915. Patients on the study must continue androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) unless surgically castrated,

The study will include an initial Phase 1 portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDEs) of HLD-0915 as monotherapy and Phase 2 expansion cohorts to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of HLD-0915.

Phase 1 of this study is an open-label, dose-escalation and cohort expansion study in patients with mCRPC that have progressed after prior systemic therapies. Patients will be enrolled in monotherapy dose-escalation cohorts using a Bayesian optimal interval with backfill (BF-BOIN) design. Patients are treated in cohort size of 3 with the enrollment staggered between cohorts.

Phase 2 of this study will evaluate the anti-tumor activity of HLD-0915 administered at the RDEs in patients with mCRPC. Phase 2 study design and patient population will be based on the outcomes of Phase 1 of the trial.
