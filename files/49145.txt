Bone Biopsy Study For Dialysis Patients With Secondary Hyperparathyroidism of End Stage Renal Disease
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of cinacalcet on markers of bone turnover in patients with kidney disease who are receiving dialysis.
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism
DRUG: Sensipar (Cinacalcet HCl)
Change From Baseline to End of Study in Bone Formation Rate (BFR), Baseline to week 52
Percent Change From Baseline in Serum Calcium During the Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), Baseline to weeks 40-52|Percent Change From Baseline in Serum Phosphorus During the Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), Baseline to weeks 40-52|Percent Change From Baseline in Ca x P During the Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), Baseline to weeks 40-52|Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BALP) at Week 52, Baseline to week 52|Percent Change From Baseline in N - Telopeptide (NTx) at Week 52, Baseline to week 52|Percent Change From Baseline in Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) During the Efficacy Assessment Phase (EAP), Baseline to weeks 40-52|Change From Baseline to End of Study in Osteoblast Perimeter (Osteoblast Perimeter/Osteoid Perimeter), Osteoblast Perimeter was calculated as "Osteoblast Perimeter/Osteoid Perimeter \* 100", Baseline to week 52|Change From Baseline to End of Study in Osteoclast Perimeter (Osteoclast Perimeter/Eroded Perimeter), Osteoclast Perimeter was calculated as "Osteoclast Perimeter/Eroded Perimeter \* 100", Baseline to week 52|Change in Categorization From Baseline to End of Study in Fibrosis Area/Tissue Area, Categorisation at each timepoint was based on fibrosis area as a percentage of tissue area (Fibrosis Area/Tissue Area \* 100), Baseline to week 52|Change From Baseline to End of Study in Eroded Perimeter/Bone Perimeter, Eroded Perimeter/Bone Perimeter was calculated as "Eroded Perimeter/Bone Perimeter \* 100", Baseline to week 52|Percent Change From Baseline in Osteocalcin (OC) at Week 52, Baseline to week 52|Percent Change From Baseline in Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase(TRAP) at Week 52, Baseline to week 52
Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is common in people with end stage renal disease (kidney disease). Patients with secondary HPT often have enlarged parathyroid glands in the neck and as a result often have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels . Patients with secondary HPT may have bone disease (osteodystrophy). Cinacalcet has been used to decrease PTH levels in patients with secondary HPT. Patients with secondary HPT may have bone disease (osteodystrophy). This bone disease may cause bone pain, fractures, and poor formation of red blood cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate effects of cinacalcet on markers of bone turnover in patients with kidney disease who are receiving dialysis.
