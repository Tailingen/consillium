Effects of Maintenance Cabozantinib+BSC Versus BSC in Children and AYA With Osteosarcoma
The participants of this study will be children, adolescents, and young adults with residual osteosarcoma, which cannot be removed completely through surgery.

Participants will have achieved a partial response or stable disease at the end of conventional chemotherapy. Osteosarcoma is cancer of the bone. The cancer cells make immature bone cells, known as osteoid.

Osteosarcoma is very rare, but it is the most common type of bone cancer in children and teens. It is most common in teens and young adults.

In this study, participants will receive either cabozantinib and best supportive care or the best supportive care alone. Best supportive care will be provided at the investigator's discretion and according to institutional guidelines.

It includes antibiotics, nutritional support, correction of metabolic disorders, optimal symptom control and pain management (including radiotherapy), etc. but does not include tumor specific therapy.

Cabozantinib will be taken by mouth (orally), as a tablet, once a day. Cabozantinib will be provided to participants who tolerate it for as long as their disease does not progress. Participants in the study receiving best supportive care alone may switch to treatment with cabozantinib and best supportive care if their disease progresses and if other eligibility criteria are met.

Participants may withdraw consent to participate at any time.

The estimated duration of the study for participants is 24 months, however a participant could remain in the study longer if demonstrating treatment benefit.

Progression-free Survival (PFS) assessed by Blinded Independent Radiology Committee (BIRC), PFS defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From randomization until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (approximately 34 months).
Progression-free survival (PFS) rate assessed by BIRC, PFS rate at 4 months and 1 year was defined as the probability that participants have not progressed by BIRC assessment and remain alive at 4 months and 1 year., 4 months and 1 year after randomization.|Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by BIRC, ORR defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) determined by BIRC., Approximately 34 months after randomization.|Disease control rate (DCR) assessed by BIRC, Defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) determined by BIRC, Approximately 34 months after randomization.|PFS assessed by investigator, Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression determined by investigator or the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, From randomization until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (approximately 34 months).|PFS rate assessed by investigator, Defined as the probability that participants have not progressed by investigator assessment and remain alive at 4 months and 1 year., At 4 months and 1 year after randomization.|ORR assessed by investigator, Defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) determined by investigator using RECIST version 1.1., Approximately 34 months after randomization.|DCR assessed by investigator, Defined as the proportion of participants who have achieved CR, PR, or SD determined by investigator., Approximately 34 months after randomization.|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death, from any cause, From randomization until death or last contact (approximately 34 months).|1-year overall survival rate, Defined as the probability participants alive at 1 year., At 1 year after randomization.|Percentage of participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)., An Adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. AESIs are AEs that may not be serious but are of special importance to a particular drug or class of drugs., From screening to 30 days after last dose.|Area Under Curve (AUC) at steady state., At Day 1 of week 1 and Day 1 of week 5.|Average concentration (Cavg) at steady state, At Day 1 of week 1 and Day 1 of week 5.|Minimum concentration (Cmin) at steady state, At Day 1 of week 1 and Day 1 of week 5.|Maximal concentration (Cmax) at steady state, At Day 1 of week 1 and Day 1 of week 5.|Acceptability and palatability in children and adolescents assessed using a horizontal visual assessment scale., Five-point Facial Hedonic Scale (FHS) with a correlated 100-point horizontal Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (FHS/VAS-5) will be used to assess acceptability and palatability in children and adolescents. Final scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better palatability and acceptability., Day of first dose.|Change from baseline in score for all Paediatric QoL Inventory (PedsQL) Scales including Generic Core Scales and Cancer Modules., The PedsQL is a modular instrument designed to measure health-related quality of life in children and adolescent. The PedsQL generic core scales are multidimensional child self-report and parent proxy-report scales developed as the generic core measure to be integrated with the PedsQL. The PedsQL cancer modules was designed to measure paediatric cancer specific HRQoL. Final total scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health related quality of life., From screening to 30 days after last dose.|Change from baseline in European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) (EORTC QLQ-C30) for adult participants, The EORTC QLQ-C30 was developed by the EORTC Quality of Life Group to assess HRQoL, functioning, and symptoms in cancer clinical trials. It is a 30-item self-administered questionnaire for all cancer types. Final scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health related quality of life. A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems., From screening to 30 days after last dose.
