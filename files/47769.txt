The subjects rates the severity of impairment for each dimensions on a 3-point scale(1 to 3). The digits for five dimensions were combined in a five-digit number describing the respondent's health state. Health states were converted into a weighted health state index. High score is indicating high health.

Change from Baseline: weighted health state index at each observation minus weighted health state index at baseline, Day 28 of Cycle 1; Day 1, 28 of Cycles 2-4|Number of Subjects With Disease Controlled Based on the Extramural Review Committee Assessment in Recommended Dose Group, Number of subjects with Disease Controlled is defined as sum of the subjects confirmed with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD)\>= 10 weeks on study according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)., Day 28 of Cycles 1-4|Number of Subjects With Objective Response Based on the Extramural Review Committee Assessment in Recommended Dose Group, Number of subjects with Objective Response is defined as sum of the subjects confirmed with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)., Day 28 of Cycles 1-4|Time To Tumor Progression (TTP), Time To tumor Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of Progressive Disease (PD)., From the first dose to Progressive Disease|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of Progressive Disease (PD) or death., From the first dose to Progressive Disease or Death|Time To Failure (TTF), Time To Failure (TTF) is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the first documentation of Progressive Disease (PD), the date of treatment discontinuation except completion of treatment, or date of death due to cancer., From the first dose to Progressive Disease, Treatment discontinuation except completion of treatment, or Death due to cancer.|Overall Survival Time, Overall Survival Time is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of the death due to any cause. For subjects whose death had not been confirmed, Overall Survival Time was censored on the last date when the patient was known to be alive.

Survival was surveyed once a year from the registration day of the first subject, for all the subjects who received the study drug at least once., From the first dose to death
