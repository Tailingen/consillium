Laparoscopic Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy
The purpose of this research is evaluate the results with laparoscopic ALPPS procedure in a single center. The validity, feasibility and limitations were assessed objectively through our clinical prospective study.The investigators expect laparoscopic ALPPS is safe, effective and feasible.
Liver Tumor
PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic ALPPS
Safety of the procedure defined as the incidence of postoperative complications and mortality, within the first 90 days after the first stage
survival rate, follow-up after the surgery every 3months, to understand relapse, death, statistics 1-year, 3-year overall survival rates，disease-free survival rates , recurrence and metastasis rate., 3 years
Background: Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) is a breakthrough in the field of hepatobiliary surgery in recent years，which stimulates the remnant liver volume(RLV) grew by 74%-87.2% in 9 to 13 days。The published literature reported that the two stages of ALPPS are the conventional laparotomy surgery，Patients need to undergo the injury of two open operations in a short time. The incidence of postoperative complications and mortality rate is as high as 53% -73% and 12%-27%.The aim of this study was to evaluate the results with laparoscopic ALPPS procedure in a single center, with special emphasis in validity, feasibility and limitations.

Results:

Clinical data include: operation time, intraoperative blood loss, volume of blood transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function, long-term curative effect and survival time were collected and analysed.

Statistical method:groups t-test ，univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis, mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis ，Kaplan-Meier survival analysis，Log-rank survival curves were used.
