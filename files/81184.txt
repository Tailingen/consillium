Role of Acetaldehyde in the Development of Oral Cancer
This is a minimal risk intervention study where healthy volunteers and individuals with Fanconi anemia will consume a single dose of alcohol and provide primarily non-invasive biological samples at various time points. Biospecimens to be collected include saliva, oral cells collected via mouthwash and cheek brush, and urine. The collection of two blood samples (5 mL each) will be optional and banked for future use.

DRUG: Alcohol|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Breath Test
Determine the acetaldehyde exposure to the oral cavity by comparing saliva levels before and after alcohol dose, Identify and quantify DNA adducts in the oral cells (mouthwash and cheek brush samples)., Prior to alcohol dose, and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours post alcohol dose
Urine will be analyzed to confirm non-smoking status, The optional blood samples will be analyzed for DNA adducts in the blood. We will measure the total concentration of the marker NNAL in urine., Prior to alcohol exposure|Urine will be analyzed to confirm non-smoking status, The optional blood samples will be analyzed for DNA adducts in the blood. We will measure the total concentration of the marker NNAL in urine., Up to 6 hours after alcohol exposure
