Combination of Capmatinib + Spartalizumab in Advanced Oesogastric Adenocarcinoma
Immunotherapy with anti-PD1 antibodies provides encouraging results on a subset of patients. Capmatinib, a MET inhibitor, has shown an imunomodulatory effect and a synergy with spartalizumab a PD-1 inhibitor. The purpose of this phase II trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of capmatinib + spartalizumab in adult patients with advanced oesogastric adenocarcinoma.
