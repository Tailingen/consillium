CMP-001 in Combination With Nivolumab Compared to Nivolumab Monotherapy in Subjects With Advanced Melanoma
CMP-001-011 is a Phase 2/3 study of CMP-001 intratumoral (IT) and nivolumab intravenous (IV) compared to nivolumab monotherapy administered to participants with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

The study is divided into two phases: Phase 2 and Phase 3.

The primary objective of Phase 2 of the study is to determine confirmed objective response rate (ORR) for treatment with first-line CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

The secondary objective of Phase 2 of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of first-line CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

The primary objective of Phase 3 of the study is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) for subjects receiving first-line CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

The secondary objectives of Phase 3 are to:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of first-line CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
* To evaluate the efficacy of first-line CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

Phase 2: Determine confirmed objective response with CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as proportion of subjects with a confirmed objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) as determined by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)., From first dose of drug (Week 1 Day 1) until 30 days after the last drug injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)|Phase 3: Evaluate progression-free survival for subjects receiving CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as time from date of randomization to first date of documented progressive disease based on RECIST v1.1 by BICR or death (from any cause, whichever occurs first)., From date of randomization until 30 days after last CMP-001 injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)
Phase 2 & 3: Evaluate the safety & tolerability of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma defined by AEs, SAEs, & AEs leading to discontinuation or death & severity of AEs., Defined by adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), \& AEs leading to discontinuation or death \& severity of AEs as assessed by NCI CTCAE version 5.0., From time of informed consent until 30 days after the last drug injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)|Phase 3: Overall survival (OS), The time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., From date of randomization until 30 days after last CMP-001 injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)|Phase 3: Confirmed objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects with a confirmed objective response of CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1 as determined by BICR., From first dose of drug (Week 1 Day 1) until 30 days after last CMP-001 injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)|Phase 3: Duration of response (DOR), The time from date of first documented response (CR or PR) to date of documented progressive disease, based on RECIST v1.1 as determined by BICR., From first dose of drug (Week 1 Day 1) until 30 days after last CMP-001 injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)|Phase 3: Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of subjects with confirmed best response of CR or PR, or stable disease lasting at least 4 months, based on RECIST v1.1 as determined by BICR., From first dose of drug (Week 1 Day 1) until 30 days after last CMP-001 injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)|Phase 3: Treatment response (TR) in non-injected target lesions, The confirmed ORR in non-injected target lesions based on the RECIST v1.1. Treatment response in non-injected lesions based on RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment (IA)., From first dose of drug (Week 1 Day 1) until 30 days after last CMP-001 injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)|Phase 3: Immune PFS (iPFS), The time from date of first dose of study drug to date of iCPD by IA or death, whichever occurs first., From first dose of CMP-001 (Week 1 Day 1) until 30 days after the last CMP-001 injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)|Phase 3: Immune DOR (iDOR), The time from the date of the first immune response (iCR or iPR) to the date of immune confirmed progressive disease (iCPD) by IA., From first dose of CMP-001 (Week 1 Day 1) until 30 days after the last CMP-001 injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)|Phase 3: Immune ORR (iORR), The proportion of subjects with a best overall response of immune complete response (iCR) or immune partial response (iPR) based on the immunotherapy Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST) by IA., From first dose of CMP-001 (Week 1 Day 1) until 30 days after the last CMP-001 injection (until a reason for treatment discontinuation occurs)
