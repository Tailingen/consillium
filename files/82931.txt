Phase II Study of Alimta (Pemetrexed) Treatment of Advanced Thymoma and Thymic Carcinoma
To study the efficacy of Alimta as a single agent in thymic cancers
Thymoma|Thymic Carcinoma
DRUG: Premetrexed (Alimta)
Objective Response Rate (Complete and Partial Response), The percent of patients having an objective response (complete or partial response) will be estimated with a 95% exact binomial confidence interval for the percent of patients receiving drug. RECIST v1.0 will be used. At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions in reference to the baseline longest diameter will need to take place to be considered an objective response., Up to 3 years
Duration of Remission, Will be examined using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Time from earliest confirmed remission criteria until death or progression will be calculated. If a patient continued to be in remission at the end of the study, they will be censored at their last evaluation in the analysis., Time from the date of remission until progression or death, assessed up to 3 years|Grade 3/4 Treatment Related Adverse Events, To determine the toxicity of premetrexed in this patient population, the number of patients who experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events will be reported that were treatment related (possibly, probably, definitely)., Up to 3 years
The broad range of clinical activity of thymic carcinomas makes the likelihood of detecting efficacy of a single agent such as premetrexed a reasonable objective since these malignancies are relatively slow growing and exhibit a broad range of chemosensitivity to antineoplastic agents.
