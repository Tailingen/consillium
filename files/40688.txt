Intravenous Tranexamic Acid Reducing Intraoperative Blood Loss in Huge Meningiomas Resection
Intra-operative blood loss of huge meningioma resection patients on average was over 1000ml. Intra-operative massive hemorrhage was associated with longer hospital of stay, higher expense, and higher mortality. Previous studies indicated intra-operative tranexamic acid infusion would decrease blood loss for cardiac, trauma and obstetric procedures. However, limited researches focusing on the effect of tranexamic acid in neurosurgery population, with heterogenous pathologies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of tranexamic acid on intra-operative blood loss in patients undergoing huge meningioma resection.
