Erlotinib vs. Standard Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)Performance Status (PS) 2
The purpose of this noncomparative study is to obtain preliminary estimates of the efficacy of erlotinib and standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced, previously untreated nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2. The study will also evaluate the safety of single-agent erlotinib in this patient population.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Tarceva (Trademark) (erlotinib HCl, OSI-774)|DRUG: Combination carboplatin and paclitaxel
Progression-free Survival, Median time until disease progression. Disease progression defined as radiological and/or symptomatic disease progression or death in absence of progression., Until time of disease progression (maximum 5 months)
Overall Survival, Median number of months from first study treatment until time of death, From first study treatment until time of death (maximum 26.8 months)|Best Tumor Response, Change in size of tumor: Complete Response (CR) = no measurable tumor; Partial Response (PR) = 30% decrease in size of measurable tumor; Stable Disease (SD) = measurable tumor size has not changed; Progressive Disease (PD) = measurable tumor 20% larger than at baseline., While receiving study treatment (maximum 60 weeks)
