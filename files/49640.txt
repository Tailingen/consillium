Evaluation of Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to iRECIST (Unconfirmed), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants for each dose level whose best overall response is rated as iCR or iPR per immune Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (iRECIST) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI.

iCR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes must be \<10 mm in the short axis.

iPR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the baseline sum of the diameters., Data collected from screening until time of disease progression, death, lost to follow up, study discontinuation, whichever occurs first, assessed up to approximately 68 months|Evaluation of Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to iRECIST (Confirmed), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants for each dose level whose best overall response is rated as iCR or iPR per immune Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (iRECIST) for target lesions and assessed by CT or MRI.

Up to 187 patients will be recruited in the TACTI-002 (Two ACTive Immunotherapies) Phase II study which will take place across approximately 22 study centres in the U.S., Europe and Australia. It will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of eftilagimod alpha with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma or head and neck carcinoma. It will be a Simon's two-stage, non-comparative, open-label, single-arm, multicentre clinical study. Patients participating in the trial will be given the combination treatment for 12 months using a 30 mg s.c. eftilagimod alpha dosing every 2 or 3 weeks.
