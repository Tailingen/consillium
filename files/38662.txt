Investigating Efficacy and Safety of Two Degarelix Three-Month Dosing Regimens in Patients With Prostate Cancer Requiring Androgen Ablation Therapy
The study will have two treatment groups, evaluating two Degarelix doses. First dose is the initial dose followed by a maintenance dose given every three months. The initial dose given to suppress the testosterone level and the three month maintenance dose to maintain the suppressed testosterone level over one year of treatment.
