An Initial Safety Study of Gedatolisib Plus PTK7-ADC for Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer
Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and effect of Gedatolisib and PTK7-ADC for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer
Triple Negative Breast Cancer|Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Gedatolisib|DRUG: PTK7-ADC
Safety of Gedatolisb + PTK7-ADC using NCI CTCAE v4.0, safety and toxicity data will be assessed using NCI CTCAE v4.0 and tabulated and reported, through study completion i.e. up to 1 year
Efficacy in all enrolled subjects, efficacy as determined by clinical benefit at 18 weeks, 18 weeks|Overall response rate in all enrolled subjects, efficacy as determined by overall response rate, through study completion i.e. up to 1 year|Progression free survival in all enrolled subjects, efficacy as determined by progression free survival, through study completion i.e. up to 1 year|Pharmacodynamic determination of inhibition of PI3k signaling, Pathological H-score will be determined from tissue obtained at screening and Cycle 1 Day 15. H-score will be compared to calculate percentage inhibition between samples., Cycle 1 Day 15|Pharmacodynamic determination modulation of Wnt pathway, pathological H-score will be determined from tissue obtained at screening and Cycle 1 Day 15. H-score will be compared to calculate percentage change in expression between samples., Cycle 1 Day 15|Pharmacodynamic determination modulation of Wnt pathway, RNA sequencing of tissue collected at screening and Cycle 1 Day 1 to compare Wnt pathway expression after treatment, Cycle 1 Day 15
