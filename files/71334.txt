Impact of Catch-up HPV Vaccination
Each year in France, more than 6000 new cases of HPV inducted cancers are recorded. The vaccinal cover stays insufficient since less than 30% of the french population is vaccinated. Therefore french studies about vaccine efficacy and especially about the catch-up vaccine (done after 15years old) are needed.

HPVAC2 is a prospective, analytic and monocentric study designed to learn the impact of the catch-up HPV vaccination.

Women from 25 years old and born after 1984 may be included if they come to the Brest CHU to do their regular cervical smear. At this time, a survey will be given to know their vaccinal status.

The aim of the study is to prove the efficacy of the catch up vaccination by analyzing the cervical smears results and by comparing the vaccinated group with the not-vaccinated group.
