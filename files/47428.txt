RACIN in Patients With Advanced TIL-negative Solid Tumors
Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic incurable Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL)-negative solid tumors who are not eligible for, declined or failed standard therapy will be treated with a combination nivolumab, low-dose ionizing radiation (RT) (0.5-2 Gy), aspirin (ASA)(cohorts 1 and 2)/celecoxib (cohorts 3, 4 and Phase Ib), and either ipilimumab or low-dose cyclophosphamide. The study comprises 2 phases: The aim of Phase Ia, is to determine safety and tolerability of a given combination therapy, as well as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase Ib dose (RP1bD) of radiotherapy. Phase Ib aims to further explore safety and tolerability of this treatment in an expansion cohort.

In Phase Ia, 4 distinct cohorts will receive the following combination therapy:

Cohort1: combination therapy for 5 cycles (C0-C4) which includes: RT 0.5 Gy every 2 weeks (Q2W), Cy (200 mg/m2) Q2W (cycles C0 to C4); ASA (300 mg) daily, with nivolumab 240 mg flat dose Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W) will be administered (cycles C1 to C4).

Cohort2: combination therapy for 5 cycles (C0-C4) which includes: RT 1 Gy every 2 weeks (Q2W), Cy (200 mg/m2) Q2W (cycles C0 to C4); ASA (300 mg) daily, with nivolumab 240 mg flat dose Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Q6W) will be administered (cycles C1 to C4).

Cohorts 3a and 4a: Patients will receive Cy (200 mg/m2) Q2W, celecoxib (2x200mg daily), nivolumab (240 mg flat dose) Q2W, and low-dose radiation. Cohort 3a will receive 1 Gy of low-radiation dose and cohort 4a will receive 2 Gy.

Cohorts 3b and 4b: Patients will receive nivolumab (240 mg flat dose) Q2W, ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Q6W), celecoxib (2x200mg daily) and low-dose radiation. Cohort 3b will receive 1 Gy of low-radiation dose and cohort 4b will receive 2 Gy.

In Phase Ia, the safety of combination (nivolumab, celecoxib, low-dose irradiation and cyclophosphamide) or (nivolumab, celecoxib, low-dose irradiation and ipilimumab) will be evaluated , and MTD or RP1bD will be defined. RP1bD will be the MTD or, in the absence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), the biologically best RT dose based on pharmacodynamics parameters.

In Phase Ib, patients will be treated with the MTD or RP1bD dose of RT and will follow the selected schema of treatment used in the Phase Ia cohort 3 or 4. At the end of the 5th cycle, patients eligible for nivolumab maintenance, will be treated with nivolumab at 240 mg Q2W until progression or excessive toxicity; celecoxib will be maintained according to tolerability.

Phases Ia and Ib: Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Phase Ia and IB: Toxicity and tolerability will be assessed through measure and evaluation of adverse events occuring during the study, using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CommonTerminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4.03), 3.5 years|Maximum Tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase Ib dose of low-dose irradiation for radio-immunotherapy combination (RP1bD)., MTD is defined as the dose level below the dose that causes a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in more than 17% of participants. The MTD analysis population will consist of all evaluable participants registered in the phase Ia , who completed the DLT/ backbone limiting toxicity (BLT) period (cycle C0 and C1), unless discontinued due to toxicity. RP1bD will be the MTD or, in the absence of DLTs, the biologically best radiotherapy dose based on pharmacodynamics parameters., 3.5 years
Objective response rate (ORR), Best objective response rate (Complete Response or Partial Response) during the period from enrolment to termination of trial treatment, will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 or PCWG3 criteria for prostate cancer., 3.5 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Percentage of patients achieving Complete Response, Partial Response or Stable Disease at the end of four cycles of combination therapy (i.e. at 6 months) as well as at 12 and 24 months, will be measured by RECIST v.1.1 or PCWG3 criteria for prostate cancer., 6,12 and 24 months|Progression free survival (PFS) rate, The time from enrolment until objective tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first, will be evaluated at 6,12 and 24 months by RECIST v.1.1 or PCWG3 criteria for prostate cancer., 6,12 and 24 months|Time to Progression (TTP):, The time from enrolment until objective tumor progression, will be evaluated by RECIST v.1.1 or PCWG3 criteria for prostate cancer., 3.5 years|Overall survival (OS), OS will be assessed at 12 and 24 months, 12 and 24 months
Exploratory outcomes: Assessment of treatment response, Assessment of treatment response will be performed through monitoring of tumor metabolism using 18Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT or 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for prostate cancer patients., 5 years|Exploratory outcomes: Immune monitoring of the tumor, Tumor immune profile will be assessed by multiplexed immunohistochemistry, tumor immunophenotyping, RNA expression as well as flow cytometry, ELISA and ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunospot) assays., 5 years|Exploratory outcomes: Immune monitoring of the tumor microenvironment, Tumor microenvironment immune profile will be assessed by multiplexed immunohistochemistry, tumor immunophenotyping, RNA expression as well as flow cytometry, ELISA and ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunospot) assays., 5 years
