Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of JCXH-211 in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive High-Grade Glioma
This is a phase 1 open label study to establish the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and preliminary efficacy of a single dose of JCXH-211. The study agent JCXH-211, is a self-replicating RNA (srRNA)-based human IL-12, administered intratumorally via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma. Primary objective is to determine MTD or RP2D for a single dose on the study drug. Secondary outcomes include overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by modified mRANO 2.0.
Recurrent or Progressive High-grade Glioma
BIOLOGICAL: JCXH-211
MTD or RP2D, Determine Minimum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of JCXH-211 in patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma, Day 1 of treatment until 28 days post first infusion
Overall Survival, Day 1 of treatment until death to calculate Median overall survival by the Kaplan-Meier method., 5 years|Progression Free Survival, Day 1 of treatment until first documentation of disease progression as assessed by modified RANO 2.0 criteria or death to calculate Median progression free survival by the Kaplan-Meier method., 5 years
This is a Phase 1 open label study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and MTD or RP2D of the study drug, JCXH-211 as administered by CED in patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma based on radiographic findings including patients with recurrent IDH-wildtype GBM or recurrent IDH-mutated astrocytoma, who have progressed after receiving standard-of-care therapy.

A stereotactic biopsy will be performed prior to administration of the study drug to confirm viable tumor and a catheter will be implanted into the appropriate site which will be confirmed by Computed Tomography (CT) scan post-operatively. A continuous intratumoral infusion of JCXH-211 at the assigned dose level will be administered as in patient. An Ommaya reservoir will also be placed in the lateral ventricle at time of surgery to remove intracranial pressure by removing CSF and collect sample for exploratory analyses.

Patients will be followed up in clinic at 1 week and 2 weeks for adverse events (AEs),and subsequently for AEs and radiographic monitoring at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and every 8 weeks thereafter until 48 weeks or disease progression, whichever occurs first.
