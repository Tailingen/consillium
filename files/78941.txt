Identifying Molecular Drivers of Cancer
The primary aim of this study is to identify drivers of cancer by performing comprehensive genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic characterization of patient samples as a basis for understanding the underlying cause of disease.

GENETIC: Molecular profile
Genetic profiling, To determine genetic changes associated with the development and growth of human disease. This should lead to better ways to detect, prevent, and treat a wide variety of human health conditions, including cancer., Up to 15 years
This study involves looking at the DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites in blood and tissue samples collected from subjects and linking them to their health information. By doing so, researchers hope to discover the underlying molecular causes of human diseases with the hope that this information can be used for the development of diagnostic tests and more effective treatments.
