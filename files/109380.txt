Development of a Self-collection Device for Cervical Cancer Screening
Evaluation of a novel self-collection device for cervical cancer screening.
Human Papilloma Virus Infection Type 16|Human Papilloma Virus Infection Type 18|Human Papilloma Virus
DEVICE: Teal Health Self-Collection Device Group
Primary Safety: SAEs, Evaluate SAEs to confirm that SAEs from self-collection are equivalent to the rate of SAEs from health care provider-collection, Acute - immediately after self-collection procedure|Primary Effectiveness: Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA), Detection of high risk HPV in self-collected as compared to clinician-collected sample results., Up to 30 days|Primary Effectiveness: Sample Inadequacy Rate, Sample inadequacy rate defined as percent of high risk HPV DNA concentrations below the detection thresholds as determined by the manufacturer., Up to 30 days
Usability Survey, Usability Survey data will be analyzed to determine device design issues (There is no scale - questions are assessed individually), Immediately After Self-collection Procedure|Satisfaction and Needs Survey, Satisfaction and Needs Survey data will be used to assess subjects' general willingness to use an HPV self-collection device, and concerns about HPV self-collection. (There is no scale - questions are assessed individually), Immediately After Self-collection Procedure|Rate of sample adequacy for liquid-based cytology analysis, Samples will be assessed to determine if there is an adequate number of cells for liquid-based cytology analysis, Up to 30 days
The purpose of this study is to collect design and user input on the safety and effectiveness of the Teal Health self-collection device for patient self-collection of cervicovaginal samples for use with FDA-approved in vitro diagnostics indicated for high risk Human Papillomavirus (hrHPV) screening.
