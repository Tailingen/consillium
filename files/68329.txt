BR55 in Prostate Cancer: an Exploratory Clinical Trial
The purpose of this study is to determine whether BR55 is able to identify areas of VEGFR2 expression in human prostate by ultrasound molecular imaging.

This will be compared with histopathology analysis (location based on expression of VEGFR2 in tissue specimens determined by immuno-histochemistry, IHC).
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: BR55
BR55 sensitivity assessment, Assess the ability of BR55 to identify area(s) of VEGFR2 expression in human prostate by ultrasound molecular imaging on the basis of a visual score in comparison with histopathology analysis (location based on expression of VEGFR2 in tissue specimens determined by immuno-histochemistry, IHC)., Day 1
BR55 specificity assessment, Evaluate the specificity of BR55 targeting for prostate cancer relative to normal prostate gland on the basis of a visual score in comparison with routine histopathology analysis and IHC assessment of VEGFR2 expression in tissue specimens., Day 1
