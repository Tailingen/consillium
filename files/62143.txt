Study of Combined Fulvestrant and Everolimus in Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer After Aromatase Inhibitor Failure
The primary objective of this study is to determine if estrogen receptor-targeted therapy with fulvestrant used in combination with Everolimus is an effective and safe therapy for women with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer after failure of aromatase inhibitor therapy.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Time to Progression, Duration of time start of treatment to time of documented progression or death
Objective Response Rates, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Evaluated 60 days after therapy start|Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate is defined as a complete response, partial response, or stable disease (CR, PR, SD) by Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for a minimum of at least 24 weeks or more., Duration of response or stable disease for 24 weeks or more
Fulvestrant, which degrades ER, is used after aromatase inhibitor (AI) failure in metastatic breast cancer but resistance develops quickly. We hypothesized that using everolimus to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key signaling pathway in endocrine resistance, may delay fulvestrant resistance in patients and thus improve its efficacy. We conducted a phase II trial of combined fulvestrant and everolimus in postmenopausal women with disease progression or relapse after an AI. Primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP) and secondary endpoints included objective response rate, clinical benefit rate (CBR), safety, and biomarker correlates. Tumor blocks were collected and biopsy of accessible tumor was done for future biomarker analysis.
