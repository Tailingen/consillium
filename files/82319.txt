Hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate Metabolic MRI With Infiltrating Gliomas
The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and feasibility of performing hyperpolarized metabolic MRI in the diagnosis of brain tumor. This study will also assess the accuracy of hyperpolarized metabolic MRI to diagnose intermediate to patients with infiltrating gliomas and examine the added utility of metabolic MRI over standard MRI imaging

The FDA is allowing the use of hyperpolarized \[1-13C\] pyruvate (HP 13C-pyruvate) in this study.

Up to 5 patients may take part in this study at the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB).
Glioma
DRUG: Hyperpolarized 13C-Pyruvate
Accuracy of metabolic MRI to diagnose Glioma, To study the accuracy of hyperpolarized metabolic MRI to diagnose Glioma Cancer. We will compare the prediction of cancer from the MRI scan compared to actual diagnosis of cancer by any subsequent workup or procedure the participant undergoes. Prediction of cancer from MRI scan will be performed by assigning a standardized score . Actual diagnosis of cancer will be based on tissue pathology., Within three years post treatment
Utility of metabolic MRI over standard MRI imaging in the diagnosis of Glioma cancer, To examine the added utility of metabolic MRI over standard MRI imaging. 3. We will quantify the number of participants in which the MRI provided extra information that otherwise was not available during the course of the patient's workup., Within three years post treatment
