Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive form of B-cell lymphoma, where the dual expression of Myc and BCL-2 genes in non-germinal center B-cell like (non-GCB) lymphomas is associated with a poor prognosis when treated with the standard R-CHOP regimen. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a key kinase in the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, is an important target for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas. Studies have shown that the first-generation BTK inhibitor Ibrutinib when combined with the R-CHOP regimen for previously untreated patients with dual-expressing, non-GCB lymphomas, can improve event-free survival rates. Orelabrutinib, as a new generation BTK inhibitor independently developed in China, possesses higher inhibitory activity against BTK kinase and can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, offering potential benefits for patients at high risk of central nervous system relapse. The novel anthracycline drug-Liposomal Doxorubicin, which has almost no cardiac toxicity, suggests that the combination of Orelabrutinib with the R-CDOP regimen could improve the adverse prognosis of DLBCL patients at high risk of central relapse. This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical study on the treatment of newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with high-risk CNS-IPI using Orelabrutinib in combination with R-CDOP regimen. All participants were treated with the Orelabrutinib combined with R-CDOP regimen. The treatment cycles were set every 21 days for a total of 6-8 cycles. During the study treatment period, researchers conducted a tumor assessment (with a 1-week time window allowed) after the screening period and once again after the 4th, 6th, or 8th cycle of treatment to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of the investigational drug. After all treatment cycles were completed, follow-up visits were conducted every 3 months until the end of the 3-year period. The median duration of follow-up was 24 months.
