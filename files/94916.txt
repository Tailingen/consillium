Study of IPH4102 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Cutaneous T-cell Lymphomas (CTCL)
The primary objective of this first in human study is to assess the safety and tolerability of increasing intravenous (IV) doses of single agent IPH4102 administered to patients with relapsed/refractory CTCL to characterize the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and identify a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).
