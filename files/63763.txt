Evaluation of a Point-of-care Testing Instrument for Fecal Immunochemical Test
Early detecting and removing of colorectal advanced adenomas can reduce incidence of colorectal cancer.Use of the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention is supported by previous studies.However existing instruments have low portability.The purpose of this study is to test the performance of a Point-of-care testing instrument for fecal Immunochemical test(FIT) .
Colorectal Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: The new instrument and colonoscopy with pathological examination
Diagnostic performance of advanced neoplasms, The study is committed to test the diagnostic efficacy of the new instrument to advanced neoplasms.We will measure the sensitivity and specificity of the instrument, 4 months
Diagnostic performance of Colorectal Cancer, The study is committed to test the diagnostic efficacy of the new instrument to colorectal cancer.We will measure the sensitivity and specificity of the instrument, 4 months
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide and has become a progressively important public health problem that inevitably leads to an increase in morbidity and medical costs. Therefore, many countries have a screening program in place to lower the incidence of CRC. Subjects with a positive fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have a much higher likelihood of advanced neoplasms than the general population.However existing instruments have low portability.The purpose of this study is to test the performance of a Point-of-care testing instrument for fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
