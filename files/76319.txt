Efficacy and Safety of Paclitaxel Polymeric Micelles for Injection in the Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer
This multicenter, randomized, open, parallel positive control study compares the clinical efficacy and safety of paclitaxel polymeric micelles for injection with TPC in HER2- MBC subjects who have failed ≥2 to≤4 previous chemotherapy regimens.

Treatment Protocol: Subjects are randomized into paclitaxel polymeric micelles for injection group and the Physician's Choice (TPC) group by the proportion of 1:1. Randomization is stratified according to three factors: number of lines of previous treatment for metastatic disease (2 or 3/4 lines), receptor status (triple-negative, non-triple-negative), and visceral metastasis (yes/no).

Progression-free survival (PFS) is the main efficacy indicator in this study. Treatment Group: Subjects are given paclitaxel polymeric micelles for injection, three weeks constitutes one cycle of treatment.

Control Group: Physician's Choice Group, subjects are given Eribulin Mesilate injection; or capecitabine tablets; or gemcitabine hydrochloride for injection; or vinorelbine tartrate injection; or paclitaxel (albumin-bound). Three or four weeks constitutes one cycle of treatment.

If subject does not develop disease progression after 6 cycles of dosing, the subject continues treatment until disease progression (RECIST 1.1) or develops an intolerable toxicity, initiation of a new anti-cancer drug, withdrawal from the study, death, or loss of follow-up.

Superiority design is used in this study, progression-free survival (PFS) is the main efficacy indicator. Assuming α = 0.0249(unilateral, adjusted test level), power=80%, the median PFS of the treatment group is 6.0 months, the median PFS of the control group is 3.7 months, the enrollment period is 12 months, and the study period is 24 months. Using PASS (version 11.0) for calculation, a total of 152 subjects (76 in each group) are required to meet the statistical significance between the treatment group and the control group. In consideration of case expulsion, enlarged by 10%, a total of 168 subjects (84 in each group) are required.
Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)
DRUG: Paclitaxel Polymeric Micelles for Injection|DRUG: Eribulin Mesilate injection|DRUG: Capecitabine Tablets|DRUG: Gemcitabine Hydrochloride for Injection|DRUG: Vinorelbine Tartrate Injection|DRUG: Paclitaxel (albumin-bound)
Progression-Free-Survival, PFS(Progression-Free-Survival) was the time from randomization until the date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, Randomization to measured PD or date of death from any cause（up to 24 months)
Objective response rate, Objective response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with complete or partial response as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), Baseline to measured PD（up to 24 months)|Overall survival, Overall survival was the time from randomization until the date of death from any cause. Participants who were alive at the end of the follow-up period (or lost to follow#up) were censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive., Randomization to date of death from any cause（up to 24 months)|Disease Control Rate, Proportion of subjects who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) (RECIST 1.1), Baseline to measured PD（up to 24 months)|Incidence of adverse events, Safety Endpoint, up to 24 months
