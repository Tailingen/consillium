Determine Tumor Response Using Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)- Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) Before and After Cetuximab in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
The purpose of this study is to collect data and evaluate how the tumor is broken down in response to standard of care cetuximab treatment by evaluating the FDG-PET/CT scans, toxicity, see how well the FDG-PET/CT scans predict response to treatment and survival.
Carcinoma, Squamous Cell
PROCEDURE: FDG-PET/CT|DRUG: Cetuximab
Metabolic Response of Target Lesions Assessed as the Change in Standardized Uptake Values (SUV) Max on FDG-PET/CT, FDG-PET/CT images were evaluated qualitatively as well as quantitatively by one of two experienced nuclear radiologists. For quantitative analysis, SUVmax within each of the metastatic tumor sites was determined within a volume of interest around the tumor using a Siemens eSoft workstation. Up to a maximum of three target lesions(\>= 1.5 cm on the baseline CT) were identified as target lesions on the baseline FDG-PET. When multiple lesions were present, those having the greatest FDG uptake on the baseline FDG-PET were selected as target lesions. Lesions containing areas of necrosis were avoided. Other metabolically active lesions and lesions that were \<1.5 cm on CT were considered non-target lesions. When more than one target lesion was identified, the average percentage change in SUVmax was used to determine metabolic response., Baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment|SUVmax at up to Three Target Tumor Sites as Assessed by FDG-PET/CT of Eligible Patients at Baseline and Then After Eight Weeks of Treatment With Cetuximab., Eight weeks of treatment is equal to one cycle of treatment.

Overall Tumor Metabolic Response to Eight Weeks of Scheduled Weekly Doses of Cetuximab as Assessed by FDG-PET/CT, Definitions of metabolic response by FDG-PET/CT included: complete metabolic response(CMR)-complete resolution of all metabolically active target and non-target lesions, and no new lesions; partial metabolic response(PMR)-20% or greater decrease in SUV of target lesions with or without decrease in number/size of non-target lesions, and no new lesions; progressive metabolic disease(PMD)-one or more new lesions, 20% or greater increase in SUV of target lesions and/or unequivocal increase in FDG activity of non-target lesions; and stable metabolic disease(SMD)-not qualifying as CMR, PMR, or PMD., After 8 weeks of treatment|Overall Anatomic Response to Eight Weeks of Scheduled Weekly Doses of Cetuximab as Assessed by CT Scan, Definitions of anatomic response by RECIST for CT scan included: complete response(CR)-disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; partial response(PR)-at least 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter, persistence of one or more non-target lesions, and no new lesions; stable disease (SD)-neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started, persistence of one or more non-target lesions, and no new lesions; progressive disease(PD)-at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions recorded since the treatment started, appearance of one or more new lesions/unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., After 8 weeks of treatment|Correlation of Overall Tumor Metabolic Response as Assessed by FDG-PET/CT With the Anatomic Tumor Response Rate by RECIST Criteria as Assessed by CT and Clinical Examination, A generalization of McNemar's test was used to test for concordance of response(partial, stable or progression) by CT and by FDG-PET/CT., After 8 weeks of treatment|Correlation of Overall Tumor Metabolic Response as Assessed by FDG-PET/CT With the Anatomic Tumor Response Rate by RECIST Criteria as Assessed by CT and Clinical Examination, Agreement in treatment decision using CT and FDG-PET/CT.

Primary Endpoint

To compare the SUV (standardized uptake value) at up to three target tumor sites as assessed by FDG-PET/CT of eligible patients at baseline and then after eight weeks of treatment with cetuximab.

Secondary Endpoints

* To determine the overall tumor metabolic response (complete metabolic response, partial metabolic response, stable metabolic disease or progressive metabolic disease \[CMR, PMR, SMD, or PMD\]) to eight weeks of scheduled weekly doses of cetuximab as assessed by FDG-PET/CT performed at baseline and then after therapy.
* To correlate the overall tumor metabolic response (CMR, PMR, SMD, or PMD) as assessed by FDG-PET/CT with the anatomic tumor response rate (complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease \[CR, PR, SD, or PD\]) by RECIST criteria as assessed by CT and clinical examination performed after eight weeks of scheduled weekly doses of cetuximab.
* To correlate the overall tumor metabolic response (CMR, PMR, SMD, or PMD) as assessed by FDG-PET/CT and to correlate the overall anatomic tumor response (CR, PR, SD, or PD) by RECIST criteria as assessed by CT and clinical examination obtained at baseline and after eight weeks of treatment with weekly scheduled doses of cetuximab to TTP (time to progression) and OS (overall survival) with cetuximab therapy.
* To determine the overall best anatomic tumor response rate (CR, PR, SD, or PD) to cetuximab given until disease progression as assessed by RECIST criteria using CT and clinical examination.
* To determine the overall disease control rate (CR, PR, and SD) by RECIST criteria as assessed by CT and clinical examination and to determine the TTP and the OS with cetuximab therapy.
