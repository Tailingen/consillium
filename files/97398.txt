A Study to Assess the Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Anti Tumor Activity of UCB6114 Administered Intravenously to Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of the study is to characterize the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of UCB6114 administered as monotherapy or in combination with selected standard of care (SOC) regimens.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: ginisortamab|DRUG: trifluridine/tipiracil|DRUG: mFOLFOX6
Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study medication, whether or not considered related to the study medication. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study medication. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as any AE with a start date on or after the first dose of UCB6114 up until the last dose of Ginisortamab (UCB6114) +30 days (i.e. up to 3.8 years)., From Baseline until the End of Study (up to 3.8 years)|Percentage of Participants Based on Severity of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events, AE is any untoward medical occurrence in patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with use of study medication, whether or not considered related to study medication. AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with use of study medication. TEAE: any AE with start date on or after first dose of UCB6114 up until last dose of Ginisortamab(UCB6114)+30 days. Event for which no Common Terminology Criteria for AE (CTCAE) severity grade was recorded by investigator but intensity was recorded instead was assigned as follows to CTCAE severity grade:Severe=Grade 3, Life Threatening (indicated on electronic case report form (eCRF) for event that is serious)=Grade 4, Death (indicated on the eCRF for event that is serious or has outcome of death)=Grade 5. As planned, data reported for National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE grade \>=3 TEAEs and related TEAEs., From Baseline until the End of Study (up to 3.8 years)|Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT defined as any AE at least related to study medication that occurs during Cycle 1 and met following criteria: Grade (Gr) 3 or 4 nonhematological toxicity according to NCI CTCAE (Version 5.0) except for alopecia, or nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that reverses to Gr ≤2 within 24 hours (hr) with appropriate medical therapy; Gr 3 or 4 biochemical abnormality that persists despite maximal supportive treatment or biochemical abnormalities that is symptomatic and nontransient; Any Gr ≥3 hematological toxicity of \>5 days duration or febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count \[ANC\]\<1000/cubic millimeter\[mm3\] with single temperature of \>38.3°C or sustained temperature ≥38°C for more than one hr), infection with Gr 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia with bleeding or requiring platelet transfusion, or Gr 4 thrombocytopenia; Prolonged Gr 2 diarrhea (\>7 days) despite adequate antidiarrheal medication, or multiple Grade 1or 2 toxicities(eg, Gr 1 or 2 diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and fatigue)., From Baseline throughout 28 days (Cycle 1)
Part A and A1: UCB6114 Serum Concentration by Scheduled Assessment and Cohort, Blood samples for ginisortamab serum concentration analysis were collected at different timepoints following the first dose of ginisortamab. The data is reported for Part A and A1. Pharmacokinetic Set (PKS). Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ)., Parts A: Cycle 1 (Day 1 end of infusion [EOI] and Day 15 Predose), Cycle 2 (Day 1 Predose and Day 15 Predose); Part A 1: Cycle 1 (Day 1 EOI and Day 15 Predose), Cycle 2 (Day 1 Predose)|Part B and C: UCB6114 Concentration by Scheduled Assessment and Dose Level, Blood samples for ginisortamab serum concentration analysis were collected at timepoints following (Cycle 1 Day 1) and the (Cycle 2 Day 1) administration of ginisortamab. Data is reported for Part B and Part C., Part B and C: Cycle 1 (Day 1 EOI and Day 15 Predose), Cycle 2 (Day 1 Predose and Day 15 Predose)
The purpose of the study is to characterize the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of UCB6114 administered as monotherapy or in combination with selected standard of care (SOC) regimens.
