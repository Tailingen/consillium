Single Port Endoscopic Breast Conserving Surgery
The center plans to carry out a prospective clinical study of single hole total endoscopic breast conserving surgery for early breast cancer compared with open breast conserving surgery, to provide high-level evidence-based medical evidence for the development of endoscopic breast conserving surgery for early breast cancer.
Breast Conserving Surgery|Endoscopic Surgery
PROCEDURE: endoscopic breast conserving surgery
Six months after operation SURVIVAL EFFECTS, To compare the overall survival (OS) within 6 months after single-port endoscopic breast-conserving surgery and open breast-conserving surgery., From enrollment to the end of 6 months after surgery
Intraoperative blood loss, To compare the total blood loss between single-port endoscopic breast-conserving surgery and open breast-conserving surgery., From the beginning to the end of the operation|Postoperative drainage volume in the first three days after breast conserving surgery, The total drainage volume in the first three days after breast conserving surgery was compared between single-port endoscopic breast conserving surgery and open breast conserving surgery., 3 days after surgery|Length of surgical incision, The total incision length was compared between single-port endoscopic breast-conserving surgery and open breast-conserving surgery., 1 week after surgery
Data show that breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer asthemost prevalent malignant tumor in the world, and traditional open surgery is highly invasive and has poor cosmetic results. This study investigates the results of endoscopic breast- conserving surgery(E-BCS) versus conventional breast-conserving surgery(C-BCS) in the treatment of patients with early-stage breast cancer and to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two surgical procedures, so as to provide the best evidence for the rational choice of the procedure by both doctors and patients.
