Chidamide in Combination With Vincristine Metronomic Chemotherapy for Advanced Triple-negative Breast Cancer
The mechanism of action of cidabenamide and the advantages of vincristine metronomic chemotherapy make it possible to combine the two drugs. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a prospective study to investigate the value of chidamide in combination with vincristine metronomic treatment for triple-negative breast cancer.

DRUG: Chidamide
Progression-free Survival, 1-year progression-free survival (PFS1). Evidence of local recurrence, distant metastasis, or death from any cause within 1 year counted as events in the time-to-event Kaplan-Meier analysis of progression-free survival. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, At 1 year
Number of Patients With Clinical Responses (Phase I), The number of patients with clinical responses (CR, VGPR, PR, or minimal response \[MR\]) will be summarized by stage., Up to 1 year|Overall Toxicity Rate, The overall toxicity rates (percentages) for grade 3 or higher adverse events considered at least possibly related to treatment are reported below by stage for Phase I patients., Up to 1 year
The mechanism of action of cidabenamide and the advantages of vincristine metronomic chemotherapy make it possible to combine the two drugs. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a prospective study to investigate the value of chidamide in combination with vincristine metronomic treatment for triple-negative breast cancer.The current study was designed to explore the efficacy of oral two-metronomic agents (chidamide in combination with vincristine) in advanced triple-negative patient in China.
