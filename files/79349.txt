Hepatic Arteriography in Liver Cancer Diagnosis and Staging Applications
Primary liver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumor and leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Basically therapeutic strategies were considered and given based on the staging of liver cancer. Thus, the confirmatory diagnosis of numbers and distribution of malignant lesions were extreme important. Enhanced CT or MRI is routinely imaging scans to detect and identify lesions. Unfortunately, some malignant lesions usually presented untypical imaging characteristics, especially among lesions no larger than 1 cm, which misleading to the exact staging of liver cancer and the optimal therapeutic strategies.

Basically most of blood supply for malignant liver tumors is from the hepatic artery. Based on this fact, hepatic arterial digital subtraction angiography could potentially elevate the accuracy and sensitivity of detection malignant lesions numbers and distribution.

In this study the investigators will compare the numbers and distribution of malignant lesions before and after hepatic arteriography, then to revise the staging of liver cancer and to provide better therapeutic strategies.
