Pancreas Volume and Diabetes Status Following Pancreatectomy
This study will enroll 100 patients scheduled to undergo a pancreatectomy.

The primary objective is to develop a scoring system using pancreatic volume measured by CT scan and intraoperative measurements of the pancreas parenchyma to predict the onset of diabetes mellitus after a pancreatectomy. The investigators will also monitor patients with pre-existing diabetes to see if their diabetes worsens or improves.
Pancreatic Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Pancreatectomy
Percent resected volume of pancreas and diabetes development, Postoperative up to one year
QLQ-C30 Quality of Life Health Questionnaire, Postoperative up to one year|Blood glucose control, Postoperative up to one year
The primary objective is to develop a scoring system using pancreatic volume measured by CT scan and intraoperative measurements of the pancreas parenchyma to predict the onset of diabetes mellitus after a pancreatectomy. The investigators will also monitor patients with pre-existing diabetes to see if their diabetes worsens or improves. Patients will be followed up to one year to track their diabetes status, postoperative outcomes and quality of life.
