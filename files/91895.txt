Impact of the Coordinated Intervention of the Healthcare Facilities Pharmacist and the Dispensary Pharmacist on the Care Pathway for Cancer Patients Treated With Oral Therapy
The rise of oral therapies in the management of cancers has considerably changed the patient care path. If the oral route is preferred by patients because it offers a better quality of life, it is not without impact for patients and the health professionals involved in their management in their care. Indeed, the use of the oral route shifts part of the responsibility for monitoring treatment towards the patient, thereby leading to compliance problems, drug interactions and the management of adverse effects.These risks can cause complications or compromise the effectiveness of treatment, and generate additional costs for the investigator's health system. The study proposes to involve Healthcare Facilities Pharmacist and the Dispensary Pharmacist with all other health professionals.First, the hospital pharmacist will operate before the initiation of an oral route to perform a clinical pharmaceutical analysis of drug prescriptions. Then after the primary prescription and finally during a follow-up consultation 3 months after the initiation of treatment. The hypothesis of the study is that the coordinated intervention of the hospital pharmacist and of the dispensary pharmacist would improve the tolerance of oral treatments by reducing the number of serious adverse effects found, as well as improve the, quality of life, patient and professional satisfaction
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumor|Relapsed Hematologic Malignancy
BEHAVIORAL: IPPACTTO
Impact of the coordinated pharmaceutical path on the tolerance of oral therapies against cancer., The impact on tolerance will be measured by the proportion of patients with at least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event occurring / confirmed, linked to oral therapy, and confirmed by the oncologist., 6 months from the treatment initiation
Impact of the coordinated pharmaceutical path on the number of grade 3 and 4 adverse events detected linked to oral therapy, The impact will be measured by the number of grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurring / confirmed, linked to oral therapy, and confirmed by the oncologist., 6 months from the treatment initiation|Impact of the coordinated pharmaceutical path on unplanned hospitalizations related to the oral therapy, Number of unplanned hospitalizations related to the oral therapy and confirmed by the oncologist., 6 months from the treatment initiation|Impact of the coordinated pharmaceutical path on the drug related problems., Number and nature of potential and confirmed drug related problemS detected by pharmacists, 6 months from the treatment initiation|Detection of concerted treatment modifications between oncologist and pharmacist related to oral therapy, Number of treatment modifications related to oral therapy, necessary before starting treatment and during oral therapy and confirmed by the oncologist during follow-up consultations, 6 months from the treatment initiation|Impact of the coordinated pharmaceutical path on quality of life: EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, Quality of life for patients will be evaluated by a questionnaire before and after starting oral therapy according to the The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Inclusion ; 1 month ; 3 months and 6 months from the treatment initiation|Impact of the coordinated pharmaceutical path on adherence to the oral therapy, Adherence to the oral therapy measured with the Girerd questionnaire wich is composed of 6 questions with an expected answer yes or no. A "yes" answer is worth 1, "No" answer is worth 0. The maximum score obtained is 6; the minimum score is 0. Final Score\> 2: low compliance ; Final score = 1 or 2: average compliance ; Final score = 0: good compliance., 1 month ; 3 months and 6 months from the treatment initiation|Satisfaction of patients related to the coordinated pharmaceutical path: questionnaire, Satisfaction of patients will be evaluated by a series of questions related to oral therapy. The patient responds if he strongly disagrees; rather disagree; somewhat agree ; Totally agree. An overall score is also required between 1 and 10; 1 is very bad; 10 is perfect, 6 months from the treatment initiation|Assessment of the link between hospital and city, Evaluation of the link will be performed by a questionnaire to be completed by the oncologist and pharmacists. Each responds if he strongly disagrees; rather disagree; somewhat agree ; Totally agree, Through study completion, an average of 42 months
