Phase II Clinical Study of Befotertinib in EGFR Non-classical Mutant NSCLC
This is a prospective, multi-cohort, single-arm Phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of befotertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR non-classical mutations.

The study comprises two independent cohorts:

Cohort 1: Patients with EGFR uncommon mutations (G719X, L861Q, or S768I). Cohort 2: Patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation

Primary endpoint: Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints: Disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profile (CTCAE v4.03).

progression-free survival (PFS), From first dose to disease progression or death (assessed up to 36 months)|Disease control rate (DCR), From enrollment until treatment discontinuation (up to 24 months)|duration of response (DoR), From the first documented response to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 36 months.|overall survival（OS）, From enrollment until death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months. Survivors will be censored at the last follow-up
