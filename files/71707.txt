Digital Outreach Intervention for Lung Cancer Screening
mPATH-Lung (mobile Patient Technology for Health - Lung) is an innovative digital outreach program that identifies patients who qualify for lung cancer screening and helps them get screened. The study will: 1) Determine the effect of mPATH-Lung on receipt of lung cancer screening in a pragmatic randomized-controlled trial conducted with primary care patients in two large health networks, 2) Elucidate the drivers of patients' screening decisions and screening behavior; and 3) Explore implementation outcomes that will impact the sustainability and dissemination of mPATH-Lung using program data, surveys, and interviews.

This project will determine how mPATH-Lung affects patients' screening decisions and their completion of screening.

Primary Objective: Determine the effectiveness of mPATH-Lung on receipt of LCS in a randomized pragmatic clinical trial of 1318 patients recruited from two large health networks, Wake Forest Baptist Health and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Secondary Objectives:

* Elucidate the drivers of patients' decisions to receive or forgo LCS through a values clarification exercise embedded within mPATH-Lung and supplemental semi-structured interviews of at least 50 patients.
* Assess several critical implementation outcomes (reach, acceptability, and appropriateness) to inform the sustainability and scalability of mPATH-Lung across diverse primary care settings
