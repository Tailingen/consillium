Celecoxib in Preventing Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Tobacco Smokers
RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the development of cancer. Celecoxib may be effective in preventing lung cancer in tobacco smokers.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing non-small cell lung cancer in tobacco smokers.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: celecoxib
Evaluate the expression of Cox-2 and PGE2 in the lungs of tobacco smokers., 1 year|Evaluate the capacity for an oral Cox-2 inhibitor (Celecoxib) to suppress the intrapulmonary formation of PGE2, 1 year
Determine the effects of Cox-2 inhibition on biomarkers of field cancerization on histopathologic abnormalities in patients at risk for primary NSCLC, 2 years|Study the potential role of PGE2 and its regulation by Cox-2 specific inhibitors on antitumor immunity within the lung microenvironment, 2 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy and feasibility of celecoxib for chemoprevention of primary non-small cell lung cancer in high-risk tobacco smokers.
* Determine the safety and long-term side effects of this drug in this population.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 6 months.

Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then at 6 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
