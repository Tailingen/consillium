The therapeutic results (response and survival) of young adult and adolescent patients with hematological malignancies are generally lower than those usually observed in adults over the age of 30, with equivalent treatment, particularly in lymphomatous pathology.The overall analysis of this large cohort of patients in its entirety, then by age groups (15-17 years, 18-25 years, 26-30 years) and pathology aims to describe the future of patients and patients. compare them to the results of the literature observed in this age group, and according to the therapeutic regimens administered (pediatric regimen or adult regimen).
