RAD001 Plus Bevacizumab in Metastatic Melanoma
This is a non-randomized, open label Phase II study comparing bevacizumab and everolimus in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
Metastatic Melanoma
DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Everolimus
Progression-free Survival, Length of time, in months, that patients were alive from their first date of protocol treatment until worsening of their disease, 13 months
Overall Survival Rate, Overall Survival is defined as the length of time, in months, that patients were alive from their first date of protocol treatment until death. For patients who were alive at the time of calculation, follow-up time was censored at date of last contact. The percentage of patients who were alive at 1 year is reported here. This was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method., 1 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of patients who experience an objective benefit from treatment (CR+PR). The response categories were assigned using RECIST criteria. Complete Response (CR) = Disappearance of all target lesions ; Partial Response (PR) = \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., 13 months
All patients will begin treatment with the same doses of RAD001 and bevacizumab. Patients will receive 6 weeks of treatment, followed by re evaluation. Patients with objective response or stable disease will continue treatment until disease progression.

During the study, all patients will receive 10 mg of RAD001 orally daily and 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab intravenously (IV) once every 3 weeks.

Fifty-five patients will be enrolled in this multi-centered study
