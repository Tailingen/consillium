The first Cohort (Cohort 1) utilizes a treatment interval of at least 14 days between treatments with longer treatment intervals being allowed depending on a specific patient's clinical response.Twenty Subjects (2 years and older) are targeted completing End of Study (EOS) visit in Cohort 1.

The second Cohort (Cohort 2) utilizes a treatment interval of 21 days between treatments. Paring of lesions is allowed. Approximately 35 subjects (12 years and older) will be enrolled in Cohort 2. Up to 4 sites will participate in the study.
