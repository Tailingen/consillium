Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields (PEMFs) - A Highly Selective Breast CAncer Treatment pLatform (PASCAL)
To assess the safety and tolerability of combined PEMFs and anthracycline-based chemotherapy in subjects who are undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs)|DRUG: Anthracycline-based chemotherapy
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events as assessed by CTCAE 5.0, Toxicity to treatment as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0. Grade 1-5 refer to the severity of the adverse event with higher grade indicating greater severity. Grade 3 and above will be considered severe.

A dose limiting toxicity will be defined as Grade 3 or above toxicity of the following:

a) pain in breast where PEMF was applied

* Increased intra-operatively bleeding whereby surgical bed require a longer period of hemostases
* Post-surgical complications including delay wound healing (open wound of more than 5 days post-surgery), wound infection and wound dehiscence, hematoma formation, up to 6 months
Treatment response as assessed by clinical measurement of tumor size using calipers, Subjects should have documented the size of the tumor through clinical measurement using calipers at each assessment visit. Wherever possible, documentation of radiological size based on mammogram, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging should also be recorded., up to 6 months
This is a single-center phase Ib study to investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination of PEMF with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Subjects will be enrolled on a 3+3 dose escalation design from dose level 1 with a target to reach dose level 4, where PEMF can be administered prior to each cycle of anthracycline-based chemotherapy. In the first 2 dose levels, PEMFs will first be administered to subjects who are planned for upfront surgical resection to ensure that PEMFs is safe and tolerable for up to 0.5-hour. Once the duration of each PEMF treatment is established, PEMFs will then be added to anthracycline-based chemotherapy to investigate the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment.
