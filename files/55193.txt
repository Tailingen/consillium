A Study of BBI608 in Combination With Sorafenib, or BBI503 in Combination With Sorafenib in Adult Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is an open label, three-arm, phase 1 dose escalation study and phase 2 study of BBI608 in combination with sorafenib, or BBI503 in combination with sorafenib. The study population is adult patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who have not received systemic chemotherapy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: BBI608|DRUG: BBI503|DRUG: Sorafenib
Assessment of the Dose Limiting Toxicities for the Napabucasin and Amcasertib Arm in Combination With Sorafenib for Phase IB, To assess the dose limiting toxicities for phase IB, 16 weeks including 2-week Sorafenib run-in period prior to initiation of combination therapy|To Assess the Number of Patients Who Experienced Adverse Events for Phase IB., Assessment of safety of either BBI608 or BBI503 given in combination with sorafenib to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma by reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events, Adverse events will be assessed at baseline, while the participant is taking drugs, and for 30 days after stopping therapy. It was expected that patients would receive between 4-24 weeks treatment.|Determination of the Recommended Phase II Dose for Napabucasin and Amcasertib Arm in Combination With Sorafenib, To determine the recommended phase II dose for Napabucasin and Amcasertib arm in combination with sorafenib, 16 weeks including 2-week Sorafenib run-in period prior to initiation of combination therapy|Assessment of Objective Response Rate in the Intent to Treat Population - Phase II, To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma randomized to receive treatment with sorafenib in combination with Napabucasin or sorafenib in combination with Amcasertib, or sorafenib alone; Napabucasin and Amcasertib will be administered at their respective RP2D dose levels for combination administration with sorafenib, which were determined during the phase Ib portion of the study.

The radiologic assessments will be evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and modified RECIST for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

ORR was defined as the percentage of patients with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), using both RECIST and mRECIST assessment data., Assessment of the preliminary anti-tumor activity by performing tumor assessments at baseline and every 8 weeks after the date of the first dose of protocol therapy|Assessment of Disease Control Rate in the Intent to Treat Population- Phase II, To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma randomized to receive treatment with sorafenib in combination with Napabucasin, sorafenib in combination with Amcasertib\*, or sorafenib alone; Napabucasin and Amcasertib will be administered at their respective RP2D dose levels for combination administration with sorafenib, which were determined during the phase Ib portion of the study.

The radiologic assessments will be evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and modified RECIST for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients with best response of complete response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or stable disease (SD), Assessment of the preliminary anti-tumor activity by performing tumor assessments at baseline and every 8 weeks after the date of the first dose of protocol therapy
Assessment of the Pharmacokinetic Profile (Maximum Plasma Concentration and Area Under the Curve) of Either Napabucasin or Amcasertib., To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of napabucasin administered in combination with sorafenib and of amcasertib administered in combination with sorafenib., On Day 15 of the first cycle and Day 15 of the second cycle, prior to dosing and every one hours to 11 hours and 24 hours after first dose|Assessment of the Pharmacodynamic Studies as Well as the Concentration of Study Drug (Either Napabucasin or Amcasertib) in Tumors, To perform biomarker studies for napabucasin administered in combination with sorafenib and for amcasertib administered in combination with sorafenib., On day 15 of the second cycle
This is an open label, three-arm, phase 1 dose escalation study and phase 2 study of BBI608 in combination with sorafenib, or BBI503 in combination with sorafenib. The study population is adult patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have not received systemic chemotherapy.

The phase 1 portion will involve dose-escalation of BBI608 administered in combination with a fixed starting dose of sorafenib (Arm 1), and dose escalation of BBI503 administered in combination with a fixed starting dose of sorafenib (Arm 2). The fixed starting dose-level of sorafenib for both arms will be 400 mg twice daily (800 mg total daily dose). Eligible patients will be randomized to either Arm 1 or Arm 2.

The phase 2 portion will be an open-label, 3-arm, randomized trial of patients with advanced HCC who have not received prior systemic treatment. Patients will be randomized to receive either, Arm 1: sorafenib administered in combination with BBI608 (at the RP2D determined for BBI608 plus sorafenib during the phase 1 portion); Arm 2: sorafenib in combination with BBI503 (at the RP2D determined for BBI503 plus sorafenib during the phase 1 portion), or Arm 3: sorafenib alone at a starting dose of 400 mg twice daily. The starting dose for sorafenib is the same for all study arms.
