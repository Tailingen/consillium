A Trial of Everolimis in Patients With Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma.
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for more than 200,000 new cases of cancer and over 100,000 cancer deaths annually in the World (Ferlay, et al., 2004). It is estimated that there were about 15,000 new cases of RCC in the region that excludes the Americas, European Union and Japan. Renal cell carcinomas arise from the proximal tubal epithelium are more common in males than in females with an overall lifetime risk of 1 in 75 and a median age of diagnosis of 65 years.

Everolimus (Certican速) has been approved since 2003 in more than 60 countries for the prevention of organ rejection in patients with renal and cardiac transplantation. Everolimus (RAD001) is a derivative of rapamycin, which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. It targets mTOR, a key protein kinase regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The mTOR pathway activity is modulated by the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B AKT (AKT) pathway, a pathway known to be deregulated in numerous human cancers. RAD001 (Afinitor速) has been investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act:

* directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation;
* indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via potent inhibition of tumor cell hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity, VEGF production, and VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells).

Primary: To evaluate the PFS rate over time.

Secondary:

* To evaluate the disease control rate (stable disease \[SD\] + partial response \[PR\] + complete response \[CR\]);
* To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR; where ORR = CR + PR) and duration;
* To describe the safety profile of RAD001.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: RAD001
PFS (Progression-Free Survival), the time from the date of the start of RAD001 treatment to the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, Approximately 4 years
Disease Control Rate (Stable Disease [SD] + Partial Response [PR] + Complete Response [CR]);, The disease control rate was based on the data as per local radiological review following the RECIST criteria. The disease control rate is defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR, or SD and was summarized in terms of percentage with 95% exact Clopper-Pearson CIs, Approximately 4 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR; Where ORR = CR + PR), The overall tumor response was based on the data as per local radiological review, following RECIST criteria. The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR and was summarized in terms of percentage with 95% exact Clopper-Pearson CIs, Approximately 4 years|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR analysis applied only to patients whose overall response was CR or PR and was defined as the time from onset of response (CR/PR) to progression or death from any cause, Approximately 4 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of start of treatment to date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, survival will be censored at the date of last contact., Approximately 4 years
