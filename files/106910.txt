Phase II Study of Radiotherapy Followed by Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and Ceralasertib (AZD6738) in Stage III NSCLC Patients With Thoracic Relapses +/- Oligometastases After PACIFIC Regimen (AUSTRAL)
Aim of this phase 2 study is to explore the safety and efficacy of thoracic re-irradiation +/- SBRT to oligometastases (\<3) followed after an interval of 2 weeks by durvalumab and ceralasertib for patients with thoracic relapses +/- oligometastases after PACIFIC or PACIFIC-like (concurrent or sequential chemo-radiotherapy followed by maintenance durvalumab) regimens.
