Phase II Trial of Vemurafenib and Sorafenib in Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this research is to determine the benefit of two oral chemotherapy drugs, Vemurafenib and Sorafenib, in individuals with KRAS mutated pancreatic cancer who have progressed on standard chemotherapy.
Pancreas Cancer
DRUG: Vemurafenib|DRUG: Sorafenib
Disease Control Rate of Vemurafenib in Combination with Sorafenib, To determine the efficacy by the disease control rate (Complete response plus Partial Response plus Stable Disease at 16 weeks) of Vemurafenib in Combination with Sorafenib in patients with KRAS mutated pancreatic cancer., initiation of study treatment until 16 weeks
Confirm the Incidences of Adverse Events of Vemurafenib in Combination with Sorafenib, To confirm the incidence of adverse events of Vemurafenib in Combination with Sorafenib in patients with KRAS mutated pancreatic cancer, initiation of study treatment up to 30 days post treatment|Clinical Activity of Vemurafenib in Combination with Sorafenib, To determine the progression free survival of Vemurafenib + Sorafenib in patients with KRAS mutated pancreatic cancer. Progression free survival is defined as first dose treated until the date of progression, initiation of study treatment up to study completion, up to 2 years|Measure circulating ctDNA, To utilize circulating tumor DNA (ct DNA) in plasma to give qualitative (mutations) and to some extent quantitative (amount of ct DNA) information regarding BRAF and KRAS, initiation of study treatment up to study completion, up to 2 years|Measure phospho ERK and phospho AKT in plasma, To measure the changes in plasma free DNA in regards to mutated KRAS, phospho ERK and phospho AKT, initiation of study treatment up to study completion, up to 2 years
Clinical Activity of Vemurafenib in Combination with Sorafenib, To determine the overall survival of Vemurafenib + Sorafenib in patients with KRAS mutated pancreatic cancer. Overall survival is defined as first dose treated until the date of death., initiation of study treatment up to study completion, up to 2 years
