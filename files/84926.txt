Evaluation of Effect of CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System on Human Esophageal Barrett's Epithelium
This is a feasibility study without a primary study hypothesis or statistical comparison.
Barrett's Esophagus
DEVICE: Focal Cryoballoon Ablation System - 6 seconds|DEVICE: Focal Cryoballoon Ablation System - 8 seconds|DEVICE: CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System - 10 seconds
Esophageal Stricture, Stricture formation is defined as none, mild (non-circumferential stenosis allowing easy passage of diagnostic endoscope), moderate (circular stenosis allowing passage of diagnostic endoscope), and severe (any stenosis preventing the passage of a diagnostic scope)., 6 to 8 Weeks
Post-procedure pain relative, A secondary objective of the study is to determine patient comfort post-procedure. Pain scores are measured on a numerical pain intensity scale (0 to 10). Patients is asked to score pain level in the treatment area and swallowing., Pre-ablation,12 hrs post ablation, 2 days (+ or - 1 day)|Presence of Residual Barrett's Esophagus, Esophageal tissue subjected to ablation via the CryoBalloon Focal Ablation System will be submitted for histological evaluation. The evaluation will include:

1. detailed description of the presence of Barrett's Esophagus and/or squamous mucosa.
2. estimate of percentage of residual Barrett's in each sample
3. the detailed description of any residual injury at all levels within the sample., 6 to 8 weeks
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, feasibility, and performance of the C2 Focal Cryoablation Device in patients with Barrett's Esophagus (BE). At 6 to 8 weeks, the patient will receive a follow-endoscopy to assess stricture formation along with biopsy samples taken.

Post-operative pain will be noted. Additionally, biopsy samples will be evaluated for the presence of residual Barrett's Esophagus. Through evaluation of the histological results, treatment parameters for the ablation of human esophageal epithelium will be better understood.

Evaluations include, but are not limited to the following:

* Deployment ease/scope compatibility.
* Device malfunctions.
* Time of catheter deployment.
* Adverse events.
* Stricture formation at 6 to 8 weeks.
* Patient Pain.
* Histological evaluation of treatment zone at 6 to 8 weeks for presence of residual Barrett's Esophagus.
