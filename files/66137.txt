The IDEA Study (Individualized Decisions for Endocrine Therapy Alone)
This study will collect rates of local/regional recurrence in select patients who do not receive radiation treatment after lumpectomy surgery. These women must be postmenopausal; have hormone receptor-positive, Her2-negative tumors; have Oncotype-DX RS less than or equal to 18; and plan to receive endocrine therapy. In this way, this study seeks to collect prospective data supporting the idea that this is a population at sufficiently low risk of local/regional recurrence that omission of adjuvant radiation might be a reasonable option.
Breast Neoplasms
OTHER: endocrine therapy alone without radiotherapy
Loco-regional Recurrence, All patients will be followed for their clinical outcome for at least 10 years, specifically: for development of recurrence (and site), the salvage therapy type if local disease recurs, for development of distant metastasis, and survival - both overall and breast-cancer specific., 5 years of follow up
This study's primary aim is to determine rates of recurrence with the innovative approach of considering tumor biology to select patients who may avoid radiation, with restriction of eligibility to women aged 50-69 with hormone-sensitive, Her2-negative tumors with Oncotype-DX RS â‰¤ 18 who plan to receive endocrine therapy. In this way, this study seeks to collect prospective data supporting the idea that this is a population at low risk of LRR in whom omission of adjuvant radiation is reasonable.
