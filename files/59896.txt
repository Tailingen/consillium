Usability and Utility of Mindfulness-based Life Management Social Robots for Children and Adolescents in the Long-term Treatment
The purpose of this study is to apply social robot-based mindfulness-based life management content to pediatric and adolescent patients in the long-term disease treatment process and to assess usability and effectiveness of the social robot-based mindfulness-based life management content.

\[Question 1\] Effectiveness: Was the content on social robots effective in psychological adaptation of pediatric and adolescent patients?

\[Question 2\] Usability: Is there any difficulty in interacting through social robots applied in the hospital environment?

The participants conduct a preliminary survey and use robot content at least 10 times for the two weeks. Afterwards, follow-up surveys and in-depth interviews will be conducted.
