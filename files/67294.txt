Endoscopic Mucosal Resection and Cellular Matrix
This study is being done to test the usefulness of extracellular matrix (ECM) a thin sheet placed over the site after endoscopic mucosal resection to promote healing of the esophagus.
Barretts Esophagus With High Grade Dysplasia|Barrett Adenocarcinoma
DEVICE: Acell MatriStemÂ® Surgical Matrix
Completeness of EMR Site Healing at Follow up Endoscopy, Number of subjects to have complete endoscopic submucosal resection (EMR) site healing determined by the ability of the resection site to lift with saline injection during follow-up endoscopy., approximately 3-4 months post EMR
Presence of Stricture Formation at Follow up Endoscopy, Number of subjects to have symptomatic esophageal stricture formation requiring dilation, preventing dysphagia as determined by questionnaires, and mitigating formation of post-resection scarring as determined by blinded comparison of pre- and post-resection images (taken using white-light endoscopy and electron chromoendoscopy)., approximately 3-4 months post EMR
