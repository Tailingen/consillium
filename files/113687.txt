Dopamine D2 Receptors(D2R) Imaging in Prolactinomas
To study the in vivo expression of dopamine D2 receptors in prolactinoma and the predictive role of dopamine D2 receptors PET-MR imaging in the therapeutic effect of dopamine agonists.
Prolactinoma
OTHER: Surgery|DRUG: Drug treatment
Change from baseline on PRL level, Record the result of PRL on every 3 month follow-up visit, Up to 6 months
Change from baseline on tumor volume measured by enhanced pituitary Magnetic Resonance Imaging（MRI）, Record the tumor volume from enhanced pituitary MRI on every 3 month follow-up visits, Up to 6 months|Change from baseline of visual field scale, Record the Visual field scale on every 3 month follow-up visit, 0 = normal, no vision loss; 1 = one quadrant vision loss; 2 = two quadrants of vision loss; 3 = three quadrants of vision loss; 4 = four quadrants of vision loss but retain a central tubular vision; 5 = blind, Up to 6 months|Change from baseline of visual acuity, Record the Visual acuity on every 3 month follow-up visit., Up to 6 months
The dopamine agonist(DA),such as cabergoline(CAB) and bromocriptine(BC), has been used widely in the treatment of prolactinomas, but its clinical use is hampered by intolerance and/or resistant in some patients. It had been showed that DA inhibit prolactin secretion by binding to and activating dopamine D2 receptors.PET-MR combined MR images with PET function images is substantial to evaluate the expression of dopamine D2 receptors.The aim is to study the in vivo expression of dopamine D2 receptors in prolactinoma and the predictive role of dopamine D2 receptors PET-MR imaging in the therapeutic effect of DA.
