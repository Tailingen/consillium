A phase I/II study of the efficacy of CPX-351 treatment in patients with higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes : as first line treatment or after hypomethylating agents failure.

CPX-351 is an advanced liposomal formulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine encapsulated at a 1:5 ratio.

Patients will receive induction treatment with CPX-351. Patients in response (complete response (CR), complete response with incomplete hematologic improvement (CRi), partial response (PR)) after induction will receive monthly courses of consolidation therapy with CPX-351.
