Efficacy and Safety of LEO 43204 in Field Treatment of Actinic Keratosis on Face or Chest Including 12-month Follow-up
The objective of the trial is to compare the short term efficacy of LEO 43204 gel with vehicle gel in AK on face or chest when applied topically once daily for 3 consecutive days as field treatment.
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: LEO 43204 gel|DRUG: Vehicle gel
Percentage of Participants With Complete Clearance of Actinic Keratosis (AK), Complete clearance was defined as an AK count of zero, i.e. no clinically visible AKs (actinic keratosis lesions) in the treatment area.

The table shows the percentage of mean number of subjects across imputations with complete clearance., At Week 8
Percentage of Participants With Partial Clearance (Multiple Imputation), Partial clearance was defined as at least 75% reduction from baseline in the number of clinically visible AKs in the treatment area.

The table shows the percentage of mean number of participants across imputations with partial clearance., At Week 8|Percentage of Participants With Partial Clearance (Multiple Imputation), Partial clearance was defined as at least 75% reduction from baseline in the number of clinically visible AKs in the treatment area.

The table shows the percentage of mean number of participants across imputations with partial clearance., At Week 4|Percent Reduction in AK Count in the Treatment Area Compared to Baseline, The percent reduction at Week 8 from baseline was analysed using a negative binomial regression for the AK count at Week 8 with treatment group and pooled sites as factors and baseline count as offset variable (using multiple imputations to account for missing values). The table presents adjusted mean percent reduction at Week 8 from baseline., At Week 8
