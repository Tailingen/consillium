Effect of Refnot on Immunity in Cancer Patients
The study was planned to include disseminated patients with various solid tumors (melanoma, soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, etc.). The study drug was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 400,000 IU once a day, 3 times a week (every other day), for 4 weeks. In the absence of disease progression - an additional 4 weeks.

The study was planned to include 50 disseminated patients with various solid tumors. The patients were divided into 2 groups: 1 - Refnot, monotherapy, 2 - Refnot together with chemotherapy.

Refnot is administered at a dose of 400,000 IU subcutaneously 3 times a week for 4 weeks. 4 weeks constitute 1 course of treatment with Refnot. Immediately before use, 1 ml of water for injection is added to 4 vials (100,000 IU each) or to a vial containing 400,000 IU. After dilution, the drug is injected subcutaneously into the outer surface of the shoulder or thigh. Injection sites should alternate. In the absence of progression of the disease - an additional 4 weeks. Chemotherapy may be used after 4-8 weeks of Refnot use.
