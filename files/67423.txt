ASCT Versus Chemotherapy as First-Line Consolidation Therapy inT-Cell Lymphoma
To compare the effectiveness of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and chemotherapy as first-line consolidation therapy after obtaining a complete therapeutic response in T-cell lymphoma through a multicenter retrospective real-world study in China.

T-cell lymphoma is characterized by high molecular heterogeneity, high disease aggressiveness, and high chemotherapy resistance rate, and the prognosis is extremely poor. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is an important consolidation therapy for patients with T-cell lymphoma who have achieved therapeutic response to chemotherapy, but it is still controversial whether the efficacy of ASCT is significantly better than that of chemotherapy consolidation in patients who have achieved a complete therapeutic response. In this study, the investigators compared the efficacy of ASCT with that of chemotherapy as a first-line consolidation therapy for T-cell lymphoma patients who had achieved a complete therapeutic response in a multicenter real-world study in China. This study included patients with primary T-cell lymphoma diagnosed during 2015-2021 at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital, Peking University People's Hospital, and Wuhan Tongji Hospital, and based on electronic case information, the investigators retrieved the diagnosis, staging, extranodal and bone marrow involvement, and induced and consolidated the efficacy of chemotherapy. The participants were divided into ASCT group and consolidation chemotherapy group according to the consolidation therapy adopted after obtaining complete therapeutic response, and the primary endpoint was adopted as progression-free survival, and the secondary endpoints included overall survival, non-recurrent death, and disease progression/recurrence, so as to explore the efficacy of ASCT and chemotherapy as a first-line consolidation therapy after obtaining a complete therapeutic response in T-cell lymphoma.
