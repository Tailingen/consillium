Neoadjuvant Doxorubicin/Cyclophosphamide Followed by Docetaxel (AC-Doc) Versus Dose-Dense Doxorubicin and Docetaxel (ADoc) in Breast Cancer
The primary objective of this trial is to compare the rate of pathologically complete remissions achieved using a preoperative dose-intensified 8 week therapy consisting of adriamycin and docetaxel with a preoperative sequential 24 week regimen consisting of adriamycin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, in patients with operable carcinoma of the breast. Secondary aims are to assess disease-free and overall survival, the rate of complete and partial responses by palpation and imaging methods, the rate of breast-conserving operations, and the toxicity of the two chemotherapy regimens.

Women meeting the following criteria will be eligible for the study: those with operable breast cancer (T2-3 N0-2 M0), with the diagnosis histologically confirmed by biopsy, and measurable disease on mammography or sonography or breast MRI (the most appropriate method should be chosen by the investigator). After the patients have given written informed consent, they will be randomly assigned to the study treatments. Patients in group I will receive four cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin 50 mg/m2 (15 min i.v. infusion) and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (1 h i.v. infusion) repeated every 14 days, followed by surgery 9-10 weeks after the start of therapy. Patients in group II will receive four cycles of adriamycin 60 mg/m2 (15 min i.v.) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 (1 h i.v.) every three weeks, followed by four cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m2 (1 h i.v.) every three weeks. Surgery will be performed during week 25 or 26. Patients in both groups will additionally receive oral doses of tamoxifen 20 mg once daily for 5 years, starting on the first day of chemotherapy. Surgery will consist of removal of the remaining tumor (breast-conserving resection or mastectomy) and axillary dissection (Sentinel node biopsy is allowed if the patient is involved in a randomized trial. Radiotherapy is applicated according to standard proceedings of participating center. A second randomization for additional versus no additional postoperative chemotherapy is recommended in ypN+ disease. Patients with disease progression during preoperative therapy, chemotherapy can be stopped and surgery can be performed immediately.
