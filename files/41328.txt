ThuLEP vs. HoLEP vs. Monopolar Enucleation in Management of BPH
Today, endoscopic enucleation of the prostate (EEP) has been recognized a method of choice for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) of any size, including large-sized glands (\>80 cc). The goal of our study was to compare perioperative efficacy, functional outcomes and safety of different techniques of endoscopic enucleation of the prostate (monopolar enucleation, holmium laser enucleation, thulium laser enucleation) in a single center.

HoLEP and ThuLEP or EEP have been approved by the current guidelines of the European Association of Urology for use in men with substantially enlarged prostates (\>80 ml) as first-line therapy \[1\]. This type of operation can be performed by means of several sources of energy.

To our knowledge, there were no studies comparing efficacy and complications of these three treatment modalities.

In this study the investigators have evaluated efficacy of Thulium-fiber laser enucleation (120 W thulium fiber laser Urolase, IPG IRE-POLUS, Russia with wavelength of 1940 nm) and monopolar enuclation in comparision with HoLEP (VersaPulse Powersuite 100, Lumenis, USA/Israel) in reduction of LUTS secondary to BPH in a prospective randomized trial.

All peri-operative parameters, urinary flow parameters, prostate size changes, erectile function and complications associated with the procedures were compared.
