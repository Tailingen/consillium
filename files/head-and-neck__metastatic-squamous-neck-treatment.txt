Diagnosis
The diagnosis of an occult primary tumor is made only when no primary tumor is
detected after careful search and when a primary tumor is not revealed during therapy.  Patients
with cervical lymph node metastases histologically related to a previously
treated primary tumor and patients with lymphomas and adenocarcinoma are
excluded from this diagnosis.  If the biopsy is an undifferentiated carcinoma (in particular, a
lymphoepithelioma), the most probable primary site is in the Waldeyer ring; for
example, the nasopharynx, base of tongue, or tonsil.  Most epidermoid
carcinomas that are metastatic to lymph nodes of the upper half of the neck will
originate from a head and neck primary site.  Squamous carcinomas that are metastatic to
the lower neck may represent a primary site in the head and neck, esophagus,
lung, or genitourinary tract.  A search for primary tumors in these areas must be
undertaken before assuming that the primary is occult.  Primary tumors
arising in the nasopharynx may be secondary to Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) infection, and EBV genomic material may be detectable in cervical nodal
tissue after DNA amplification using the polymerase chain reaction.  Such a
finding should lead to an in-depth search for a primary in the nasopharynx.[
1
]
The extent of investigation and type of treatment must be individualized
depending on the patient's age and wishes, and on the site, histology, and extent of metastatic lymph
node involvement of the tumor.  A patient with a squamous carcinoma of the neck with occult primary should be checked for other
obvious metastatic disease—for example, involving the lung, liver, or bone—because this would
affect the locoregional approach to therapy.[
2
]
Survival
Three-year disease-free survival rates following surgery and/or radiation
therapy for unknown squamous primary tumors range from 40% to 50% in patients with N1 disease to 38%
and 26% for patients with N2 and N3 disease, respectively.  Patients who later develop
primary lesions have poor survival rates compared with patients whose
primaries remain occult (30% vs. 60%).
Follow-Up
Patients with neck metastases from an undetectable primary should be given the benefit of definitive treatment.  Despite the ominous
situation of an undiscovered primary malignancy, a significant number of patients do
achieve cure by both surgical and radiotherapeutic approaches.  In some
patients, long-term repeat examinations will eventually disclose the primary
tumor, and at a treatable stage.

Cellular Classification of Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer With Occult Primary
This section helps lead the clinician and pathologist through a differential
diagnosis for an unknown primary presenting with cervical node metastases.  The
therapeutic section, however, relates only to squamous carcinoma and assumes
that the primary physician has worked with the pathologist to eliminate other possibilities that would require alternative therapies.
The pathologist plays a central role in evaluating an occult primary tumor.  A
thorough evaluation of an adequate specimen through histological or
immunohistochemical techniques, and, when appropriate, electron microscopy
provides guidance for the clinical evaluation that ensues.  The pathologist, oncologist, and primary
physician should interact closely in conducting this evaluation.
The complexity of the pathological evaluation tends to be inversely related to
the degree of differentiation of the tumor.  For instance, for tumors that are well or
moderately differentiated, the pathological diagnosis of an epithelial
cancer is often readily apparent. In contrast, lymphoma, sarcoma, melanoma,
or a germ cell tumor are often poorly differentiated and harder to diagnose.  Commonly used stains such as mucicarmine or
diastase-sensitive Periodic Acid Schiff can be important in confirming
the diagnosis of certain tumors of gastrointestinal or renal origin.
For a male patient younger than 50 years with a
poorly differentiated tumor, serum levels of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) should be obtained
and specimens should be evaluated with immunohistochemical stains for beta-hCG and
AFP.  Some of these tumors respond to platinum-based combination
chemotherapy in a manner similar to extragonadal germ cell malignancies, and
this group of patients should consider this treatment unless alternative diagnoses
are made.[
1
]
Special studies can differentiate more poorly differentiated tumors. 
Often, a generic distinction is important between a poorly differentiated tumor
of epithelial, hematopoietic, neuroendocrine, or neuroectodermal origin (i.e.,
melanoma).
These studies include:
Immunohistochemical.
Immunohistochemical studies can be important in making these broad
distinctions, in particular, studies that evaluate staining for keratins,
leukocyte common antigen, and S-100, a neuroectodermal antigen expressed
in melanomas.[
2
]
Polymerase chain reaction.
In patients with suspected nasopharyngeal carcinoma, DNA amplification of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes can be used for diagnosis with tissue provided
by fine-needle aspiration biopsy.  The presence of EBV in metastases from an
occult primary tumor suggests the development of overt nasopharyngeal
carcinoma.[
3
]
Acinar spaces and microacini are seen with adenocarcinomas.  Electron dense
secretory granules are seen in tumors of neuroectodermal origin. 
Premelanosomes can be found in most amelanotic melanomas.  But these features
are generally associated with differentiation along a particular line.  Often
poorly differentiated tumors do not display such characteristics, and electron microscopy
evaluation would be of little value.  Approximately 10% of the time, electron microscopy may help
distinguish a primary diagnosis not obtained by light microscopy.[

American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
For metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary, the patient's human papilloma virus (HPV) p16 status or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status is used to determine which AJCC staging system is used, as follows:
If the patient is HPV p16 positive, the staging for p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer, which has different nodal staging, is used. For more information, see the
AJCC prognostic stage groups for HPV-mediated (p16-positive) oropharyngeal cancer
section in Oropharyngeal Cancer Treatment.
If the patient is HPV p16 negative, the staging for p16-negative oropharyngeal cancer is used. For more information, see the
AJCC prognostic stage groups for p16-negative squamous cancers of the oropharynx
section in Oropharyngeal Cancer Treatment.
If the patient is EBV positive, the staging for nasopharyngeal cancer is used. For more information, see the
Stage Information for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
section in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Treatment.
Treatment of Untreated Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer With Occult Primary
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Patients with untreated metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary have had no previous treatment except supportive
care.
 Patients with neck nodes from a presumed unknown primary tumor should be
evaluated as follows:
Surgical biopsy or excision to establish a histological diagnosis, but only
after an aerodigestive tract primary has been carefully ruled out by the
following procedures:
Direct nasopharyngoscopy, laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, and esophagoscopy,
with biopsy of any suspicious area.
If no suspicious lesions are found, random biopsies of the nasopharynx,
base of tongue, tonsil, and pyriform sinus on the side of the lesion should be performed.
If the tonsil is not present, biopsy of the tonsillar fossa should be
performed.
Sinus x-rays are probably indicated; if an abnormality is found, it should
be biopsied as well.
Selected other studies if indicated.  Magnetic
resonance imaging offers an advantage over computed tomography scans to detect head and neck
tumors and to distinguish lymph nodes from blood vessels. It should be
considered in the initial evaluation of the patient with metastatic squamous
cell cancer in cervical lymph nodes.[
1
]  Positron emission tomography may help determine the primary site.[
2
]
Patients should undergo a full course of radiation therapy or
adequate neck dissection, when possible.  In cases of fixed massive homolateral
adenopathy or bilateral nodes, radiation therapy should be
administered first.  The radiation fields should also include the nasopharynx,
base of tongue, and pyriform sinuses.  If radiation therapy is the primary mode
of treatment and the neck mass persists upon completion of radiation therapy,
cervical lymph node dissection should be performed.  Patients with metastatic
carcinoma in the supraclavicular region are best managed with a full course of
radiation therapy, followed by surgical dissection if palpable tumor persists. 
Careful continued follow-up of these patients is of utmost importance. 
Depending on the likely site of origin and histology, chemotherapy appropriate
to the most treatable site may be indicated.
Accumulating evidence has demonstrated a high incidence (>30%–40%) of
hypothyroidism in patients who receive external-beam radiation therapy to the entire
thyroid gland or the pituitary gland.  Thyroid function testing of patients
should be considered before therapy and as part of posttreatment follow-up.[

Treatment of Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer With Occult Primary
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
The prognosis for most treated patients with progressing, recurring, or
relapsing cancer is poor, regardless of cell type or stage.  Deciding on
further treatment depends on many factors, including the specific cancer, previous
treatment, site of recurrence, and individual patient considerations. 
Treatments that are under clinical evaluation are appropriate and should be
considered when possible.
