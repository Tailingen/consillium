Surgery With Implantable Biodegradable Carmustine (BCNU) Wafer Followed by Chemo for Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme
The purpose of this research study is to try and identify a more effective treatment plan to improve survival rates for patients with a recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) brain tumor that can be removed by brain surgery.

The study will record what effects (good and bad) the combination of surgery with chemotherapy wafers inserted in the spot where the patient's tumor was during your surgery and post-operative chemotherapy has on the patient and their survival rate over the next 12 months.
