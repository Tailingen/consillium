Sexual Dysfunction Check-up in Premenopausal Breast Cancer Survivors Taking Endocrine Therapy: A Cross-Sectional Study
Primary objectives:

* To estimate Sexual Dysfunction (SD) incidence in premenopausal breast cancer patients treated by surgery and taking endocrine therapy.
* To detect the presence of SD-related distress in the population, as a determining factor in the maintenance of a good quality of life.

Secondary objectives:

* To describe SD characteristics determining the most frequently reported symptoms and correlations with type of surgery or therapeutic regimens.
* Collect baseline data for subsequent randomized trials involving practical interventions with the aim to reduce SD prevalence in this population.
