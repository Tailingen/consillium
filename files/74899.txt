Hemodynamic Parameters in People with Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease Referred to a Secondary Prevention and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Program
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the hemodynamic changes in the forefoot of patients with coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral atherosclerotic disease referred a 12-week cardiovascular rehabilitation program (PREV program).

Also, this study will describe the characteristics of patients admitted to the PREV program and their evolutions in terms of favorable, unfavorable outcomes and complications and up to one year after completion of the program.
