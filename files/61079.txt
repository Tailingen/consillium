Pasireotide in Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia
This is a small controlled pilot study to assess the effect of subcutaneous pasireotide on preventing hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism, including congenital hyperinsulinism and insulinoma.

Pasireotide is a somatostatin analog with affinity for several somatostatin receptors including those on pancreatic beta cells; when activated these receptors affect the secretion of glucagon and insulin. Pasireotide is also known to decrease glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) secretion. Hyperglycemia is a well-documented adverse effect of pasireotide in its approved indications for treatment of Cushing's disease and acromegaly.

In light of this, the investigators hypothesize that pasireotide may be an effective therapy for hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. Therefore a small controlled pilot study to assess the effect of subcutaneous (s.c.) pasireotide on preventing hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism over 7 hours of observation in both fasting and fed states is proposed.
