Evaluation of Oncoxin-Viusid® in Cervical Cancer and Endometrial Adenocarcinoma.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral solution Oncoxin-Viusid in the reduction of acute toxicity of Radiotherapy (RTP) and Chemotherapy (QTP) in patients with histological diagnosis of cervical cancer and endometrial adenocarcinoma. This is a phase II, prospective, randomized and double blind clinical trial, which will include 66 patients assigned to 2 treatment arms: 33 patients will receive conventional treatment, plus a placebo of the nutritional supplement and another 33 patients will receive along with the conventional treatment the Oncoxin-Viusid nutritional supplement produced by the Catalysis Laboratories of Spain. Patients will receive oral treatment throughout the onco-specific treatment and up to 3 weeks after completion.

Toxicity of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients diagnosed with cervical cancer and endometrium adenocarcinoma., Patients diagnosed with cervical cancer and adenocarcinoma of the endometrium usually have varying degrees of malnutrition and immunodeficiencies; they are carriers of oncogenic virus infections, and present deterioration of their general state, depression-anxiety and socio-economic dysfunctions. Oncospecific treatment's toxicity is measured according to Common Criteria of Terminology for the Report of Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4)., 3 months

Patients will be evaluated clinically and hematological at the beginning of the treatment, before each cycle of treatment with QTP / RTP, at month, two and three months after the end of the treatment with follow-up every three months for 1 year. The self-perceived quality of life related to health will be assessed by means of the EORTC questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and the specific questionnaire QLQ-CX24) at the beginning and a year after completing the treatment. The toxicity to the research product will be described according to Common Criteria of Terminology for the Report of Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4) and the tolerance to onco-specific treatment. It is expected that with the joint administration of the research product, the patients will have a better tolerance to the treatment of QTP / RTP with a decrease of the interruptions by toxicity in 25% and will preserve a better quality of life.
