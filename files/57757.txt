Bevacizumab Beyond Progression in Platinum Sensitive Ovarian Cancer
Bevacizumab has been found to prolong progression free survival in first line, and more recently, in second line treatment for platinum sensitive ovarian cancer patients who had not received prior treatment with bevacizumab.

Recently reported data suggest that patients with colon cancer who receive bevacizumab in more than one line of therapy (beyond progression) have better results. In ovarian cancer, the role of bevacizumab administered in both first and second-line therapies needs to be defined.

This study aims to evaluate whether administering bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in second-line therapy to patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have received first-line bevacizumab will be more effective than chemotherapy alone.
