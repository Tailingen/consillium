A Single Dose, Open-Label, Dose-escalation Study of the Safety and Imaging Characteristics of LS301-IT for Intraoperative Imaging of Lung Cancer
The aim of this Phase 1b study is to investigate the safety and fluorescence signal of a single dose of LS301-IT, a novel fluorescence imaging agent developed by Integro Theranostics (IT), administered by slow intravenous (IV) administration in patients undergoing surgical thoracoscopy and resection of lung cancer. Safety is the primary objective of this study, followed by the evaluation of the fluorescence signal as it relates to dose level and dosing time interval.
Lung Cancers
DRUG: LS301-IT
Number of Patients with Dose Limiting Toxicities, Dose Limiting Toxicity - Any CTCAE Grade 2, 3, 4, or 5 AE (any treatment emergent sign or symptom) at least possibly related to IMP will be considered a DLT, as well as any other AE deemed clinically relevant by the SRC., 2 to 7 days after dosing|Number of Patients that discontinue the study or have their surgery cancelled due to toxicity, Treatment discontinuation and/or surgery cancellation due to toxicity (hypersensitivity reaction to LS301-IT), From start of dosing to time of surgery
Maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) in ng/mL, Cmax of LS301 and its main metabolite, Samples collected up to 24 hours after dosing|Area under the plasma concentration time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUC0-âˆž [AUCinf]) in ng*hr/mL, AUC of LS301 in plasma., Over 24 hours after dosing|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable plasma concentration (AUC0-t [AUClast]) in ng*hr/mL, LS301 concentration in plasma, over 24 hours after dosing|Time to reach maximal plasma concentration (Tmax) in minutes, LS301 concentration in plasma, over 24 hours after dosing|Elimination/apparent terminal elimination half- life (t1/2) in minutes, LS301 concentration in plasma, 24 hours after dosing
This is a Phase 1b, open-label study to investigate the use of LS301-IT (investigational medicinal product \[IMP\]), a fluorescence imaging agent used for visualization of tumor margins and other suspicious nodules in patients with primary diagnosis, or a high clinical suspicion, for cancer in the lung based on CT, biopsy, or other imaging.

Up to 24 patients (4 dose cohorts, up to 6 patients each) for Phase 1b study (total of 24 patients maximum). There will be no stratification by dosing interval or lung cancer type (e.g., lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma).

As safety is the primary objective of this study, the safety of each dose level will be assessed by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). Based upon the safety results of the first cohort, the SRC will recommend to the Sponsor which dose levels of LS301-IT may be administered in subsequent cohorts.
