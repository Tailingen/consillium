Novel Imaging Markers in SPMS
This pilot study takes the innovative approach of using ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticle enhanced MRI to measure activity of the innate immune system within MS lesions. Activity of innate immunity has been hypothesized as one of the critical pathologic processes underpinning neurologic worsening in progressive MS. As such, in the short term this project proposes to investigate USPIO uptake in SPMS lesions as a promising in vivo imaging biomarker for chronic-active lesions, as distinguished from chronic-inactive lesions.
