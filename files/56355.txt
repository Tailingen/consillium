A Study of Dostarlimab in Participants With Untreated Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer in China
The main goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of dostarlimab monotherapy in Chinese participants with locally advanced Mismatch-repair deficient (dMMR)/ Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) rectal cancer who have received no prior treatment.

Number of Participants with Sustained Complete Clinical Response for 12 Months (cCR12) as assessed by Independent Central Review (ICR), cCR12 is achieved when a participant maintains complete clinical response (cCR) as assessed by Independent central review (ICR) for 12 months from the first disease assessment after last dose of study intervention.
