Behavioral Activation and Medication Optimization for Perioperative Mental Health Feasibility Study
Inadequate management of preoperative mental health disorders often contributes to poor postoperative outcomes, including increased rates of readmission, delirium, falls, and mortality. However, very little work has been done to improve perioperative mental health. In particular, there have been limited systematic efforts that identify evidence-based behavioral and pharmacological strategies that were originally developed for depression and anxiety in otherwise medically well psychiatric patients. A mental health intervention bundle, composed of behavioral and pharmacological strategies, can mitigate anxiety and depression symptoms during the perioperative period. However, lacking is conclusive evidence on effectiveness of such an intervention bundle focused on the delivery of perioperative mental health care in older surgical patients. Towards this end, the investigators will develop and test an intervention bundle that encompasses: (1) behavioral activation, and (2) medication optimization.

Reach of the Study as Measured by the Number of Participants Who Agree to Participate in the Study Out of the Total Eligible Participants, Through completion of the study (13 months and 5 days)|Reach of the Intervention Bundle as Measured by the Number of Participants Who Completed the Intervention Out of the Participants Who Agreed to Participate in the Study, Through completion of the study (13 months and 5 days)
Completeness of Planned Primary Outcome Data Collection at Specified Timepoints as Measured by the Number of Participants Who Completed 100% of the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS), Baseline, 1 month, and 3 months
The proposed research is relevant to public health because the prevalence of undertreated depression/anxiety in older adults coupled with the increasing number of surgeries performed in this population are creating a crucial need for the integration of mental health interventions into critical periods, such as the perioperative period. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the mission of the NIMH to transform the treatment of mental illnesses through clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure.
