Exosomes Implication in PD1-PD-L1 Activation in OSAS
An increased occurrence of cancer associated mortality has been described in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS). This association might be partially explained by an impaired cellular immune response that has been described in OSAS. Is has been suggested that OSAS impact immune cells by upregulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Exosomes are small membrane vesicles released by numerous cells in the bloodstream. Exosomes have been shown to be implicated in cancer cells proliferation via a PD-1/PD-L1 pathway activation.

This study will evaluate exosomal PD-1/PD-L1 expression in patients with OSAS as compared to controls and will further investigate their impact on immune cells function and proliferation capacities.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PD1/PD-L1 exosomal expression
exosomal PD1 expression, Peripheral blood (≈20 ml) will be collected from non-OSAS or OSAS subjects on EDTA-coated tubes. Exosomes will be isolated by centrifugation. For detecting exosome-associated surface proteins by flow cytometry, exosomes will be first captured on magnetic beads. The bead/exosome complexes will be then co-incubated with the labeled detection antibodies, either anti-PD1. Next, the complexes will be washed 3x resuspended in 300uL of PBS for antigen detection by flow cytometry., at baseline|exosomal PD-L1 expression, Peripheral blood (≈20 ml) will be collected from non-OSAS or OSAS subjects on EDTA-coated tubes.
