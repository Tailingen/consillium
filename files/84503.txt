Phase 1/2 Study of HS-10370 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
HS-10370 is an oral, highly selective, small molecular inhibitor of KRAS G12C. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of HS-10370 in Chinese advanced solid tumor patients.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: HS-10370
Phase Ia：To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Number of participants with dose limiting toxicity, From the single dose to the last dose of the first cycle defined as 21 days of multiple dosing (28 days).|2. Phase Ib/II: To evaluate clinical activity/efficacy of HS-10370 by assessment of objective response rate, Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), up to 24 months
Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, Number of participants with treatment related adverse events., From baseline until 28 days after the last dose|Observed maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after single dose of HS-10370, In the study of single-dose, Cmax will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of HS-10370 on Day 1 to Day 6, From pre-dose to 120 hours after single dose on Day 1|Time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) after single dose of HS-10370, In the study of single-dose, Tmax will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of HS-10370 on Day 1 to Day 6., From pre-dose to 120 hours after single dose on Day 1|Apparent terminal half-life (T1/2) after single dose of HS-10370, Apparent terminal half-life is the time measured for the concentration to decrease by one half. Terminal half-life calculated by natural log 2 divided by λz., From pre-dose to 120 hours after single dose on Day 1|Duration of response (DOR), DOR assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, 24 months|Overall survival (OS), 24 months
This is a phase 1/2, first-in-human, open-label, multicenter study of HS-10370, this study has two parts: phase 1 and phase 2. The phase 1 portion consists of dose escalation and dose expansion, which is aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of HS-10370 in subjects with advanced solid tumors and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of HS-10370. Phase 2 will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of HS-10370 in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with a KRAS G12C mutation.
