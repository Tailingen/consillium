Early Nutrition Intervention for M1 Stage Cancer Patients
In China, the treatment of advanced-stage cancer often follows a pattern where the management of patients is primarily overseen by oncologists who focus on addressing the main clinical symptoms and intervening accordingly.

However, symptoms such as appetite loss, weight loss, and anxiety are often overlooked. It is common for clinical nutritionists to passively enter oncology wards to conduct comprehensive nutritional assessments and develop nutrition plans only when patients exhibit significant malnutrition, upon request from oncologists or patients and their families.

Against this background, the investigators integrated clinical nutritionists into the oncology treatment team and established a proactive nutritional intervention team specifically targeting M1 advanced-stage cancer patients. This initiative aims to conduct a single-center, open-label, randomized parallel-group prospective study, with the following objectives: 1) to evaluate the impact of this model on the nutritional status, survival, and quality of life of advanced-stage cancer patients, and 2) to further optimize this model for widespread replication in clinical practice.

the incidence of cachexia, The definition and classification of cancer cachexia was used by an international consensus \[9, 10\]: (1) weight loss \> 5% over the past 6 months (in the absence of simple starvation), (2) BMI \< 20 and any degree of weight loss \> 2%, or (3) appendicular skeletal muscle index consistent with sarcopenia and any degree of weight loss \> 2%. The assessment of skeletal muscle depletion was used by mid-upper arm muscle area by anthropometry (men \< 32 cm2, women \< 18 cm2), every month, up to half year
overall survival ；progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed from the first day of treatment with ICIs to the earliest signs of disease progression or death from any cause. Patients who were alive but without progression were censored at the time of last follow-up.

OS was calculated from the date of starting ICI to the date of death due to all-cause. Patients who are alive at the date of data cutoff were censored at the time of last follow-up., every month, up to half year|Physical Fitness Status, Karnofsky Performance Score，the minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 100, and higher scores mean a better outcome., every month, up to half year|BMI, Changes in body weight and Body Mass Index (BMI), every month, up to half year|Nutritional risk and malnutrition status, Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS2002) ，the minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 7, and higher scores mean a worse outcome., every month, up to half year|Patient's emotional changes, Evaluation through Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)，the minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 42, and higher scores mean a worse outcome., every month, up to half year|Caregiver psychological burden, Assessment via Caregiver Burden Scale，the minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 7, and higher scores mean a worse outcome., every month, up to half year|Patient's physical, social, and cognitive functioning, Assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)，the minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 27, and higher scores mean a worse outcome., every month, up to half year|incidence of Sarcopenia, while muscle function alterations are assessed via the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), including sit-to-stand tests, the 400-meter walk test, and grip strength measurements., every month, up to half year|Nutritional risk and malnutrition status, Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA)，the minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 20, and higher scores mean a worse outcome., every month, up to half year|Patient's emotional changes, Distress Thermometer (DT)，the minimum value is 0 and maximum value is 10 and higher scores mean a worse outcome., every month, up to half year

Against this background, the investigators integrated clinical nutritionists into the oncology treatment team and established a proactive nutritional intervention team specifically targeting stage IV cancer patients. This initiative aims to conduct a single-center, open-label, randomized parallel-group prospective study, with the following objectives: 1) to evaluate the impact of this model on the nutritional status, survival, and quality of life of advanced-stage cancer patients, and 2) to further optimize this model for widespread replication in clinical practice.
