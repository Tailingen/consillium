Toripalimab as Monotherapy for Patients With Small Cell Carcinoma of Esophagus Who Failed Chemotherapy
To evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety and tolerance of toripalimab as monotherapy for patients with small cell esophageal cancer (SCCE), and to explore the potential biomarkers for this treatment.
Small Cell Carcinoma of Esophagus|Advanced Cancer
DRUG: Toripalimab
Objective Response Rates (ORR), the ratio of patients who are evaluated as CR or PR, up to two year
Progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to disease progression, up to two year|Overall Survival (OS), defined as the period from the first dose of study treatment to loss of follow-up or death, up to two year|Duration of remission (DOR), Defined as the time between the first assessment of a tumor as PR or CR and the first assessment as PD or any cause of death, up to two year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), It is defined as the proportion of patients whose tumors shrink or remain stable for a certain period of time, including CR, PR and SD., up to two year|Adverse Events (AEs), All treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were categorized according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events., up to two year
For the first time in the world, the investigators revealed the genomic characteristics of SCCE and constructed a complete genomic profile of SCCE. The analysis of transcriptome data showed that the number of effector T cells in SCCE immune microenvironment was significantly higher than that of other cancers, and NK cells were relatively high. Macrophages in SCCE mainly showed M2-like phenotype and maintained at a relatively high level, suggesting the possibility of immunotherapy in SCCE treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to clarify the efficacy of PD-1 antibody in the treatment of patients with SCCE who failed chemotherapy, so as to provide a basis for further large-scale clinical research.
