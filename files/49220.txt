SpaceIT Hydrogel System for Perirectal Spacing
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the SpaceITâ„¢ Hydrogel System in patients undergoing External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: SpaceIT Hydrogel System|DEVICE: Commercially available Boston Scientific Spacer
Primary Safety Endpoint - Acute Grade 3 or greater adverse events., Acute Grade 3 or greater adverse events, inclusive of all adverse events listed on the existing SpaceOAR product labels, that arise within 90 days of index procedure., 90 Days from hydrogel placement procedure|Primary Effectiveness Endpoint - 25% reduction in the volume of the rectum receiving 90% of the prescribed radiation dose, Clinically relevant dose reduction defined as a 25% reduction in the volume of the rectum receiving 90% of the prescribed radiation dose in subjects receiving hydrogel., 10 days post procedure
Additional Safety Endpoint - Adverse Device Effects (ADEs) requiring additional procedures and/or medications, Adverse Device Effects (ADEs) requiring additional procedures and/or medications, Up to 24 months|Additional Safety Endpoint - Incidence of acute Grade 2 or greater gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) adverse events (AEs), Incidence of acute Grade 2 or greater gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) adverse events (AEs) from index procedure up to 3 months, Up to 90 days|Additional Safety Endpoint - Incidence of late Grade 2 or greater GI and GU adverse events (AEs), Incidence of late Grade 2 or greater GI and GU adverse events (AEs) from 3 months up to the end of study follow-up, 91 days up to 24 Months|Additional Effectiveness Endpoint - Visualization of hydrogel, Technical Success: visualization of hydrogel between the posterior prostatic capsule and the anterior rectal wall will be assessed as Yes/No using the MRI performed post hydrogel placement procedure, 10 days post procedure|Additional Effectiveness Endpoint - Space Creation, Space Creation: Distance between the posterior prostatic capsule and anterior rectal wall will be measured mid gland in millimeters using MRI performed post hydrogel placement procedure, 10 days post procedure|Additional Effectiveness Endpoint - Absorption, Absorption: Absence of hydrogel in the perirectal space assessed on MRI at 12 months post-hydrogel placement., 12 Month post hydrogel placement|Additional Effectiveness Endpoint - Change in radiation dose distributions to the organs at risk, Dose Distribution: Change in radiation dose distributions to the organs at risk (OARs) quantified by computing rectal Dose-Volume Histograms (DVHs) for the dose plans created pre-and post-hydrogel placement., 10 days post procedure|Additional Effectiveness Endpoint - Mean and Maximum Rectal Radiation doses, Mean and Maximum Rectal Radiation Doses (in Gy), 10 days post procedure|Additional Effectiveness Endpoint - Quality of Life Questionnaire: EQ-5D-5L, Changes from Baseline in EQ-5D-5L

The EQ-5D-5L is a generic questionnaire that assesses a subject's self-reported health status in terms of five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. Each dimension has five response levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to/extreme problems. Subject's overall current health on a vertical visual analogue scale of "0-100" is recorded, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' at "100" and 'The worst health you can imagine' at "0"., Baseline up to 24 months|Additional Effectiveness Endpoint - Ease of hydrogel administration, Ease of hydrogel administration. Scored on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 where 1 is Very Difficult and 5 is Very Easy, 10 days post procedure|Additional Effectiveness Endpoint - Space Maintenance, Space Maintenance: Distance between the posterior prostatic capsule and anterior rectal wall will be measured, 3 Months post hydrogel placement procedure|Additional Effectiveness Endpoint - Quality of Life Questionnaire: Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26), Changes from Baseline in Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26)

EPIC-26 is a questionnaire designed to measure health related quality of life (HRQOL) in people with prostate cancer. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better HRQOL., Baseline up to 24 months|Additional Effectiveness Endpoint - Quality of Life Questionnaire, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI:GH), Changes from Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI:GH)

The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI:GH) outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity., Baseline up to 24 months
HYDROSPACE study is a prospective, randomized, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of SpaceIT in patients undergoing External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Subjects randomized to the investigational arm will receive SpaceIT Hydrogel System

Subjects randomized to the control arm will receive a commercially marketed Boston Scientific perirectal hydrogel spacer, SpaceOAR System or SpaceOAR Vue Hydrogel
