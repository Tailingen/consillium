Incretin Effect in PCOS Women
This study investigates the incretin effect in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) before and after removal of their insulin resistance by metformin.

The investigators' hypothesis is that insulin resistant women with PCOS have a reduced incretin effect and elevated glucagon responses as measured by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test and isoglycemic i.v. glucose infusion. The investigators hypothesise that both can be improved when their insulin resistance is removed.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
DRUG: Metformin|DRUG: Placebo
The change in incretin effect from baseline and until after removal of insulin resistance, The incretin effect will be assessed from the insulin secretion during af 75 g OGTT and IIGI at baseline and after 12 weeks' treatment with placebo and metformin, baseline and 12 weeks' treatment
Glucagon response, Glucagon responses (plasma concentrations) will be assessed during the 75-g OGTTs, 0, 12 and 30 weeks
