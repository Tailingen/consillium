Effect of Food and Antacid on BIIB021 With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is designed to assess the effect of food and antacid use on the pharmacokinetic properties of BIIB021.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: BIIB021 and Food|DRUG: BIIB0121 and Antacid
The primary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of BIIB021 taken under fed conditions compared to BIIB021 taken under fasting conditions in subjects with advanced solid tumors., Cycle 1, Day 3
To assess the pharmacokinetics of BIIB021 taken with an antacid (ranitidine) compared to BIIB021 taken with no antacid, both under fasting conditions, Cycle 1, Day 8 and Day 10|To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB021, 6 months|To evaluate the antitumor activity of BIIB021, 6 months|To evaluate the effect of BIIB021 on pharmacodynamic biomarkers., 6 months
This study has 2 phases (the Food Phase and the Antacid Phase), each consisting of a 2-period, 2-sequence, 2-treatment crossover design. The Food Phase will assess the effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of 100 mg BIIB021, and the Antacid Phase will assess the effect of an antacid (ranitidine) on the pharmacokinetics of 450 mg BIIB021 in the same subjects. Ranitidine 150 mg will be taken the evening before and the morning of the antacid dosing day.
