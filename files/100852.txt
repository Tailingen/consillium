Pilot Study of Curcumin Formulation and Ashwagandha Extract in Advanced Osteosarcoma
Curcumin as well as the ashwagandha extract are ingredients from traditional indian medicine and have been shown to be potent anti-cancer compounds in laboratory as well as animal studies.

The pharmacokinetics will be studied along with response as measured on CT scans and PET scans as well as the quality of life and any toxicity.
