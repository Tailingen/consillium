Regulation of LncRNA For Breg in Patients With Thymoma and Autoimmune Diseases
Initially investigators will find LncRNA which to be able to affect Notch2 signaling pathway; then confirm the relationship between Notch2 and LncRNA, and analysis the regulation mode of LncRNA to Notch2 signaling pathway, and to observe the correlation between LncRNA and thymoma complicated with autoimmune diseases.
Thymoma|Autoimmune Disease
The relationship between LncRNA and Notch2 signaling pathway, Using of Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction(RT-PCR) and Western-Blot to find special LncRNA that can affect the Notch2 signaling pathway LncRNA's and Notch2 signaling pathway's gene and protein expression level Then, using of SiRNA to inhibit the expression of LncRNA or plasmid transfection to raise the expression of LncRNA, and observation of changes of Notch2 signaling pathway., 2016.10.01~2018.09.31-up to 24 months
The regulated effect of Notch2 signaling pathway to the development of Bregs and the cell function, Peripheral blood was obtained from participants, and Regulatory B Cells(Bregs) were extracted and cultured.

SiRNA-Notch2 to inhibit the expression of Notch2 signaling pathway and plasmid transfection of Notch2 to raise the expression of Notch2 signaling pathway, Then, observation of the quantity (\*10\^6/ml) and morphological changes of Bregs; the expression differences of Notch2 signaling pathway and content level (pg/ml) of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) in culture supernatant, 2016.10.01~2018.09.31-up to 24 months
The relevance of Bregs and thymoma with autoimmune diseases, Natural disease course (number of days) Treatment options: hormone dosage (mg), cytotoxic drug dosage (mg), 28 day mortality (%), treatment success rate.

Laboratory examination: white blood cell (\*10\^9/L), hemoglobin (g/L), urinary protein (mg/L), titers of autoimmune antibody.

Vital signs: heart rate (bpm), body temperature., 2016.10.01~2018.09.31-up to 24 months
1. This study plans to research the correlation between Bregs and thymoma complicated with autoimmune diseases and the regulation the severity of the disease.
2. Clarify different expression levels of Notch2 signaling pathway in thymoma complicated with autoimmune diseases, and the effect on Regulatory B Cells(Bregs).
3. Find the effective regulation mode of Notch2 signaling pathway and the regulation of Bregs cell development and function in LncRNA.
