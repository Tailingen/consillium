Analysis of Palbociclib Treatment in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer Within a Compassionate Use Programe
In Spain, palbociclib was launched last November 1st, 2017. However, since February 2015 the on-going compassionate use programme of palbociclib has enabled drug access to patients with RH+/HER2- breast cancer previously treated with at least 4 treatment lines for advanced disease. During this period, approximately 400 patients have received treatment within this programme. Since this population of patients more pre-treated was not included in the studies for regulatory submission, the collection of efficacy and toxicity data in the clinical practice setting is of clinical interest.
