A Study of MM-111 and Paclitaxel With Trastuzumab in Patients HER2 Positive Carcinomas of the Distal Esophagus, Gastroesophageal (GE) Junction and Stomach
To determine whether the combination of MM-111 plus paclitaxel and trastuzumab is more effective than paclitaxel and trastuzumab alone
HER-2 Gene Amplification|Esophagus Cancer|Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer|Stomach Cancer
DRUG: MM-111|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Trastuzumab
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Target and non-target lesion antitumor response and disease progression during treatment with each dosing regimen will be evaluated using the international criteria proposed by the RECIST v1.1. Disease status will be assessed every 8 weeks from the date of the first dose of any drug in a regimen., 30 months
