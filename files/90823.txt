Focal Prostate Radio-Frequency Ablation
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of focal (targeted) Radio-Frequency Ablation (RFA) in men with low or intermediate-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Radio-Frequency Ablation (RFA)
Negative Biopsy Rate at 6 Months After Focal Bipolar Radio-Frequency Ablation (RFA), The primary efficacy endpoint is negative biopsy rate at 6 months after focal bipolar RFA. The point estimate and its 95% confidence interval will be calculated using the exact binominal method., 6 months
Number of Participants With Treatment Related Adverse Events, The type of event using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be identified and graded for severity. The relationship of the adverse event to the therapy or procedure will be determined as follows: Unrelated; Unlikely; Possible; Probable; Definite. For reporting purposes, an adverse event is considered unexpected when either the type of event or severity of the event is not listed in the study consent., Up to 9 months|Completion of Quality of Life (QOL) Assessment Questionnaires at Six Months, The secondary objective is to evaluate the change from baseline in quality-of-life indicators following focal RFA in patients with low-risk localized prostate cancer. The patients will complete the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), American Urological Association (AUA), Rectal Assessment Scale (RAS), and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaires at baseline and 6-month visit. EPIC scores overall 1 (dissatisfied) - 5 (extremely satisfied). AUA scores are o (no prostate issues) - 35 (very severe prostate symptoms). SHIM scores 0 (severe sexual dysfunction) - 25 (no sexual dysfunction) and RAS scores 0 (no bowel issues) - 15 (bad bowel habits), 6 months
