Fludarabine/Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide Conditioning for Adult Lymphoid Malignancies
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is potential curative therapy for adult lymphoid malignancies. Based on our previous study, the condition with iv-busulfan (iv-BU) and cyclophosphamide (CTX) is feasible with low toxicity and transplantation mortality and long-term survival is comparable to most data reported with slightly higher relapse rate particularly for patients in CR2. In this study, the investigators aim to further improve the conditioning with Fludarabine + iv-BU and to use CTX after stem cell transfusion as consolidation for lymphoid malignancies and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis.

acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), d100 incidence of acute GVHD, grade II-IV or grade III-IV, day 100|chronic GVHD, 3-year incidence of chronic GVHD and extensive cGVHD, 3 years
non-relapse mortality (NRM), estimated 3-year NRM after transplantation (death not due to relapse disease), 3 years|cumulated incidence of relapse (CIR), estimated 3-year CIR after transplantation, 3 years|event-free survival (EFS), estimated 3-year EFS estimated 3-year EFS after transplantation, 3 years|overall survival (OS), estimated 3-year OS after transplantation, 3 years|GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS), estimated 3-year survival for patients without relapse, without III-IV aGVHD and without cGVHD required systemic treatment, 3 years
Patients with adult lymphoid malignancies received conditioning with Fludarabine + iv-BU. The GVHD was consisting of D+3 and D+4 CTX after stem cell transfusion. CSA will be added for all patients after D+5.
