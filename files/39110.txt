The purpose of this study is to determine a safe, effective, and tolerable dose of PRX302 for the treatment of low to intermediate risk prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: PRX302
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including both serious and non-serious AEs, and assessments of severity and relatedness to both the study drug agent (PRX302) and the rest of the injection procedure, 26 weeks post administration
Proportion of patients with an absence of clinically significant prostate cancer in the targeted area at 24 weeks post-administration of PRX302, as determined by a transperineal targeted biopsy [Efficacy], Clinically significant disease is defined as Gleason 7, or in the presence of Gleason 3+3 a maximum cancer core length \> 6 mm, 24 weeks post administration
A multi-centre, open label, phase IIb study, evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a targeted intraprostatic focal administration in development. The study will treat approximately 40 men who meet the eligibility criteria, and give written consent. Safety and tolerability will be assessed post-treatment over 26 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed by biopsy and imaging (mpMRI) at 24 weeks.
