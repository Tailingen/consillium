Confocal Microscopy Dual Band in the Management of Bladder Cancer
Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancer worldwide and the second most frequent urological cancer. The photodynamic diagnosis technique (PDD) currently used (Hexvix®) has improved tumor detection but with a high false positive rate. Indeed, the main limitation of the PDD is its lack of specificity, ranging from 35 to 66%. The association of this technique with new technologies such as the Cellvizio Dual Band featuring simultaneous dual wavelength illumination and detection, could improve the identification of tumoral lesions. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Cellvizio dual band technique for the diagnosis of tumors bladders.
Urinary Bladder Neoplasm
DEVICE: Cellvizio dual band
Determination of the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio of cells, In order to perform comparison between benign versus malignant cytology, significant differences between cytoplasmic areas and nuclear areas will be determine to stablish a value of nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, at inclusion
Number of neoplastic lesions identified by Cellvizio compared to number of lesions identified by pathology, through the study completion, an average of 6 months
