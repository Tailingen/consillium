Study of ONO-4578 With and Without ONO-4538 in Subjects Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and biomarker of ONO-4578 and combinations of ONO-4578 and ONO-4538 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and subjects with unresectable, advanced or recurrent gastric cancer, unresectable, advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.
