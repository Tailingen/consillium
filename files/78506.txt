Acetylsalicylic Acid and Colorectal Cancer Prevention: Exploring the Platelet Function of Its Mechanism of Action
In a preliminary study in healthy subjects, the investigators determined the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic of enteric-coated acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (Adiro 100 mg, Bayer), and the variability (coefficient of variation), accuracy and precision of a novel biomarker of ASA action, i.e., quantification of the extent of COX-1 acetylation at serine-529, using a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technique.

Now, the investigators will perform a clinical study in individuals undergoing Colorectal cancer (CRC) to validate the hypothesis that that low-dose ASA given once daily is acting primarily by selectively acetylating platelet COX-1 and suppressing its activity throughout the 24-hour dosing interval. In contrast, it is expected that the inhibitory effect on extra-platelet sources of COX-1 will be short-lasting, if any, affecting only partially COX-1, and this effect will be completely reversed at 24 hours after dosing. This is an important point which will strengthen the platelet hypothesis underpinning the apparent adequacy of a 24-hour dosing interval of ASA administration for the anticancer effect detected in cardiovascular trials.

These patients will be stratified into individuals with adenomas/carcinomas (20 to 30%) and patients without clinically detected adenomas/carcinomas (about 70 to 80%).
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Acetylsalicylic acid|PROCEDURE: Screening colonoscopy
Assessment of the degree of COX-1 acetylation by ASA administered for 1 week., It will be performed in platelets versus biopsies of the recto-colonic tissues., 7 hours after the 7th daily dose (group 1) and 24 hours after the 7th daily dose (group 2)
Changes from baseline in different biomarkers., It will be used a combining technique of liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify the level of acetylation of COX-1 in circulating platelets in subjects treated with ASA.

Parameters of the composite measure:

* haemochrome, AST, ALT, gamma-GT, alkaline phosphatase (AP), total bilirubin, total protein, glucose, creatinine, N, Na, K, Ca.
* urine analysis: pH, protein, albumin, glucose, RBC, bilirubin, nitrites, leucocytes and sediment., pre-drug on day 0 and after the 7th daily dose (6 hours for Group 1 and 24 hours for Group 2)|Changes from baseline in eicosanoid generation in vivo by measuring urinary metabolites derived from COXs., It will be performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS)., pre-drug on day 0 and after the 7th daily dose (6 hours for Group 1 and 24 hours for Group 2)|Changes in baseline platelet COX-1, By using human whole blood assay (serum TXB2) ex vivo, pre-drug on day 0 and after the 7th daily dose (6 hours for Group 1 and 24 hours for Group 2)|Change from baseline in plasma proteins of markers of angiogenesis., In blood sample by using an antibody array kit and Sphingosine-1 Phosphate (S1P) by immunoassay., pre-drug on day 0 and after the 7th daily dose (6 hours for Group 1 and 24 hours for Group 2)|Assessment of ASA plasma levels., Will be performed whole blood aggregation test., pre-drug on day 0 and after the 7th daily dose (6 hours for Group 1 and 24 hours for Group 2)|Changes from baseline of proteomic profile of selected angiogenesis factors, ie VEGF, FGF2, TGFbeta, EGF, PDGF, MMP, angiogenin, and angiogenesis inhibitors, ie endostatin, PF4, thrombospondin 1, alpha-macroglobulin, PAI 1 and angiostatin., It will be done in isolated platelets by using an antibody array kit and Sphingosine-1 Phosphate (S1P) by immunoassay., pre-drug on day 0 and after the 7th daily dose (6 hours for Group 1 and 24 hours for Group 2)|Change from baseline in eicosanoid biosynthesis and protein expression of markers of growth and progression of colorectal cancer (such as COX-2, NF-Kb and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway)., It will be done in normal tissues or pathological recto-colonic tissues., pre-drug on day 0 and after the 7th daily dose (6 hours for Group 1 and 24 hours for Group 2)
