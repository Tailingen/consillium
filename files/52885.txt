Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography and Choroidal Osteoma
This study evaluates the vessel density of choriocapillary vascular network in eyes affected by choroidal osteoma and in eyes complicated by choroidal neovascularization, using optical coherence tomography angiography.
Choroidal Osteoma, Bilateral
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Optical coherence tomography angiography
Study of vessel density of the choriocapillary in patients affected by choroidal osteoma ., To evaluate the role of optical coherence tomography angiography in evaluating the features of the choriocapillary, using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in patients with choroidal osteoma and in patients with choroidal osteoma complicated by choroidal neovascularization. The parameter analyzed by OCTA was the vessel density of choriocapillary (percent), 7 years
The choroidal osteoma is a rare benign tumor of choroid, it is bilateral in 10%-25% of cases, affecting usually young women. Previous studies evaluated the morphologic characteristics of tumor-related vasculatures, described as a seafun vascular networks, but none focused on study of vessel density of coriocapillary.

The aim of this study is to investigate the potential role of the optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in evaluating the choriocapillary vessel density in order to individuate the changes of this vascular network that may influence the onset of choroidal neovasculariztion.

Therefore, OCTA could be useful in the clinical management of the choroidal osteoma
