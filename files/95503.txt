Comparison of Delta-Shaped and Billroth II After TLDG
To compare the safety and feasibility of Delta-shaped anastomosis and Billroth II anastomosis after totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer(TLDG).
Gastric Cancer
PROCEDURE: Delta-shaped anastomosis|PROCEDURE: Billroth II anastomosis
Stage distribution, up to 7 days after the operation|Resected margin, up to 7 days after the operation|Operative time, up to 7 days after the operation|Anastomosis time, up to 7 days after the operation|The number of stapler cartridges used, up to 7 days after the operation|Median estimated blood loss, up to 7 days after the operation|Red blood cell transfusion, up to 7 days after the operation|Length of the incision, up to 7 days after the operation
Postoperative complication, Major complications includes anastomosis leakage and intrabdominal bleeding . Minor complications includes bile regurgitation,anastomotic stenosis and delayed gastric emptying., up to 30 days after the operation
Methods: 78 consecutive patients who underwent TLDG in First Hospital of Jilin University between October 2012 and December 2014 were enrolled in this study . All patients were divided randomly into two groups:Delta-shaped anastomosis group (DS group) and Billroth II anastomosis group (B-II group), and the patients in DS group underwent Delta-shaped anastomosis after TLDG, and the patients in B-II group underwent Billroth-II anastomosis after TLDG.Outcome measures,resected margin,operative time,anastomosis time,number of stapler cartridges used,length of the incision,the time of first flatus and liquid diet,hospital stay and postoperative morbidity are compared between the two groups.
