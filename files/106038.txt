Liquid Biopsy With PET/CT Versus PET/CT Alone in Diagnosis of Small Lung Nodules
The purpose of this study is to determine if a liquid biopsy, a method of detecting cancer from a blood draw, combined with a PET/CT scan, a type of radiological scan, is better at determining whether a lung nodule is cancerous when compared to a PET/CT scan alone. A PET/CT scan is already used for diagnosis of lung nodules, but its efficacy is uncertain in nodules 6-20 mm in size. Therefore, the PET/CT will be evaluated for its diagnostic ability in lesions this size alone and in combination with a liquid biopsy. Secondarily, a machine learning model will be created to see if the combination of the PET/CT imaging data and the liquid biopsy data can predict the presence of cancer.
