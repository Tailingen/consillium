Continuous Alloreactive T Cell Depletion and Regulatory T Cell Expansion for the Treatment of Steroid-refractory or Dependent Chronic GVHD
Phase II multicenter, Canadian only study - open to 25 subjects. Study open to subjects with steroid-refractory or dependent chronic graft vs host disease.

Series of 6 aphereses and 28 re-infusions over 24 weeks. Primary endpoint is FFS at 24 weeks. Primary objective is to measure the efficacy of CARE (Continuous Alloreactive T-Cell depletion and Regulatory T-cell Expansion)
