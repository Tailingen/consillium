Ultrasound Acupuncture for Oxaliplatin-induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Colorectal Cancer Patients
The current study was conducted to examine the effect of ultrasound acupuncture for oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in colorectal cancer patients.

Pain level assessment, In comfortable siting position we asked them to give each item from the 10-items score from 0 to 10 according to the intensity of the symptom, 0 means that the symptom is absent and 10 means maximum intensity. Sum of scores is 100, a higher score is associated with increased pain, 2.5 months|Assessment of pain pressure threshold, Pain pressure threshold at hand and foot was measured by using a digital pressure algometer with a probe of 1 cm2 .PPT at feets was measured on the plantar foot surface over the second metatarsal. PPT at hands was measured on thenar eminence of the hand, 2.5 months
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, NCI CTC are set of medical terms very useful for the classification of adverse events related to cytotoxic drugs. These terms are not international codes for reporting adverse events to the Health Authorities. They are very frequently used in handling adverse events from oncology trials, 2.5 months
Oxaliplatin is platinum-based chemotherapy most usually used for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, this drug can produce a cumulative and dose-limiting distal sensory neuropathy affecting the majority of oxaliplatin-treated patients. Despite intense investigation at the preclinical and clinical levels, no treatment can be suggested for the prevention of OIPN. Since acupuncture has proven effective in alleviating the severity of peripheral nerve neuropathy, as has ultrasound.

This systematic review was conducted to test the ability of ultrasound acupuncture in decreasing neuropathy-related symptoms induced by oxaliplatin-based chemotherapies in colorectal cancer patients
