Building Engagement Using Financial Incentives Trial - Colorectal Cancer Screening
The goal of this pilot clinical trial is to determine feasibility and explore whether financial incentives paid to primary care patients for completing colorectal cancer screening increase completion of colorectal cancer screening. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Do patient financial incentives for completing colorectal cancer screening increase screening completion?
* Does a patient financial incentive for colorectal cancer screening offered alongside patient financial incentives for COVID-19 and flu shots increase completion of those shots?

Participants who are due for colorectal cancer screening will receive telephone outreach from primary care staff who will offer a stool-based colorectal cancer screening. Participants will be randomly assigned to either Group 1 or Group 2. Group 1 participants will be offered financial incentives for completing COVID-19 and flu shots within 2 months of enrollment. Group 2 participants will be offered financial incentives for completing a COVID-19 shot, a flu shot, and colorectal cancer screening within 2 months of enrollment.

Researchers will compare to see if completion of a COVID-19 shot, a flu shot, and colorectal cancer screening is different between the two groups.
