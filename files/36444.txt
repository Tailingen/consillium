To Assess the Effects of Single Dose of JMKX001899 on QTc Interval in Healthy Subjects
Study to assess the effect of JMKX001899 on QTc interval in healthy volunteers
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: JMKX001899|DRUG: JMKX001899|DRUG: JMKX001899|DRUG: Placebo
To evaluate the effect of a single dose of JMKX001899 on the change in time-matched QTc intervals compared with placebo, QTc interval was measured by electrocardiograms to evaluate the potential effect of JMKX001899 plasma concentrations on the QTc interval using linear mixed-effect exposure-response modeling, including the predicted ddQTc at Cmax values corresponding to exposure levels, 48 hours
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Single-Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics and the Effect on Cardiac Repolarization of JMKX001899 Administered as a Tablet Formulation Under Fed Conditions in Healthy Subjects
