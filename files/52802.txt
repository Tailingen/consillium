ALaCART-B: Acute Leukemia and Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T Cell Therapy for B-lymphoblastic Leukemia.
The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a immunophenotype-adapted approach using CAR T-cells in patients with high-risk, refractory or relapsed B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL).

Proportion of participant who are flow cytometry minimal residual disease (MRD) negative at the end of 1 month after CAR T-cell infusion., MRD levels will be determined by flow cytometry, The target sensitivity of flow MRD is \<0.01% when available., 30 days
Proportion of participant who are minimal residual disease (MRD) negative with molecular base assay at the end of 1 month after CAR T-cell infusion., MRD levels will be determined by molecular based MRD. PCR and oncogene fusion transcript (OFT)., 30 days|Proportion of patient who shows CAR T-cell persistence and presence of B-cell aplasia by immunophenotyping using flow cytometry in bone marrow, peripheral blood and CSF samples at multiple study time points following CAR T cell infusion, Flow cytometry will be performed on bone marrow, peripheral blood and CSF samples at multiple study time points following CAR T cell infusion, 1 month to 5 years
Patients will receive CART-cells with one or more specificities according to the phenotypic profile of the leukemic cells in each individual patient. This will allow targeting the entire leukemia cell population to induce deeper and more durable remissions. Although it would be possible to administer CART-cells targeting all possible antigens to all patients, this indiscriminate approach would increase the CAR T-cell dose and hence, the risk of toxicity in patients that could be effectively treated with a lower, less toxic, CAR T-cell dose. Moreover, the cost of the procedure increases proportionally with the number of CAR T-cells used, limiting our capacity to enrol other patients. Reducing the number of CART-cells below the dose that we set, will inevitably increase the risk of treatment failure, according to the literature and our own experience.
