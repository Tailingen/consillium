AMG 386 (Trebananib) in Ovarian Cancer (TRINOVA-2)
To determine if AMG 386 plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is superior to placebo plus PLD as measured by progression-free survival (PFS)

The hypothesis for this study is that AMG 386 plus PLD will prolong PFS compared to placebo plus PLD in women with recurrent partially platinum sensitive or resistant epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

DRUG: AMG386 plus PLD|DRUG: Placebo plus PLD
To determine if AMG 386 plus PLD is superior to placebo plus PLD as measured by progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to the earliest of the dates of first radiologic disease progression per RECIST 1.1 with modifications, Radiological imaging will be performed 8 weeks ± 1 week, starting from date of randomization for the first 64 weeks, then every 16 weeks ± 1 week for the next 32 weeks, and then every 24 weeks ± 4 weeks thereafter.
