OTHER: No intervention conducts.
The number of occurrences of pre-determined expected adverse events and complications, The number of occurrences of pre-determined expected adverse reactions and complications will be compared between the experimental group and the control group., From the day of operation of breast reconstruction to 12 months
Subjects' self-assessment of satisfaction with physical and psychological well-being using the BREAST-Q survey, Subjects will complete the BREAST-Q survey before and after breast reconstruction surgery, which includes multiple questions on a scale from 1 to 5, where a higher score represents greater satisfaction.

The answer would be selected the scale from 1 (Very Dissatisfied) to 4 (Very Satisfied).

The total number of study subjects is 100, with 50 people recruited prospectively into the test group and 50 people retrospectively into the control group.

The test group will consist of 50 patients aged 20 to 80 who have undergone total mastectomy for breast cancer and are scheduled to undergo immediate breast reconstruction using implants. These subjects will receive SC Derm (ADM processed by DOF Inc.) during the implant-based breast reconstruction surgery.

The control group will consist of 50 patients who will be retrospectively and consecutively selected from medical records of patients who underwent implant breast reconstruction using ADM from other companies between June 1, 2021, and November 9, 2021.
