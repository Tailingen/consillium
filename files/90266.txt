Study of Azacitidine and Durvalumab in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 2 study of investigational drug, durvalumab given in combination with azacitidine (CC-486). The main purpose of this phase 2 study is to assess the antitumor activity of azacitidine in combination with durvalumab patients with microsatellite stable colorectal carcinoma (MSS-CRC), platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer type II (PR-OC), and estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer.
