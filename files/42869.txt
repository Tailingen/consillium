A Safety Study Assessing the Effects of Receiving Genome Sequencing Results
This study uses new methods called "genome sequencing" that allow the investigators to study part or all of a person's genome. The genome is the collection of all of a person's genes. Genes carry the instructions that our bodies need to develop and function. Genes are passed on from one generation to the next. Genome sequencing can study all of a person's genome (whole genome sequencing) or just parts of their genome (whole exome sequencing). In the study, the investigators refer to all these research methods as 'genome sequencing'. Genome sequencing typically shows a large number of gene changes, known as "variants." Some (but not all) of these genetic variants may be linked to increased risks of diseases other than cancer.

The purpose of this study is to learn what kinds of genetic variants the patient wants to learn about from their genome.
History of Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: qualitative interviews
Psychological distress, of receiving incidentally identified disease risk results from whole genome/exome sequencing. Safety is defined as no more than 20% of participants experiencing clinically meaningful levels of distress at 1 week follow-up, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety \& Depression Scale (HADS; score \> or = to 8 on the anxiety sub-scale). Patients will be considered evaluable for the primary outcome if they are not distressed at baseline and have completed the 1 week follow-up assessment., 2 years
