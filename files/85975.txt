B7-H3 Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells (B7-H3CART) in Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme
This is an open label, non-randomized, single site Phase I study to test the manufacturing feasibility and safety of locoregional (LR) administration of B7-H3CART into the central nervous system of adult subjects with recurrent IDH wild-type GBM using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design.
Brain and Nervous System
DRUG: B7-H3CART
Number of successful manufacturing product (B7-H3CART) that met minimum assigned dose level range, Defined by the frequency of successful manufacturing runs of B7-H3CART that meet the established IND release criteria for the targeted dose level., 5 years|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) or Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), Defined by the frequency of subjects experiencing dose limiting toxicity (DLT) after initial infusion, 5 years
Cumulative Safety of B7-H3CART, At each dose level, incidence and severity of DLT, adverse events and serious adverse events after initial and subsequent infusions of LR B7-H3CART infusion. The definition of DLT in these studies uses NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv5.0), 5 years|Immunotherapy Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology (iRANO) in subjects with recurrent IDH wild-type GBM, iRano response criteria will be measured by complete response, partial response, minor response, stable disease, progressive disease,, 5 years|Time to progression (TTP), the time from the start (surgical resection) to the date of radiographic progression (death is censored), 5 years|Median overall survival (OS), time from the date of initial disease diagnosis to the date of death from any cause, 5 years|Percentage of subjects able to receive at least three (3) doses of B7-H3CART, 5 years
