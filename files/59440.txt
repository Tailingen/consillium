Stereotactic Radiation and Immunotherapy in Patients With Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer
This is a multi-centre, open label, phase 2, randomised controlled trial of patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have received no more than one line of chemotherapy (not including neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy) who will be randomised to be treated with SABR 20Gy in 1# followed by atezolizumab or SABR 24Gy in 3# followed by atezolizumab.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: SABR|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Progression Free Survival, To assess the progression free survival of SABR at a dose of 24Gy in 3# followed by atezolizumab and SABR at a dose of 20Gy in 1# followed by atezolizumab in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)., 24 months
Best Objective Response (BOR) between different SABR regimens + atezolizumab, Best objective response (BOR) rate: confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per RECIST 1.1, 24 months|Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events (safety and tolerability), Toxicities will be assessed using NCI-CTCAE version 4.03. Tolerability is defined as the time until ceasing treatment due to toxicity., 24 months|Progression Free Survival Comparison between different SABR regimens + atezolizumab, To compare the progression free survival between arms, 24 Months|Duration of Response (DOR) between different SABR regimens + atezolizumab, Duration of response (DoR), defined as time from first occurrence of documented response to disease progression or death in participants who achieve a PR or better as per RECIST 1.1., 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) between different SABR regimens + atezolizumab, Disease control (DC), defined as achieving a CR, PR or have had stable disease (SD) for at least 21 weeks prior to any evidence of disease progression, based on RECIST 1.1, 24 months|Time to Treatment Failure between different SABR regimens + atezolizumab, Time to treatment failure (TTF) defined as the time from randomization until cessation of atezolizumab for any reason including disease progression, treatment toxicity, participant preference or death., 24 months|Overall Survival between different SABR regimens + atezolizumab, Overall survival, defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause, 24 months
