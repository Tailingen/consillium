A Multicentre Trial of Nerve-Spring Radical Hysterectomy vs. Radical Hysterectomy for Cervical Cancer
The investigators designed this multicentre randomized study to investigate the clinical benefits of nerve-spring radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer. Patients with FIGO stage Ia2, Ib1, IIa1 and FIGO stage Ib2, IIa2 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are randomized to either nerve-spring radical hysterectomy or radical hysterectomy. The primary endpoint are urodynamic outcome including maximum flow rate, residual volume, maximum vesical compliace, cystomctric capacity at first desire, and maximum cystomctric capacity. A total 240 patients (120 per treatment arm) are planned to accrue for this study within 7 years.
