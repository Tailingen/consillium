Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Metaplastic Carcinoma of Triple Negative Breast Cancer
prospective study for response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in metaplastic carcinoma of triple negative breast cancer
Metaplastic Breast Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Vimentin/pan CK stain
response rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, response criteria for neoadjuvant chemotherapy-complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and no response (NR), After neoadjuvant chemotherapy was finished. Average 6 month later.
Vimentin/Pan CK staining will be performed on tissues of patient who visited Seoul National University Hospital and were diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer and decided to perform neoadjuvant chemotherapy under clinical judgement.

Histologically determined to be a metaplastic breast cancer or tested positive for vimentin/Pan CK patients decides as the metaplastic breast cancer. They evaluate the response rate of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Patients with vimentin/Pan CK negative are diagnosed with non-metaplastic breast cancer and this group also confirms the response rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

The group of metaplastic breast cancer will enroll 50 people, and the group of non-metaplastic breast cancer will enroll 100 people.
