Effect of an Antioxidant on Cancer-Cachectic Patients Undergoing Exercise Training
The purpose of the study is to tests the hypothesis, that N-acetylcysteine (a thiol-antioxidant)improves the exercise training effect on cancer patients that experience weight loss (cachexia) as assessed by muscle mass and function as well as histomorphology.
