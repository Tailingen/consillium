Localising Occult Prostate Cancer Metastases With Advanced Imaging TEchniques
The investigator prospectively compare diagnostic concordance of whole body multi---parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with current conventional multi---modality reference standard imaging (CT scan, isotope bone scan +/--- PET---CT scan) for staging of prostate cancer patients with biochemical relapse following external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy of locally advanced prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: Whole body MRI
The investigator will measure and analyse sensitivity and specificity of WB-MRI compared to conventional multi-modality imaging for detection of regional lymph node distant metastasis.T, 3 years
Interobserver agreement for WB-MRI: Per-site and per-nodal staging assessment will be done by two radiologists separately and then in consensus. Kappa agreement statistic will be tested for the level of agreement for per-site and per-patient assessments., 3 years|The investigator will investigate whether there would be any significant correlation between MRI quantitative parameters and the response following treatment., 3 years|The investigator will evaluate using blood test differences between two groups, The investigator will evaluate using blood test, differences between Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor analysis in patients with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer and non-metastatic patient to explore any significant differences between two groups, 3 years|The investigator will asses the Cost-effectiveness by comparing the direct and indirect costs of multi-modality imaging path versus WB-MRI path, 3 years|The investagator will measure sensitivity and specificity of WB-MRI compared to choline PET-CT for detection of regional lymph node distant metastasis. Analysis of sensitivity and specificity will be investigated on per-site basis and per-patient basis, 3 years
The investigators have developed and assessed the feasibility of performing whole---body multi---parametric MRI for staging metastatic disease. The investigators hypothesize that a whole body multi---parametric MRI will be more sensitive and specific than conventional imaging staging for detection of metastatic disease in patients with biochemical failure following local therapies. Investigators therefore propose a comparative trial of conventional imaging verses whole---body multi---parametric MRI within this population of men. The investigators would further like to explore whether heterogeneity between metastases of multi---parametric MRI signals can predict men unlikely to respond to ADT. The investigators aim to enhance the main study by exploratory work on exosome, pathway and genomic analysis, the results of which could lead to complimentary imaging / non---imaging biomarker combinations of clinical utility for patient stratification. Finally the investigators will perform a health economic analysis to assess the cost---effectiveness of whole---body multi---parametric MRI for metastatic disease staging compared with conventional staging with computed tomography and bone---scans.
