Prospective Clinical Trial Evaluating Metronomic Chemotherapy in Patients With High-grade, Operable, Non-metastatic Osteosarcoma of the Extremity
Preclinical models show that a daily antiangiogenic regimen at low-dose may be effective against chemotherapy-resistant tumors. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with continuous oral cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in patients with high grade, operable, non-metastatic osteosarcoma (OST) of the extremities. The primary end point is event-free survival (EFS) from randomization.
High Grade Osteosarcoma
DRUG: continuous oral cyclophosphamide and methotrexate
Event-Free Survival, AT 5 YEARS, EFS AT 5 YEARS
Overall survival, AT 5 YEARS, OS AT 5 YEARS
The study design includes a backbone of 10 weeks of preoperative therapy using MAP (High-dose methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin). Following surgery, non-metastatic patients were randomized by blocks to complete 31 weeks of MAP or to receive 73 weeks of maintenance therapy following MAP; while metastatic patients received maintenance therapy in combination with MAP since the beginning of treatment.
