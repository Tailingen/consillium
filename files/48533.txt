Project PREVAM : Prospective Comparison of Capsule Endoscopy Pillcam II™ Versus Colonoscopy
The aim of the study is to perform a prospective, multicenter research comparing capsule endoscopy with the video colonoscopy in the detection of the adenomatous polyps and cancer specifically in a high risk population (sensibility, specificity, NPV, PPV and diagnostic accuracy). The investigators will used the Pillcam II™ colon capsule (second generation) and a high resolution colonoscope (with high definition). Both procedures will be perform in the same day with an adapted bowel preparation.
Adenomatous Polyps|Cancer
DEVICE: Comparison of capsule endoscopy Pillcam II™ versus colonoscopy
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, The investigators want to know if the capsule endoscopie is more or less effective than colonoscopy to detect lesion or abdominal cancer., 7 days
Pain Scores on the Visual Analog Scale, Presence of at least one polyp at capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy with both operators unaware of each other's findings until completion of the procedures.

Comparison of the different class of size for all polyps Comparison of Kudo and Paris classification of the polyps at endoscopy capsule and colonoscopy Tolerance, pain and discomfort between the both procedure Acceptability of both procedure at day 1 and day 7 Accuracy of the localization of the polyp or the lesion at the capsule endosocpy comparated with the colonoscopy topography (Gold standard)., 7 days
