Evaluation of Cryoprotection Induced Nail Toxicity Docetaxel Low Cumulative Dose
For the specific patient population studied receiving 5-Fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide - Docetaxel sequence (cumulative dose \<300 mg / m2), using a cryoprotection has never been assessed.

The effectiveness of cryoprotection of onycholysis secondary to Docetaxel is not well established in this population (breast cancer in the adjuvant setting) and is based solely on a publication (Scotté) that does not contain the same therapeutic modalities (dose significantly higher). The few studies available have heterogeneous populations, nonrandomized, retrospective or with a small sample.

By extension to what has been observed with higher cumulative doses of docetaxel, some teams offer mittens and booties chilled to their patients, a practice that is not the subject of a national consensus.

The investigators wish to accurately assess the effectiveness of mittens and slippers chilled, their tolerance and their observance because of weak data on this specific population in the literature.
