Detection of KRAS, NRAS et BRAF Mutations in Plasma Circulating DNA From Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
RAS genotyping is mandatory for the prescription of anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The standard genotyping is assessed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumour tissue. This study compares RAS and BRAF genotyping results achieved in analyzing circulating plasma DNA using OncoBEAMâ„¢ technique with those achieved using the standard genotyping techniques and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded samples.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
GENETIC: KRAS, NRAS et BRAF mutation analysis from circulating plasma DNA
KRAS, NRAS et BRAF mutational status, Compare the results of KRAS (exons 2, 3 et 4), NRAS (exons 2, 3 et 4) and BRAF (V600) genes genotyping using OncoBeam technique in blood samples with results achieved routinely by the molecular genetics platforms of the recruiting centers., up to 6 months
The study will be proposed to all patients with a metastatic colorectal cancer.

Study information will be given to the patient during a routine medical examination. The patient will be included after checking inclusion criteria and signature of the informed consent form

Blood sampling (30 ml) will be performed before the initiation of the first line metastatic chemotherapy.
