A Multi-centre 3-arm Randomised Phase II Trial of BIBF 1120 Versus BIBW 2992 Versus Sequential Administration of BIBF 1120 and BIBW 2992 in Patients With Hormone-resistant Prostate Cancer
The primary objective of this trial is to estimate and compare the 12-week progression-free rate of BIBF 1120, BIBW 2992 or sequential administration of BIBF 1120 and BIBW 2992 in patients with HRPC as determined by radiographic, bone and PSA criteria.

Progression Free Rate (PFR) at 12 Weeks, PFR is defined as a composite endpoint for disease progression.

If patients met one of the following criteria they were counted as having progressive disease (PD):

* Prostate serum antigen (PSA) progression according to Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criteria
* Bone metastasis progression- development of new lesions on bone scan or development of disease-related skeletal related events (SREs)
* Disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.0, 12 weeks
Progression Free Rate at 24 and 48 Weeks, PFR is defined as a composite endpoint for disease progression.

If patients met one of the following criteria they were counted as having progressive disease (PD):

* Prostate serum antigen (PSA) progression according to Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) criteria
* Bone metastasis progression- development of new lesions on bone scan or development of disease-related skeletal related events (SREs)
* Disease progression according to RECIST version 1.0, 24 weeks and 48 weeks|Number of Patients Showing Prostate Serum Antigen (PSA) Response, PSA response was evaluated according to the PSAWG guidelines. All patients achieving a fall in PSA of ≥50% from baseline (confirmed with a second value at least 4 weeks later) fulfilled the criteria for PSA response. The confirmatory value had to be at least 50% lower than the baseline value, but could be higher than the original drop in PSA (first PSA value).

However, the confirmatory value could not be 50% higher than the first PSA value. If it was ≥50% higher than the first PSA, another sample was taken to determine if response had been achieved., End of trial visit, 29 ± 1 days after Day 1 of the last treatment cycle (Up to 48 weeks)|Duration of PSA Response, Duration of PSA response was calculated from the time of first 50% decline in PSA (compared to baseline) until the time at which there was an increase of 50% from the PSA nadir, provided that the absolute increase was at least 5 ng/mL. The increase had to be confirmed by a second consecutive measurement that was at least 50% above the nadir. If the PSA never showed a 50% increase over the nadir value, then the patient was censored at the last PSA measurement.

Duration of PSA response expressed in median number of days., End of trial visit, 29 ± 1 days after Day 1 of the last treatment cycle (Up to 48 weeks)|Time to PSA Progression, Time to PSA progression through 48 weeks was calculated as the number of days from first administration of study drug to the first time that there was an increase of 50% from the PSA nadir, provided the absolute increase was at least 5 ng/mL.

Time is expressed in median number of days., Start of treatment until end of treatment (Up to 48 weeks)|RECIST Tumour Progression Rate at 12, 24, 36, and 48 Weeks, RECIST (version 1.0) tumour progression rate at 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks was calculated based on the occurrence of new lesions, or an increase in the sum of the longest lesion diameters of at least 20%., 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks|Overall Objective Response by RECIST Criteria (Version 1.0) (Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) for Patients With Measurable Disease at 12, 24, 36 and 48 Weeks, Objective response is defined as a Complete or Partial response Complete response \[CR\] for Target lesions: Disappearance of all target lesions. Complete response \[CR\] for Non- target lesions: Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumour marker level Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD., 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks|Duration of RECIST Response, Time from first observation of response (PR, CR, confirmed or unconfirmed) until progression according to RECIST (version 1.0) or death.

Duration is expressed in Median number of days., Up to 48 weeks|Time to Progression, Time from first administration of study drug until disease progression according to composite endpoint.

Time is expressed in Median number of days., start of treatment until end of the treatment (Up to 48 weeks)|Overall Survival (Time to Death), Overall survival (time to death) was calculated in days from baseline to the date of reporting of death. Time is expressed in Median number of days., start of treatment until 28 days after end of treatment (Up to 52 weeks)|Incidence and Worst Intensity of Adverse Events With Grading According CTCAE, Incidence and worst intensity of Adverse Events with grading according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 3.0)., from first intake of treatment until 29 days after last intake of treatment (Up to 52 weeks)|Changes in Safety Laboratory Parameters, Changes in safety laboratory Parameters reported as adverse events, from first intake of treatment until 29 days after last intake of treatment (Up to 52 weeks)|Trough Plasma Concentrations for BIBF 1120 and BIBW 2992 for the Monotherapy, Trough plasma concentrations are defined either as pre-dose concentration of BIBF 1120 and BIBW 2992 in plasma at steady state immediately before administration of the next dose for the monotherapy treatment or as post dose concentrations taken after the dosing interval for the combination treatment, Day 15, Day 29 and Day 57|Trough Plasma Concentrations for BIBF 1120 and BIBW 2992 for the Combination Therapy, Trough plasma concentrations are defined either as pre-dose concentration of BIBF 1120 and BIBW 2992 in plasma at steady state immediately before administration of the next dose for the monotherapy treatment or as post dose concentrations taken after the dosing interval for the combination treatment (C12,14 for BIBF1120 ; C24,7 and C24,14 for BIBW2992)

The primary objective of this trial is to estimate and compare the 12-week progression-free rate of BIBF 1120, BIBW 2992 or sequential administration of BIBF 1120 and BIBW 2992 in patients with HRPC as determined by radiographic, bone and PSA criteria.
