Tracer-Guided Surgery for Recurrent Prostate Cancer
ADT with or without robot-assisted PSMA-radioguided surgery for patients with recurrent prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: PSMA-radioguided surgery|DRUG: ADT
Clinical progression-free survival (CPFS), CPFS is defined as time between randomization and the appearance of a recurrence (any N1 or M1) as suggested by PSMA PET/CT or symptoms related to progressive PC, or death due to any cause, 24 months
Metastasis-free survival (MFS), Metastasis-free survival will be defined as the time between randomization and the appearance of a metastatic recurrence (any M1) as suggested by PSMA PET-CT., 24 months|Biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS), Biochemical progression-free survival will be defined as the time between randomization and the development of biochemical progression ( three consecutive rises in prostate specific antigen (PSA) 1 week apart, resulting in two 50% increases over the nadir and PSA\>2 ng/ml), 24 months|Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), CRPC is defined as castrate serum testosterone\<50 ng/dl plus biochemical progression, i.e., three consecutive rises in PSA 1 week apart, resulting in two 50% increases over the nadir and PSA\>2 ng/ml., 10 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival will be read as the time from trial randomization to the date of death from any cause, 10 years|Incidence of adjuvant therapy, ADT, radiation therapy or additional salvage surgery, 10 years|Patient reported QOL as per EORTC-QLQ C30, Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed with the EORTC Core Quality of Life questionnaire's (QLQ-C30) global QoL scale ranging from 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better QoL, 24 months|Patient reported QOL as per Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite (EPIC) 26, Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed with the EPIC 26 questionnaire, containing 26 items covering 5 domains: Urinary Incontinence, Urinary Irritative/Obstructive, Bowel, Sexual, and Hormonal. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better QOL., 24 months|Complications, Assessment of 99mTc-PSMA-I\&S injection-related as well as surgery-related complication rate according to Clavien-Dindo., 30 and 90 days|Number of in-field recurrences, Recurrence measured by use of PSMA PET/CT in the template of 99mTc-PSMA-radioguided surgery (RGS) supported salvage surgery, 24 months|Specificity of 99mTc-PSMA RGS for salvage surgery for recurrent PC compared to histologic evaluation, In percentage, 30 days|Sensitivity of 99mTc-PSMA RGS for salvage surgery for recurrent PC compared to histologic evaluation, In percentage, 30 days|Positive Predictive Value of 99mTc-PSMA RGS for salvage surgery for recurrent PC compared to histologic evaluation, In percentage, 30 days|Negative Predictive Value of 99mTc-PSMA RGS for salvage surgery for recurrent PC compared to histologic evaluation, In percentage, 30 days
Improving the oncological treatment outcomes in men with a biochemical recurrence after primary prostate cancer (PC) treatment that are diagnosed with a disease recurrence confined to the regional lymph nodes or local residual disease using Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT.)

The proposed trial randomizes patients with recurrent PC following primary PC treatment to either 6 months of ADT or Technetium-PSMA-radioguided salvage surgery plus 6 months of ADT. Although the optimal duration of ADT is unknown, a minimal duration of 6 months of ADT seems advisable in this setting and will be mandatory for both arms.
