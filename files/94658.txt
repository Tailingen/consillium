The Effect Of Meditation On Quality Of Life In Women With Breast Cancer And Other Gynecological Cancers
Women with breast cancer and other gynecologic cancers often suffer significant distress and disability from their disease. A practice of meditation-based stress reduction and cognitive-affective-behavioral learning may help women with these conditions decrease their suffering and improve their quality of life.

BEHAVIORAL: Mindfulness based meditation program
Quality of life will be assessed by within patient differences in the FACT-G (General Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment Scale), as well as with the disease specific subscales at baseline and at 12 months., Subjects will complete questionnaires at baseline and closeout. Patients will participate in the meditation program weekly for 20 weeks.
The objective of this project in women recently treated for breast or other gynecologic cancer is to determine whether an intervention program consisting of group and individual instruction in a meditation-based practice of stress-reduction and cognitive-affective-behavioral learning has the potential for reducing disabling distress and improving quality of life in a population vulnerable to the progression or recurrence of disease. Quality of life will be assessed at 12 months.
