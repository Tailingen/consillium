Developing a Symptom List for Children With Cancer
Primary Objective

The aim of this research study is to develop a comprehensive inventory of symptoms that occur in children with advanced cancer who are receiving a specialist palliative care service.

Secondary Objectives

* To assess correlation between parent, child and nurse scores on the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS).
* To identify symptom prevalence in children with advanced cancer as identified by the child/young person (CYP), nurse and parent (to be analysed separately for parent, child and nurse).
* To identify whether there are any symptoms missing from the age appropriate MSAS as identified by the CYP, nurse and parent (to be analysed separately for parent, child and nurse).
* To identify whether any items on the age appropriate MSAS are not relevant to the population being studied (to be analysed separately for parent, child and nurse).
* To identify which symptoms cause the most distress as identified by the CYP, nurse and parent (to be analysed separately for parent, child and nurse).
* To identify degree of severity of each symptom as identified by the CYP, nurse and parent (to be analysed separately for parent, child and nurse).
* To identify which symptoms occur most frequently as identified by the CYP, nurse and parent (to be analysed separately for parent, child and nurse).
* To assess the trends between phase of illness and symptom profile, severity and distress.
