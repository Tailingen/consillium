Annexin A2 as a Novel Diagnostic Marker in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study aimed to investigate the clinical utility of Annexin A2 serum level as a novel diagnostic marker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to correlate its level with alpha fetoprotein the current marker ofhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
PROCEDURE: blood sample
serum Annexin A2 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic liver disease and healthy subjects, to determine the clinical utility of Annexin A2 serum level as a novel diagnostic marker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to correlate its level with alpha fetoprotein the current marker of (HCC)., 1 month
This study was carried out in HCC clinic , Ain Shams University Hospitals, Cairo; Egypt and included :Group 1: Fifty patients with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma(BCLC stage A); Group 2:Twenty five patients with chronic liver disease diagnosed based on clinical, laboratory, and ultrasonographic investigations; Control Group: Fifteen healthy, age and sex-matched subjects with seronegative hepatitis viral markers .All groups were subjected to thorough history taking, full clinical examination, and laboratory investigations including viral hepatitis markers: HBsAg and HCV antibodies using ELISA technique and HCV RNA using real time PCR for HCV antibody positive patients, AFP by electrochemiluminescence and Annexin A2 estimation using ELISA technique.
