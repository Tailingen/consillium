Dose Escalation Trial of Nitroglycerin, 5-flourouracil and Rad Therapy for Rectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether topical nitroglycerin in addition to 5-flourouracil and radiation therapy are effective in the treatment of operable rectal cancer.
Rectal Cancer
DRUG: Nitroglycerin 0.2 MG/HR|DRUG: Nitroglycerin 0.4 MG/HR|DRUG: Nitroglycerin 0.6 MG/HR
The Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), DLT was defined as greater or equal to two instances of grade 3 toxicity, or a single event of grade 4-5 toxicity deemed probably or definitely related to the addition of transdermal neoadjuvant chemoradiation to the standard neoadjuvant chemoradiation, Up to 4-6 weeks for each dosing cohort
Number of Participants With a Pathological Complete Response (pCR), pathological complete response (pCR) at time of surgery following the completion of neoadjuvant therapy. This will be compared to the institutional historical pCR rate.

Pathologic complete response indicates a complete absence of cancer at the time of surgical resection., Time of surgery (~ 6-9 wks) following the completion of neoadjuvant therapy
This is an open label, non-randomized, multi-cohort, dose escalation trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, feasibility and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topical nitroglycerin in addition to 5-flourouracil and radiation therapy for neo-adjuvant treatment of, T3-T4 or clinically node positive, operable rectal cancer.

Patients that would otherwise be eligible for concurrent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with continuous infusion 5-FU, for locally advanced operable rectal cancer, will be assigned to 4 sequential cohorts of 3 different dose levels of nitro glycerin patches (0.2; 0.4; and 0.6 mg/hr). Each cohort will consist of 3 patients. All patients will receive radiation therapy, 45-50 Gy in 25-28 fractions to the pelvis along with continuous infusion 5-FU 225mg/M2 for the duration of the radiation therapy. The radiation therapy will be planned and delivered as per institutional standard of care for the Dallas VAMC radiation oncology department.
