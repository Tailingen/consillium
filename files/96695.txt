Telerehabilitation in Hemato-oncological Survivors
This study investigates whether the 12-week home-based exercise training with remote guidance and telemonitoring compared to regular center-based training leads to better long-term cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity levels in post-treatment patients with lymphoma.
Hematologic Malignancy|Lymphoma
DEVICE: Home-based training|DEVICE: Center-based training
Cardiorespiratory fitness, Peak oxygen uptake during cardiopulmonary exercise test, Change from baseline to 12 weeks and 52 weeks
Health-related quality of life, Health-related quality of life (SF-36 Form) yields a score for each domain of health. All domains are scored on a scale from 0 (negative health) to 100 (positive health), with 100 representing the best possible health state, Change from baseline to 12 weeks and 52 weeks|Satisfaction - self-completed questionnaire, Subjects will be provided with a 5-item self-completed questionnaire developed by our research team that will measure their satisfaction with the intervention they received and the study in general. The items will be presented in the form of statements to which subjects will be asked to respond using a 1-5 Likert scale ("strongly agree", "agree", "not sure", "disagree", and strongly disagree")., 12 weeks and 52 weeks|Body water, Total body water in liters will be measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis., Change from baseline to 12 weeks and 52 weeks|Muscle mass, Total muscle mass in kilograms will be measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis., Change from baseline to 12 weeks and 52 weeks|Body fat percentage, Body fat percentage will be measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis., Change from baseline to 12 weeks and 52 weeks|Incidence of exercise adverse events assessed by 5 grade scale, Participants will be encouraged to use the contact details for reporting incidence of exercise adverse events at any time throughout the study period. The type, incidence, and severity of adverse events by scale (Grade 1: Mild, asymptomatic or mild symptoms; Grade 2: Moderate, minimal; Grade 3: Severe or medically significant; Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; and Grade 5: Death) will be noted., Data will be recorded continuously from the intervention's baseline for 12 weeks and then for 52 weeks|Training adherence (Number of compliant participants), Evaluation of the total number of compliant participants (The criterium of compliance with the rehabilitation program is set at 70% of the prescribed training lessons, 100% = 36 lessons), 12 weeks|Maximum Grip Strength, Maximum grip strength during dynamometer evaluation, Change from baseline to 12 weeks and 52 weeks
80 lymphoma cancer patients post-treatment (except adjuvant treatment) will be enrolled in the study. Cardiorespiratory fitness (peak oxygen consumption), adverse events, body composition, quality of life, costs and adherence to exercise prescription will be evaluated at baseline, 12-week, and year after enrollment.

Investigators assume that home-based training with remote guidance and telemonitoring with objective training data obtained during rehabilitation after cancer treatment will improve long-term motivation and effectiveness of independent training in cancer survivors, resulting in superior cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity levels.
