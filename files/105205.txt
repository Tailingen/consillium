A Study of TSN1611 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring KRAS G12D Mutation
The study is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, multi-center phase 1/2 study of TSN1611 in subjects with KRAS G12D mutant advanced solid tumors. This study will consist of a phase 1 dose escalation part and phase 2 dose expansion part.

Adverse events, To assess the safety profile and tolerability of TSN1611 as monotherapy in subjects with KRAS G12D mutant advanced solid tumors., Up to 3 years|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of TSN1611., 9 weeks|Maximum blood concentrations (Cmax), To characterize the PK profile of TSN1611., 9 weeks|Time to maximum blood concentration (Tmax), To characterize the PK profile of TSN1611., 9 weeks|Duration of response (DOR), To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of TSN1611 using RECIST version 1.1., Up to 3 years|Time to response (TTR), To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of TSN1611 using RECIST version 1.1., Up to 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of TSN1611 using RECIST version 1.1., Up to 3 years|Progression free survival (PFS), To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of TSN1611 using RECIST version 1.1., Up to 3 years|Overall survival, Up to 3 years
Phase 1 Part:

The phase 1 part will evaluate the prespecified dose levels of TSN1611. Dose escalation will continue until up to the highest planned dose or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. Dose optimization could be performed as indicated by the emerging data.

Phase 2 Part:

Phase 2 part will evaluate the efficacy and safety of TSN1611 as monotherapy at the recommended dose in separate groups of patients with pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or other solid tumors, harboring KRAS G12D mutations.
