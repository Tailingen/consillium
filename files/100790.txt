Unravelling Tumour Biology In Ovarian Cancer With Precision Imaging
The objective of this study is to explore the integration of in vivo and ex vivo of MRI with histology and molecular assessments to advance non-invasive characterization of tumor heterogeneity in high-grade serous ovarian cance
High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Blood sample and tissue sample
the integration of in vivo and ex vivo of MRI with histology and molecular assessments to advance non-invasive characterization of tumor heterogeneity in high-grade serous ovarian cancer., The diagnostic performance of the radiomic and multiomic algorithm for the characterization of heterogeneity in the CSOHG., one shoot at the surgery
the imaging phenotype of tumor heterogeneity with a multi-scale radiomic approach by obtaining the image mirror tumor at the in vivo scale, Correlation between radiomic maps and pathogenic maps of heterogeneity,, one shoot at the surgery|tumor heterogeneity based on phenotypic imaging supported by AI reflects and can predict sub-histologyunderlying by tumor stroma proportion and tumor density infiltrating lymphocytes and genomics through HRD, Correlation between radiomic algorithms and i/underlying histology and ii/ genomics, one shoot at the surgery|the heterogeneity of the tumor biology of CSOHG through non-invasive habitat imaging combined with an integrated Multi-O-Mics approach., Correlation between radiomic maps and tumor biology (CYTOF, proteomics and transcriptomics),, one shoot at the surgery|To Correlate MRI results with hematological molecular biology results., Correlation between radiomic algorithms for tumor detection and cDNA determination., one shoot at the surgery
After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patient giving wirtting informed consent.

During surgery, tissue and blood samples will be conserved for the study. In this study will be compared images obtained in vivo before surgical management, ex vivo images obtained on excised tissues during surgery, histological data obtained during surgery.
