Circulating Tumor DNA Methylation Test to Differentiate Benign and Malignant Pulmonary Nodules
Current state-of-the-art lung cancer early screening utilizes low-dose CT scan to identify lung nodules smaller than 3 cm in diameter. However, it's still a clinical challenge to differentiate between malignant and benign nodules.

In previous studies, the investigators had taken the approach of methylation profiling by high throughput bisulfite DNA sequencing in tissue samples to identify specific methylation signatures. The investigators had learned methylation patterns that differentiate malignant vs. benign lesions from tissue samples by in-depth data mining, and then used pattern matching to classify plasma samples.

In this study, the investigators are going to validate the efficacy of ctDNA methylation test for diagnosing early lung cancer by comparing results of the pre-surgery ctDNA methylation test with the post-surgery pathology.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Circulating Tumor DNA Methylation Test
The diagnostic performance of the blood-based assay for differentiating benign and malignant pulmonary nodules early using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation analysis by next-generation sequencing (NGS), The efficacy of the blood-based ctDNA methylation assay comparing with pathologic diagnosis, the gold standard, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV)., 1 year
This is a prospective, multi-center, observational cohort study and seeks to enroll 1230 participants with pulmonary nodules 5-30mm in diameter.

The assay analyzes the ctDNA methylation profiles of lung cancer-specific biomarkers non-invasively using whole blood specimens collected before invasive surgery.

The performance characteristics(sensitivity and specificity) of the pre-surgery ctDNA methylation test for detection of early lung cancer is evaluated in comparison to post-surgery pathology.
