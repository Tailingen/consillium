A Study Of The Pharmacokinetics And Safety Of Ipatasertib In Chinese Participants With Locally Advanced Or Metastatic Solid Tumors.
A Phase I, Open-Label study designed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of ipatasertib in Chinese participants. Approximately 20 Chinese participants (12 PK-evaluable participants) with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for whom standard therapy either does not exist or has proven ineffective will be enrolled to provide sufficient data. Participants will receive a 400-mg ipatasertib dose (two 200-mg tablets) daily orally (PO). Participants deriving clinical benefit may be offered continued treatment with ipatasertib until disease progression, at the discretion of the investigator (as assessed by the investigator) or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor.
