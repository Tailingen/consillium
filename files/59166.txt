Therapeutic Effect and Safety Study of Decitabine in Elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients
The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and the therapeutic effect of Decitabine in the treatment of elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients.

The outcome of the elderly AML patients is very poor. No obvious progress was achieved in this field. Decitabine is a kind of specific DNA methylation shift enzyme inhibitor. It can reverse the DNA methylation and induce the differentiation and apoptosis of the tumor cells. Recent studies about decitabine in the treatment for elderly AML patients had achieved inspiring results and indicated that low dose decitabine maybe a good choice for elderly AML patients. So in this research the investigators plan to evaluate the safety and the therapeutic effect of decitabine in the treatment of elderly AML patients.
