Trial of Sirolimus and Methotrexate in Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Lymphoma
This is a phase 2 study looking at efficacy and toxicity of oral sirolimus in combination with oral methotrexate in children with refractory/relapsed ALL or NHL.

Secondary objectives include characterizing the trough levels produced by administration of oral sirolimus in children with refractory/relapsed ALL/NHL and to evaluate the effect of sirolimus on intracellular targets related to mTOR inhibition.

DRUG: Sirolimus and Methotrexate
Response Rate, Number of participants who achieve a Complete Response (CR), Complete Response with in the absence of total platelet recovery (CRp), or Partial Response (PR). Per response criteria in this protocol: Complete Response (CR) - M1 bone marrow (\<5% blasts) with no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and recovery of peripheral blood counts (absolute neutrophil count (ANC)\> 500/μL and platelets \> 50,000/ μL); Complete Response in the absence of total platelet recovery (CRp) - M1 bone marrow (\<5% blasts) with no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease with recovery of peripheral blood counts except for platelets (ANC\> 500/μL, platelets \< 50,000uL); and Partial Response (PR) - M2 bone marrow (5% but \<25% blasts), with no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and normalization of peripheral blood counts (ANC \> 500/μL and platelets \>50,000/μL)., Day 28
Number of Dose Adjustments To Maintain Trough Levels, One goal of this study is to maintain trough levels of sirolimus within a certain range. The outcome measure counts the number of dose adjustments up or down that were needed to meet goal level based on weekly tough level measurements., Day 28
At present children who have bone marrow or combined bone marrow and extramedullary relapses of acute leukemia while on therapy have 5-20% of long-term survival. Newer, targeted agents need to be identified and integrated into the present cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. Biologically targeted cancer agents, including signal transduction inhibitors like mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (MTIs), have shown great promise in treating hematologic malignancies. A Phase 1 trial of sirolimus (an MTI) alone performed at CHOP has been well tolerated with no DLTs and has evidence of hitting the biologic target. While signal transduction inhibitors may be efficacious as single agents, it is more likely that these targeted agents will demonstrate greater efficacy in combination with other cytotoxic agents.Based upon pre-clinical humanized ALL mouse models we propose to study the toxicity and efficacy of adding sirolimus to oral methotrexate in relapsed and refractory patients.

Patients \< 25 years of age, at time of enrollment, with second or greater relapse of ALL or NHL (lymphoblastic lymphoma or peripheral T-cell lymphoma) are eligible. ALL patients must have at least 10% blasts in their marrow and NHL patients must have radiologic or physical evidence of recurrence.

Patients will be started on daily oral sirolimus that is dosed based upon goal trough levels and weekly oral methotrexate. All therapy can be done as an outpatient.
