Study to Evaluate Impact® As Support to Anti PD1 Treatment in Patients with Inoperable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Melanoma
This is a monocentric, prospective study evaluating the effectiveness in reducing immune-related adverse events, and translational study conducted on 20 patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma.

The patients will be treated with Oral Impact® administered at the dose of two bricks/day for 21 days + one brick/day for 14 days, starting exactly one week before Anti PD-1 treatment (nivolumab) as per clinical practice, administered up to two years.

The comparison will be done with historical literature data on patients matched by age, sex, disease stage, and therapy dosage, not treated with Impact.
