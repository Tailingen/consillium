Skin Cancer and Hyperthermia and Radiotherapy
The SAHARA trial assesses wether combining ultrahypofractionated accelerated radiotherapy (RT) with hyperthermia is as effective as standard hypofractionated high-dose radiation in treating non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC).

Local control, The primary outcome is local control, defined as the absence of of recurrence or need for subsequent intervention., Within two years post-treatment initiation.
Analysis, Radiation is applied assessed immediately post-treatment, at six weeks, and three months post-treatment using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events (CTCAE 5.0)., Immediately (within 24 hours post-treatment), at six weeks post-treatment and at three months post-treatment.|Late toxicities, Monitoring late toxicities, specifically noted at six months, one year, and two years after completion of treatment using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events (CTCAE 5.0)., at 6months, one year and two years post-treatment|Quality of life assessment, Evaluations are carried out at time of inclusion, immediately post-treatment, at three months, 6months, one year and two years post-treatment utilizing the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire for Elderly (QLQ-ELD14) questionnaire., at three months, 6months, one year and two years post-treatment
The SAHARA Trial is investigating if adding hyperthermia to radiotherapy (RT) can enhance treatment outcomes by making cancer cells more sensitive to radiation, thus requiring lower doses and potentially reducing side effects. The trial compares high-dose RT alone with de-escalated RT plus hyperthermia. The aim is to demonstrate that the combination is non-inferior to standard RT in treating non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). The trial is designed for elderly people of 65 years or older.
