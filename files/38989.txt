Brigatinib Before Brain Irradiation Trial (B3i Trial)
This is a single arm phase II study of brigatinib alone for patients with brain metastases from anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who have either not been treated previously with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting ALK or who have had prior exposure to crizotinib.
Brain Metastases|Lung Cancer
DRUG: Brigatinib
Number of Participants Who Meet Disease Control Rate (DCR) Criteria of Brain Metastases at 3 Months, DCR is defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) as defined by the RANO-BM (Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria - Brain Metastases) criteria., 13-week MRI Â±7 days
Time Until Progression With Brigatinib Alone (Part 1), Time until any CNS progressive disease (PD) by RANO-BM criteria and rates at follow up intervals, up to 24 months|Time Until Progression With Brigatinib Alone (Part 2), Time until any local PD (i.e., in brain lesions identified at the time of enrollment) by RANO-BM criteria and rates at follow up intervals, up to 24 months|Time Until Progression With Brigatinib Alone (Part 3), Time until any distant brain PD (i.e., new brain lesions that were not present at the time of enrollment) by RANO-BM criteria and rates at follow up intervals, up to 24 months|Time Until Progression With Brigatinib Alone (Part 4), Time until progression at any site using RANO-BM for intracranial disease and RECIST for extracranial disease and rates at follow up intervals, up to 24 months|Overall Survival With a Strategy of Brigatinib Alone, Time until death from any cause and rates at follow up intervals, up to 24 months|Time Until Brain Metastases-Specific Mortality, Defined as time to intracranial progression as a component of cause of death and rates at follow up intervals, up to 24 months|Brain Metastases Objective Response Rates (ORR) With Brigatinib Alone, Cumulative rate of best responses individually for complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), by RANO-BM criteria, up to 24 months|Time Until the Administration of WBRT With Brigatinib Alone, Time until the administration of whole brain-radiotherapy (WBRT) and rates at follow up intervals, up to 24 months|Longitudinal Changes in Quality of Life With Brigatinib Alone, Quality of life will be assessed using standardized QOL metrics (EORTC QLQ C30/BN 20), up to 24 months
Analysis of Blood at Baseline and at Progression to Correlate With Clinical Outcomes, Evaluation of cfDNA at baseline and progression to correlate with clinical outcomes, including incidence of disease recurrence per RANO-BM and RECIST 1.1, survival status by percentage of patients alive at 2 years, and patient rating of quality of life per EORTC QLQ-BN20 and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires., up to 24 months|Characterization of Corticosteroid Administration Before and After Brigatinib Initiation, Quantification of the agent and dosage of corticosteroids at each study assessment, up to 24 months
In this single-arm phase II trial, patients with brain metastases from ALK+ NSCLC will be treated with brigatinib alone without upfront brain irradiation. Patients will have close monitoring with clinical follow up visits and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance, which will maximize safety and allow for early treatment if disease progression is observed. If brigatinib alone can demonstrate high rates of CNS disease control, these data could support a strategy of upfront brigatinib alone for carefully selected patients with brain metastases from ALK+ NSCLC.
