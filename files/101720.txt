Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This study is a single-arm, open, single-center clinical study to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of sovalteinib in combination with solutumab and tegeo in second-line and post-line treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

A total of 30 patients were enrolled in this study, which was divided into 3 phases: screening phase, treatment phase and follow-up phase. During the treatment period, tumor status was evaluated by imaging methods every 6 weeks (±7 days) until disease progression (PD, RECIST 1.1) or death (during patient treatment) or intolerable toxicity, and tumor treatment and survival status after disease progression were recorded. Safety observations included AE, changes in laboratory test values, vital signs, and changes in ECG. In addition, 10 ml of blood was drawn for testing in our laboratory before each treatment and at the time of disease progression before the patients were enrolled, and the exploration of the efficacy-related biomarker BRCA1 was performed by blood samples.
Progression-free Survival
DRUG: Sovalteinib Solutumab Tegeo
PFS, Time between the start of treatment and the onset of (any aspect of) progression of the tumor or death (from any cause), through disease progression, an average of 6 months
ORR, The proportion of patients whose tumor volume shrinks to a pre-specified value and who can maintain the minimum time requirement is the sum of the proportion in complete and partial remission., through disease progression, an average of 6 months|DCR, The number of cases that achieved remission (PR+CR) and stable lesions (SD) after treatment as a percentage of the evaluable cases., through disease progression, an average of 6 months|OS, Time from start of treatment to death (from any cause), through patients' death, an average of 12 months
