GC-PRO Intervention
The goal of the GC-PRO study is to try to make genetic counseling better for people of all backgrounds. We are asking participants to complete two surveys and to allow audio recording of their genetic counseling visit. The purpose of the study is to understand whether trying different ways of doing genetic counseling will lead to better experiences for patients. The research team is also working with partners from the Somali, Latino/Hispanic, Black/African American, and Hmong communities to make sure the research is being done in a way that will benefit underserved communities.
