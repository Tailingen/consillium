A Study of KNT-0916 in Treatment of Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors with FGFR2 Alterations
This is a Phase1, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of KNT-0916 in patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors harboring FGFR2 alterations who have failed prior systemic therapy. This study is divided into 2 parts, dose escalation part(part A), dose expansion part(partB).
Solid Tumors with FGFR2 Alterations, Adult
DRUG: KNT-0916
Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), 4 weeks|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or Maximum administered dose (MAD), 12 months|Incidence, relatedness, seriousness and severity of adverse events (AEs) per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AE (NCI CTCAE) Version 5.0., 33 months|Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), 33 months
Objective response rate (ORR) assessed as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, 33 months|Duration of response (DoR) assessed as per RECIST 1.1, 33 months|Disease control rate (DCR) assessed as per RECIST 1.1, 33 months|Progression-free survival (PFS) assessed as per RECIST 1.1, 33 months|Overall survival (OS) assessed as per RECIST 1.1, 33 months|Pharmacokinetic parameters including maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax), 33 months|Pharmacokinetic parameters including area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), 33 months|Pharmacokinetic parameters including half-life (t1/2), 33 months|Pharmacokinetic parameters including time to maximum concentration (Tmax), 33 months|Pharmacokinetic parameters including Apparent clearance (CL/F), 33 months
This study is divided into 2 parts, part a isNdesigned to explore the maximum toxicity dose (MTD) of KNT-0916 with an accelerated titration plus traditional "3+3" design; part b is designed to explore the elementary anti-neoplastic activity of KNT-0916 with recommended dose in patients with confirmed FGFR2 alterations through central laboratory testing.
