Predicting the Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Therapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Using an AI Platform Based on Multi-parametric MRI
Establish a deep learning model based on multi-parameter magnetic resonance imaging to predict the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer.This study intends to combine DCE with conventional MRI images for DL, establish a multi-parameter MRI model for predicting the efficacy of CRT, and compare it with the DL and non-artificial quantitative MRI diagnostic model constructed by conventional MRI to evaluate the role of DL in MRI predicting CRT. And this study also tries to build a DL platform to assess the efficacy of LARC neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, accurately assess patients' complete respose (pCR) after CRT, and provide an important basis for guiding clinical decision-making.
