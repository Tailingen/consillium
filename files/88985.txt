A Study of Smoking Cessation Patterns in Participants Undergoing Lung Surgery
The purpose of this study is to assess the current smoking status and smoking cessation attempts among smokers or recent smoking quitters during the perioperative period, to describe postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and other postoperative complications (PCs) following a lung surgery, and to describe the smoking cessation methods and services patients received from their health care professionals (HCPs) and participant's satisfaction among participants with lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), a pulmonary lesion (example, nodule, or ground glass opacity) or other pulmonary conditions who are admitted to the thoracic surgical unit of the participating hospitals in China.
