Paclitaxel and Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin for Treatment of HIV-related Kaposi Sarcoma
This study is being done to determine if two different anti-cancer drugs, paclitaxel (PTX) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) have similar effects on treating Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) in people living with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in sub-Saharan Africa. Patients with HIV-related KS will receive either PTX or PLD once every 3 weeks for a total of six cycles.

Progression Free Survival at 48 weeks, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the length of time from enrollment into the study until disease progression or death. Disease progression will be assessed using the Kaposi Sarcoma Response Evaluation Criteria. Progressive disease is defined as: 1) 25% increase in the sum of perpendicular diameters of the indicator lesions; 2) 25% increase in the total number of KS lesions or the appearance of 5 new lesions; OR 3) 25% increase in the number of raised lesions, 48 weeks
Frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 in participants receiving PLD or PTX., The frequency of adverse events that occur in patients receiving PLD will be compared with the frequency of adverse events in patients receiving PTX, 96 weeks|Objective response rate for AIDS-related KS in patients receiving PLD and PTX, The objective response rate is defined as the sum of the number of complete and partial responses in patients receiving PLD or PTX., 96 weeks|Duration of Response in patients receiving PLD and PTX, Response duration is defined as the time from first documentation of complete or partial response as measured by KS response criteria to the documentation of first progression of disease as measured by KS response criteria, 96 weeks
