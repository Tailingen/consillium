Study on HRQOL and Cost-effectiveness Analysis in Management of Patients With <2cm Thyroid Nodules
Ideally randomized controlled trials should be carried out to compare the cost-effectiveness between FNAC and watchful waiting but such studies are very difficult to conduct in practice because they require following up very large number of subjects for a long period of time.

The aims are to determine the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and HRQOL preference (utility) of patients undergoing watchful observation (no FNAC) and routine FNAC, and to determine the cost-effectiveness of two strategies in managing small incidental thyroid nodules for the Chinese population in Hong Kong.
Thyroid Nodules
OTHER: Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology
The measurement of HRQoL by SF-6D Health Survey, Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) preference value measured by The Chinese (HK) SF-6D Health Survey will be calculated by the Hong Kong population specific algorithm. It ranges from 0 (dead) to 1 (perfect health), Two years
The effectiveness of managing small incidental thyroid nodules and treatment effect on the HRQOL of patients with thyroid carcinoma, The effectiveness of managing small incidental thyroid nodules is quantified by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which will be calculated as the product of average duration of each stage (including no illness) and the SF-6D preference value for that particular health state.

The direct health care costs of different strategies in managing small incidental thyroid nodules will be estimated using the costs published by the Government Gazette and previous literatures.

HRQOL measured by the Chinese (Hong Kong) Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey version 2 and FACT-G will be evaluated to identify these major problem of life.

Health service utilizations of patients with thyroid neoplasm will be surveyed.

Treatment effect on the HRQOL of patients with thyroid carcinoma will be explored., Two years
