AI-assisted White Light Endoscopy to Identify the Kimura-Takemoto Classification of Atrophic Gastritis
Grading endoscopic atrophy according to the Kimura-Takemoto classification can assess the risk of gastric neoplasia development. However, the false negative rate of chronic atrophic gastritis is high due to the varying diagnostic standardization and diagnostic experience and levels of endoscopists. Therefore, this study aims to develop an AI model to identify the Kimura-Takemoto classification.

Grading endoscopic atrophy according to the Kimura-Takemoto classification can assess the risk of gastric neoplasia development. The higher the score, the more severe the degree of atrophic gastritis. However, the false negative rate of chronic atrophic gastritis is high due to the varying diagnostic standardization and diagnostic experience and levels of endoscopists. Therefore, this study aims to develop an AI model to identify the Kimura-Takemoto classification of atrophic gastritis to achieve gastric cancer risk assessment.
