Acalabrutinib in Combination With R-miniCHOP in Older Adults With Untreated Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to study the addition of Acalabrutinib to standard R-miniCHOP in older adults with DLBCL. The main question it aims to answer is whether progression free survival kann be prolonged with the addition of Acalabrutinib.

Participants will be randomised to receive either R-miniCHOP alone or R-miniCHOP with Acalabrutinib.
