Study of Atezolizumab Combination Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Bevacizumab in EGRF Mutation or ALK Translocation NSCLC
This randomized, Phase III, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy of Atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel, bevacizumab compared with treatment with pemetrexed, cisplatin in approximately 228 TKI(tyrosine kinase inhibitor) pre treated patients with Stage IV non squamous non small cell lung cancer with activating EGFR mutation or ALK translocation.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab(Tecentriq)|DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin or cisplatin
progression-free survival, PFS, To evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab as progression-free survival (PFS) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) in the following treatment:Atezolizumab + carboplatin + paclitaxel + bevacizumab versus Pemetrexed + carboplatin or cisplatin, 34month after the first patient is randomized
overall survival(OS), 24month after the last patient is randomized|objective response rate(ORR), 24month after the last patient is randomized|duration of response(DOR), 24month after the last patient is randomized
The difference in PFS and OS based on the CNS metastasis, CNS metastasis(brain, spinal cord, ophthalmic..), 24month after the last patient is randomized|PFS on CNS(brain, spinal cord, ophthalmic..), 24month after the last patient is randomized
