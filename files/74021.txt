Evaluation of Predictive Proteic Profile on Mortality in the Acute Phase of Septic Shock in Cancer Patients
The mortality induced by infections in onco-hematological patients is abnormally high at the acute phase of septic shock. Consequently, it is important to detect the population with a high risk of short term mortality among patients with a septic shock. The aim of this study is the evaluation of predictive proteic profile on the short term mortality in the acute phase of septic shock in cancer patients.
