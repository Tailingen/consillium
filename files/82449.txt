Combination Chemotherapy Plus Radiation Therapy in Treating Adult Patients With Brain Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy in treating adult patients with brain cancer.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: etoposide|DRUG: vincristine sulfate|PROCEDURE: adjuvant therapy|RADIATION: radiation therapy
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the complete and partial response rate of patients with adult medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, or disseminated ependymoma treated with preradiation combination chemotherapy.
* Determine the progression free survival and overall survival of these adult patients treated with combination chemotherapy followed by craniospinal radiation.
* Determine the toxic effects associated with this treatment in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours, etoposide IV, and vincristine IV over 1-2 minutes on day 1; etoposide IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days 2-3; filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 4-13; and vincristine IV over 1-2 minutes on day 15. Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Within 4-6 weeks after the last chemotherapy course, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 to 7 weeks.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5-10 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
