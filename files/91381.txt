Biomarkers in Samples From Young Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial is studying biomarkers in samples from young patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
Sarcoma
GENETIC: DNA analysis|GENETIC: RNA analysis|GENETIC: mutation analysis|GENETIC: nucleic acid sequencing|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Occurrence of somatic mutations in driver genes and mutations in other genes that occur individually
OBJECTIVES:

* To identify the key components of driver pathways of primary and secondary soft tissue sarcomas.
* To perform the next-generation sequencing on primary versus normal on undifferentiated sarcomas.

OUTLINE: Genomic DNA and RNA samples from undifferentiated sarcoma tumors are analyzed by next-generation sequencing for somatic mutations. Normal matched lymphocytes and tissue are also analyzed.
