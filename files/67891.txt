Nivolumab in Combination With Chemotherapy, or Nivolumab in Combination With Ipilimumab, in Advanced EGFR-Mutant or ALK-Rearranged NSCLC
This research study is studying a drug intervention as a possible treatment for lung cancer.

The drugs involved in this study are:

* Nivolumab
* Carboplatin
* Pemetrexed
* Ipilimumab
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Presented in Numbers of Participants, Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)

* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Up to approximately 2 years
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Presented in Numbers of Participants, The number of patients that achieved either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) per RECIST version 1.1

* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Up to approximately 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from initiation of the study drugs to progression or death, whichever occurs first. Disease progression was assessed via RECIST 1.1

Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study(this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).

Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated using the Kaplan Meier (KM) method, From the start of treatment until disease progression or death due to any cause, up to approximately 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Time from initiation of the study drugs to date of death due to any cause. CIs are the KM estimate CIs., From the start of treatment until death due to any cause, up to approximately 2 years|Duration Of Response, Time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first

* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study(this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)., From the first documented response until disease progression or death, up to approximately 2 years
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Nivolumab as a treatment for other types of cancers including lung cancer. However, the combination of Nivolumab with other drugs (such as those being tested in this study) has not been approved by the FDA as a treatment for this type of lung cancer.

The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness (how well the drug works), safety, and tolerability of the drug Nivolumab in combination with standard of care chemotherapies, or in combination with Ipilimumab. Nivolumab and Ipilimumab are antibodies (a type of human protein) that are being tested to see if they will allow the body's immune system to work against tumor cells. This study is being done to see if Nivolumab and Ipilimumab, or Nivolumab and chemotherapy drugs (Carboplatin and Pemetrexed), are more effective against cancer when administered together.

These drugs are given as infusions. They are designed to "boost" the immune system's ability to suppress or kill cancer cells that are foreign to the human body.
