A Study of E7386 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Previously Treated Participants With Selected Solid Tumors
The Phase 1b part of this study is conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of E7386 in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with previously treated selected solid tumors, and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of E7386 in combination with pembrolizumab.

The Phase 2 part of this study is conducted to assess the objective response rate (ORR) of E7386 in combination with pembrolizumab (melanoma, colorectal cancer \[CRC\], hepatocellular carcinoma \[HCC\]) or of E7386 in combination with pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib (HCC) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.
Melanoma|Carcinoma, Hepatocellular|Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: E7386|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Phase 1b Part: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLTs are any pre-specified toxicities occurring during Cycle 1, based on investigator assessment as related to study drug. All adverse events (AEs) of the specified grades should count as DLTs except those that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to disease progression or extraneous causes. DLTs will be assessed to determine the RP2D of E7386 in combination with pembrolizumab. All toxicity will be graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0., Cycle 1 (Cycle length is equal to [=] 21 days)|Phase 1b Part: Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), From date of first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last administration of study drug (approximately up to 3 years 11 months)|Phase 2 Part: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., From first dose of study drug until progressive disease (PD) or death, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)
Phase 1b Part: Best of Response (BOR), BOR is defined as CR, PR, stable disease (SD), PD, and not evaluable (NE), where SD has to be achieved at greater than equal to (\>=) 5 weeks after the first dose per RECIST version 1.1., From first dose of study drug until PD or death, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any causes, whichever occurs first in participants with confirmed CR or PR as per RECIST version 1.1., From the date of first documented CR or PR until first documentation of recurrent or progressive disease or death due to any causes (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of confirmed CR, PR, or SD after \>=5 weeks from first dose per RECIST version 1.1., From first dose of study drug until PD or death, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a BOR of confirmed CR, PR, or durable SD (duration of SD \>=23 weeks) per RECIST 1.1., From first dose of study drug until PD or death, development of unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study termination (up to approximately 3 years 11 months)|Phase 2 Part: Number of Participants With TEAEs and Treatment-related Adverse Events for E7386 in Combination With Pembrolizumab and E7386 in Combination With Pembrolizumab Plus Lenvatinib, From date of first dose of study drug up to 30 days after last administration of study drug (approximately up to 3 years 11 months)|Phase 2 Part: Number of Participants With DLTs for E7386 in Combination With Pembrolizumab Plus Lenvatinib, DLTs are any pre-specified toxicities occurring during Cycle 1, based on investigator assessment as related to study drug. All AEs of the specified grades should count as DLTs except those that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to disease progression or extraneous causes. All toxicity will be graded using NCI CTCAE version 5.0., Cycle 1 (Cycle length = 21 days)|Phase 1b Part, Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for E7386 When Co-administered With Pembrolizumab, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-12 hours post-dose (Cycle length = 21 days)|Phase 1b Part, Tmax: Time to Reach the Maximum Plasma Concentration for E7386 When Co-administered With Pembrolizumab, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-12 hours post-dose (Cycle length = 21 days)|Phase 1b Part, AUC(0-t): Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Zero (Pre-dose) to Time of Last Quantifiable Concentration for E7386 When Co-administered With Pembrolizumab, Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8: 0-12 hours post-dose (Cycle length = 21 days)|Phase 2 Part: Apparent Clearance for E7386 When Co-administered With Lenvatinib and Pembrolizumab, Cycle 1 Day 1: 0.5-8 hours post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 8: 0-8 hours post-dose (Cycle length = 21 days)|Phase 2 Part: Apparent Clearance for Lenvatinib When Co-administered With E7386 and Pembrolizumab, Cycle 1 Day 1: 0.5-8 hours post-dose; Cycle 1 Day 8: 0-8 hours post-dose (Cycle length = 21 days)
