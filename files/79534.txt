EZH2 Inhibitor Tazemetostat in Pediatric Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory INI1-Negative Tumors or Synovial Sarcoma
This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study with BID (suspension) and TID (tablet) oral dose of the enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2) inhibitor, tazemetostat. Subjects will be screened for eligibility within 14 days of the planned first dose of tazemetostat. A treatment cycle will be 28 days. Response assessment will be evaluated after 8 weeks of treatment and subsequently every 8 weeks while on study.

DRUG: Tazemetostat
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) (Dose Escalation Only), The incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events qualifying as protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities that occurred during the first month of treatment was used to determine the RP2D and/or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in pediatric patients treated with tazemetostat., Cycle 1, from the start of study treatment (Day 1) until the end of the first Cycle (Day 28) of treatment|Number of Dose-limiting Toxicities (Dose Escalation Only), The RP2D in pediatric patients treated with tazemetostat as determined by the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events qualifying as protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicities that occurred during the first month of treatment., Cycle 1, from the start of study treatment (Day 1) until the end of the first Cycle (Day 28) of treatment|Overall Response Rate (ORR) (Dose Expansion Only), ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieved a confirmed complete response (CR) and/or partial response (PR) defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) or response assessment in neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria from the start of tazemetostat treatment until disease progression or the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (with all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size or under 10 millimeters \[mm\] in short axis) and PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR= CR+PR., RECIST assessments performed at screening (within 14 days before start of study intervention) and every 8 weeks post start of dosing, approximately up to 302 weeks

Disease progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (including at least a 5 mm absolute increase). The presence of new lesions also constitutes to disease progression., RECIST assessments performed at screening (within 14 days before start of study intervention) and every 8 weeks post start of dosing, approximately up to 302 weeks|Overall Survival (Dose Expansion Only), Overall survival was defined as the time (in weeks) from the first dose of study drug to the date of death due to any cause., RECIST assessments performed at screening (within 14 days before start of study intervention) and every 8 weeks post start of dosing, approximately up to 302 weeks
The study has two parts: Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion.

Dose escalation for subjects with the following relapsed/refractory malignancies:

* Rhabdoid tumors:
* Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT)
* Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT)
* Rhabdoid tumor of kidney (RTK)
* Selected tumors with rhabdoid features
* Integrase interactor 1 (INI1)-negative tumors:
* Epithelioid sarcoma
* Epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
* Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma
* Myoepithelial carcinoma
* Renal medullary carcinoma
* Other INI1-negative malignant tumors (e.g., dedifferentiated chordoma)
* Synovial Sarcoma with a SS18-SSX rearrangement Dose Escalation cohorts are closed to enrollment.

Dose Expansion at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)

* Cohort 1 - ATRT
* Cohort 2 - MRT/RTK/selected tumors with rhabdoid features
* Cohort 3 - INI-negative tumors:
* Epithelioid sarcoma
* Epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor
* Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma
* Myoepithelial carcinoma
* Renal medullary carcinoma
* Chordoma (poorly differentiated or de-differentiated)
* Other INI1-negative malignant tumors (e.g., dedifferentiated chordoma)
* Cohort 4 - Tumor types eligible for Cohorts 1 through 3 or synovial sarcoma with SS18-SSX rearrangement
