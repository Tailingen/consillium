Organ Preservation Following Enverolimab-based Total Neoadjuvant Therapy for Locally Advanced Very Low Rectal Cancer
Patients diagnosed with locally advanced very low rectal cancer were chosen to participate in a comprehensive neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) protocol. This treatment regimen consisted of preoperative fractionated radiotherapy (5×7Gy) combined with 6 cycles of CAPOX chemotherapy and enverolimab. For patients who achieved clinical complete response (cCR) or near-clinical complete response (ncCR) after undergoing TNT, an organ-preserving strategy involving local full-thickness resection was implemented.

Locally advanced very low rectal cancer poses significant challenges in rectal cancer treatment. Presently, the prevailing approach in clinical practice involves neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in conjunction with total mesorectal excision (TME). Historically, abdominoperineal resection (APR) has been the conventional surgical procedure for managing locally advanced very low rectal cancer. However, the long-term presence of a colostomy following an abdominoperineal resection (APR) significantly impacts the quality of life for patients. Additionally, studies have revealed that 11.8-22% of rectal cancer patients who underwent APR after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) achieved a pathological complete response (pCR). Conversely, 11-52% of patients with pCR after nCRT for rectal cancer ultimately underwent APR surgery. Intersphincter resection (ISR) offers a highly beneficial surgical approach that preserves the anal sphincter, particularly for individuals with locally advanced very low rectal cancer. The patient's postoperative quality of life was significantly affected by severe low anterior resection syndrome (LARS), sexual dysfunction, and voiding dysfunction.

This study represents an exploratory phase II clinical trial in which patients diagnosed with locally advanced very low rectal cancer were chosen to undergo a total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) regimen. This regimen consisted of preoperative fractionated radiotherapy (5×7Gy) combined with 6 cycles of CAPOX chemotherapy and enverolimab.

For patients who achieved clinical complete response (cCR) or near-clinical complete response (ncCR) after undergoing TNT, an organ-preserving strategy involving local full-thickness resection was implemented. Patients who achieve non-clinical complete response are subjected to traditional TME surgery.

This study aims to investigate the effectiveness and safety of organ preservation using the local resection approach in patients with locally advanced very low rectal cancer. By implementing this approach, the study aims to improve the quality of life for patients who achieve pathological complete response (pCR), thereby avoiding the need for conventional abdominoperineal resection (APR) and intersphincteric resection (ISR) procedures. Additionally, this study aims to address the issue of local regrowth associated with the "watch \& wait" strategy and propose a novel treatment strategy for rectal-sparing surgery in patients with locally advanced very low rectal cancer.
