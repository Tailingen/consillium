First-in-Human Positron Emission Tomography Study Using the 18F-αvβ6-Binding-Peptide
This clinical trial studies the side effects of 18F-alphavbeta6-binding-peptide and how well it works in imaging patients with primary or cancer that has spread to the breast, colorectal, lung, or pancreatic. Radiotracers, such as 18F-alphavbeta6-binding-peptide, may improve the ability to locate cancer in the body.

DRUG: 18F-αvβ6-BP
Assessment of safe administration of 18F-αvβ6-BP, Assessed by measures and/or changes in a given vital sign, Up to 6 months
Measurement of 18F-αvβ6-BP accumulation in tumors, Assessed by PET, Up to 6 months|Level of αvβ6-BP expression in tumors, Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for the cell surface receptor integrin, Up to 6 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety, biodistribution and dosimetric properties of 18F-alphavbeta6-binding peptide (BP) in normal tissues and malignancies in cancer patients and correlate concordance with alphavbeta6 expression.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive 18F-alphavbeta6-BP intravenously (IV) and then undergo positron emission tomography (PET) scans over 30 minutes each at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes post-injection.

After completion of study, patients are followed up for up to 6 months.
