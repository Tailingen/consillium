Lutathera and ASTX727 in Neuroendocrine Tumours
Patients entered into the study will receive ASTX727 orally for 5 days, prior to receiving Lutathera treatment on Day 8, to determine whether pre-treatment with ASTX727 results in re-expression of somatostatin receptor-2 in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumours. The study will use \[68Ga\]-DOTA-TATE PET to image epigenetic modification of the receptor locus.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: ASTX727|RADIATION: Lutathera
To determine whether pre-treatment with ASTX727 results in re-expression of SSTR2 in patients with metastatic NETs, using [68Ga]-DOTA-TATE to image epigenetic modification of the SSTR2 locus allowing subsequent treatment with Lutathera, This outcome will be assessed using a specific PET scan, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
To assess tolerability of combination therapy, This outcome will be assessed using CTCAE v5.0, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To assess response to treatment using conventional imaging, This outcome will be assessed using standard of care CT scans, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To assess patients quality of life during treatment, This will be assessed using standardised quality of life questionnaires, which will be given to the patients, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|To assess progression free survival, This will be the time until patients show progressive disease on their routine CT scans, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NET) who are found to be eligible will receive up to 4 doses of Lutathera on this trial. All participants will receive ASTX727 orally (cedazuridine 100mg + 35mg decitabine) Days 0-5 prior to receiving Lutathera Day 8 +/- 2days. Each cycle will be repeated every 2 months for 4 cycles unless unacceptable toxicity, progression of disease or withdrawal of patients' consent. Restaging will occur after 2 cycles of Lutathera and at the end of treatment. Patients will be followed 3 monthly until disease progression, death or withdrawal of patients' consent.
