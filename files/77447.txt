Can B12 and Folate Levels Predict HPV Penetration in Patients With ASCUS?
Non-classified atypical squamous cells (ASCUS) is the most common abnormal cervical cytology (%39). The risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2-3 is 5% and the risk of carcinoma is around 0.1% after diagnosis. Mostly human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for this transition. Most of them are transient, but some infections become persistent and can progress into precancer and invasive cancer. In the process of progression to cancer; patients with cell cycle problems are thought to be at risk. In some studies, B12 and folate deficiency, which play a role in DNA synthesis and repair, have been shown to induce incorrect binding of uracil to DNA, leading to DNA breakage and repair disorder. Therefore, in this study, it has been aimed that the relation of presence of atypical squamous cells and HPV persistence with folate and vitamin B12 levels which effect on immune system.

Participants were divided into two groups according to their smear results; atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) (study group: 100 patients) and women who did not have intraepithelial neoplasia as a result of smear (control group: 100 patients). Patients who had well preserved sufficient number of squamous epithelial cells, who did not have bleeding, fixation failure, inflammation or atrophy, and had negative cervical cytology smear were considered as control group. HPV test was also requested from the study group. B12 and folate blood levels were compared between the groups.
