Phase II Study Evaluating Strategies of Lung Surveillance of Patients Operated of High Grade Soft Tissue Sarcoma
Cancer surveillance has a significant cost and generate anxiety for the patient.

It is important to avoid exams that will not modify health support or whose results wont allow to decide.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma|Lung Metastasis
PROCEDURE: chest radiography|PROCEDURE: chest CT
proportion of patients having an isolated and operable pulmonary relapse, % of patients having resectable or resected lung metastasis after 2 years of surveillance, 2 years
evaluate quality of life, questionnaire STAI, every 3 months for 2 years then every 6 months for the 3rd year|evaluate free disease survival, Time between date of inclusion and date of clinical or radiological progression, 5 years|evaluate overall survival, time between date of inclusion and date of death (whatever the cause is), 5 years|evaluate irradiation received, measure of PDL (product dose length) for chest CT measure of PDS (product dose surface) for chest radiograph, 2 years|estimate false positive rate, patients operated for non metastatic lesions patients monitored for non metastatic nodules, 2 years|evaluate global health, using scale of pain EVA, every 3 months for 2 years then every 6 months for the 3rd year|medico economic evaluation, sum of direct and indirect costs, 5 years
Cancer surveillance has a significant cost and generate anxiety for the patient.

It is important to avoid exams that will not modify health support or whose results wont allow to decide.

Our study will help rationalise surveillance of soft tissue sarcoma and standardize medical practices.
