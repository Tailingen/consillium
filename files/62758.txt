Analysis of Circulating Epithelial Tumor Cells in Peripheral Blood in Patients With Primary Non-metastatic Breast Cancer Under Adjuvant Radiotherapy
The aim of this study was to investigate the systemic effect of radiotherapy on patients with primary non-metastatic breast cancer using CETC and to analyze possible changes in CETC quantity under adjuvant radiotherapy.
Breast Cancer Female
RADIATION: radiation
Overall survival, from the start of Radiotherapy until death / last seen during follow up, up to 10 years
Disease free survival, from the start of Radiotherapy until relapse or metastasis / last seen during follow up, up to 10 years
In cooperation with the Women's Hospital of the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, a total of 161 patients with clinically proven, primarily non-metastatic breast cancer were sampled and examined before and after radiotherapy over a period from 09/2002 to 09/2012. The MAINTRAC method was used to quantitatively determine the amount of CETC in the blood and to observe its peritherapeutic course.
