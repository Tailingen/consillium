Effect of Physical Activity in Patients With Breast Cancer.
Every year in France, there are approximately 58,000 new cases of breast cancer, which is the leading cancer in women according to the National Cancer Institute.

Among the various tools in the fight against cancer, it is now proven that physical activity improves the prognosis of cancers, particularly breast cancer.

Indeed, APA (Adapted Physical Activity) reduces morbidity and mortality, the risk of recurrence and improves quality of life. It is one of the tools of the Ten-Year Cancer Control Strategy 2021-2030 of the anti-cancer plan.

However, it seems to be insufficiently proposed and prescribed in France at present.

CAMI (Cancer Arts Martiaux et Information) is a non-profit association comprising health professionals specifically trained to support cancer patients through APA. It works in collaboration with the Hospices Civils de Lyon and in particular the Gynecology Department of the CHU (University Hospital Center) of Croix Rousse.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), quality of life is "an individual's perception of his or her place in life, in the context of the culture and value system in which he or she lives, in relation to his or her goals, expectations, norms and concerns. It is a very broad concept influenced in a complex way by the subject's physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships as well as their relationship to the essential elements of their environment."

Quality of life is thus synonymous with well-being, perceived health and life satisfaction. The quality of a person's life is based both on the objective elements of his or her life (physical health, living environment and material and/or contextual conditions) and on his or her experience, which can be defined as the subjective quality of life.

Thus, quality of life is considered to be a multidimensional concept that is structured around four dimensions, the first of which encompasses the physical state (autonomy, physical abilities), the second the somatic sensations that often translate into the expression of pain, the consequences of trauma related to the disease or treatment.

With the increase in the incidence of breast cancer and the improvement in its prognosis, the number of breast cancer survivors has increased significantly. Quality of life has become an important outcome measure in clinical breast cancer surveys and survival studies, in addition to survival.

The investigators' main objective is to study the effects of APA managed by CAMI in routine practice, on the quality of life of breast cancer patients.

They also want to analyze how, by whom, and which patients are referred to CAMI to improve their care and describe the program offered by CAMI.

The aim of this research is therefore to establish an axis of work and improvement for the Gynecology Department of the Croix Rousse Hospital in order to better identify the patients for whom APA would be most beneficial, to better refer them to CAMI and to study in real practice the effects of APA on these patients.
