DCSZ11 as a Monotherapy and in Combination in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study to assess the effects of DCSZ11, an anti-CD93 monoclonal antibody, as a monotherapy and in combination in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

The drug being tested in this study is called DCSZ11. DCSZ11 is being tested to treat people who have advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.

The study will enroll approximately 138 patients in dose escalation, and approximately 113 participants in the dose expansion phase. Participants will receive escalating doses of DCSZ11 and a fixed dose of pembrolizumab until DCSZ11 doses for phase 1b are selected:

* Phase 1a DCSZ11 monotherapy Dose Escalation.
* Phase 1a DCSZ11 in combination with fixed dose of pembrolizumab Dose Escalation.

Once Phase 1b doses are selected for Phase 1b, participants of select advanced or metastatic solid tumors will receive DCSZ11 in below defined cohorts in Phase 1b:

* Phase 1b cohort 1 NSCLC.
* Phase 1b cohort 2 Microsatellite Stable Colorectal Cancer (MSS-CRC) without liver involvement.
* Phase 1b cohort 3 MSS-CRC with liver involvement.

This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study is 60 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and survival follow-up for a maximum of up to 12 months after the last dose of the study drug.
