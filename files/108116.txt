Magnetic Particle-ICG Lymph Node Mapping in Colorectal Cancer
Study to determine the feasibility of Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) mapping using novel magnetic tracers (FerroTrace) and indocyanine green (ICG) for colorectal cancer; and to evaluate safety by assessing short term toxicity associated with colonoscopic peritumoral injection of novel magnetic nanoparticles (FerroTrace) and ICG for colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: FerroTraceTM|DRUG: indocyanine green (ICG)
To assess the feasibility how the Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) mapping by using novel magnetic tracers (FerroTrace) and using the indocyanine green (ICG) for colorectal cancer., through study completion, an average of 1 year
PRIMARY:

1. To determine the feasibility of Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) mapping using novel magnetic tracers (FerroTrace) and indocyanine green (ICG) for colorectal cancer.
2. To evaluate safety by assessing short term toxicity associated with colonoscopic peritumoral injection of novel magnetic nanoparticles (FerroTrace) and ICG for colorectal cancer.

SECONDARY:

1. To determine the additional positive diagnostic value of adding sentinel lymph node mapping to lymphadenectomy by assessing the SLNs with detailed immunochemistry versus the normal H\&E staining pathology tests.

PRIMARY END POINTS:

1. Feasibility: Number of registered patients who complete all study procedures with at least one sentinel node identified.
2. Safety: Rate of any grade III or greater toxicity attributable to FerroTrace injection, evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 5.0. Adverse events according to general peri-operative complications.

SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:

1. The identification rate and number of FerroTrace-positive lymph nodes for each patient.
2. Incidence of pathological upstaging of LN metastasis status by the addition of (non-routine) serial H\&E and immunohistochemistry in the pathological assessment of identified FerroTrace-positive lymph nodes.
