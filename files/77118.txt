An Exploratory Clinical Study of Adebelimumab in Combination With Famitinib and Chemotherapy in Patients With NSCLC
This study was a single-arm design to explore the efficacy and safety of Adebelimumab in combination with famitinib and lateral ventricular chemotherapy in patients with floppy meningeal metastases from non-squamous NSCLC who have failed EGFR-TKI therapy, and included patients with pathologically confirmed non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
NSCLC
DRUG: Adebelimumab+Famitinib + FOLFIRI+Ariely
ORR, Objective remission rates for flaccid meninges, Two years of observation after enrollment
iPFS, Intracranial progression-free survival, Two years of observation after enrollment|iDoR, Duration of intracranial relief, Two years of observation after enrollment|PFS, Overall progression-free survival, Two years of observation after enrollment|OS, overall survival, Two years of observation after enrollment
Despite the rapid progress of immune-combination therapy in lung cancer, immune-combination anti-vascular regimens after EGFR-TKI failure have not been explored in NSCLC LM, and further exploration of superior regimens targeting brain metastases is needed. Therefore, we plan to conduct an exploratory clinical study of adebenosumab in combination with famitinib and lateral ventricular chemotherapy in patients with non-squamous NSCLC with soft meningeal metastases who have failed EGFR-TKI therapy, with the aim of providing a more feasible and effective comprehensive treatment strategy for this group of patients.
