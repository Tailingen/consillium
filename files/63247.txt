Health Economic Evaluation of Primovist-enhanced Liver MRI
Patients with a history of colorectal cancer and known or suspected liver metastases who are scheduled for contrast-enhanced tomographic imaging will be included in this study. After randomization to either Primovist-enhanced MRI, extracellular contrast media (ECCM)-enhanced MRI or contrast-enhanced (CE)-CT outcomes and resource needs of the diagnostic work-up and treatment will be evaluated for each of the three imaging modalities. Main objectives of the study are to assess the proportion of patients for whom further imaging is required to come to a therapy decision and to evaluate the proportion of patients with intraoperatively modified surgical plans after Primovist-enhanced MRI as compared to ECCM-enhanced MRI and CE-CT.

PROCEDURE: Primovist MRI|PROCEDURE: Extracellular contrast media (ECCM) MRI|PROCEDURE: Contrast-enhanced CT
Primary variable is the proportion of patients in each of the three treatment groups for whom further imaging is required after initial imaging to come to a therapy decision., At end of the study (per patient)
Proportion of patients with intra-operatively modified surgical plans based on initial imaging with either Primovist-, ECCM-MRI or CE-CT, After end of the study
