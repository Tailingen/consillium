Individualized Tumor Specific TCR- T Cells in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the tumor-specific TCR-T cells in the treatment of advanced Solid Tumor .

The secondary purpose of this study is to preliminarily showed the effect of TCR-T cells in the treatment of advanced Solid Tumor .
Solid Tumor
DRUG: tumor-specific TCR-T cells|DRUG: Interleukin-2
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03, Keep records the adverse events experienced by subjects in 30 days after the last infusion., At least 45 days
Disease Control Rate(DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction(CR,PR) and stable (SD) assessed by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, one year|overall survival(OS), The time from the first injection of Investigational Product until death, two year|progression-free survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first injection of Investigational Product until objective tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first.Assessed by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST, two year
This study is an open, single-center, phase I clinical trial which is aim to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tumor-specific TCR-T cells. In this study, these TCR-T cells will be multiplied, or grown, in the laboratory.Subjects will received TCR-T cells infusions twice at day 0 and day 14, with the use of IL-2 for 5 consecutive days after every cell infusion.
