Evaluation of Early Retinal Vascular Modifications After Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery
This study evaluates the retinal vascular features using optical coherence tomography angiography in patients that received endoscopic endonasal approach for the removal of an intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.
Pituitary Adenoma
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery
Study of vessel density of the optic disc in patients underwent Endoscopic Endonasal Pituitary Surgery for the removal of an intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve., To evaluate the role of optical coherence tomography angiography in predicting the recovery of the vessel density of the optic disc after surgery, using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). The parameter analyzed by OCTA was the vessel density of the optic disc (percent), 48 hours
To investigate the potential role of optical coherence tomography angiography in predicting the postoperative recovery of retinal vascular network of the optic disc in patients before and at 3 months after Endoscopic Endonasal Approach for the removal of an intra-suprasellar pituitary adenoma compressing the optic nerve.

The optical coherence tomography angiography represents a novel and non-invasive diagnostic technique that allows a detailed analysis of retinal vascular features.
