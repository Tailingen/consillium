EVITA Study - Epstein-Barr Virus Infection MoniToring in RenAl Transplant Recipients
Transplant recipients are treated with immunosuppressive drugs to avoid rejection of the transplanted organ. As the medication impairs the immune response, it also increases the risk of serious infections and cancer in transplant recipients compared with the general population.

Previous studies have shown a close association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), with frequent demonstration of the virus in lesional tissues. Transplant recipients without evidence of EBV infection prior to transplantation (EBV seronegative) are at particularly high risk of developing PTLD. Other risk factors include a high viral load. As part of a preventive approach against PTLD, several transplantation units now monitor the occurrence of EBV DNAemia after transplantation. However, there is little evidence to guide this strategy; nor is there consensus concerning either the best specimen to use for EBV analysis (whole blood or plasma) or the appropriate clinical action to take if EBV DNAemia is detected.

Our aim is to estimate the incidence and clinical consequences of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNAemia in whole blood and plasma in renal transplant recipients, and to determine if persistence of EBV DNAemia can predict excessive immunosuppression as indicated by the incidence of infections requiring hospitalisation, EBV driven PTLD and mortality.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: EBV DNA in whole blood and plasma
The incidence rate of EBV driven PTLD, The incidence rate of EBV driven PTLD in patients with 2 consecutive positive PCR samples for EBV DNA in whole blood and/or plasma during follow up (persistent EBV DNAemia). The detection level for EBV DNA in the whole blood is 110 IU/ml. Levels of EBV DNA \< 1000 IU/ml are not quantified. The lower limit of detection for the EBV DNA plasma analysis is 25 IU/ml. Levels of EBV \< 100 IU/ml are not quantified, 2 years|The incidence rate of infections requiring hospitalisation in patients with persistant EBV DNAemia, The incidence rate of infections requiring hospitalisation in patients with 2 consecutive positive PCR samples for EBV DNA in whole blood and/or plasma during follow up (persistent EBV DNAemia)., 2 years|Mortality rate in patients with persistant EBV DNAemia, Mortality rate in patients with 2 consecutive positive PCR samples for EBV DNA in whole blood and/or plasma during follow up (persistent EBV DNAemia)., 2 years
The incidence of symptomatic opportunistic infections, Defined as CMV, BK virus, Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Human herpes virus 6 and 7, and Varicella zoster virus. In addition, bacterial pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Nocardia, all parasitic infections i.e. Pneumocystis jirovecii and fungal infections are regarded as opportunistic infections., 2 years|Incidence of infections requiring hospitalisation, 2 years|Incidence of EBV driven PTLD during follow-up., PTLD verified by a biopsy. Cases of PTLD will be reviewed according to the WHO-definitions, 2 years|Incidence of acute rejection, The incidence of acute rejection and chronic graft changes will be evaluated according to the Banff classification system. Cases without a biopsy will be registered if they have been treated as a an acute rejection, 2 years|Kidney graft function, Kidney graft function at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months after transplantation will be evaluated by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, mL/min.) and urine albumin/creatinine, 2 years
