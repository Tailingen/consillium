Evaluate the Auxiliary Diagnostic Value of Circulating Tumor Cells in Benign and Malignant Lung Nodules
By testing the CTC number of new solitary pulmonary nodule patient, evaluating the correlation of CTC number and benign and malignant lung nodules auxiliary diagnosis, the correlation of CTC number and the size of lung nodules of the malignant patients, the correlation between the CTC number and subtypes of malignant lung nodules patients.The CTC and tumor markers will be detected before the patient received treatment. Tumor markers include Pro-GRP, NSE, CEA, CYFRA211, SCC.
Solitary Pulmonary Nodule
The number of circulating tumor cells will be detected in baseline by Immunomagnetic negative screening and targeted polymerase chain reaction(PCR) method., The 3 mL of blood will be taked with each patient for CTCs detection., 1 months
The concentration of the tumor marker of pro gastrin releasing peptide(Pro-GRP) will be detected in baseline by Electrochemical luminescence., The 2 mL of serum will be extracted., 1 months|The concentration of the tumor marker of neurone specific enolase(NSE) will be detected in baseline by Electrochemical luminescence., The 2 mL of serum will be extracted., 1 months|The concentration of the tumor marker of carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA) will be detected in baseline by Electrochemical luminescence., The 2 mL of serum will be extracted., 1 months|The concentration of the tumor marker of cytokeratin 19 fragments(CYFRA211) will be detected in baseline by Electrochemical luminescence., The 2 mL of serum will be extracted., 1 months|The concentration of the tumor marker of squamous cell carcinoma antigen(SCC) will be detected in baseline by Electrochemical luminescence., The 2 mL of serum will be extracted., 1 months
