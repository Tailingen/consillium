A Study of Laparoscopic Middle Hepatic Vein Guidance and Traditional Anatomic Hemihepatectomy
The study, entitled "RCT study of laparoscopic middle hepatic venous guidance versus conventional ananatomical hemihepatectomy", was designed to compare the efficacy of two different ananatomical hemihepatectomy procedures under laparoscopy.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: laparoscopic middle hepatic vein guidance anatomic hemihepatectomy
Survival rate, follow-up after the surgery every 3 months, to understand statistics 1-year overall survival、3-year overall survival、1-year disease-free survival、3-year disease-free survival, 3 years
Perioperative results, the angle of hepatic vein between segment Ⅳ b and Ⅴ, angle between MHV and IVC, Duration perioperation(an expected average of 3 days)|intraoperative parameters, blood loss per unit area will be combined to report intraoperative parameters in milliliter/square centimetre(ml/c㎡）, during the operation
Incidence of postoperative complications, hemorrhage,biliary leakage,ascites,intra-abdominal infection,pleural effusion,pulmonary infection,cardiopulmonary insufficiency，liver function failure, Duration hospitalization(an expected average of 7 days)
Backgroud \& Aim:Hepatectomy is the main way to treat all kinds of liver surgical diseases, which can be divided into anatomic hepatectomy and non-anatomic hepatectomy.Among them, anatomic hepatectomy is suitable for primary liver cancer, hepatolithiasis and other benign and malignant diseases;It can be divided into hepatic venous guidance and non-hepatic venous guidance hepatectomy (traditional ananatomical hepatectomy).The aim of this study was to observe and compare the perioperative period and follow-up results of the two different laparoscopic surgical resection methods, and to provide high-level evidence-based medicine evidence for the selection of surgical methods for laparoscopic anatomical hemihepatectomy.
