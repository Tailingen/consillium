Study to Evaluate the Presence of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) in Prostate Cancer Patients Scheduled to Receive Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) Analogues
The intention of this study is to investigate how many patients with prostate cancer, planned to be treated with LHRH analogues without history of surgery or radiotherapy, are suffering from LUTS. In addition the effect of LHRH analogues on the improvement of theses primary LUTS symptoms over time will be investigated.
