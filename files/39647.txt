Envafolimab Combined With GEMOX in First-line Treatment of Advanced GBC
The TOPAZ-1 study compared the advantages and disadvantages of immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-L1 antibody combined with Gem/Cis chemotherapy (Gemcitabine and Cisplatin) and Gem/Cis chemotherapy alone in first-line treatment of advanced biliary tract tumors (BTC, which including gallbladder cancer). It was observed that chemotherapy combined with PD-L1 antibody improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

As a standard first-line chemotherapy regimen for BTC too, Gemox chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) has a median OS of 9.5 months, and non-inferior survival time to Gem/Cis chemotherapy. In addition, Gemox chemotherapy has been widely used in clinical practice because it reduces the requirement on patients' renal function and has good tolerance. Envafolimab is a novel fusion of humanized mono-domain PD-L1 antibody and human IgG Fc fragment, which has shown good efficacy and safety in a variety of solid tumors. It is safe and convenient to administer by subcutaneous injection. However, there is currently no clinical data on Envafolimab combined with GEMOX chemotherapy in patients with advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC).

The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate its efficacy and related safety in patients with GBC. Eligible participants will receive Envafolimab (up to 12 months) plus gemcitabine and cisplatin (up to 6-8 cycles) until progression of radiological disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study, whichever comes first.The primary endpoint was the 6-month PFS rate.
