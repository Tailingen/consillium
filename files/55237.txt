Living Conditions After Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in France
This is an innovative project, allowing to study for the first time the long-term living conditions of patients after diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) from population data in France. Patients will be selected from the three specialized hematology registries in France: Côte-d'Or, Gironde and Basse-Normandie.

This is also one of the first studies to look at epidemiological indicators of net survival after diagnosis of follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, adjusted for clinical factors such as disease stage, therapeutic management, and comorbidities, apart from the standard adjustment factors of age, sex, and time of diagnosis in real life. In addition, the proportion of cured patients will be estimated.

For component 1, this will be the survival analysis on the initial data. For part 2, questionnaires will be sent out followed by a follow-up if necessary one month after the mailing. There is no physical interview nor any specific biological or imaging examination.
