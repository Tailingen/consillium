NAPOLI-2: Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Nanoliposomal Irinotecan in Biliary Cancer
This is a study to evaluate the clinical activity of the combination of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and nanoliposomal irinotecan as second-line treatment in patients with advanced biliary tract cancers following gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy.

Blood for the analysis of circulating tumor DNA as a surrogate marker of disease burden., Correlation of dynamics of circulating tumor DNA change compared with change in CA19-9., 6 months|Archived tumor tissue using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in order to elucidate potential mutational biomarkers predictive of response to fluorouracil, leucovorin, and nanoliposomal irinotecan., Correlation of tumor genetic mutations and protein expression levels with progression-free survival., 6 months
This is a single arm, open label, multicenter phase II study to evaluate the clinical activity of the combination of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and nanoliposomal irinotecan as second-line treatment in patients with advanced biliary tract cancers following gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy. Patients with advanced biliary tract cancers who have adequate performance status and adequate hepatic and renal function will be eligible. Patients may have received adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy prior to enrolling in the trial, but a minimum of 6 months between adjuvant chemotherapy and this current therapy are required. Patients may continue on study as long as they are tolerating treatment and do not have progression of disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria. Response assessments will occur using imaging (CT or MRI) every 8 weeks.
