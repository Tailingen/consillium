Study of Abiraterone Acetate Without Exogenous Glucocorticoids in Men With Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
This study is comparing the safety and effectiveness of abiraterone acetate alone, followed by the addition of prednisone (when the participant's disease worsens or the physician feels it would lessen symptoms of toxicity) versus the current approved treatment regimen which involves the concomitant use of prednisone in conjunction with abiraterone acetate. Additionally, this study is also examining why participants stop responding to treatment with abiraterone acetate by evaluating blood and tissue.
Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: abiraterone acetate
Number of Participants With Toxicities That Required the Addition of Prednisone to Manage Symptoms of Persistent or Severe Mineralocorticoid Excess, Patients requiring prednisone to manage toxicities such as COU-302 any grade or COU-301 grade 3-4 hypertension, hypokalemia and edema per CTCAE v. 4.0 were summarized using frequency and percentage., Patients were on abiraterone acetate up to 57 months and toxicities of mineralocorticoid excess were monitored each cycle (1cycle = 28 days).
Safety and Tolerability Associated With AA Monotherapy and the Addition of Prednisone to AA., Grade 3 or higher toxicities attribution to AA monotherapy with or without prednisone were summarized descriptively., Adverse events were assessed continuously on treatment and up to 30 days after going off treatment (up to 55 months).|Number of Participants Requiring the Addition of Prednisone to Manage Symptoms of Severe Fatigue., Participants initiated treatment with prednisone for ≥grade 3 fatigue were summarized using frequency and percentage., Patients were on abiraterone acetate up to 57 months.|Changes in Serum Concentrations of Corticosteroid Intermediates Between the First and Second Assessment Visits., Percent change in corticosterone level between the first visit and the second visit was summarized by whether patients initiated prednisone for hypertension and hypokalemia., 1 month|Changes in Serum Concentrations of ACTH Between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2., Changes in serum concentrations of ACTH at second assessment referent to the value at the first visit were summarized descriptively., 1 month|Percent Changes in Serum Concentrations of Androgen (Including Testosterone, DHT and Androgen Precursors) Between Cycle 1 and Cycle 2., Change in corticosterone level between cycle 2 and cycle 1 was summarized by whether patients initiated prednisone for hypertension and hypokalemia., 1 month|Changes in BMI Between Cycle 1 and Next Cycle, Changes in BMI between cycle 1 and cycle 2 were summarized descriptively., 1 month|Changes in Hemoglobin-A1c Between Cycle 1 and Next Cycle (Cycle 4), Changes in HbA1c at cycle 1 and next measurement at cycle 4 were summarized descriptively., 3 months|PSA Response and Its Duration to AA Monotherapy., PSA response was defined per PCWG2 criteria (PSA reduction of ≥50%) and duration of PSA response is defined as time from PSA response to PSA progression or death, whichever occurs first., PSA was measured every cycle (up to 25 months)|PSA Response and Its Duration to Addition of Prednisone to AA at Time of PSA Progression on AA Monotherapy., Among those who initiated prednisone due to PSA progression, duration of PSA response was calculated as time from PSA response (PSA reduction ≥50%) to PSA progression or death, whichever occurs first., PSA was measured every cycle (up to 25 months)|Response of Measurable Disease to AA Monotherapy., Radiographic response of measurable disease is defined using RECIST v 1.1 for soft-tissue and visceral disease and PCWG2 for bone disease.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

Response is tabulated descriptively., Imaging was performed every 12 weeks up to 23 months.|Number of Patients Who Received AA Monotherapy and Progressed With Measurable Disease at Pre-study, Radiographic disease progression is defined using RECIST v 1.1 for soft-tissue and visceral disease and PCWG2 for bone disease (2 or more new lesions on bone scan and for the first 12-week assessment, defining disease progression requires a confirmatory scan performed 6 or more weeks later which shows a minimum of 2 additional new lesions)., Imaging was performed every 12 weeks up to 23 months.|Response of Measurable Disease to Addition of Prednisone to AA at Time of PSA Progression on AA Monotherapy., Radiographic response of measurable disease is defined using RECIST v 1.1 for soft-tissue and visceral disease and PCWG2 for bone disease.

Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.

Response is tabulated descriptively., Imaging was performed every 12 weeks up to 23 months.|Number of Patients Who Progressed With Measurable Disease at Pre-study Among Those Who Were Added of Prednisone to AA at Time of PSA Progression on AA Monotherapy., Radiographic response of measurable disease is defined using RECIST v 1.1 for soft-tissue and visceral disease and PCWG2 for bone disease. Due to small number patients, patients who experienced progressive disease were summarized using frequency and time to progression using Kaplan-Meier method was not calculated., Imaging was performed every 12 weeks up to 23 months.|Subsequent Lines of Therapy, Subsequent lines of therapy following study drug discontinuation were not collected for this trial., Data not collected.
Participants will be treated with abiraterone acetate (AA) in 28-day cycles. Participants will be monitored (weekly for the first two cycles, then on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle) for symptoms of persistent or severe mineralocorticoid excess (including hypertension, hypokalemia).

For participants who experience symptoms of persistent or severe hypertension or hypokalemia as detailed in the above schema, prednisone 5 mg by mouth twice daily will be added. We will monitor for other symptoms of AA toxicity to include fluid retention and fatigue.

For participations who tolerate AA monotherapy without the addition of prednisone to manage symptoms of persistent or severe mineralocorticoid excess, prednisone 5 mg by mouth twice daily will be added at Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) progression. Participants will be continued on study until symptomatic or radiographic progression or taken off study for another reason as detailed in protocol.
