A Study of Amolimogene (ZYC101a) in Patients With High Grade Cervical Intraepithelial Lesions of the Uterine Cervix
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amolimogene, in the treatment of patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions of the uterine cervix.
Uterine Cervical Dysplasia
DRUG: Amolimogene|DRUG: Amolimogene|OTHER: Placebo
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 resolution, defined as the histological evaluation of cervical tissue (presence or absence of CIN 2/3 as determined by pathology consensus diagnosis) at the End of Observation (EOO) period., 24 weeks after enrollment.
Histology based on biopsy to determine the proportion of pts. w/resolution of CIN2/3. This is the same as primary efficacy variable in determination of presence or absence of CIN2/3, but excludes pts. with excisional procedure or cytology information., 24 weeks after enrollment.|Histological resolution to normal to examine the proportion of patients with a histology result of "normal" versus "abnormal.", 24 weeks after enrollment.|Clearing or persistence of lesions based on colposcopic findings to examine the proportion of patients with "no lesion" versus "at least one lesion.", 24 weeks after enrollment.|Pap smear cytology., 24 weeks after enrollment.|Clearing or persistence of original human papillomavirus (HPV) subtype as determined by HPV typing to present the number and percent of patients with absence of all HPV., 24 weeks after enrollment.
This is a double-blind study, so neither the patient not the doctor will know which treatment has been assigned.
