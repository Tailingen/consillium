TC as Adjuvant Therapy After Surgery for Locally Recurrent Resectable Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: a Single-arm Clinical Trial
Regarding the application value of capecitabine metronome chemotherapy's regulatory effect on the immune microenvironment in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, many studies in recent years have confirmed that metronome chemotherapy and immunotherapy are safe and effective in resectable recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct a "single-arm clinical study on adjuvant therapy of toripalimab combined with capecitabine after Surgery for locally recurrent resectable nasopharyngeal carcinoma" to explore the efficacy and safety of toripalimab combined with capecitabine as adjuvant therapy after salvage surgery for resectable recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. If this study is confirmed, it is expected to provide a new treatment model for patients with resectable recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

If this study is confirmed, it is expected to provide a new treatment model for patients with resectable recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma.The diagnosis was pathologically confirmed as locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. According to the TNM staging of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (AJCC, 8th Edition, 2018), resectable nasopharyngeal diseases: rT1 (the tumor was confined to the nasopharynx, oropharynx and/or nasal cavity, and did not involve the parapharynx); rT2 (The tumor is confined to the superficial septum beside the pharynx, more than 0.5 cm away from the internal carotid artery) and rT3 (the tumor is confined to the basal wall of the sphenoid sinus, more than 0.5 cm away from the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus); Resectable recurrent regional lymph nodes (rN1-3), without involvement of the anterior vertebral fascia, cervical vertebrae or common carotid artery/internal carotid artery.
