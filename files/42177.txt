First-in-Human Study of FLX925 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, sequential-group, dose-escalation and cohort expansion study evaluating the safety, PK, PD, and antitumor activity of FLX925 in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: FLX925
Safety: Incidence of adverse events, 30 Months|Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of FLX925, 12 Months|Assess the antitumor activity of FLX925 when administered at the RP2D dose, 30 Months
Evaluate the PK profile of FLX925 (maximum concentration (Cmax), time of the maximum measured concentration (Tmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), PK parameters include: maximum concentration (Cmax), time of the maximum measured concentration (Tmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), 30 Months|Assess the effects of FLX925 on pharmacodynamic (PD) markers (changes in FLT3-ITD and FLT3-D835 allelic burden), PD endpoints include: changes in FLT3-ITD and FLT3-D835 allelic burden, status and changes in the cyclin/CDK/Rb pathway, and changes in immune parameters, 30 Months|Characterize tumor control according to clinical disease response assessments per Cheson criteria in subjects receiving FLX925, 30 Months|Explore the relationships of PK and PD parameters to clinical drug activity as defined by clinical disease response assessments per Cheson criteria, 30 Months
