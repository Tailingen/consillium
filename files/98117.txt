Aloxi for Prevention of Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Malignant Glioma Patients Receiving Irinotecan With Bevacizumab
1. Primary Objective:

   * To determine the efficacy and tolerability of palonosetron and dexamethasone in preventing acute CINV in brain tumor patients during the first 24 hours of receiving Irinotecan /Bevacizumab regimens.
2. Secondary Objective

   * To determine the safety and tolerability of palonosetron in brain tumor patients.
   * To determine the effects of glucocorticoid and anticonvulsants on the efficacy of palonosetron.
   * To determine the efficacy of palonosetron and dexamethasone in preventing delayed CINV in brain tumor patients during days 2-5.
   * To determine if patients receiving palonosetron have less fatigue than baseline.
Brain Cancer
DRUG: Palonosetron (Aloxi) and Dexamethasone
Acute CINV (Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting) CR (Complete Response) Rate, Acute Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) complete response (CR) rate is defined as the percentage of patients who do not have an emetic episode or use antiemetic rescue medication during the first 24 hours following chemotherapy of the first cycle of treatment., first 24 hours of the first week of chemotherapy
Acute Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) Complete Response (CR) Rate by Corticosteroid Use at Baseline, Acute Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) complete response (CR) rate is defined as the percentage of patients who do not have an emetic episode or use antiemetic rescue medication during the first 24 hours following chemotherapy of the first cycle of treatment., Day 1 of the first week of chemotherapy|Acute Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) Complete Response (CR) Rate by Anticoagulant Use at Baseline, Acute Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) complete response (CR) rate is defined as the percentage of patients who do not have an emetic episode or use antiemetic rescue medication during the first 24 hours following chemotherapy of the first cycle of treatment., Day 1 of the first week of chemotherapy|Delayed Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) Complete Response (CR) Rate, Delayed Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) complete response (CR) rate is defined as the percentage of patients who do not have an emetic episode or use antiemetic rescue medication during days 2 through 5 of chemotherapy treatment during the first cycle of treatment, Days 2-5 of the first week of chemotherapy|Percentage of Patients With ≥ Grade 3, Treatment-related Toxicities, Percentage of patients with ≥ grade 3, treatment-related toxicities using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0., 6 weeks|Overall Mean Change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score From Baseline to Day 5 of the First Week of Chemotherapy, Overall mean change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score from baseline to day 5 of the first week of chemotherapy. The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item validated questionnaire assessing the impact of fatigue on an individual's quality of life. The raw score range is 0-52 with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The mean change from baseline to day 5 was calculated by subtracting the baseline score from mean of the day 1-5 scores, thus a negative mean change represents worsening in quality of life due to fatigue., Baseline through day 5 of the first week of chemotherapy|Overall Mean Change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Score From Baseline to Day 5 of the First Week of Chemotherapy by Acute Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV) Complete Response (CR), Overall mean change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score from baseline to day 5 of the first week of chemotherapy. The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item validated questionnaire assessing the impact of fatigue on an individual's quality of life. The raw score range is 0-52 with higher scores indicating better quality of life. The mean change from baseline to day 5 was calculated by subtracting the baseline score from the mean of the day 1-5 scores, thus a negative mean change represents worsening in quality of life due to fatigue. Acute CINV complete response (CR) is defined as not having an emetic episode or any use of antiemetic rescue medication during the first 24 hours following chemotherapy of the first cycle of treatment., Baseline through day 5 of the first week of chemotherapy
Before the patients receive the palonosetron, a physical exam and blood tests are performed to determine eligibility. If eligible and willing, subjects are given Palonosetron intravenously. Subjects are given the Palonosetron and Dexamethasone 30 minutes before the first dose of Irinotecan and Bevacizumab chemotherapy. The total expected duration of participation is 57 days. Subjects are also asked to complete 4 questionnaires about nausea and vomiting, as well as daily functioning and fatigue. Subjects are asked to complete these questionnaires before starting chemotherapy, the day of starting chemotherapy and for the next 4 days after receiving chemotherapy, for a total of 6 times. Subjects are asked to complete this set of questionnaires each of the 3 times that they receive chemotherapy during the 6-week treatment cycle.

The other treatments subjects would normally receive for their brain tumor and their routine care are not affected by the study.
