A Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Reduction Intervention for Native American Men
This clinical trial develops and tests a culturally-appropriate educational program (Indigenous SIPin) for reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption in men affiliated with Native American athletics communities. Sugary drinks are drinks like pop, soda, and juice. Increased sugar consumption may lead to an increased risk of chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, some types of obesity-related cancers, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and dental decay. A culturally sensitive program may help reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption in Native American men
