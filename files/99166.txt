Perioperative Symptom Study of Lung Cancer (CN-PRO-Lung 1)
Investigators propose a multicenter prospective observational cohort study to develop and validate essential technical parameters for establishing the patient-reported outcome-based perioperative symptom management cohort in patients with lung cancer. With at least 300 patients with initial diagnosis of lung cancer and scheduled for surgery, this study will administer symptom assessments (MDASI-LC) and quality of life assessments (SIQOL) before surgery (typically within 3 days before surgery), daily after surgery (in hospital ≤ 14 days), and weekly after discharge, up to 4 weeks (±3 days) or the start day of postoperative oncologic treatment. In the upgraded research protocol, symptom and quality of life assessments (every 3 month for 1 year, every 6 month for 2-3 year, every 12 month for 4-5 year), as well as the follow-up of clinical outcomes will continue until 5 years after surgery.
Patient-reported Outcomes
Perioperative symptom burden (severity, freqency and impact on daily functioning) measured by MDASI-LC, We will use MD Anderson Symptom Inventory lung cancer module (MDASI-LC) to longitudinally assess the perioperative symptom burden for lung cancer patients. The symptom burden will be profiled as symptom severity, frequency of moderate to severe symptom and its interference with daily functioning., less than 6 weeks
