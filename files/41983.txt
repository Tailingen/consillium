DDR Genes Alteration and Response to Platinum-based Chemotherapy in Advanced Urothelial Cancer.
This study aims to prospectively observe whether certain alterations in some genes related to the DNA repair mechanism are related to better response to platinum-based chemotherapy used to treat metastatic bladder or urothelial cancers.
Bladder (Urothelial, Transitional Cell) Cancer Metastatic or Unresectable|Upper Tract Urothelial Cancer
DRUG: Platinum + Gemcitabine|DRUG: Avelumab first-line maintenance|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: NGS test for DDR alterations
Overall Response Rate (ORR) by DDR group., The difference in ORR defined as the percentage of patients who achieve PR or CR as measured by RECIST 1.1, to the platinum-based chemotherapy between patients with metastatic or locally advanced urothelial cancer with or without DDR genes alterations., Six months
Progression Free Survival (PFS) by DDR group., The PFS defined as the time elapsed from start of investigational treatment to the documentation of investigator-assessed disease progression, according to RECIST 1.1 \[22\], or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first in patients with or without DDR genes alterations., 12 months|Overall Survival (OS) by DDR group., The OS is defined as time elapsed from start of treatment to the date of death due to any cause in patients with or without DDR genes alterations., 12 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) by treatment group., The ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve PR or CR as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria in patients with or without DDR genes alterations between those treated with carboplatin o cisplatin., six months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) by treatment group., The disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve stable disease (SD), or PR or CR as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria in patients treated with carboplatin o cisplatin., six months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) by DDR group., The disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve stable disease (SD), or PR or CR as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria in patients with or without DDR genes alterations., six months|Treatment-related toxicity, The treatment-related toxicity will be evaluated by the incidence of chemo-related adverse events in patients with or without DDR genes alterations graded according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0., 12 months.
Expression of PDL1, This is the description of the rate of patients with positive expression of the marker over the study population., six months|Expression of Nectin-4, This is the description of the rate of patients with positive expression of the marker over the study population., six months|Expression of Trop-2, This is the description of the rate of patients with positive expression of the marker over the study population., six months|Expression of Her-2, This is the description of the rate of patients with positive expression of the marker over the study population., six months
