Observational Study for SIR-Spheres Therapy for the Treatment of HCC Patients in China
Yttrium-90 (y90) Microsphere Injection Solution was approved by the NMPA in 2022. Currently, there is a lack of summary of real-world data in China. Therefore, this retrospective real-world study is intented to explore the characteristics and efficacy of HCC patients treated with y90 in China, aiming to provide reference for guiding and optimizing clinical practices and subsequent confirmatory clinical studies for the treatment of HCC patients in China.
