Randomized Study of Docetaxel +/- Vandetanib in Metastatic TCC
In this research study the investigators are looking to see if the combination of docetaxel plus Vandetanib is effective in the treatment of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug that kills cancer cells that are dividing. It is widely used in TCC. Vandetanib is a drug that is believed to stop new blood vessels from forming around cancer cells. The combination of docetaxel and Vandetanib has been studied in people with lung cancer and found to be helpful in killing cancer cells. Thus, this study is looking at people with TCC, to see if the combination of docetaxel plus Vandetanib is better or worse then docetaxel alone.

Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the time between randomization and documented disease progression (PD) per RECIST 1.0 criteria or death, or is censored at time of last disease assessment. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Disease evaluations occurred at week 6 and 12 and thereafter every 3 cycles/9 weeks on treatment and every 3 months in follow-up. Participants were followed until PD, death or lost to follow-up. Median survival follow-up was 12 months (range 1-26).
Grade 3-5 Toxicity Rate, Grade 3-5 toxicity rate is the percentage of participants experiencing maximum grade of all toxicity types of grade 3-5 with any attribution on treatment during the randomized phase., Assessed each cycle throughout treatment from time of first dose and up to day 30 post-treatment. Median treatment duration for this study cohort approximated 2 cycles (range 1-31).|Median Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined from date of randomization to date of death or censored at the date the patient was last known alive., Off treatment, patients were followed for survival information every 6 months (Â±1 month) until death,up to 2 years after discontinuing therapy, or until lost to follow-up. Median survival follow-up for the study cohort was 12 months (95% CI: 9-18 months).|Objective Response Rate, Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a confirmed overall partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) using RECIST criteria on treatment during the randomized phase. Patients without measurable disease only at baseline are included, based on status of non-target lesions.Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria are first met. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions., Disease evaluations occurred at week 6 and 12 and thereafter every 3 cycles/9 weeks on treatment. Median treatment duration for this study cohort approximated 2 cycles (range 1-31).
* Because no one knows which of the study options is best, and all of the options are considered equally likely to work, participants will be randomized into one of two study groups: docetaxel plus Vandetanib or docetaxel plus placebo.
* Each treatment cycle lasts three weeks during which time the participant will be taking Vandetanib or placebo once a day, every day. On Day 1 of each cycle (a cycle is 21 days), participants will receive docetaxel as an infusion through a vein in the arm over one hour.
* On Day 1 of every cycle the following tests and procedures will be performed: physical exam and blood tests. On day 1 and on Day 8 of the first cycle only, participants will have an ECG. Every 6-9 weeks (every 2 to 3 cycles), the participants tumor will be assessed by x-ray, CT scan, bone scan, and/or MRI.
