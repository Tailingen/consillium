This registry is prospective, multi-center, observational study and will collect efficacy and safety data on multiple myeloma adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy and take REVLIMID as part of standard care associated with patients' treatment in order to characterize the use, efficacy and outcomes of REVLIMID treatment.
