Radiation and Androgen Ablation for Prostate Cancer
A study to see how effective and tolerable radiation therapy along with androgen deprivation therapy is in treating prostate cancer.
Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate
RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)
Biochemical failure free-rate, To assess 5-year biochemical failure free rate (BFFR) associated with image-guided radiation therapy in doses of 7.25 Gy every other day to a total dose of 36.25 Gy (5 fractions) along with 4 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) neoadjuvantly and concurrently., 1, 2, 3, 6 12, 18. 24, 30, 36 mont, 4 year and 5 year follow-up points after treatment has been completed
Various Control Rate Assessments, Assess biochemical, clinical, and pathologic control rates associated with the combined hypofractionated dose regimen and ADT., 1 year|Dose Volume/ Imaging Data Assessments, Collect dose/volume and imaging data to allow normal tissue complication probability modeling and targeting assessment for patients treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy., 1 year|Biomarker Studies, Collect whole blood to perform correlative studies for serum cytokine profiling and future biomarker studies., 1 year|Gastrointestinal (GI) and Genitourinary (GU toxicity) assessment, 1) Assess the incidence of grade 3 or greater GU (genitourinary) and GI (gastrointestinal) toxicity with image-guided radiation therapy in doses of 7.25 Gy every other day to a total dose of 36.25 Gy (5 fractions) along with 4 months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) neoadjuvantly and concurrently., 1 year
This will be a Phase I/II study evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of a combined regimen of 7.25 Gy every other day fractions to a total dose of 36.25 Gy (total of 5 fractions) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for 4 months total.
