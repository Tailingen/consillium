Initial Feasibility Study to Treat Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer With a Planar LDR Source
Initial study to evaluate local control and the preferred method of attachment of the CivaSheet in the setting of suspected close or positive margins at the time of surgical tumor removal.
Pancreatic Cancer
DEVICE: Directional Brachytherapy Source Implant
Safety of CivaSheet Radiation Treatement, Patients will be monitored for any adverse radiation toxicity effects from the CivaSheet device., 1 Year
Efficacy of CivaSheet Radiation Treatment, Patients will be monitored for one year to determine the local cancer recurrence rate, 1 Year|Morbidity of patients following surgery and radiation, 2 year survival rates for patients post surgery and CivaSheet radiation treatment, 2 Year|Post Operative Radiation Dosimetry Calculation, Post procedure 3D treatment planning will be performed to determine if the radiation dose delivered was satisfactory, 1 Month|Length of Hospital Stay, Length of hospital stay will be monitored to determine if CivaSheet radiation treatment alters the typical length of hospital stay for patients after surgery., 1 Month
This is a Feasibility study to determine the safety and efficacy of a new brachytherapy device that provides unidirectional radiation which utilizes active components (Palladium-103) of standard devices in a novel configuration.This pilot study may benefit pancreatic cancer patients by reducing the radiation dose to adjacent critical structures, while giving a therapeutic dose to diseased tissue, such as at a surgical margin. The appropriate dose and local control rate will be recorded the primary endpoint in order to provide an efficacy assessment.
