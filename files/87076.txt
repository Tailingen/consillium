A Study Comparing Tarlatamab, Durvalumab, Carboplatin, and Etoposide Versus Durvalumab, Carboplatin, and Etoposide in First-line Extensive Stage Small-Cell Lung Cancer (ES-SCLC)
The main objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of tarlatamab in combination with durvalumab, carboplatin and etoposide to the combination of durvalumab, carboplatin and etoposide on prolonging overall survival (OS).
