A Phase IIa. Open-label, Multicenter, Dose-escalation Study to Assess the Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ZD4054 (Zibotentan) Given Orally Once Daily in Subjects With Metastatic Prostate Cancer
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safest dose of ZD4054 (Zibotentan)in men with prostate cancer
Prostatic Neoplasms|Metastases, Neoplasm
DRUG: ZD4054 10 mg|DRUG: ZD4054 15 mg|DRUG: ZD4054 22.5 mg
Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT is defined as experiencing Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 3 or 4 headache with onset within 24 h of receiving ZD4054, CTC grade 2 rhinitis leading to the withdrawal of the subject, or other CTC grade 3 or 4 toxicity that was considered to be related to ZD4054 treatment.

The numbers of patients with a DLT are reported., Baseline to Day 29.
Total Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Concentration, Total Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) concentration at Day 15 (14 doses of study treatment per patient - no dose was administered on Day 2)., Baseline to Day 15.|Change in Total Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), Percentage change in total Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) (ng/mL) from baseline to Day 15 (14 doses of study treatment per patient - no dose was administered on Day 2).

Percentage change = \[(measure at Day 15 - measure at baseline)/measure at baseline\]\*100, Baseline to Day 15.|Change in Serum Concentration of Bone Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Percentage change in serum concentration of Bone Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) (ng/mL) from baseline to Day 15 (14 doses of study treatment per patient - no dose was administered on Day 2). Percentage change = \[(measure at Day 15 - measure at baseline)/measure at baseline\]\*100, Baseline to Day 15.|Change in Serum Concentration of Procollagen Type I N Propeptide (PINP), Percentage change in serum concentration of Procollagen Type I N Propeptide (PINP) (ng/mL) from baseline to Day 15 (14 doses of study treatment per patient - no dose was administered on Day 2).

Percentage change = \[(measure at Day 15 - measure at baseline)/measure at baseline\]\*100, Baseline to Day 15.|Change in Serum Concentration of C-Terminal Telopeptide of Type I Collagen (CTx), Percentage change in serum concentration of C-Terminal Telopeptide of Type I Collagen (CTx) (ng/mL) from baseline to Day 15 (14 doses of study treatment per patient - no dose was administered on Day 2). Percentage change = \[(measure at Day 15 - measure at baseline)/measure at baseline\]\*100, Baseline to Day 15.|Change in Urine Concentration of Type I Collagen-Cross Linked N Telopeptide (NTx), Percentage change in urine concentration of Type I Collagen-Cross Linked N Telopeptide (NTx) (nmol BCE/mmol Creatinine) from baseline to Day 15 (14 doses of study treatment per patient - no dose was administered on Day 2). Percentage change = \[(measure at Day 15 - measure at baseline)/measure at baseline\]\*100, Baseline to Day 15.
