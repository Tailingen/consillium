Exploring the Activity of RAD001 in Vestibular Schwannomas and Meningiomas
The primary objective is to estimate the proportions of vestibular schwannomas (VS) and meningiomas after 10 days of exposure to the study drug RAD001 at a dose of 10 mg daily, as determined by immunohistochemistry. This is a "phase 0" PK (pharmacokinetic) and PD (pharmacodynamic) study of RAD001 in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 2-related and sporadic VS and meningiomas. Enrolled patients will take RAD001 prior to a scheduled VS or meningioma surgery, and blood and tissue samples will be obtained for further analysis.
Neurofibromatosis Type 2|Vestibular Schwannomas|Meningiomas
DRUG: RAD001
Proportions of VS and meningiomas after exposure to RAD001, 1) To estimate the proportions of VS and meningiomas with complete inhibition of phospho-S6 after10 days of exposure to RAD001 at a dose of 10 mg daily, as determined by immunohistochemistry. This endpoint was chosen based on prior pharmacodynamic data from a published trial, showing complete inhibition of phospho-S6 in solid tumor tissue of patients treated with RAD001 and our own preliminary data confirming baseline phospho-S6 expression in VS and meningiomas., 10 days
