Use of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Early-Stage, Palpable Node-Positive HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer Having Upfront Surgery and Adjuvant Radiation
The purpose of this study is to find out how often the researchers can avoid an ALND in patients with early-stage, node-positive HR+/HER2- breast cancer who are having upfront surgery. The study researchers think that, if AUS before surgery can help identify people who may have up to 3 affected lymph nodes, it will be possible to perform the less radical standard SLNB during surgery.
