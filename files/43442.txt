RVU120 (SEL120) in Patients with Relapse/Refractory Metastatic or Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1/2, dose-escalation and expansion study investigating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of RVU120 (SEL120) in patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors progressing from previous lines of therapy.

The dose-escalation phase (Part 1) will be followed by an expansion phase (Part 2). Part 1 will evaluate the safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of RVU120 (SEL120) administered as a single dose every other day (7 doses in a 3 week cycle). Part 2 will collect additional data on safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy at the recommended dose in patients with tumor types selected in Part 1.
