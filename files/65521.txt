Evaluation of Three Strategies Based on Vaginal Self-sampling Kit Send to Home of Unscreened Women for Cervical Cancer
Despite the existence of an effective screening test (pap smear), cervical cancer is, every year in France, the cause of more than 3,000 new cases and 1,100 deaths. But, in France, 4 in 10 women are not screened or not often enough (nearly 7 millions women). It is therefore necessary to develop new strategies to reach these women. The etiological factor of this cancer is persistent infection with High-Risk Human PapillomaVirus (HR-HPV). Thereby, HPV-based tests could be alternative screening tests. Vaginal self-sampling with HR-HPV test is simpler and less intrusive than the pap smear. It has been shown that sending vaginal self-sampling kit (with HPV test) to unscreened women's home is a powerful means to increase the participation rate of cervical cancer screening. It seems interesting to explore methods to increase the efficiency of this strategy by optimizing the ratio of the number of kits used compared to the number of kits sent. Two approaches will be tested: a system "available on request" of the kit and / or the addition of an SMS (Short Message Service) reminder.
Cervical Cancer Screening|Cervical Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Self-sampling kit sent at home|BEHAVIORAL: Self-sampling kit sent at home + SMS reminder|BEHAVIORAL: Letter offering a self-sampling kit "on request"+ SMS reminder|BEHAVIORAL: SMS offering a self-sampling kit "on request"+ SMS reminder
Participation / no participation to complete cervical cancer screening, Complete cervical cancer screening is defined as one of the followings :

* perform a pap smear
* perform a vaginal self-sampling with negative HR-HPV test
* perform a vaginal self-sampling with noninterpretable HR-HPV test result followed by a control pap smear (nine-month extension to do the pap smear after the sending of the HPV result)
* perform a vaginal self-sampling with positive HR-HPV test result followed by a control pap smear (nine-month extension to do the pap smear after the sending of the HPV result), 9 months after postal mail (with or without the kit) or SMS
