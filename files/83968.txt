Potential Predictive Biomarkers in Patients Undergoing First-line Chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Chemoresistance remains an obstacle in treating people with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue in the laboratory from patients with mCRC receiving chemotherapy may help doctors understand the effect of chemotherapy on biomarkers. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate biomarkers in chemotherapy regimens for first-line chemotherapy for mCRC.
