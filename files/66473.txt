SNV1521 in Participants with Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is testing a new medicine, SNV1521, for people with advanced cancers. The researchers want to find out if SNV1521 is safe, well-tolerated, and effective in treating solid tumors. They are investigating different doses in order to find the most effective and safe one. They are also investigating whether it can be combined with other cancer therapies.
