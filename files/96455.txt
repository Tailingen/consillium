Study of Oral Administration of LP-168 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Malignancies.
This is a phase I, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of LP-168 in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. LP-168 is a small molecule inhibitor.

DRUG: LP-168|DRUG: LP-168
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), When more than 1 DLT occurs in ≤ 6 subjects in a dosing cohort, dose escalation will be stopped and this dose level will be identified as the non-tolerated dose. Doses between the non-tolerated dose and the preceding lower dose, where ≤ 1 DLT occurred, may be explored to more precisely define the MTD., Up to 24 months, each cycle is 28 days|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), The RP2D may be as high as the MTD or a lower dose and will be selected in discussion with the Investigators and the Sponsor based on longer term safety data, preliminary efficacy data, and PK data., Up to 24 months, each cycle is 28 days|Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LP-168, Maximum Plasma Concentration \[Cmax\], At Cycle 1: Day 1, Day 2, Day 8, Day 9, Day 15, Day 22, Day 28; At Cycle 3: Day 28; At Cycle 6 Day 28; (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LP-168, Area Under the Curve \[AUC\], At Cycle 1: Day 1, Day 2, Day 8, Day 9, Day 15, Day 22, Day 28; At Cycle 3: Day 28; At Cycle 6 Day 28; (each cycle is 28 days|Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LP-168, Time at Maximum Concentration \[Tmax\], At Cycle 1: Day 1, Day 2, Day 8, Day 9, Day 15, Day 22, Day 28; At Cycle 3: Day 28; At Cycle 6 Day 28; (each cycle is 28 days
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the time of first study drug administration until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented., Up to 24 months, each cycle is 28 days|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the sum of complete response (CR) and partial remission rates., Up to 24 months, each cycle is 28 days|Duration of Response (DOR), The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (which is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, Up to 24 months, each cycle is 28 days
The primary objectives for the study are to assess the safety and tolerability profile, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LP-168 administered once or twice daily as a single agent dosed orally in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell Malignancies (CLL/SLL, WM, FL, MCL, MZL, DLBCL, HCL); and to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LP-168 in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell Malignancies (CLL/SLL, WM, FL, MCL, MZL, DLBCL, HCL).

Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate preliminary efficacy regarding the effect of LP-168 on progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell Malignancies (CLL/SLL, WM, FL, MCL, MZL, DLBCL, HCL).

Once the MTD is declared and the RP2D is established, additional subjects will be enrolled in a cohort expansion phase (Phase 1b).
