Study of Cetuximab in Combination With Chemotherapy in Patients With Recurrent and/or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN)
The primary objective of this trial is to assess the antitumor activity of cetuximab when given in combination with cisplatin + 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) for the first-line treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in Japanese subjects.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Cisplatin/Carboplatin|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil
Best Overall Response (BOR) According to Modified World Health Organization (WHO) Criteria, Percentage of participants experiencing a complete response \[CR\] (complete disappearance of measurable and evaluable disease without new lesions) or partial response \[PR\] (greater than or equal to 50 percent decrease in the sum of the products of diameters \[SOPD\] of index lesions compared to the baseline SOPD, with no evidence of PD) confirmed by a subsequent assessment no less than 28 days after criteria for response were first met based on modified WHO criteria as assessed by Independent Review Committee (IRC)., Evaluations performed every 6 weeks until progressive disease (PD) reported between day of first participant treated, until cut-off date, 02 March 2011
Best Overall Response (BOR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Criteria, Percentage of participants with objective response based assessment of confirmed CR or confirmed PR according to RECIST as assessed by IRC. CR are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 28 days after initial documentation of response. PR are those with greater than or equal to 30 percent decrease in the SOPD of index lesions compared to the baseline SOPD, with no evidence of PD., Evaluations performed every 6 weeks until PD reported between day of first participant treated, until cut-off date, 02 March 2011|Disease Control Rate, Percentage of participants experiencing a CR (complete disappearance of measurable and evaluable disease without new lesions) or PR (\>=50 percent decrease in sum of the products of diameters \[SOPD\] of index lesions compared to baseline SOPD, with no evidence of PD) confirmed by subsequent assessment no less than 28 days after criteria for response were first met) or stable disease \[SD\] (neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD) at least once no less than 42 days after first dose of trial treatment based on modified WHO criteria as assessed by IRC., Evaluations performed every 6 weeks until PD reported between day of first participant treated, until cut-off date, 02 March 2011|Duration of Response, Duration of response according to modified WHO criteria as assessed by IRC was defined as the time from the first assessment of CR or PR until the date of the first occurrence of PD, or until the date of death when death occurred within 60 days of the last tumor assessment or first administration of trial treatment (whichever was last)., Time from first assessment of CR or PR to PD, death or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first participant treated, until cut-off date, 02 March 2011|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time, The PFS time according to modified WHO criteria as assessed by IRC was defined as duration from first administration of trial treatment until PD (radiological or clinical, if radiological progression is not available) or death due to any cause. Only deaths within 60 days of last tumor assessment are considered. Participants without event are censored on the date of last tumor assessment., Time from first administration of trial treatment to PD, death or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first participant treated, until cut-off date, 02 March 2011|Overall Survival (OS) Time, Time from first administration of trial treatment to death. Participants without event are censored at the last date known to be alive or at the clinical cut-off date, whatever is earlier., Time from first administration of trial treatment or last day known to be alive, reported between day of first participant treated, until cut-off date, 02 March 2011|Time to Treatment Failure, Time to treatment failure according to modified WHO criteria as assessed by IRC was defined as the time from first administration of trial treatment until the date of the first occurrence of one of the events defining treatment failure: PD assessed by the investigator, discontinuation of treatment due to PD, discontinuation of treatment due to an adverse event (AE), start of any new anticancer therapy, or withdrawal of consent or death within 60 days of the last tumor assessment or first administration of trial treatment., Time from first administration of trial treatment to treatment failure or last tumor assessment, reported between day of first participant treated, until cut-off date, 02 March 2011
