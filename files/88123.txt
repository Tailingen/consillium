Safety and Modulation of Adaptive Immunity by Iscador速 Qu Viscum Album Extract in Patients With Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic Cancers Treated With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
The main objective of this study is to test if adding the mistletoe extract Iscador速 Qu to regular cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors affects:

* The immune system's ability to fight cancer
* Safety of the treatment
* How well the treatment performs against cancer
* How the patient feels during treatment

Researchers will compare patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors plus Iscador速 Qu with patients treated with imune checkpoint inhibitors only.

The impact of mistletoe preparations - that are claimed to have immunostimulatory properties - on cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, the current study aims to investigate the modulation of adaptive immunity through the combination of Iscador (a specific mistletoe preparation) and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, researchers will evaluate the safety profile of this combination therapy in patients with locally advanced non-operable or metastatic cancers except for skin cancers. By examining the modulation of adaptive immunity and safety of this treatment approach, researchers aim to provide valuable insights for clinicians and patients in the context of advanced cancer care.
