This phase 1/2 study evaluates the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary antitumor activity of COM701 an inhibitor of poliovirus receptor related immunoglobulin domain containing (PVRIG) in combination with BMS-986207 (an inhibitor of TIGIT) and nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study will consist of 2 parts (part 1 - dose escalation and part 2 - dose expansion).

Part 1: escalating doses of COM701 will be combined with fixed doses of BMS-986207 and nivolumab. Upon completion of dose escalation a recommended dose of COM701 in combination with BMS-986207 and nivolumab (3-drug combination) will be determined.

Part 2: subjects will be administered the recommended dose of COM701 in combination with BMS-986207 and nivolumab. Subjects will be enrolled into one of three cohorts based on their cancer type.

Cohort 1: subjects with platinum resistant/refractory ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer will receive study treatment with the 3-drug combination.

Cohort 2: subjects with MSS- endometrial cancer will receive study treatment with the 3-drug combination.

Cohort 3 (Basket cohort): subjects with tumors that have high expression of a biomarker (PVRL2) will receive study treatment with the 3-drug combination. Subjects with tumor types in cohorts 1, 2 and 4 will not be enrolled into this cohort.

Cohort 4: subjects with HNSCC. This cohort will enroll subjects who have received treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor or subjects who have received treatment with chemotherapy but not an immune checkpoint inhibitor. All subjects enrolled in this cohort will receive study treatment with the 3-drug combination.
