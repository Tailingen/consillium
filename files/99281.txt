Intrathecal Double Checkpoint Inhibition
The objective of the present study is to determine the feasibility and to explore anti-tumor activity of intrathecal double immune checkpoint inhibition for patients with newly diagnosed leptomeningeal metastases from non-small cell lung cancer without driver mutation or melanoma.
Leptomeningeal Metastasis|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IV|Melanoma Stage IV
DRUG: intrathecal nivolumab and intrathecal ipilimumab
Recommended phase II dose of intrathecal (IT) nivolumab/ipilimumab followed by IT nivolumab/ipilimumab plus systemic nivolumab/ipilimumab, Determination of the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended phase II dose for combined intrathecal immunotherapy, 3 weeks
steroid intake, steroid intake in mg dexamethasone at each assessment, through study completion, an average of 1 year|compartmental efficacy (PFS) of nivolumab/ipilimumab combined with systemic nivolumab/ipilimumab, progression free survival in months by compartments level (leptomeningeal compartment, brain compartment, central nervous system compartment, extra-central nervous system compartment, overall compartment), through study completion, an average of 1 year|compartmental efficacy (response) of nivolumab/ipilimumab combined with systemic nivolumab/ipilimumab, response rate in percentage by compartments level (leptomeningeal compartment, brain compartment, central nervous system compartment, extra-central nervous system compartment, overall compartment), through study completion, an average of 1 year|efficacy of nivolumab/ipilimumab combined with systemic nivolumab/ipilimumab, overall survival in months, through study completion, an average of 1 year|prognostic factors, association between survival and prognostic factors. The list of items to analyze will be determined prior to the analysis to consider potential new data available in the literature. The analysis will be performed in the whole population, per cerebrospinal fluid cytology assessment at diagnosis (positive cerebrospinal fluid cytology versus equivocal or negative cerebrospinal fluid cytology); per tumor entity (non-small cell lung cancer versus melanoma), through study completion, an average of 1 year
The treatment regimen within the IT-IO study consists of intrathecal administration of nivolumab/ipilimumab in combination with systemic combined nivolumab/ipilimumab.

The scheme of administration of systemic nivolumab/ipilimumab corresponds to the current standard of care for non-small cell lung cancer and for melanoma patients.
