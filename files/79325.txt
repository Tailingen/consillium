Effect of Remote Ischemic Preconditioning on Lung Injury After Pulmonary Resection
The purpose of this study is to determine whether ischemic preconditioning reduces lung injury in patients undergoing pulmonary resection.
Lung Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: remote ischemic preconditioning
Limb remote ischemic preconditioning has effective protection of lung injury in patients undergoing pulmonary lobectomy, PaO2/FiO2 in the limb RIPC group was significantly higher than that in the control group at 30 and 60 min after OLV, 30 min and 6 h after operation (all P\<0.05), June,2013
Cs and Cd, Cs and Cd in limb RIPC group were significantly higher than those in the control group at 30 and 60 min after OLV (all P\<0.05), June,2013|IL-6 and TNF-α, The IL-6 levels in the limb RIPC group were lower than those in the control group at 30 min, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after operation (all P\<0.05), and there was a significant difference in TNF-α level between the groups (P\<0.01)., June,2013
Remote ischemic preconditioning is an intervention in which brief ischemia of one tissue or organ protects remote organs from a sustained episode of ischemia. It is known that one-lung ventilation in patients undergoing pulmonary resection, which may cause acute lung injury. The investigators did a single-blinded randomised controlled study to establish whether remote ischemic preconditioning reduces lung injury in these patients.
