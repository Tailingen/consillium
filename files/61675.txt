A Study of Nab-paclitaxel-based Doublet as First Line Therapy in Patients With Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP)
Agnostos Trial is a multicentric phase 2 randomized trial with a 'pick-the-winner design' in chemonaive patients with cancer of unknown primary. It will assess the efficacy of the two best active single agent - carboplatin or gemcitabine - added to an innovative taxane back bone (nab-Paclitaxel). Agnostos trial is a part of a larger clinical and translational initiative to improve the outlook of patients with cancer of unknown primary through evaluation of novel chemotherapeutic regimens.
Unknown Primary Tumors
DRUG: nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Objective response rate (ORR) as evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 guidelines., 42 months
duration of response according to RECIST version 1.1., 42 months|time to progression, 42 months|overall survival, 42 months|toxicity according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events - CTCAE version 4.03., 42 months
Treatment-na√Øve patients with CUP diagnosis confirmed according to CUP Diagnostic Guidelines, will be enrolled into AGNOSTOS trial. Patients will be randomized upfront to receive a nab-paclitaxel-based duplet adding either carboplatin or gemcitabine until progression or unacceptable toxicity (randomization 1:1, n= 120; 60 per arm).
