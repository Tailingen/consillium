Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With a Combination of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin (CaelyxÂ®) and Paclitaxel in Breast Cancer
In this study, PLD, an anthracycline encapsulated in stealth liposomes, which are believed to efficiently deliver the doxorubicin within the tumour mass with less toxicity compared with standard doxorubicin formulation was used. The study aimed to determine whether the combination of PLD-docetaxel would increase tumour response in patients with breast cancer.
