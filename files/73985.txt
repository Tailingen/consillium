International, prospective, single arm, multicenter and observational Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF).

The overall objective of this study is to collect preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative (at 9 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years) data on the clinical complications and functional outcomes of the study devices to demonstrate safety and performance in a real-world setting.

The primary objective is to demonstrate that the use of the study devices is safe.

The secondary objective is to demonstrate that the use of the study devices decreases the pain, and improves the quality of life and the daily activities of the subjects.
