Phase 2 Study Applying MRD Techniques for Participants With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Treated With D-VRd Prior To and After High-dose Therapy Followed by ASCT - TAURUS
This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label, Phase 2 study in mutiple myeloma with newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve participants for whom high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation is part of the intended treatment plan. The study is evaluating a technique called Mass Spectrometry Minimal Residual Disease (MS-MRD) using blood samples and compares it with the minimal residual disease (MRD) technique using bone marrow samples.

Proportion (%) of agreement and disagreement in the MRD measurements in BM (by NGS-MRD) and in the MRD measurements in peripheral blood (by MS-MRD) at post-consolidation., The proportion (%) of agreement will be defined as the total number of concordant cases (i.e., MRD-positive by both techniques, MRD-negative by both techniques) versus the total number of cases with available results., Up to 12 months
Proportion (%) of agreement and disagreement in the MRD measurements in BM (by NGS-MRD) and in the MRD measurements in peripheral blood (by MS-MRD) at post-induction., The proportion (%) of agreement will be defined as the total number of concordant cases (i.e., MRD-positive by both techniques, MRD-negative by both techniques) versus the total number of cases with available results., Up to 4 months and 2 weeks|Proportion (%) of agreement and disagreement in the MRD measurements in BM (by NGF-MRD) and in the MRD measurements in peripheral blood (by MS-MRD) at post-induction and post-consolidation., The proportion (%) of agreement will be defined as the total number of concordant cases (i.e., MRD-positive by both techniques, MRD-negative by both techniques) versus the total number of cases with available results., Up to 12 months|Proportion (%) of agreement and disagreement in the MRD measurements in BM by NGF-MRD and NGS-MRD at post-induction and post-consolidation., The proportion (%) of agreement will be defined as the total number of concordant cases (i.e., MRD-positive by both techniques, MRD-negative by both techniques) versus the total number of cases with available results., Up to 12 months|MRD negativity rate BM-MRD and PB-MRD, To evaluate the MRD negativity rate achieved at any time up to the end of consolidation with BM based MRD techniques and with the MS-MRD technique, Up to 12 months|ORR, VGPR or better, CR or better, sCR at post-induction, post-transplant, post-consolidation and overall., ORR will be defined as the percentage of participants achieving confirmed PR or better (i.e., PR+VGPR+CR+sCR). The number and percentage of participants achieving ORR, VGPR or better, CR or better and sCR will be presented, post-induction, post-consolidation, post-transplant and overall., Up to 12 months|Effect of cytogenetic abnormalities (presence or not), R-ISS (1, 2 or 3), CTCs (number of cells per ml) on likelihood to develop MRD-negative disease (with MS, NGS and NGF) and the agreement between the different techniques., Binary logistic regression will be used to identify factors associated with post-induction and post-consolidation MRD status (negative or positive) (as defined with NGS-MRD; NGF-MRD; MS-MRD; the most conservative method), in the MRD-evaluable Analysis Set. Odds ratios and respective 95% CIs will be estimated from univariable and multivariable models., Up to 12 months
