[CREMA]Combination of R-M Followed by R-A in Elderly Patients With Primary CNS Lymphoma
This study was conducted to evaluate the 2-year progression free survival rate of elderly patients with primary CNS lymphoma followed by combination of rituximab and methotrexate followed by rituximab and cytarabine.
Primary CNS Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Cytarabine Injection
2-year progression free survival rate, From the end of the last patient's trial, the disease progression will be tracked for up to 2 years, and primary analysis and reporting will be conducted., the time between the date of treatment start and the date of death due to any cause or date of disease, assessed up to 24 months
progression free survival, Means the period from the date of consent to the date of disease progression, the time of death, or the last time the disease has not progressed or has confirmed its survival., 2 years from the date of consent to the date of Progress disease f / u.|overall survival, It measures the time from start of treatment to death., Time between the start of treatment and the date of death.assessed up to 5 years]|Frequency of Adverse events classified by each criterion by CTCAE v4.0, CTCAE v4 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0) In the present study, toxicities will be recorded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE), version 4.0. Then, the collected Toxicity is classified by CTCAE term and calculated as%, and a lot of AE will be detected., from the date of informed consent signature to 31 days after last drug administration.|time to treatment failure, Means the period from the date of consent to the date of the onset of the disease or to the discontinuation of treatment for any reason., Within 3 years
As described, standard therapy for patients with primary CNS lymphoma is not based on a high level of evidence yet, and studies in elderly patients with this disease are very limited. Based on the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, it is estimated that about 100 \~ 150 cases of primary central nervous system lymphoma are diagnosed per year in Korea, but there is no analysis through prospective studies. As described previously, MTX monotherapy in elderly patients is relatively safe and does not reduce clinical utility. Although the autologous therapy may consider autologous stem cell transplantation, it is difficult to apply in elderly patients. Brain radiation therapy is not a primary consideration because it may cause neurological sequelae, especially in elderly patients. High-dose cytarabine is a safely administered drug that has been used extensively in clinical studies involving the treatment of elderly patients.Rituximab has not been studied prospectively for medications, doses, and intervals that are expected to play a role in patients with primary CNS lymphoma, as described above, and may be caused by reducing the number of cytotoxic anticancer drugs in elderly patients And to reduce the treatment effect.

Therefore, the authors propose a two-phase study in which R-A induction therapy is performed after R-M induction therapy in elderly patients with primary CNS lymphoma.
