A Phase 2a Study of Modified Vaccinia Virus to Treat Sorafenib-naïve Advanced Liver Cancer
This study is to determine how effectively JX-594 (Pexa-Vec) will prolong life in patients with advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) who have not been previously treated with sorafenib, and the safe administration of JX-594 in five weekly IV infusions.
Hepatocellular Carinoma
BIOLOGICAL: JX-594 recombinant vaccina GM-CSF
Number of Participants With Radiographic Response, Number of Participants with Complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\] per modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) for target and non-target lesions assessed by enhanced CT scan: CR, disappearance of intratumoral enhancing area; PR, \>=30% decrease in sum of diameters of enhancing area; Radiographic Response = CR + PR, CT scans every 6 week from Week 6 up to 12 months
Time to Progression (TTP), TTP (in months) was defined as the number of months from the date of first Pexa-Vec infusion to the date of disease progression. If the patient had no progression then TTP was censored at the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. TTP was summarized and a Kaplan Meier (KM) curve was constructed., CT scans every 6 week from Week 6 up to 12 months.|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from first dose of Pexa-Vec until death from any cause. For patients not known to have died at the time of the analysis, OS was censored on the date they were last known to be alive. OS was summarized and a KM curve was constructed., CT scans every 6 week from Week 6 up to 12 months
This was a Phase 2a, two-staged, single-arm, open-label study in sorafenib-naïve patients with advanced HCC.

Patients received 5 weekly IV infusions of Pexa-Vec and could have continued to receive IV infusions of Pexa-Vec every 3 weeks until progressive disease (PD).
