A Phase I Study of TAS-102 in Solid Tumors
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of TAS-102 after single and multiple dose in Chinese patients with solid tumor.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: TAS-102
Cmax (Maximum Plasma Concentration) of FTD, Multiple time points on Day 1 and Day 12 of Cycle 1.|Tmax (Time to Reach Maximum Drug Concentration in Blood) of FTD, Multiple time points on Day 1 and Day 12 of Cycle 1.|AUC0-t (Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time 0 to Time (t) of the Last Quantifiable Concentration ) of FTD, Multiple time points on Day 1 and Day 12 of Cycle 1.
This is an open-label, non-randomized, single group Phase 1 study of TAS-102, evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety, and antitumor activity. Blood sampling will be performed during the first cycle (Day1 and Day 12) of therapy in all consenting patients.
