Management of Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules Across Different World Regions
Thyroid carcinoma (TC) is the most common endocrine malignancy, affecting 0.2-1.5% of individuals worldwide. The rising incidence rate of TC is mostly related to the expanding use of high-quality imaging techniques, with an increase in the detection of thyroid nodules. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the most accurate, rapid, safe, and cost-effective test for the evaluation of thyroid nodules, with high specificity and sensitivity. Nevertheless, FNAC is particularly unreliable in differentiating between benign and malignant nodules that fall under the category of indeterminate thyroid nodules (class III and class IV according to Bethesda Classification\[2\]). In fact, in these cases, the expected malignancy rates are 5-15% and 15-30%, respectively. Thus, most patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules undergo an operation that is indeed unnecessary, while representing a risk for surgical complications and a cost for health-care systems.

We aim to evaluate different approaches to indeterminate nodules across different countries in the world.
