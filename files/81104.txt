Ph 3 ADI-PEG 20 Versus Placebo in Subjects With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma Who Have Failed Prior Systemic Therapy
This is a study of ADI-PEG 20 (pegylated arginine deiminase), an arginine degrading enzyme versus placebo in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have failed prior systemic treatment (chemotherapy). Hepatocellular carcinomas have been found to require arginine, an amino acid. Thus the hypothesis is that by restricting arginine with ADI-PEG 20, the hepatocellular carcinoma cells will starve and die.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: ADI-PEG 20 (arginine deiminase formulated with polyethylene glycol)|DRUG: Placebo|OTHER: Best Supportive Care
Overall survival, Overall survival - until death or study closure., 18 months
Safety and tolerability - number of participants with adverse events., In addition to safety and tolerability, progression free survival, response rate using RECIST 1.1 and time to tumor progression will be assessed., 18 months - at anticipated end of study.
Patients will be randomized 2:1 to study drug versus placebo. Patients will be recruited from North American, Europe and Asia. In addition to overall survival, progression free survival, responses by RECIST 1.1 criteria and time to tumor progression will be calculated. Safety and tolerability will be assessed, as will pharmacodynamics (peripheral blood levels of arginine and citrulline), pharmacokinetics (peripheral blood levels of ADI-PEG 20) and immunogenicity (antibodies to ADI-PEG 20).
