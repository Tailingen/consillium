HeadStart4: Newly Diagnosed Children (<10 y/o) With Medulloblastoma and Other CNS Embryonal Tumors
This is a prospective randomized clinical trial, to determine whether dose-intensive tandem Consolidation, in a randomized comparison with single cycle Consolidation, provides an event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). The study population will be high-risk patients (non-Wnt and non-Shh sub-groups) with medulloblastoma, and for all patients with central nervous system (CNS) embryonal tumors completing "Head Start 4" Induction. This study will further determine whether the additional labor intensity (duration of hospitalizations and short-term and long-term morbidities) associated with the tandem treatment is justified by the improvement in outcome. It is expected that the tandem (3 cycles) Consolidation regimen will produce a superior outcome compared to the single cycle Consolidation, given the substantially higher dose intensity of the tandem regimen, without significant addition of either short-term or long-term morbidities.

Compare tandem consolidation vs. single cycle consolidation A, Dose-intensive tandem Consolidation will be compared with single cycle consolidation via randomization. The randomized consolidations will provide an event-free survival (EFS) analysis after completing "Head Start 4" Induction., 5 years|Compare tandem consolidation vs. single cycle consolidation B, Dose-intensive tandem Consolidation will be compared with single cycle consolidation via randomization. The randomized consolidations will provide an overall survival (OS) analysis after completing "Head Start 4" Induction., 5 years
Induction Cycle Reduction, Induction chemotherapy cycles will be reduced in number from five to three for molecularly high-risk medulloblastoma (non-Shh/non-Wnt) and CNS embryonal tumors who achieve a complete response (CR) after three cycles of Induction therapy results in equivalent 3-year EFS. Outcome will be analyzed irrespective of Consolidation assignment (Primary Aim) and compared to historical controls., 5 years|Uniform Treatment Regimen, Assess the rate of response of sequential dose-intensive and dose-compressed Induction chemotherapy followed by marrow-ablative chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic progenitor cell rescue (AuHPCR) for children with medulloblastoma and other CNS embryonal tumors enrolled on the "Head Start 4" study utilizing a uniform treatment regimen., 5 years|Therapy-Related Hearing Loss Evaluation A, The prevalence and severity of therapy-related hearing loss as a function of cumulative dosing of cisplatin (three versus five cycles during Induction) will be evaluated. Distortion-Product Oto-acoustic Emissions (DPOAE) will be used as an early predictor of hearing loss to identify at-risk patients., 5 years|Therapy-Related Hearing Loss Evaluation B, The prevalence and severity of therapy-related hearing loss as a function of AuHPCR (one versus three tandem transplants in Consolidation) will be evaluated. Distortion-Product Oto-acoustic Emissions (DPOAE) will be used as an early predictor of hearing loss to identify at-risk patients., 5 years|Neuropsychological effects will be evaluated using age based tests and questionnaires., The long-term neuropsychological effects will be evaluated., 5 years|Endocrine studies will be conducted using Serum-free T4, TSH, Cortisol, IGF and IGFBP3 laboratory tests., The long-term endocrine functions effect will be evaluated., 5 years|Physical growth will be evaluated by collecting patient's height, weight and BSA., The long-term physical growth effect will be evaluated., 5 years|The development of second neoplasms will be monitored., The long-term development of second neoplasms will be evaluated., 5 years|Neuropathology Biorepository and Clinical Database, The study will establish a "Head Start 4" repository of clinical, radiographic and biologic specimens, including nucleic acids derived from these specimens, for future genomic, biologic and pharmacologic research., 5 years
Due to the inferior response and event-free survival data of Regimens D and D2 on "Head Start III" for all children with supratentorial embryonal tumors, in comparison with the published data from "Head Start II" with Regimen A2 for metastatic patients, all such patients will receive the "Head Start II" Induction Regimen A2, on "Head Start 4", for either three or five cycles, depending upon whether or not they achieve complete remission by the end of Induction cycle #3. They will then undergo randomization to either single cycle or three tandem cycles of Consolidation marrow-ablative chemotherapy with AuHPCR.

Because of the unsatisfactory event-free survival for young children with non-desmoplastic/extensive nodular medulloblastoma (predominantly non-Shh and non-Wnt medulloblastoma subgroups) on Regimens D and D2 of "Head Start III", all these patients will receive the "Head Start II" Induction Regimen A2 on ""Head Start 4"", for either three or five cycles, depending upon whether or not they achieve complete remission by the end of Induction cycle #3. They will then undergo randomization to either single cycle or three tandem cycles of Consolidation marrow-ablative chemotherapy with AuHPCR.

Because of the excellent event-free and overall survival for young children with good risk medullo-blastoma (Shh or Wnt subgroups) treated with up-front "Head Start" chemotherapy strategies, such patients will undergo risk-tailored reduction of duration of Induction therapy from five cycles to three cycles of the "Head Start II" Induction Regimen A2 on "Head Start 4" for patients achieving a complete response to 3 cycles, followed, provided they are also without evidence of residual tumor following recovery from Induction cycle #3. They will NOT then undergo randomization, but will follow with a single cycle of Consolidation marrow-ablative chemotherapy as in "Head Start" studies.
