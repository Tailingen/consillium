Comprehensive Assessment of Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Gemelli Adolescents and Young Adults
The Adolescent and Young Adults cancer population encompass patients diagnosed with oncological disease at the age of 15-39 years. Although 86% of these patients become long-term cancer survivors, studies have shown that these survival rates lag behind to those of younger and older patients. The underlying reason for this discrepancy is, however, yet poorly understood. Furthermore, these patients may be more often confronted with late effects due to their disease and/or anticancer treatment. Knowledge on Adolescent and Young Adults diagnosed with gynecological cancer at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS hospital in Rome, Italy, is currently lacking and is needed to deliver these patients the best possible care, tailored to their disease characteristics and specific needs.

The primary objective of this monocenter observational study is to determine the number of Gemelli Adolescent and Young Adults diagnosed with gynecological cancer and their clinical characteristics. Secondary objectives will be to determine their oncological, late-term physical effects, sexual and reproductive health, psychological and social outcomes. Tertiary outcomes will be to compare the clinical characteristics and oncological outcomes of Gemelli Adolescents and Young Adults to patients beyond this age-specific cohort who have been treated during the same study period.
