Sonobiopsy for Noninvasive and Sensitive Detection of Glioblastoma
This clinical study to evaluate sonobiopsy is significant because sonobiopsy will fundamentally enhance the clinician's insight into the molecular features of an intracranial lesion to tailor treatment approaches and optimize outcomes. In addition to the standard diagnostics of anatomic imaging and surgical histology, sonobiopsy has the potential to become the third pillar for brain tumor management by radically advancing the ability to easily and regularly acquire tumor genetic and molecular signatures. This enhanced capability will have a dramatic impact on patient survival and quality of life.

Feasibility of sonobiopsy as measured by change in ctDNA level, The feasibility of sonobiopsy will be demonstrated by an increase in the amount of ctDNA in the blood samples acquired post than prior sonobiopsy in at least 50% of the patients., Day 1|Number of matched mutations between the post-sonobiopsy sample and the tumor tissue sample, The agreement of the post-sonobiopsy sample mutation detected in the blood with a variant identified in the tumor tissue will be compared using a kappa statistic., Day 1
