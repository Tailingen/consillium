Safety and Preliminary Effectiveness of BNT327, an Investigational Therapy for Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in Combination With Chemotherapy Following Chemoimmunotherapy
This is a Phase II, multisite, open-label, single arm study with two parts in participants with advanced/metastatic NSCLC which progressed after a first-line chemoimmunotherapy.

Part 1 is safety run-in with BNT327 (Dose 1 or Dose 2) plus docetaxel and will include up to 12 participants to be treated in Part 1A and 1B sequentially.

Part 2 is a dose expansion at the deemed safe dose of BNT327 plus docetaxel.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: BNT327|DRUG: Docetaxel
Part 1 - Occurrence of DLTs, During the DLT evaluation period by dose level, up to 21 days after first dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP)|Part 1 and Part 2 - Occurrence of BNT327 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-related TEAEs, treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs), treatment-related (TRSAEs), and adverse events of special interest (AESIs), Graded according to the (US) National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), from initiation of the first dose of IMP to the 90-day Follow-Up visit|Part 1 and Part 2 - Occurrence of dose interruption, dose reduction, and/or participant discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs), from initiation of the first dose of IMP until the 90-day Safety Follow-up visit|Part 1 and Part 2 - Objective response rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of participants in whom a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) based on investigator's review) is observed as best overall response, Up to approximately 2 years
Part 1 and Part 2 - Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the time from first objective response (CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 based on the investigator's assessment) to first occurrence of objective tumor progression (progressive disease, per RECIST v1.1 based on the investigator's assessment) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2- Progression-free Survival (PFS), Based on the investigator's assessment defined as the time from first dose of IMP to the first objective tumor progression (progressive disease per RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2 - Depth of Response, Defined as the maximum percent reduction from baseline in tumor size measured by sum of target lesion diameter (including nodal \[short axis\] and non-nodal \[longest axis\] lesions), Up to approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2 - Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or stable disease (per RECIST v1.1 based on the investigator's assessment) as best overall response, Up to approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2 - Time to Response (TTR), Defined as the time from first dose of IMP to first objective response (CR or PR per RECIST v1.1 based on the investigator's assessment), Up to approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2 - Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from first dose of IMP to death from any cause, Up to approximately 2 years|Part 1 and Part 2 - PK assessment: Maximum concentration (Cmax) derived from serum concentration of BNT327, from pre-dose to the end of study treatment (up to approximately 2 years)|Part 1 and Part 2 - Number of participants developing detectable anti-BNT327 antibodies in serum, from pre-dose to the end of study treatment (up to approximately 2 years)
If the dose level (either from Part 1A or 1B) seems tolerable, an internal review committee will decide if the study can proceed to Part 2 and enroll additional participants.

Study participants will receive BNT327 in combination with docetaxel until disease progression, the occurrence of intolerable toxicity, study participant withdrawal, death, study termination or 2-year limit (whichever comes first).

After completion of study treatment, except for participants who withdraw informed consent, a long-term follow-up will be conducted for all participants to record disease progression, subsequent new anticancer treatments, and survival status.
