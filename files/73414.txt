A Global Study to Assess the Effects of Osimertinib in Participants With EGFRm Stage IA2-IA3 NSCLC Following Complete Tumour Resection
This is a global study to assess the effects of osimertinib in participants with EGFRm stage IA2-IA3 non-small cell lung cancer following complete tumour resection.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib|DRUG: Placebo
Disease-Free Survival (DFS) in high-risk stratum, DFS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until the date of disease recurrence or date of death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence), whichever occurs first.

Stratification to the high risk stratum will be based on pathologic features assessed by central pathology review during screening., From date of randomisation up to approximately 10 years
Disease-Free Survival (DFS) in overall population, DFS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until the date of disease recurrence or date of death (by any cause in the absence of recurrence), whichever occurs first., From date of randomisation up to approximately 10 years|Overall Survival (OS) in high-risk stratum and the overall population, OS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death due to any cause., From date of randomization up to approximately 10 years|PK plasma concentrations of osimertinib and of metabolite AZ5104 in overall population, Ratio of metabolite-to-osimertinib to be calculated at predose, and at 0.5-2 hours postdose., From date of randomisation up to approximately 10 years|Impact of osimertinib versus placebo on physical functioning, Assess the impact of osimertinib versus placebo on physical functioning in both the high-risk stratum and the overall population as measured by SF-36 V2 health survey, From date of randomisation up to approximately 10 years|Central Nervous System (CNS) Disease-Free Survival (DFS) in both the high-risk stratum and the overall population, CNS DFS is defined as the time from randomisation to the time of a CNS lesion (as assessed by investigator) or death due to any cause, regardless of whether the participant withdraws from study intervention or receives other anti-cancer therapy., From date of randomisation up to approximately 10 years|Safety and tolerability in overall population, AEs graded by CTCAE version 5.0, From date of randomisation up to approximately 10 years
This is a Phase III, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, international study assessing the efficacy and safety of adjuvant osimertinib versus placebo in participants with stage IA2-IA3 EGFRm Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, who have previously undergone complete tumour resection. All participants must have had a tumour which harbours one of the 2 common EGFR mutations known to be associated with EGFR-TKI sensitivity (Ex19del, L858R).

Eligible participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to one of the 2 intervention arms: osimertinib 80 mg or matching placebo, once daily for 3 years unless discontinuation criteria is met.
