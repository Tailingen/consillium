Phase I Study of Orally Administered Aminolevulinic Acid for Resection of Malignant Astrocytomas
This research is being done to study the safety and utility of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) (also known as Gliolan) for identifying brain tumor tissue during surgery. The goal of this study is to determine if 5-ALA can differentiate between tumor and normal brain tissue.

Sometimes, during brain surgery, the removal of tumor tissue can be difficult because the tumor can look like normal brain tissue. Studies in other countries have shown that in some brain tumors, 5-ALA can make the tumors appear brighter under ultraviolet light. This may make it easier for doctors to remove as much tumor as safely as possible from your brain.

This study also hopes to see if 5-ALA can find different cell populations within the tumor that is removed and allow the researchers to better understand brain tumors.

The purpose of this study is to:

* Find out how well 5-ALA can separate normal brain tissue from tumor tissues AND to see how well 5-ALA can find different cell populations within brain tumors
* Identify the amount of 5-ALA that should be taken before surgery to make the tumors glow under ultraviolet light
* Make sure the 5-ALA identifies tumor and not normal brain
* Make sure 5-ALA does not cause any side effects
Astrocytoma|Glioma
DRUG: 5-Aminolevulinic Acid
serious adverse event (SAE) Rate, It will be considered as a serious adverse event with possible, probable, and definitely attribution to 5-ALA (SAE, detailed in section 8) if (within 2 weeks of dosing):

Grade 1 or 2 LFT abnormalities not resolving within 2 weeks A single documented Grade 3 or 4 LFT abnormalities A Grade 3 or 4 skin photosensitivity, 2 weeks from dosing
Diagnostic Accuracy, The secondary objective of the study is to estimate sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate); false positive rate and false negative rate; positive predict rate, and negative predict rate using a 5-ALA dose of 20 mg/kg to delineate tumor that may provide discrimination between normal and malignant tissue intra-operatively., 72 hours post-operative
