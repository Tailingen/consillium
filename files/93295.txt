Impact of Group Psychological Interventions on Extracellular Vesicles in People Who Had Cancer
Background: There is some evidence demonstrating the effect of psychological interventions in improvements in health biological parameters. To best of our knowledge, no study had addressed the impact of any psychological intervention on extracellular vesicles. In addition, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Emotion Focused Therapy for Cancer Recovery (EFT-CR) in the group have never been explored regarding extracellular vesicles and the effectiveness of these was not compared yet.

Objectives:

1. To explore and compare the effect of MBCT and EFT-CR on biological parameters and psychological variables in distressed people who have had breast, prostate and colorectal cancer;
2. In addition, we will explore the acceptability through recruitment and retention rates of MBCT and EFT-CR in group and evaluate whether these interventions are appropriate for a larger clinical trial.

Methods: The design of this study is a parallel randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized into MBCT, EFT-CR or usual care. Outcome measures will be assessed before, at the end of the intervention (8 weeks) and follow-ups (24 and 52 weeks from the baseline moment).

Hypotheses: The researchers expected that both interventions will have an effect on extracellular vesicles and other study biomarkers as well as improvements in psychological outcomes, compared to treatment as usual (TAU) group. Regarding the comparative effectiveness, we did not have evidence to hypothesize which one of the interventions will be superior in both biological (extracellular vesicles) and psychological outcomes.

Contribution for practice: The results of this preliminary study would permit to know if there are benefits of these psychological interventions on changes in extracellular vesicles and on psychological outcomes related to health. In addition, this study will permit to determine the acceptability of conducting a larger randomized controlled trial.

Change on Extracellular vesicles number by ultracentrifugation with sucrose cushion, The collected extracellular vesicles will be quantified by Nanoparticle tracking analysis (Nanosight Ltd.), and data will be measured in particles per milliliter (mL). NTA measures Brownian movements on a particle-by-particle basis tracking movements by image analysis. Additionally, miR21-5p - a brain related microRNA - will be measured to ascertain for the extracellular vesicle's origin. The latter will be achieved by isothermal DNA amplification method, and data will be measured by luminescence (in RLU - relative light unit)., T0-before intervention; T1-8 weeks after T0; T2-24 weeks after T0; T3-52 weeks after T0|Change on anxiety, depression and stress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, DASS21), This self-report instrument assess the depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms in a 4-points likert scale, from 0 to 3, with higher values representing higher depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, T0-before intervention; T1-8 weeks after T0; T2-24 weeks after T0; T3-52 weeks after T0

In addition, the participants identified therapeutic changes as result of the therapy and are asked to rate these changes in three scales: expected change (1: change totally expected; 5: totally unexpected); change without therapy (1: the change would not have happened; 5: change would happen for sure); and the value of the change (1: nothing important; 5: extremely important)., T2-24 weeks after T0|Change on smoking dependency (Fagestrom Test), This instrument assesses nicotine dependency with 6 items (rated from 0 to 2 or 3).
