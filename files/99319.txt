Comparison of 2 Types of Cervical Specimens in Patients With a Pathological Screening Smear
The recommendations on the method and the realization of the cervico-uterine smears are clear. With regard to performing endocervical curettage, several methods are possible without precise consensus. In general, the Kevorkian curette is widely used. However, it is often reported by doctors and patients that curettage is painful. Some articles show that the cytobrush would be less painful. While keeping a percentage of correct curettage failures, it is sought to show that the cytobrush would improve the comfort of the patient during curettage.
