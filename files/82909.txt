Vitamin D Levels and Survival in Cancer Patients
Using the population-based data sources in Iceland and the well-characterized AGES-Reykjavik cohort, our overarching aims are on exploring whether pre-diagnostic serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) among older individuals living in Iceland were associated with survival after cancer diagnosis. We also wanted to assess the risk of being diagnosed with cancer in association with 25(OH)D levels. In this population living just south of the arctic circle, vitamin D levels largely depend on dietary- and supplemental sources.

Overall mortality among cancer patients, We tested the association between pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D levels and total survival, Patients were followed from date of diagnosis since 2002 until death or censored at end of the follow-up (December 31, 2014)
Cancer-specific mortality among cancer patients, We tested the association between pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D levels and cancer survival, Patients were followed from date of diagnosis since 2002 until death or censored at end of the follow-up (December 31, 2014)
Pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D levels and cancer risk, We tested the association between pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D levels and risk of being diagnosed with cancer, Participants without cancer were followed from the study entry since 2002 until cancer diagnosis, death or end of the observation period whichever occurred first (December 31, 2014)
