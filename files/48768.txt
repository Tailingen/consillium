Safety Study of NHL With 90Y-hLL2 IgG
This will be an open label, multiple center, non-randomized, dose-escalation Phase I/II trial, designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a repeated, outpatient regimen utilizing IMMU-hLL2 intact monoclonal antibody IgG labeled with different doses of 90Y for the treatment of patients B-cell lymphoma (NHL).
NHL|B-cell NHL|Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: 90Y-hLL2
Safety will be evaluated from physical examinations, hematology and chemistry testing and toxicity evaluation, First 12 weeks, total 5 years
Determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), first 12 weeks|Evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of repeated infusions of 90Y-hLL2 in NHL patients., 6 weeks, 12 weeks, every 3 months if HAHA elevated|Determine the therapeutic effects, in terms of objective response rate and duration, of the therapeutic agent in NHL patients., 6 wks, 12 wks, every 3 mos for 5 years
90Y-labeled hLL2 will be administered according to a schedule based upon whether or not a patient had prior high-dose chemotherapy with a marrow or stem cell transplant. Patients with both indolent and aggressive types of NHL will be enrolled at each dose level without segregation. However, at the conclusion of the trial, with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined, a minimum number of 6 patients with indolent NHL, 6 patients with aggressive NHL, and 6 patients with \>25% bone marrow involvement will be studied at that dose level.
