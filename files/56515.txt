Study of GS-0189 (Formerly FSI-189) as Monotherapy and in Combination With Rituximab in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of GS-0189 (formerly FSI-189) as monotherapy and in combination with rituximab in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).
Non-hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: GS-0189|DRUG: Rituximab
