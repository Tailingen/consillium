Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of VIR-5525 and VIR-5525 + Pembrolizumab in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This Phase 1, first-in-human (FIH), dose-escalation and dose-expansion study is designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of VIR-5525 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with solid tumors that are known to express EGFR.

The study will be conducted in the following 4 parts:

* Part 1: VIR-5525 monotherapy dose escalation
* Part 2: VIR-5525 monotherapy dose expansion
* Part 3: VIR-5525 plus pembrolizumab dose escalation
* Part 4: VIR-5525 plus pembrolizumab dose expansion
