Predicting the Efficacy in Advanced Gastric Cancer.
With advances in chemotherapy for gastric cancer, it is important to identify patients who will respond effectively to specific therapies. This longitudinal study aimed to establish a liquid-biopsy assay that can predict response to ramucirumab plus paclitaxel therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer.

Chemotherapy response, Follows by response valuation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) evaluation. Partial response (PR) and Stable disease (SD) are defined as treatment effective, while Progressive disease (PD) is defined as no treatment effective., 5 years
The combination of paclitaxel and ramucirumab is a potent standard second-line therapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer, but approximately 30% of patients do not respond to treatment. Failure to respond to second-line therapy can lead not only to disease progression, but also to deterioration of the patient's health and loss of the opportunity to receive other treatments that originally had the potential to be curative. This study aims to predict the efficacy of second-line treatment (paclitaxel plus ramucirumab) in patients with gastric cancer using liquid biopsies (small RNA). Prediction using pre-treatment blood may allow patients who do not respond to treatment to choose other treatment options. This study aims to establish a tool that will enable noninvasive pre-treatment selection, which could lead to personalized treatment.
