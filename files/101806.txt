A Multicentre Phase I-II Study to Investigate the Combination of Bendamustine With Weekly Paclitaxel as First or Second Line Therapy in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer
The aim of the study is to establish a feasible combination of bendamustine and paclitaxel in a weekly schedule. The two agents have different toxicity profiles and are well tolerated when given in a weekly fashion. The combination might be of special interest for elderly patients with hormone insensitive breast cancer
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Bendamustine
The phase I part of the trial should evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of bendamustine with paclitaxel., end of cycle 2 of the 6th patient of the assumed highest dose level
To determine the objective response rate (phase II part), EOT last patient (phase II part)
The aim of the study is to establish a feasible combination of bendamustine and paclitaxel in a weekly schedule.
