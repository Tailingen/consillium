A Comparative Study of GPI's DBS and Pallidotomy in the Treatment of Meige Syndrome
In this study, we will compare the degree of postoperative symptom improvement, postoperative complication rate, postoperative quality of life improvement degree of patients with Meige syndrome undergoing pallidotomy (unilateral globus palliotomy) and deep brain stimulation (unilateral globus pallidus) ,in order to get the conclusion of the comparison of the clinical efficacy of the two surgical plans. In addition, possible predictive factors such as age, gender, age of onset, length of disease course, scale baseline score, preoperative brain PET-CT function analysis and other possible predictive factors are added for analysis, in order to find predictive factors that can guide the choice of surgical options.
