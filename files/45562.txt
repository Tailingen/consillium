Removal Time of Urinary Catheter After Laparoscopic Anterior Resection of the Rectum
Traditionally these catheters are retained for 7 days, because a higher incidence of urinary retention is related to early removal of the urinary catheter. However, recently Enhanced Recovery After Surgery presents that urinary catheters placed via the urethra can be withdrawn 48 hours after colon/rectal surgery in patients receiving epidural pain relief，but there is no clear data on the incidence of urine retention.Longer retaining time of urethral catheter would induce the urinary tract infection while early removal of urethral catheter is considered to develop acute retention of urine due to lack of sensation when the bladder is full. Taking the comfort and mobility for faster rehabilitation of patients into account, the investigators aim at obtain the optimal removal time of urinary catheter after after laparoscopic anterior resection of the rectum
Rectum Cancer
PROCEDURE: Early removal group|PROCEDURE: Normal removal group
Post-operative urinary retention requiring re-catheterisation, Development of acute post-operative urinary retention demonstrated by a post-void residual \>100mls on bladder ultrasound requiring re-catheterisation within 1 day of removal of urethral catheter in the post-operative period, 1 day following urethral catheter removal
Urinary tract infection, Before catheter removal, take a mid-stream urine sample for microscopy and culture. Leucocyte in urine ≥5/HP for man and ≥10/HP for woman is defined as bacteruria with urinary irritation or not.A pure culture of a single organism of \>100,000 colony forming units will be considered a positive culture., Within 7 days of urethral catheter removal|Urethrorrhagia, take a mid-stream urine sample for Clinical urine tests and RBC≥3/HP is defined as urethrorrhagia., Within 7 days of urethral catheter removal
For a better view to avoid accidental trauma and monitoring kidney function during surgery and in the post-surgery period, patients undergoing abdominal operations will usually have a urinary catheter placed in the bladder before the surgery. Traditionally these catheters are retained for 7 days, because a higher incidence of urinary retention is related to early removal of the urinary catheter. However, recently Enhanced Recovery After Surgery presents that urinary catheters placed via the urethra can be withdrawn 48 hours after colon/rectal surgery in patients receiving epidural pain relief.
