This is a multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose, first in human (FIH) study. The study consists of two parts: Part 1 adopts an accelerated titration at first dose level followed with classic "3+3" design to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D); Part 2 is a dose expansion phase to confirm the safety, tolerability and explore efficacy in selected malignant solid tumors at the MTD/the RP2D. This study will enroll subjects with advanced/unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic malignant solid tumors.
