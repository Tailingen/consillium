Oral Pathology Asynchronous Telementoring Pilot Study
The purpose of the proposed research project is to evaluate and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of integrating a tele-mentoring component into the identification of oral lesions at the 6 dental clinics of Family Health Centers at NYU Langone (FHC), a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in Brooklyn, NY.
Oral Cancer
OTHER: Imaging using intraoral cameras
Percentage of Dental Patients Who Strongly Agreed or Agreed That the Use of an Intra-Oral Camera By Their Dentists Helped Them to Better Understand Oral Cancer Screening, Consented patients will be asked to complete a brief Patient Exit Survey (5 statements) at the end of their dental appointments after being screened for oral cancer lesions using an intraoral camera. Responses to the second statement are reported for this outcome measure. The statement is scored on a Likert Scale from 1 - Strongly Disagree to 5 - Strongly Agree., At the end of the dental appointment, 30-45 minutes|Percentage of Dental Patients Who Strongly Agreed or Agreed That Dentists Answered Their Questions About Oral Cancer and Were Able to Provide Them With Resources, Consented patients will be asked to complete a brief Patient Exit Survey (5 statements) at the end of their dental appointments after being screened for oral cancer lesions using an intraoral camera. Responses to the fourth statement are reported for this outcome measure. The statement is scored on a Likert Scale from 1 - Strongly Disagree to 5 - Strongly Agree., At the end of the dental appointment, 30-45 minutes
Percentage of Dental Providers Who Reported Successfully Providing the Tele-Mentoring Intervention, Dentists are given a Provider "Essential Components" Checklist to fill out. This checklist summarizes the essential components of incorporating a tele-mentoring intervention into the identification of oral lesions via use of intraoral cameras to take photographs of oral lesions at chairside, uploading them into Dentrix, and conferring with an oral pathology expert.

Successful provision of the intervention is indicated by marking "item met" for all 10 intervention elements listed in the checklist., At the end of the dental appointment, 30-45 minutes|Percentage of Dental Providers Who Reported That The Process Was Clear and Straightforward, The process includes from EHR data entry to interaction with the oral surgeon over findings to patient referral, At the end of the dental appointment, 30-45 minutes
The tele-mentoring intervention involves training dental faculty members and residents to use intraoral cameras to take photographs of oral lesions and place them in the Dentrix electronic health record (EHR), along with descriptions of the lesions. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study will evaluate and enhance the feasibility and acceptability of integrating a tele-mentoring component into the identification of oral lesions at the 6 FHC dental clinics.
