Efficacy of Probiotic Lactobacillus Crispatus M247 in Promoting High-risk Human Papillomavirus (HR-HPV) Infection Clearance and Modifying Vaginal Microbiota
This clinical trial evaluates the efficacy of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus crispatus M247 in promoting the clearance of genital high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection and restoring the balance of the vaginal microbiota. The study adopts a multicenter, randomized, single-blind, longitudinal, prospective design involving HR-HPV-positive patients. Primary outcomes include HR-HPV clearance rates and microbiota composition changes.
Human Papillomavirus Infection
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Lactobacillus crispatus M247 (Crispact®)|OTHER: Placebo
HR-HPV Clearance Rate, Percentage of participants in whom HR-HPV infection is no longer detectable, as assessed by an HPV-DNA test., Baseline to 4 months post-intervention
Modifications in Vaginal Microbiota, Changes in the composition of the vaginal microbiota, including the abundance of Lactobacillus species (especially Lactobacillus crispatus) and microbiota diversity indices, as assessed by Next-Generation Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (NGS 16S) sequencing., Baseline to 4 months post-intervention.|Microbiota Characteristics Favoring HR-HPV Infection or Clearance, Identification of vaginal microbiota profiles (e.g., CST-I (Community State Type-I) to CST-IV (Community State Type-IV) distribution) associated with HR-HPV persistence or clearance, as determined by NGS 16S sequencing, Baseline to 4 months post-intervention.|Cervical Cytology Normalization, Proportion of participants with normalization of cervical cytology results, transitioning from ASC-US (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance) or LSIL (Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion) to normal cytology, as determined by Papanicolaou (Pap) test analysis., Baseline to 4 months post-intervention.|Number of patients reporting side effects to probiotic Crispact® intake, Number and type of adverse events reported, including gastrointestinal symptoms, allergic reactions, or other health concerns, as recorded in participant safety logs., From baseline to 4 months post-intervention.
This study investigates the potential benefits of Lactobacillus crispatus M247, a probiotic strain with proven ability to promote vaginal health, in the management of HR-HPV infections. Lactobacillus crispatus M247 has demonstrated superior probiotic properties, including the ability to produce lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, which contribute to maintaining a stable vaginal microbiota and potentially inhibiting HR-HPV persistence.

Participants will be randomized to receive either Lactobacillus crispatus M247 or a placebo over a specified study period. The primary aim is to evaluate the probiotic's efficacy in enhancing HR-HPV clearance rates and restoring a balanced vaginal microbiota. Secondary objectives include assessing changes in cervical cytology and participant-reported outcomes on vaginal health. By focusing exclusively on the role of Lactobacillus crispatus M247, the study seeks to establish its clinical relevance in HR-HPV management and its potential as a therapeutic intervention.
