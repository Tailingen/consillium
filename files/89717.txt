Cemiplimab and ISA101b Vaccine in Adult Participants With Recurrent/Metastatic Human Papillomavirus (HPV)16 Cervical Cancer Who Have Experienced Disease Progression After First Line Chemotherapy
The primary objective of the study is to estimate the clinical benefit of cemiplimab + ISA101b after progression on first line chemotherapy, as assessed by objective response rate (ORR).

The secondary objectives of the study are:

* To characterize the safety profile of cemiplimab + ISA101b
* To assess preliminary efficacy of cemiplimab + ISA101b as measured by duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS)
