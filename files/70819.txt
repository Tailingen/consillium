Study of Split-course Chemoradiotherapy For Postoperative Locoregional Recurrence Of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy of split-course irradiation with concurrent chemotherapy in locoregional recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer after surgical resection

This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy of split-course irradiation with concurrent chemotherapy in locoregional recurrence of non-small cell lung cancer after surgical resection.

Patients received four cycles of weekly docetaxel(25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin(25mg/㎡), each of 1 day's duration, combined with split-course thoracic radiotherapy of 40-51 Gy/10-17 fractions and 15-24 Gy/5-8 fractions administered in the first and second courses, respectively, with one-month break. The primary end point is progression-free survival, which is the time that passes from the first day of radiotherapy to the date at which disease progresses. Progression-free survival will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE v. 4.0.
