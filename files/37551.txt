Study Evaluating ABT-414 in Japanese Subjects With Malignant Glioma
This study seeks to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety of ABT-414 in Japanese participants with newly diagnosed and recurrent, World Health Organization (WHO) grade III or IV malignant glioma.
Malignant Glioma|Glioblastoma Multiforme
RADIATION: Whole Brain Radiation|DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: ABT-414
Percentage of participants with adverse events, At each visit for approximately 4 years|Number of Dose Limiting Toxicities, Measurement by clinical lab results, vital signs, physical exam and electrocardiogram (ECG) during the Phase 1 portion of the study., At each visit for approximately 1 year|Progression-free survival, Time to progression-free survival is defined as the number of days from the date of first dose to the date of earliest disease progression based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria or to the date of death, if disease progression does not occur (except Arm B and Arm C of Phase 1 portion)., At each visit for approximately 1 year|Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of ABT-414, Assessed during the Phase 1 portion of the study, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) is a method of measurement to determine the total exposure of a drug in blood plasma., Multiple time points in Cycles 1, 2 and 3 (4 weeks each) and Day 1 of remaining cycles until end of treatment for approximately 1 year for recurrent subjects and in every week of Day 1 until Week 7 and end of treatment for the newly diagnosed subjects|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of ABT-414, Assessed during the Phase 1 portion of the study, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is the highest concentration that a drug achieves in the blood after administration in a dosing interval., Multiple time points in Cycles 1, 2 and 3 (4 weeks each) and Day 1 of remaining cycles until end of treatment for approximately 1 year for recurrent subjects and in every week of Day 1 until Week 7 and end of treatment for the newly diagnosed subjects
Objective Response Rate, The objective response rate is defined as the proportion of participants with at least one measurable lesion at baseline who achieves a confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RANO criteria (except Arm B and Arm C of Phase 1 portion)., At each visit for approximately 1 year|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as number of days from the date of first dose to the date of death for all dosed participants (except Arm B and Arm C of Phase 1 portion)., At each visit for approximately 1 year|Duration of Overall Response, The duration of overall response for a given participant is defined as the number of days from the day the RANO criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is recorded first) to the date that progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented (based RANO criteria) (except Arm B and Arm C of Phase 1 portion)., At each visit for approximately 1 year
