Transdermal Buprenorphine for the Treatment of Radiation-Induced Mucositis Pain in Head and Neck Cancer Patients
This is a single-arm prospective clinical trial to determine the safety and feasibility of using transdermal buprenorphine in alleviation of radiation induced mucositis pain in head and neck cancer patients.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Buprenorphine|DRUG: Tramadol|DEVICE: Oral Mucositis (OM) Pain App
The Number of Subjects Who Achieve at Least a 30 Percent Decrease in Pain From Baseline in VAS Pain Score Calculated From BPI Questionnaire., The Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-sf) is a nine-item self-administered questionnaire used to evaluate the severity of a patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning. The patient is asked to rate their worst, least, average, and current pain intensity -- 0 being no pain and 10 being the pain as bad as you can imagine (within the previous 24 hours)., Baseline up to Week 9
The Number of Subjects Who Achieve at Least a 30 Percent Decrease in Pain From Baseline in Average Daily Pain Score Calculated by OM Pain App., The Oral Mucositis (OM) Pain App is a smartphone application that was designed to permit subjects to key in pain severity using a visual analog 0-10 scale. The amount of pain that a subject feels ranges across a continuum from none (0) to an extreme amount of pain (10). The App is programed with an alarm to prompt the patient to record pain severity at prescribed intervals daily and through spontaneous patient input. Compliance is measured by subjects entering in a value four times a day into the OM Pain App., Baseline up to Week 9
Hypothesis: Long-acting transdermal buprenorphine (FDA-approved dose from 5 mcg to 20 mcg /week) in conjunction with oral tramadol (50mg-400mg) as needed for breakthrough pain would lead to significant reduction in mucositis-related pain in locally advanced head and neck cancer patients being treated with radiation therapy by the end of treatment and follow up period of 12 weeks.

This is a single-arm, interventional, supportive care clinical trial for head and neck cancer patients evaluating role of transdermal (TD) buprenorphine and tramadol combination in alleviating radiation-induced mucositis pain. This will generate preliminary data to test the feasibility and efficacy of study drug regimen. The study will also test the clinical usefulness of the smart phone pain app in recording and reporting radiation induced mucositis pain.
