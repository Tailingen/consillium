The Affection of Two Chest Management for Enhanced Recovery Program After Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomy.
Comparing the influences of different chest tube managements for enhanced recovery program after video-Assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy.
Chest Tube
OTHER: Large size tube|OTHER: Drainage ball
Hospitalization days, The numbers of days of patients stay in the hospital after surgery, From the first days after surgery to discharge,up to 4 weeks.
VAS scores, VAS(Visual Analogue Score) is a method to value the degree of patient's pain after surgery.This method has a scale range from 1 to 10.Patient chose a number from it to represent his(her) pain.The "1" represents painless and the "10" represents sever pain which he(she) unable to bear. The pain is increasing with the increasing of number., Pain is measured by VAS on the first 24 hours of after operation and the first 24 hours after tube removing.|Analgesics, The number of analgesics using after surgery., Counting the total analgesics using times through study completion, an average of 3 months.|Drainage, The total volume of fluid., Measure the volume every 24 hours,up to 4 weeks|Pulmonary recruitment, Chest X-Ray, The first 24 hours after surgery and 8 hours before leaving hospital.|Adverse event, Air-leakage or seepage from the surrounding of tube., Counting the times of adverse events through study completion, an average of 3 months.
The Enhanced Recovery Program has a series of observation data contains hospitalization days, adverse events, drainage, extubation, visual analogue scale(VAS) scores and the number of analgesic using.The investigators plan to enroll 60 patients and divide them into two groups to compare the influences of different chest tube managements for enhanced recovery program after video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy.
