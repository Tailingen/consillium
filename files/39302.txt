GPC3 Targeted Fluorescence Image Guided Surgery of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study is to evaluate whether intraoperative fluorescence imaging targeting GPC3 can aid improve the surgical accuracy of hepatocellular carcinoma.

The main purposes of this study include:

① To raise the detection rate of hepatocellular carcinoma intraoperatively using the novel NIR-II fluorescence molecular imaging and the GPC-3 targeted fluorophore.

② To validate the safety and effectiveness of the designed GPC-3 targeted fluorophore for clinical application.
