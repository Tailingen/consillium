Sentinel Node and Endometrial Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate the relevance of sentinel node in endometrial cancer. Sentinel node is thought to reflect the status of lymph node. Only 10 to 20% of women with endometrial cancer exhibit lymph node metastasis hence systematic lymphadenectomy is questionable. In breast cancer, melanoma and vulvar cancer, sentinel node has emerged as an alternative to complete lymphadenectomy.
Endometrial Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Detection of sentinel node
Detection and false negative rates of sentinel node, During the surgery (hysterectomy)
Morbidity and recurrence rates, During 24 months
To investigate the relevance of sentinel node in endometrial cancer. Sentinel node is though to reflect the status of lymph node. Only 10 to 20% of women with endometrial cancer exhibit lymph node metastasis hence systematic lymphadenectomy is questionable. In breast cancer, melanoma and vulvar cancer, sentinel node has emerged as an alternative to complete lymphadenectomy. The objective of our trial is to validate the concept of sentinel node in endometrial cancer.
