Tissue Analysis After Tumor Ablation for Liver Metastases Leading to Immediate Retreatment
This study will see whether collecting and analyzing needle biopsy samples from cancer liver metastases after a tumor ablation procedure will be able to identify cancer cells that are still alive. The results of these biopsies could help determine the next treatment for your cancer, but the biopsies could cause side effects.
Liver Metastases
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: [18-F]- FDG - PET|PROCEDURE: Tumor ablation (TA)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET/CT Scan
Tumor response, will be measured according to RECIST and PERCIST 1.0. The first CT and PET scan taken after ablation will be considered the new baseline for subsequent comparisons and measurements., 2 years
