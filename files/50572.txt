Safety and Activity of 90Y-Labeled IDEC-159 in Subjects With Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma
This is a Phase I/II open-label, dose-escalating study in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The objectives of the study are to obtain information on the safety of radiolabeled IDEC-159, as well as its activity in colorectal cancer. Another objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The study duration is 2 years with visits occuring daily and/or weekly for the first 3 months, and every 6 weeks until the end of the 2 year period.
