Avelumab In Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Stage Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma (JAVELIN HODGKINS)
This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center study comprising a lead-in phase and an expansion phase. The lead-in phase is a multiple-dose, randomized, parallel-arm, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of avelumab as a single agent in adult patients with cHL. Patients enrolled in the lead-in phase of this study are required to have relapsed following a prior autologous or allogeneic HSCT, or to be ineligible for HSCT. Based on the preliminary TO, safety, and efficacy results from the lead-in phase, the expansion phase will evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of single-agent avelumab utilizing an intra-patient dose escalation paradigm based on two of the dosing regimens studied in the lead-in phase in 40 cHL patients in whom an allogeneic HSCT has failed.

This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center study comprising a lead-in phase and an expansion phase. The lead-in phase is a multiple-dose, randomized, parallel-arm, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of avelumab as a single agent in adult patients with cHL. Patients enrolled in the lead-in phase of this study are required to have relapsed following a prior autologous or allogeneic HSCT, or to be ineligible for HSCT. Based on the preliminary TO, safety, and efficacy results from the lead-in phase, the expansion phase will evaluate the anti-tumor activity and safety of single-agent avelumab utilizing an intra-patient dose escalation paradigm based on two of the dosing regimens studied in the lead-in phase in 40 cHL patients in whom an allogeneic HSCT has failed.
