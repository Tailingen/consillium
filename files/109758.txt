ProA Study: ProActive Management Model in Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC) Treated by Apalutamide
This is a Phase 4, multi-center, single arm, open-label clinical study to evaluate whether participants with mHSPC treated with apalutamide will benefit from the 4A ProActive Management Model.

The study will include a Screening Period of up to 14 days before assignment on Day 1 to establish study eligibility. Participants will get 4A ProActive Management according to the protocol .

As the background disease treatment, participants will received apalutamide according to local label (240 mg, 4 × 60 mg tablets, orally once daily with or without food) with duration of at least 6 months. Participants will have a Safety Follow-Up Visit within 30 days after the Visit 7.

Participants will be monitored for safety, starting from the time of signing the informed consent until 30 days after the Visit 7. AEs including laboratory AEs will be graded and summarized using Version 5.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.
Prostate Cancer (Adenocarcinoma)
BEHAVIORAL: The 4A ProActive Management Model
To evaluate the change of FACT-P total score after 6 months from baseline.The Fact-P is the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate.The score range is 0-156 points. The higher the score is, the higher the quality of life of the subjects is., The Fact-P is the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate.The score range is 0-156 points. The FACT-P scale has a uniform calculation formula, which is obtained by summing up the scores of each subscale.FACT-P Total score=(PWB score)+ (SWB score) +(EWB score) + (FWB score) + (PCS score)。The higher the score is, the higher the quality of life of the subjects is., 6 months
