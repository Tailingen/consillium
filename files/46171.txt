Secondary PRevention in Cardiovascular Disease by a Nursing Guided Program (SPRING)
DESIGN: Controlled clinical trial with single randomization, unmasked, open and multicentric.

CENTERS: University Hospital of A Coru√±a and University Hospital of Ferrol CONDITION TO STUDY: Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). INTERVENTION:monitored outhospital not inhospital supervised. MAIN OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of major adverse events (total mortality, new ACS, coronary revascularization, all-cause hospitalization) during the one-year period after hospitalization for ACS.

The SPRING study aims to learn whether a remote, nurse-guided secondary prevention program reduces adverse events in patients who suffer an infarction during the subsequent one-year period. The SPRING study focuses not only on adverse events but also on the patients' state of life in terms of diet, physical exercise, emotional state, tobacco use, and adherence to medical treatment. Nursing is a profession in charge of preserving the health of patients, which is why the remote secondary cardiovascular prevention program of this study is coordinated by a nurse.
