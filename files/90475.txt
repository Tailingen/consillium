Capeox Regimen Combined With Sintilimab and Bevacizumab for Gastric Cancer
The median survival time of first-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer is about one year, and the treatment is still facing the bottleneck. This is a one-arm, open and prospective phase II clinical study. Recruit patients who have been diagnosed with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach and gastroesophageal junction and have not received systematic treatment.

the appropriate dose of Bevacizumab, According to the incidence of dose-limited toxic dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) after 2 and 4 cycles of Ib phase treatment, the appropriate dose of Bevacizumab combination was determined., 1.5-3months|the objective Response Rate (ORR) of the experimental group., The main purpose of phase II is the objective Response Rate (ORR) of the experimental group., 2years
progression-free survival（PFS）, Refers to the time between the patient's admission to the treatment and the disease progression, 1-2years|overall survival (OS), Refers to the time from admission to treatment to death of patients, 1-3years|disease control rate (DCR), Refers to the proportion of people who receive this program in the whole patient population and achieve complete response ,partial response or stable disease and last for a period of time, 1-3years
The median survival time of first-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer is about one year, and the treatment is still facing the bottleneck. Bevacizumab is an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted therapy drug. It is doubtful whether the low dose of bevacizumab in gastric cancer patients leads to poor curative effect. Now the treatment of advanced gastric cancer has come to the era of immunotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen of daclizumab combined with CAPEOX has been proved to be effective in clinical studies. No clinical study has confirmed the safety and efficacy of CAPEOX regimen combined with sintilimab and bevacizumab.
