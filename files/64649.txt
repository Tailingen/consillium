A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and Antitumor Activity of ALK201 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, multicenter dose escalation and expansion study of ALK201. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of ALK201 as a monotherapy in adult participants with Advanced Solid Tumors. The study will also identify recommended dose(s) for subsequent clinical studies of ALK201.
