Radiotherapy Combined With Irinotecan and Apatinib Followed by PD-1 Antibody and Apatinib for Advanced Solid Tumors
An exploratory study to evaluate for the treatment of advanced solid tumors that failed standard treatments.
Solid Tumor
RADIATION: radiotherapy|DRUG: irinotecan liposome|DRUG: apatinib|DRUG: PD-1 antibody
Objective Response Rate, Evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, 2 years
Disease Control Rate, Evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, 2 years|Clinical benefit rate, Evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, 2 years|Correlation between immune microenvironment parameters of target lesions and efficacy, Evaluated by researchers based on the RECIST 1.1 standard, 2 years|Drug-related Adverse Event, Evaluated by researchers, 2 years|Drug-related Serious Adverse Event, Evaluated by researchers, 2 years
This is a prospective, single-arm, observational study. After the subjects meet the inclusive and exclusive criteria, then they will receive radiotherapy combined with irinotecan liposome and apatinib followed by PD-1 antibody and apatinib.
