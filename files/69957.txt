Ceftolozane-Tazobactam for Directed Treatment of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Bacteremia and Pneumonia in Patients With Hematological Malignancies and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
This is an open-label study, where participants will be given ceftolozane-tazobactam as the primary treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Open-label means both the investigator and the participant will known what drug will be given. Participants will be followed for approximately 60 days. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of serious bacterial infection and the investigator hypothesizes that ceftolozane/tazobactam may be effective as the primary antibiotic treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
