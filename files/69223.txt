FeAsiBility of a Treatment Free Interval in Newly Diagnosed MM Patients Treated With Daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (HOVON174MM)
In the Netherlands, the standard treatment for multiple myeloma is a combination of different medicines named daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone, abbreviated as Dara-Rd. In many patients this treatment results in suppressing the disease for a long time. The treatment is continued until it is not effective anymore and the disease progresses.

But until now it is unknown whether continuous therapy also leads to prolonging life. In addition, there are concerns about side effects, leading to a reduced quality of life, the development of severe toxicity that remains, which hampers subsequent therapy, and high costs due to prolonged treatment.

There are indications that temporarily stopping treatment is safe, leading to fewer side effects and allows recovering from toxicity or damage due to treatment. This may improve the quality of life.
