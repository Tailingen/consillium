Alpha Radiation Emitters Device for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer Emitters for the Treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
A unique approach for cancer treatment employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation emitter device for advanced pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic Cancer|Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer|Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DEVICE: DaRT seeds insertion
Feasibility- DaRT seed placement, Feasibility will be determined according to the rate of successful placement of DaRT seeds via imaging, Immediately following the insertion procedure|Safety- Adverse events, Safety will be determined according to the overall incidence of device-related SAE's graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria, Safety will be determined according to the overall incidence of device-related SAE's graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria, from DaRT-insertion up to 48 hours
To evaluate the Efficacy of the Alpha DaRT seeds for locally advanced pancreatic cancer, Local control evaluation according to RECIST v1.1, 1 months and 3 months|To evaluate the Efficacy of the Alpha DaRT seeds by measuring the CA-19-9 markers levels, Change in CA 19-9 levels, 1 months and 3 months|Efficacy - to evaluate what is the percent of the Tumor Coverage by the Alpha DaRT seeds, Tumor Coverage, immediately following the insertion procedure]|Efficacy- Alpha DaRT seeds, Overall incidence of device-related SAE's graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria, from DaRT-insertion up to initiation of a possible postablation therapy or up to a maximum three months
Exploratory Objective -to evaluate the changes in the immune markers by Blood samples for immune response, Changes in immune markers following treatment ,These biomarkers include:

* CD3
* CD4
* CD8
* CD69
* CD137, 1 month
This is a prospective, interventional, single-center, open label, single arm study. The study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and Safety of Intratumoral Diffusing Alpha Radiation Emitters for the Treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer

The study will be comprised of a screening period, DaRT insertion visit, 3 months follow up per subject and 2 years for accrual and trial completion. The total duration of the study will be 24 months from the DaRT insertion procedure.

15 patients with a safety interim analysis after the 5 first patients . patients with advanced pancreatic cancer will be recruited by the investigational site.

Eligible patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria (as assessed during the screening period) will be invited to the site for the procedure of DaRT seeds insertion.
