A First-in-human (FIH), Phase I Study of PTX-912 in Patients with Locally Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of PTX-912 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. To evaluate the PK and immunogenicity profile of PTX-912. To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of PTX-912.

Participants will be treated with PTX-912 via iv infusion, every 2 weeks until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or 12 months of total study therapy.
