Adaptive Treatment De-escalation in Favorable Risk HPV-Positive Oropharyngeal Carcinoma
This will be a phase II single-arm clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of deescalating chemoradiation treatment based on mid-treatment tumor response determined by rapid nodal shrinkage and clearance of circulating HPV plasma tumor DNA . The primary objective of this study is to evaluate progression-free survival at 2 years.

Progression-free survival at 2 years, The rate of progression-free survival will be estimated using time to failure methods; Kaplan Meier curves will be provided and the rate at 2 years will be estimated using a 95% confidence interval. Patients who do not experience progression of disease and have not died will be censored on the date of last follow up., 2 Years
The secondary objectives will include 2-year loco-regional control and overall survival, quality of life, and late toxicity. Quality of life outcomes will be assessed with a validated, self-reported questionnaire. Late toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Additionally, the prognostic value of positive HPV in salivary rinse as well as plasma at mid and post- treatment time points will be evaluated with a baseline evaluation pre-treatment. Radiomic analysis of pre-treatment imaging will be correlated with outcomes.
