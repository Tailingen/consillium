Molecular Testing to Direct Extent of Initial Thyroid Surgery
The research study consists of the participant agreeing to 1) the use of preoperative molecular testing (ThyroSeq) to guide extent of initial surgery and 2) the prospective collection of medical record data related to treatment of thyroid cancer.
Thyroid Cancer
PROCEDURE: Thyroid lobectomy|PROCEDURE: Total thyroidectomy with CCND
Number of patients who require completion thyroidectomy for aggressive histology features, Histology characteristics of tumor will be assessed including type of cancer, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, and margin status to assess if completion thyroidectomy is needed per the 2015 ATA guidelines, 2 years
Number of patients who had central compartment neck dissection but no lymph node metastasis were identified, 2 years|Number of patients with operative complications, incidence of permanent nerve injury, hypocalcemia, readmission, 2 years|Recurrence, >2 years|QOL metric - FACT-G cumulative score preop, postop, and at followup, 2 years|QOL metric - QOL-Thyroid cumulative score preop, postop, and at followup, 2 years|QOL metric - SF36 cumulative score preop, postop, and at followup, 2 years
The aim of the proposed pilot study is to use a clinical algorithm that incorporates molecular, clinical and radiographic factors to inform surgical management. This study is the first to propose molecular-directed surgical management for this commonly diagnosed cancer.
