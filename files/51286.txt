The Efficacy and Safety of EOB-MRI Guided Microwave Ablation for Early HCC: A Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Study
HCC is one of most common causes of cancer-related death in the world due to lately diagnosis by typical hallmarks which rely on completed arterialization. So it is important to earlier diagnose and treat hypovascular early HCC(eHCC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of microwave ablation for early HCC, also to explore the feasibility of EOB-MRI (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI) guided ablation.
Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: MWA
5-years overall survival (OS) after MWA for early HCC, Analyze the efficacy and safety of EOB-MRI-guided microwave ablation in the treatment of eHCC;, 5 years
Rate of completed ablation after MWA, Ablation effect assessed by EOB-MRI one month after ablation, rate of completed ablation at one month
