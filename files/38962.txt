The aim of this research project is to assess the barriers and resources (both individual and environmental), as well as the psychological, clinical, and contextual factors that may influence adherence to pharmacological therapy in patients with actively treated metastatic breast cancer.

This will be achieved through a qualitative analysis focused on pharmacological therapy and its administration methods.

For this study, 4 focus groups will be conducted to identify the needs, barriers, and psychological, clinical, and contextual factors that may influence adherence to pharmacological treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer, as well as their preferences regarding these treatments.

The number of focus groups was determined in accordance with recommendations from the literature for identifying relevant themes, which suggest that to achieve an adequate level of saturation, four or more focus groups are necessary.
