Evaluate the Long-term Safety and Effectiveness of EN3267, screening, 2 week titration period and 12 monthly study visits
This was a Phase 3 non-randomized, open-label, multicentre study designed to evaluate the long-term safety of EN3267 in the treatment of BTcP in opioid-tolerant cancer patients. The study was conducted in 2 parts:

1. A Titration Period during which patients had up to 2 weeks to determine a single, effective dose of study medication (EN3267) for adequate treatment of BTcP, and
2. A maintenance Period of up to 12 months in which episodes of BTcP were treated with study medication.
