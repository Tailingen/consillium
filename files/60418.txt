CAR - γ δ T Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed and Refractory CD7 Positive T Cell-derived Malignant Tumors
This is a study on the clinical application of chimeric antigen receptor modified γδ T cells (CAR - γδ T cells) in relapsed and refractory CD7 Positive T cell-derived malignant tumors.The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of car - γ δ T cell infusion in patients with relapsed and refractory CD7 Positive T cell-derived malignancies.

DRUG: Chimeric antigen receptor modified γδ T cells
ORR 3, 3-month objective response rate, three months after CAR-T cells infusion
γδT cells are known as "a great candidate for car-t cells". Although they only account for 2% - 5% of all T cells in our body, they are a natural killer.

CD7 is recognized as a sensitive marker of T-ALL, and its expression level on T-ALL cells is opposite to CD3: compared with normal T cells, the expression level of CD7 on T-ALL cells is significantly increased (P \< 0.001), while the expression level of CD3 on T-ALL cells is significantly decreased (P \< 0.001). At the same time, CD7 expression is absent in about 10% of normal T cells, and these CD7 negative T cells have the ability of normal T cells to express cytokines. Therefore, CD7 has become a potential target for the treatment of T-ALL because of its specificity and safety.
