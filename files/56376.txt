Enhanced Recovery Protocols in Gynecologic Oncology
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) are developed to provide a systematic structure for managing postsurgical patients.These protocols promote evidenced-based practices and implement a multidisciplinary effort to maintain normal physiology in the perioperative period and aid in earlier recovery. The present study aims to investigate the feasibility of and compliance to a structured ERAS protocol among Gynecological Oncological Centers in Greece as well as to compare the outcomes among patients that fullfilled the minimum number of necessary criteria, compared to those that were enrolled in ERAS protocols but did not meet the sufficient necessary criteria.
ERAS|Gynecologic Cancer|Perioperative Complication|Postoperative Pain|Quality of Life|Infections
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: ERAS group|COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Control group
Duration of hospitalization, From date of hospitalization until the date of discharge or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 months., Up to 30 days postoperatively|Perioperative infections, Number of participants with postoperative infections (including surgical site, pulmonary and urinary tract infections), Postoperatively (30 days)
Postoperative quality of life, Documentation of quality of life using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C40) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) questionnaires. The EORTC-QLQ C30 involves 30 questions that are rated from 1 (no impact on quality of life) to 4 (debilitating symptoms). The FACT-G assesses physical, family, emotional and functional wellbeing through 27 questions that are scaled from 0 (no impact) to 4 (very much)., Postoperatively (30 days)|Postoperative morbidity (other than infectious) using the Clavien-Dindo classification, Major events such as pulmonary embolism,accuse myocardial infarction,etc, 30 days|Interval to adjuvant therapy, The interval between surgical treatment and adjuvant therapy (radiation and/or chemotherapytreatment) will be documented, Up to 100 days|Recurrence rates, Recurrent disease will be monitored through 3 year of follow up, 3 years follow-up|Overall survival, Overall survival of the patients will be measured through 3 year of follow up, 3 years follow-up
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) are developed to provide a systematic structure for managing postsurgical patients.These protocols promote evidenced-based practices and implement a multidisciplinary effort to maintain normal physiology in the perioperative period and aid in earlier recovery. ERAS protocols briefly include pre-admission education, pre-operative nutritional care, specific recommendations for pre-operative medications, a standardized anesthetic protocol, perioperative fluid management, multimodal analgesia (MMA), early mobilization, and early removal of urinary catheters.

ERGO study study aims to investigate the feasibility of and compliance to a structured ERAS protocol among Gynecological Oncological Centers in Greece as well as to compare the outcomes among patients that fullfilled the minimum number of necessary criteria, compared to those that were enrolled in ERAS protocols but did not meet the sufficient necessary criteria. Patients will be registered into the trial before surgery. Quality assurance program will be in place for both patients that will fulfill the ERAS criteria as well as for those that will not fulfill them.
