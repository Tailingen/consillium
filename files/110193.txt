Peroperative Fluid Management in Major Gynecological Cancer Surgeries
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of perioperative fluid management on postoperative kidney damage in gynecological cancer surgeries.

The main question\[s\] it aims to answer are:

Does fluid management applied with different hemodynamic monitoring methods affect the risk of postoperative AKI? In our clinic, three different fluid management strategies are applied depending on the anesthetist experience. Acute kidney injury will be evaluated according to the postoperative AKIN classification of conventional fluid therapy and targeted fluid therapy with noninvasive or minimally invasive monitoring.
Fluid Overload|Fluid Loss|Perioperative/Postoperative Complications|Acute Kidney Injury
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Akut kidnet injury(AKI)
Evaluation of acute kidney injury, Our primary aim was to evaluate the postoperative day(POD1 ) creatinine values(mg/dl), Change from preoperative to postoperative day 1(POD1)creatinine values(mg/dl)
Peroperative fluid amounts, The seconder aim to investigate the amount of fluid used peroperatively, during the operation period
The intensive care unit admission, The other aim to investigate the intensive care unit admission, posoperatively up to 1 months|Length of stay, The other aim to evaluate the duration of hospital stay., postoperative 30 days
Our study was designed as a retrospective study. The files of patients over the age of 18 who underwent open abdominal surgery due to ASAII and III gynecological malignancy will be examined retrospectively. Patients who cannot be monitored peroperatively and who undergo HIPEC will be excluded from the study. Patients will be divided into 3 groups according to the fluid management strategy and the hemodynamic monitoring used: Group 1: patients receiving conventional fluid therapy; Group 2: patients receiving targeted fluid therapy with noninvasive monitoring; Group 3: patients receiving targeted fluid therapy with minimally invasive monitoring.
