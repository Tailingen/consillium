Health Status Evaluation for Cancer Survivors by Non-intrusive Sensing System
To improve quality of life of elderly cancer survivors

1. Using physical activity and environmental sensing technology
2. Monitoring physiological indicators of cancer recurrence

   * Analyzing the patient's circadian rhythm, frailty and his/her vital sign.
   * Vital sign includes blood pressure, weight and hrv.
3. Collecting the patient information in real time

   * Giving alarm information to the patient, if any special cases our system found.
   * Giving circadian rhythm report to the patient.
   * Giving healthy report to the patient, collected from his/her vital sign.
