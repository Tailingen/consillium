Donafenib Combined With Hepatic Artery Chemoembolization for Perioperative Treatment of Liver Transplantation
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of donafenib and TACE in the perioperative period of liver transplantation.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Donafenib|PROCEDURE: TACE
Downstaging success rate, Definition of successful downstaging: those who meet the UCSF standard with baseline AFP \> 1000 ng/ml need to be reduced to \< 500 ng/ml., Immediately after downstaging treatment
Objective response rate before transplantation (ORR), 1 year|Complete pathological response rate (pCR), 1 year|Recurrence-free survival (RFS), Including median RFS, 1, 2, 3-years RFS rate, 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Including median OS, 1, 2, 3-years OS rate, 3 years|Adverse events, 3 years
This study plans to enroll about 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who do not meet the UCSF standard, they will receive donafenib combined with TACE in downstaging period and donafenib only in adjuvant period.

Before the liver transplantation, the safety and efficacy will be evaluated every 3 and 6 weeks, respectively, until liver transplantation or the disease progression that couldn't be treated by TACE.

After transplantation, the safety and efficacy will be evaluated every 6 and 12 weeks, respectively, until intolerable toxicity, recurrence or up to 12 months treatment.
