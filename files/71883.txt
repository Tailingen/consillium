Open-label Study Investigating of OKN-007 Combined With Temozolomide in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma
This is a phase II open-label study investigating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic(PK) properties of OKN-007 combined with temozolomide(TMZ) in patients with recurrent glioblastoma(GBM). All patients will have been previously treated with the standard-of-care treatment which includes surgical resection, radiation and chemotherapy, and in some cases treatment for recurrent disease. Patients with unequivocal recurrence (first or greater) established by MRI and meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be eligible for OKN-007 treatment on this protocol.
