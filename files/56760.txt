The Myeloma Pack: A Multi-Modality Educational Intervention Strategy to Engage Patients With Multiple Myeloma
Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients are prone to poor quality of life (QoL) as a result of the anxiety and depression they suffer due to a poor understanding of their disease. Improving patient understanding of their illness and addressing issues that induce distress impacts QoL. This prospective, interventional study is designed to see if a structured psycho-educational program called "the myeloma pack intervention" (MPI), implemented in parallel with standard cancer treatment, can improve QoL for patients with MM.

The purpose of this research study is to see if the MPI educational program, implemented in parallel with standard of care treatment, can improve overall quality of life (QoL) for MM patients. This program will be delivered to the study participants by multiple modes of communication including written material in a boxed pack, online tutorials, telephone and text message follow up. If they do not have online access at home, the study coordinators will arrange access for the participants at the Clinic. A health advisor will work with the physicians to coordinate their participation in the program while they are on active treatment for myeloma. The Pack Health Advisors will only give them guidance about the study and they will not provide any kind of clinical advice to the participants.
