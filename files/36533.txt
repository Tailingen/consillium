Bendamustine Hydrochloride in Combination With Rituximab in Patients With Relapsed Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Rituximab
Overall Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response) at the End of Cycles 3 and 6 Using the 2007 International Working Group Criteria, The International Working Group (IWG) criteria (Cheson et al 2007) for a complete response is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A partial response is at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, and no new sites of disease should be observed.

95% CIs are calculated using binomial exact method., Month 3 (end of cycle 3), Month 6 (end of cycle 6)
Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the time between the date of the first response to date of progression or death. Response is determined on the basis of the 2007 IWG criteria. A complete response is a complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy. A partial response is at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses, no increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver or spleen, and no new sites of disease should be observed., Day 1 up to Month 43|Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from first exposure to study medication to disease progression or relapse, or death due to any cause. Progression is defined using the 2007 International Working Group criteria, as any new lesion or increase by at least 50% of previously involved sites from nadir., Day 1 up to Month 45|Kaplan-Meier Estimate for Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from first exposure to study medication to death, or to last date from adverse events, concomitant medications, vital signs, lost to follow-up, or last known alive, for overall survival censoring date., Day 1 up to Month 57|Shifts in Baseline to Post-Treatment in Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Participants had a whole-body PET at baseline and at the end of cycle 6 or the end-of-treatment visit. Negative PET refers to PET results showing no abnormal lymph nodes; conversely, positive PET refers to PET results showing abnormal lymph nodes., Baseline (Days -30 to 0), post treatment (up to Month 9, 30 days following completion of therapy)|Shifts in Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, The ECOG scale is:

* Grade 0: Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease activities without restriction;
* Grade 1: Restricted in physically strenuous activity, ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light nature;
* Grade 2: Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to work. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours;
* Grade 3: Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair \> 50% of waking hours;
* Grade 4: Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Confined to bed or Chair.

The shift table compares baseline ECOG scores to the ECOG scores as of the last treatment visit., Day 0 (baseline) up to Month 8
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma.
