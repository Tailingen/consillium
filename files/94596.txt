Evaluating an Amino Acid Based Medical Food w/ Diarrhea in Carcinoid Syndrome & Other NETs
Primary Objective:

To assess how an amino acid based medical food (Enterade®) helps maintain the intestine's ability to absorb and retain fluids, leading to a reduction in diarrhea due to Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) and/or Carcinoid Syndrome. This improvement in the absorption will be assessed in part by evaluating changes in average daily stool frequency from baseline in patients receiving Enterade®. Each subject serves as his or her own control.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess subject reported health-related quality of life in subjects before and after compound administration.
* To characterize the side effect profile and tolerability of Enterade® as measured by the number of total 8-oz Enterade® bottles consumed throughout the trial, and average drinks per day.
* To evaluate changes in serum electrolytes before and after administration of Eenterade®.
* To assess intravenous fluid requirement and/or hospitalization for dehydration secondary to diarrhea between control observation period and active Enterade® period.
* To evaluate difference in utilization of standard-of-care anti-diarrheal medications between control observation period and Enterade® period.
* To compare subjective feeling of bloating and flatulence before and after administration of Enterade®.
* To evaluate changes in patient weight before and after administration of Enterade®.

Effect of amino acids in tightening the intestinal barrier and protecting from antigenic translocation by evaluating plasma circulating cytokine levels in peripheral blood sample., ELISA assays will be used to assess pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα and serum endotoxin from blood samples collected., 56 days
Evaluation of increased bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation., Gut inflammation will be assessed through the analysis of fecal lactoferrin using stool specimens., 56 days
This prospective, phase 2 study is to assess how Enterade® will affect patient-reported quality of life and intestinal absorption in patients with Carcinoid Syndrome and Neuroendocrine Tumors. The hypothesis is that Enterade® when combined with standard supportive care will improve patient-reported quality of life and help maintain the small bowel's ability to absorb and retain fluids, possibly leading to a reduction in diarrhea frequency.

* This is a non-randomized, supportive-care study.
* Potentially eligible patients will be screened in the University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center clinics.
* During the screening visit, immediately after signing informed consent, the participant will be given both flavors of enterade® (original vanilla and refreshing orange) to test tolerability and taste.
* Eligible subjects will be given a stool diary and will be asked to document daily stool output (frequency and consistency of stool), use of anti-diarrheal medication and gastrointestinal discomforts (bloating, cramping).
* All lab and screening tests should be completed within 2 weeks prior to registration/initiation of study.
* The study is broken into 3 distinct segments and will apply to all enrolled participants: Baseline observation (Weeks 1-4), Enterade® administration period (4 weeks), Post-Enterade® Period (4 weeks).
* After relapse of diarrhea is documented or the 4 weeks of post-Enterade® observation are completed (whatever happens first), participants will be given the option to restart Enterade® for 1 additional month.
