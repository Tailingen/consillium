Docetaxel and S1 (DS) Versus S1 and Cisplatin (SP) in Curatively Resected Stage IIIB/IV Gastric Cancer
Docetaxel was the first drug that showed survival benefits when added to the CF regimen, but it was very toxic. Docetaxel is also has a synergistic anti-cancer effect with S-1, in phase I/II studies. The use of a docetaxel plus S-1 combination as first-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer achieved response rates of 46\~56% and a median survival time of 14.0\~14.3 months.

Based upon this background, the aim of this study is to detect a significant increase in 3 year DFS of disease for the test group (DS) relative to the Control group (SP).
Gastric Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: DS|DRUG: SP
3-year disease free survival(DFS), Tumor assessments with chest X-rays and CT or MRI scan will be done at 6 months after randomization (after the end of the treatment period), then every 3 months for the first 2 years after randomization and then every 6 months for coming 3 years then one year basis until completion of the study., 3 years
