A Study of PEP07 (Checkpoint Kinase 1 Inhibitor) in Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is To establish the safety profile and determine the dose-limited toxicity (DLT) of PEP07 monotherapy in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PEP07 monotherapy.

Participants will receive PEP07 administered orally once daily (QD) for 2 consecutive days and 5 days off, every week for 4 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, confirmed pregnancy, death, consent withdrawal, or other anti-cancer treatment is required, or the Sponsor ends the study, whichever occurs first.

This is a Phase 1, open-label, multi-center study recruiting patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

The study will utilize an Accelerated Titration Design in the lower dose levels followed by a traditional 3+3 dose escalation design at higher dose levels until RP2D is determined. The starting dose will be 40 mg.

All potential study candidates will provide informed consent and will undergo screening procedures before participating in the study. After a screening period of up to 28 days, qualified patients will be enrolled to receive their assigned dose regimen of PEP07 monotherapy.
