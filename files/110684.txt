18F-FACBC PET/CT and the PSA Kinetics for PCa Patients With Biochemical Recurrence.
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the fifth-most common cancer for male with a seventh highest cancer-related death in Taiwan. Currently, the incidence and mortality rate are still increasing rapidly. The treatment decision planning is made up by clinical charts like Gleason score (GS), TNM stage and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. However, after definitive therapy for PCa with either external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or radical prostatectomy (RP), up to half patients experience biochemical recurrence (BCR). Although not all patients with BCR proceed to develop disease progression, it is important to identify early lesion to initiate salvage treatment.

Anti-1-amino-3-\[18F\]fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid (18F-FACBC) positron emission tomography (PET) is a imaging marker for L-amino acid transport evaluation. Many cancers including PCa have up-regulated amino acid transport tied to their proliferative potential. Recently, 18F-FACBC was included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the management of recurrent PCa patients. As we know, PSA level and PSA kinetics are valuable for the prediction of recurrence. The objective of this study is to investigate the correlation between the detection rate of 18F-FACBC PET/CT and the PSA kinetics for PCa patients with BCR.
