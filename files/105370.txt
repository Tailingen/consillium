Genetic Variates of Response to Cisplatin, Vinblastine, and Temozolomide (CVT) in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma
The investigators want to learn to predict which tumors will respond to CVT chemotherapy. CVT is a combination of three drugs - cisplatin, vinblastine, and temozolomide. We and other investigators have used CVT in melanoma patients and found that tumors got significantly smaller in 30-40% of cases. In this study, the investigators want to get a precise idea of how many patients will respond to CVT. Also they want to test which genes in the tumor are turned on and which are turned off. We hope this will teach us to know in the future which tumors will respond to CVT.
Melanoma|Skin Cancer
DRUG: Cisplatin, Vinblastine, Temozolomide
Overall Response to CVT Chemotherapy., Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 2 years
