Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Detection of Peritoneal Mesothelioma
For cancers, such as mesothelioma, that spread to the lining of the stomach, detecting the cancer is very difficult with CT or MRI scans. Researchers at the University of Chicago want to find out if the new experimental MRI and ultrasound imaging techniques do a better job of detecting these cancers. Researchers will use new MRI and ultrasound techniques to see if it can find evidence of cancer that has spread to the lining of the abdomen, and right now these new techniques are only used for research.
