A Study of SHR-1210 in Combination With Apatinib or Chemotherapy in Subjects With Advanced PLC or BTC
This an open-label，Non-Randominzed Phase 2 study to evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of SHR-1210 in combination with Apatinib or chemotherapy (FOLFOX4 or GEMOX regimen) in subjects with Advanced PLC.or BTC Participants with advanced PLC who failed or intolerable to prior systemic therapy will be treated with SHR-1210 plus Apatinib; Participants with advanced PLC or BTC who have never received prior systemic therapy will be treated with SHR-1210 plus FOLFOX4 or GEMOX regimen.
