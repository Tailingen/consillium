PHOENIX DDR/Anti-PD-L1 Trial: A Pre-surgical Window of Opportunity and Post-surgical Adjuvant Biomarker Study of DNA Damage Response Inhibition and/or Anti-PD-L1 Immunotherapy in Patients With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Resistant Residual Triple Negative Breast Cancer
PHOENIX is a window of opportunity (WOP), open-label, multi-centre, phase IIa trial comprising multiple non-comparative treatment cohorts with patient allocation via randomisation. The trial consists of two parts: a post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy, preoperative WOP component (PART 1); and a post-operative component (PART 2).

PHOENX aims to assess whether short exposure to a DNA damage response (DDR) inhibitor and/or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in a preoperative WOP in patients with post-NACT high residual disease, generates a signal of anti-tumour biological activity within residual disease tissue.

Cohorts B and C co-primary endpoint #1: Change in mean proliferation index (as measured by tumour cell Ki67 immunohistochemistry) post WOP intervention within post-treatment biopsy compared to pre-treatment baseline biopsy., Change in mean proliferation index (as measured by tumour cell Ki67 immunohistochemistry) post WOP intervention within post-treatment biopsy compared to pre-treatment baseline biopsy. A patient will be defined as being a Ki67 responder if they experience a relative decrease in Ki67 positive cells of ≥33% in the surgical resection sample.

AND/OR Cohorts B and C co-primary endpoint #2, as described below., Post 2 weeks of trial treatment in the window of opportunity|Cohorts B and C co-primary endpoint #2: Changes in the proliferation gene expression signature post WOP intervention within the post-treatment biopsy compared to pre-treatment baseline biopsy., Changes in the proliferation gene expression signature post WOP intervention within the post-treatment biopsy compared to pre-treatment baseline biopsy. A patient will be defined as being a responder if there is a ≥1.5-fold drop in the proliferation gene expression in the surgical resection sample.

The proliferation gene signature will be based on 11 highly correlated proliferation genes shown in multiple studies including those published by The Cancer Genome Atlas and they also contribute to the calculation of the proliferation score in the publicly available PAM50 classifier. The list consists of: CCNB1, UBE2C, BIRC5, NDC80, CDC20, PTTG1, RRM2, MKI67, TYMS, CEP55, and NUF2.

For each sample, a proliferation gene module score will be calculated according to the expression of the relevant genes.

A patient will be defined as being a responder if they experience an increase in frequency of CD8+ counts by ≥2-fold within the surgical resection sample.

AND/OR Cohort D co-primary endpoint #2, as described below., Post 2 weeks of trial treatment in the window of opportunity|Cohort D co-primary endpoint #2: Changes in the interferon gamma-positive (IFNγ+) signature post WOP intervention within the post-treatment biopsy compared to pre-treatment baseline biopsy., Changes in the interferon gamma-positive (IFNγ+) signature post WOP intervention within the post-treatment biopsy compared to pre-treatment baseline biopsy. A patient will be defined as being a responder if there is a ≥2-fold increase in the IFNγ+ gene expression in the surgical resection sample.The four-gene IFNγ+ score will be calculated, comprising of IFNγ, CD274, LAG3, and CXCL9.
