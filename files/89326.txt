EPIX, a Study to Gather More Information About Characteristics of Patients and Other Factors Which May Contribute to Survival Over a Long Period of Time in Patients With Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Treated With Radium-223 (Xofigo)
In this observational study researchers want to gather more information about the characteristics of patients treated with Radium-223 (Xofigo) who had survived over a long period of time prostate cancer that had spread to other places in the body and keeps growing even when the amount of testosterone in the body is reduced to very low levels (metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, mCRPC). In addition researchers want to identify the factors which may contribute to survival over a long period of time in those patients. Radium-223 (Ra-223) is an alpha particle-emitting radioactive agent approved for the treatment of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
DRUG: Radium-223 dichloride (Xofigo, BAY88-8223)
Overall survival from initiation of Ra-223, Retrospective analysis from Jan 2013 to Dec 2019
Percentage of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) (unit: µg/L) response after Ra-223, PSA response will be defined ≥ 50% reduction in baseline PSA level after initiation of Ra-223, Retrospective analysis from Jan 2013 to Dec 2019
