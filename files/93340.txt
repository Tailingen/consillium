Adjuvant Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Postoperative Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Though hepatectomy is the best treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the 5-years recurrence-free survival is lower than 30%. In recent years, several immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved in advanced HCC. No study about the safety and efficacy of adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with HCC after hepatectomy was reported.

Recurrence-free survivial, Recurrence-free survival is calculated from the date of liver resection to the date of tumor recurrence or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., 12 months
Overall survival, Overall survival is calculated from the date of liver resection to the date of death from any cause or the date of the last follow-up., 12 months
Hepatic resection is the best treatment for patients with early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or selected intermediate or advanced disease. However, the postoperative 5-years recurrent rate is up to 70%, for whom recurrence is a major cause of death. In recent years, several immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved in advanced HCC by official guidelines. At the same time, four randomizead controlled trials about adjvuant immune checkpoint inhibitors for postoperative HCC are ongoing. However, no study about the safety and efficacy of adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors for such patients in clinical practice was reported. Therefore, the investigators plan to investigate the safety and efficacy of adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with high-risk factor of HCC recurrence after curative hepatectomy in a prospective cohort study.
