Taiwan Cancer Moonshot Project
The aim of this study is to establish multiomic big data under strictly collected clinical samples from tumors, adjacent normal tissue, blood, and clinical data then analyze by using integrated proteomics and genetics platform.
Malignant Neoplasm of Body of Stomach in Situ
Collected clinical samples from tumors, adjacent normal tissue, blood, and clinical data, Analyze collected clinical samples by using integrated proteomics and genetics platform (genome, transcriptome, genomic methylation, proteomics, and post-translational modification), Through study completion, an average of 2 to 3 year
Differential expressed genes and proteins in tumor, The relative difference, or fold change of expressed genes and proteins (tumors vs adjacent normal tissue), Through study completion, an average of 4 year
Multiomic integrative analysis is an effective strategy to facilitate the investigation of molecular mechanism, cause, and early intervention of specific diseases. Gastric cancer is specifically chosen for our research target to decrease its incidence and improve survival. To increase precision diagnosis, prognosis and precision therapy, patients from Taiwan are selected as cohort subjects. The aim of this study is to establish multiomic big data under strictly collected clinical samples from tumors, adjacent normal tissue, blood, and clinical data then analyze by using integrated proteomics and genetics platform. Genome, transcriptome, genomic methylation, proteomics, and post-translational modification will be used to construct a map for determine the in-depth carcinogenesis of gastric cancer and strategies for cancer early diagnosis, prevention, and targeted treatments.
