Estimation of Functional Liver Reserve Using Cholinesterases
Estimation of functional liver reserve in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis is of paramount importance to properly select candidates for surgical resection. Together with the value of bilirubin, the presence/absence of ascites and esophageal varices, and the rate of residual liver volume, which are our current parameters to measure functional liver reserve, the investigators sought to investigate the value of preoperative cholinesterases (CHE) in predict postoperative adverse outcome after hepatic resection for HCC.

The primary outcome was to investigate the value of preoperative cholinesterases in predict postoperative adverse outcome after hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis.
