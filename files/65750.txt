A Prognosis and Predicting Genetic Study of Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality among adults worldwide. The incidence rates of lung cancer among never smoking females in some parts of East Asia are among the highest in the world. The adenocarcinoma of lung being the most frequently identified histological type is more weakly associated with smoking, and often occurs in females and never-smokers. Although family history of lung cancer has been associated with histological subtypes, the inherited susceptibility factors that affect specific histology are unknown.

Genetic factors that determine individual predisposition to lung cancer have been identified via genome-wide association studies. These known common loci, however, explain only a small fraction of the familial risk of lung cancer. The hypothesis of this study is that there are genetic factors that confer inherited susceptibility among patients with primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Genetic information of lung cancer patients, Collect study subjects' blood sample and analysis with Genome-wide SNP genotyping, One week after the study subjects sign the permit of informed consents
To delineate the genetic etiology underlying NSCLC, this study proposes to employ a family-based linkage analysis, together with rich data generated from NGS, to search for disease susceptibility locus for the patients with strong family history of primary NSCLC. By using family pedigrees, linkage analysis will be able to find co-segregation of alleles through multiple generations at a genetic susceptibility locus and a known genetic marker, and then the highly penetrate gene loci may be detected by our study. These gene loci will be a good genetic predictor of NSCLC which should be a great advantage in treatment, prevention and screening of NSCLC in the future.
