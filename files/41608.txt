ISIS 104838, an Inhibitor of Tumor Necrosis Factor, for Active Rheumatoid Arthritis
ISIS 104838 is an antisense oligonucleotide drug that reduces the production of a specific protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), a substance that contributes to joint pain and swelling in rheumatoid arthritis. ISIS 104838 works by blocking TNF-alpha messenger RNA, the "instruction" molecule that is required for the production of TNF-alpha protein. This trial will assess the safety and efficacy of ISIS 1048383 by subcutaneous injection, administered by 3 different dosing regimens for 3 months, versus placebo. Approximately 160 TNF-alpha inhibitor-naïve rheumatoid arthritis patients will be evaluated at 32 sites in the U.S. and Canada.
