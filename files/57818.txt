Neoantigen DNA Vaccine in Pancreatic Cancer Patients Following Surgical Resection and Adjuvant Chemotherapy
This is a phase 1 open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a neoantigen DNA vaccine strategy in pancreatic cancer patients following surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. The neoantigen DNA vaccines will incorporate prioritized neoantigens and personalized mesothelin epitopes and will be administered with an electroporation device. The hypothesis of this study is that neoantigen DNA vaccines will be safe and capable of generating measurable neoantigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.

Safety of Neoantigen DNA Vaccine as Measured by the Number of Subjects Experiencing Each Type of Treatment-related Adverse Event, * Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0
* Related indicates possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study treatment, Through week 24
Immunogenicity of the Neoantigen DNA Vaccine as Measured by ELISPOT Analysis, Immunogenicity is defined as the number of participants with a neoantigen-specific immune response measured by ELISPOT analysis. A participant is considered a responder if there is a significant increase in the number of neoantigen-specific T cells to at least one neoantigen after vaccination. A significant increase is based on t-test comparing the number of neoantigen-specific T-cells before and after vaccination with p=0.05 for significance., Through week 77|Immunogenicity of the Neoantigen DNA Vaccine as Measured by Multiparametric Flow Cytometry, Through week 77
-Subjects will be enrolled within 12 weeks of surgery and standard of care adjuvant chemotherapy will last approximately 12 weeks with an additional 12 weeks of standard of care adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemoradiation. The first vaccine may be administered following confirmation of disease-free status and within 60 days following date of repeat imaging. From time of enrollment to first vaccine could be up to 45 weeks.
