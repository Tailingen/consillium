A Dose Escalation Study Evaluating the Safety and Tolerability of GDC-0032 in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and in Combination With Endocrine Therapy in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I/II study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032. The Phase I portion will be divided into two stages. During Stage 1, GDC-0032 will be administered every day orally and at escalating doses in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. During Stage 2, GDC-0032 will be administered alone or as combination therapy within indication-specific cohorts. In Phase II of the study, the efficacy and safety of the combination GDC-0032 and fulvestrant will be evaluated in post-menopausal female participants with locally advanced or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
