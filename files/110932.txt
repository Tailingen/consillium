Sintilimab to Prevent High-risk Oral Premalignant Lesions Cancerization
This is a non-randomized, phase II, open-label study. The goal of this clinical research study is to investigate how well sintilimab works in preventing high-risk oral premalignant lesions cancerization.
Oral Cavity Cancer|Mouth Neoplasm|Precancerous Conditions
DRUG: Sintilimab
oral cancer incidence rate, The proportion of patients who has been diagnosed with oral cavity cancer, 2 years
clinical response rate of oral premalignant lesions, The proportion of patients whose oral premalignant lesions experienced a Complete Response or a Partial Response, 2 years|pathologically response rate of oral premalignant lesions, The proportion of patients whose oral premalignant lesions experienced a locally complete response or decrease of histopathological grade, 2 years|Duration of Response (DoR) of oral premalignant lesions, the time from the date for first documented response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until the date for the first documented response of progressive disease (PD), incidence of oral cancer or death in the absence of progression., 2 years|2 year oral-cancer-free survival, time from randomization to the development of histologically confirmed oral cancer or death of any cause, whichever occurs first, 2 years|Treatment-related Adverse Events (AEs), The grade of AEs and the number of patients with AEs are assessed by the investigator based on CTCAE v4.0 from the date of randomization to 90 days after last dose of study treatment, From the date of randomization to 90 days after last dose of study treatment|Overall survival (OS), OS (per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by the investigator) is defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death due to any cause., 2 year|quality of life(QOL), EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaires, 2 years
this study is a non-randomized, phase II, open-label study. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug or combination of drugs to learn whether it works in preventing or treating a disease.

the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of sintilimab in preventing the onset of oral cancer in patients with high-risk oral premalignant lesions, who had oral cancer at least once before.
