A Study of BBI503 in Adult Patients With Advanced Urologic Malignancies
This is an open label, multi-center, Phase II study of BBI503 administered to adult patients with selected advanced urologic malignancies. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the disease control rate of patients with renal cell cancer and urothelial carcinoma treated with BBI503.
Urologic Malignancies|Renal Cell Carcinoma|Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: BBI503
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 1.1., 8 weeks
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response and partial response (CR + PR) based on RECIST 1.1., 8 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from enrollment to the first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause., 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from enrollment to death due to any cause., 24 months|Number of Patients with Adverse Events, All patients who have received at least one dose of BBI608 will be included in the safety analysis. The incidence of adverse events will be summarized by type of adverse event and severity., 24 months|Pharmacodynamics (biomarkers) of BBI503 when tumor biopsy is possible, baseline, 4 weeks
