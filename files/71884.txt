Evaluation of a Powered Surgical Stapler in Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Lung Resection Procedures in Korea
Collection of real world outcomes of Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) for lung cancer (lobectomy, wedge resection) using ECHELON FLEX™ Powered ENDOPATH® Staplers 45 mm and/or 60 mm (study devices) in a Korean population.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
DEVICE: Endocutter
Occurrence of Prolonged Air Leaks, Prolonged air leaks defined as longer than 5 days in continuous duration. Air leak was to be quantitatively assessed starting on the evening after surgery and then twice daily (during morning and evening rounds). Patients were instructed to perform standardized repeated forced expiratory maneuvers (coughing and blowing)., Post-operative period through hospital discharge and follow-up at Day 30
Occurrence of Postoperative Air Leaks, Air leak was to be quantitatively assessed starting on the evening after surgery and then twice daily (during morning and evening rounds). Patients were instructed to perform standardized repeated forced expiratory maneuvers (coughing and blowing)., Post-operative period through hospital discharge and follow-up at Day 30|Length of Stay (LOS), Determined as the length of time in days from hospital admission to initial hospital discharge, Post-operative period through hospital discharge and follow-up at Day 30|Volume of Estimated Intra-operative Blood Loss, Blood loss intra-op and up to 5 days post-op|Time to Chest Tube Removal, Defined as the number of days from date of surgery to removal of the last chest tube inserted during the surgical procedure., Post-operative period through hospital discharge and follow-up at Day 30
This clinical trial assessed the use of a powered stapler for transection in VATS lung resection, where there is currently limited published clinical data. The primary study endpoint was occurrence and duration of air leak / prolonged air leak (PAL). Procedure details and perioperative outcomes associated with VATS lung resections were also evaluated.
