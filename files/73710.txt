PD-L1 Expression in Lung Cancer
This study will measure PD-L1 expression in metastatic NSCLC (primary tumour and metastatic lesions) using \[99mTc\]-NM-01 SPECT/CT and compare to PD-L1 percentage expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: [99mTc]-NM01 SPECT/CT
PD-L1 Expression Assessment using [99mTc]-NM-01 SPECT/CT, To measure PD-L1 expression in NSCLC (primary tumour and metastatic lesions) as assessed using \[99mTc\]-NM-01 SPECT/CT and compare to PD-L1 expression determined by IHC., Day 0
Safety of [99mTc]-NM-01 SPECT/CT assessed through incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions, To assess the safety of \[99mTc\]-NM-01 SPECT/CT scan by observing for Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) occurring during the trial., Up to 12 days post-injection|PD-L1 expression heterogeneity as assessed by [99mTc]-NM-01 SPECT/CT tumour to blood-pool ratios in each lesion, To measure intra-tumoural heterogeneity in the primary tumour, as well as in individual metastases and inter-tumoural heterogeneity between different disease sites (including different metastatic sites and between primary tumour and its metastases)., Day 0
Exploratory Objectives, To correlate the SPECT/CT PD-L1 assessment with other diagnostic parameters such as blood tumour mutation burden test and to detect the presence of anti-drug antibodies to \[99mTc\]-NM-01., Up to 16 weeks post-injection
A non-blinded, single centre, single interventional arm Phase II diagnostic imaging study.
