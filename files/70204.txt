Flu Vaccine Responses in the Setting of Melanoma Treatment
Influenza vaccination is indicated for all adults, but the immunogenicity of vaccination has not been assessed in all situations. We are conducting a prospective unblinded study of influenza vaccine recipients.
Viral Vaccines
BIOLOGICAL: Inactivated influenza vaccine
Neutralizing antibody response, The neutralizing antibody titer will be assessed by measurement of the hemagglutinin-inhibition titer before and after influenza vaccination in order to determine the seroconversion rate. The late blood draw may occur between days 21-42 following vaccination., 21-42 days
Influenza vaccination is indicated for all adults, but the immunogenicity of vaccination has not been assessed in all situations. In particular, immune responses following influenza vaccination have not been studied in the setting of advanced melanoma and in the context of various anti-tumor treatments. In this study, we will look at the immune response of subjects receiving vaccination.
