Inhibition of Che-1/AATF as a New Tool in Multiple Myeloma Treatment
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a haematological malignancy characterized by the accumulation of proliferating antibody producing plasma cells in the bone marrow. In the last few years many studies have emphasized the biological complexity and heterogeneity of MM as a result of both genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Che-1/AATF (Che-1) is a transcriptional cofactor involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, DNA damage and stress response. it can be hypothesized that Che-1 might contribute to the establishment of the MM malignant phenotype by sustaining global transcription through its ability to modulate chromatin accessibility.

The prospective study on MM human samples aims to understand the involvement of Che-1 in the transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling during the pathology. To this goal the main objectives are:

* Characterization of Che-1's role in chromatin remodeling and global gene expression
* Study in vivo and in vitro of Che-1 involvement in MM tumorigenesis
* Evaluation of Che-1 as a possible therapeutic target
