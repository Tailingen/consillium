Study of Ipilimumab After Stem Cell Transplantation in People With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This study will test the safety of ipilimumab to see what effects, if any, the drug has when used as maintenance therapy for people with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHCT). The investigators also want to find out whether giving ipilimumab after chemotherapy and AHCT is a better way to control the multiple myeloma than chemotherapy and AHCT alone.
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Ipilimumab
Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose of Ipilimumab, A maximum of 12 patients will be accrued and DLTs will be assessed in these patients. If any DLT is observed in more than one of the six patient cohort, a lower dose of ipilimumab will be evaluated in a new six patient cohort., 1 year|Phase II: Progression Free Survival (PFS), criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group, 2 years
