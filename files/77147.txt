Study of Immune Response Modifier in the Treatment of Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of 852A when used to treat certain hematologic malignancies not responding to standard treatment.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Multiple Myeloma|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: 852A
Number of Patients With 852A Response Using Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Stable disease in Non-Hogkin's Lymphoma = disease that does not satisfy complete (complete regression), partial (\> or = 50% reduction) or progressive disease (increase of 25%) by at least a 4-week period. Since Acute Myelogenous Leukemia is not a solid tumor, Complete Response (CR) = \<5% blasts with hematopoietic recovery (absolute neutrophil count \>500) at 4 weeks., Up to Week 12
Number of Patients Who Received Steroids, Number of patients who received steroids allowing successful continuation of therapy., Up to Week 12|Measure of Immune Activation With Correlative Laboratory Studies, Up to Week 12|Peak Concentrations of 852A, Measurement of peak concentrations of 852A to correlate the side effects of tolerability in patients., Up to Week 12
852A will be administered as a subcutaneous injection (SC) 2 times per week for 12 weeks (24 doses) with provisions for dose escalation or reduction based on tolerability
