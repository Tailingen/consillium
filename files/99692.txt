Avoiding Surgery in Rectal Cancer After Pre-Operative Therapy
The objective of Timing and Deferral of Rectal Surgery Following a Continued Response to Pre-operative CRT study is to establish the time to maximum tumour response following CRT, and to investigate whether surgery can be safely avoided within the tight framework of the trial follow-up protocol in a small group of patients where the cancer becomes undetectable by imaging modalities.

The study uses MRI in combination with FDG-PET CT and clinical examination (tri-modality assessment) to assess for a continued incremental response to CRT. Surgery is NOT withheld from patients entering this study. Indeed, surgery is an option at each stage of patient follow-up and is a crucial component of a patient's treatment pathway should no further regression of disease be detected through stringent follow-up. If a status of 'no detectable disease' by serial MRI, CT-PET and clinical assessment is achieved and the patient wishes not to have surgery, they will continue to be carefully monitored within the framework of the trial follow-up protocol.
