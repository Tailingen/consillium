Tomotherapy for Leptomeningeal Metastases
This clinical trial was designed to investigate the efficiency and toxicity of tomotherapy for leptomeningeal metastases.
Leptomeningeal Metastasis
RADIATION: tomotherapy
overall survival, the time from radiation to death, up to 2 years
local control, the time from radiation to leptomeningeal lesion recurrence, up to 1 year|intracranial progress free survival, the time from radiation to leptomeningeal lesion recurrence and/or new brain metastases, up to 1 year|progress free survival rate, the time from radiation to any progression, up to 1 year|adverse event, acute and late toxicities, up to 2 years
This is a single-arm, single center, phase II trial to investigate the feasibility and toxicity of tomotherapy for leptomeningeal metastases, which are defined as leptomeningeal metastases with or without brain metatstases.
