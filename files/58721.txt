Prospective Trial to Compare the Clinical Efficiency of G-EYE™ HD Colonoscopy With Standard HD Colonoscopy
The purpose of this study is to compare the adenoma detection rate of G-EYE™ high definition colonoscopy with that of standard high definition colonoscopy
Adenoma|Polyps|Colorectal Cancer
DEVICE: G-EYE™ colonoscopy|DEVICE: Standard Colonoscopy
Detection Rate of Adenomas and Serrated Lesions, The percentage of patients with at least one adenoma or serrated lesion in the G-EYE™ group will be compared to the Standard group, Approximalty following 14 days (histology results)
Number of Polyp and Adenoma Detection, Procedure Times and Safety (Number of Patients With Adverse Events., The secondary outcome is a composite-each of the measured parameters will be reported as a single value for each arm, Up to 14 days (histology results)
This is a multicenter, two-arm, randomized, open-label study intended to compare the detection rate obtained by performing G-EYE™ high definition colonoscopy vs. the detection rate obtained by performing high definition standard colonoscopy.

The study will enroll 1000 subjects. Consecutive adult subjects who were referred for elective colonoscopy will be asked to enroll into this randomized clinical study if the candidate meets the study inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Subjects will sign informed consent form and undergo randomization. The study includes a run-in preliminary phase of 270 patients to allow physicians to get familiar with the G-EYE™ endoscope.
