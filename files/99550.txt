MRI in Multiple Myeloma: Analysis of the Axial Skeleton Versus Whole Body. What is the Required Analysis?
The investigators wish to determine which anatomic regions need to be explored in order to correctly diagnose myeloma: whether axial skeletal MRI alone is sufficient or whether it is necessary to perform a total skeletal MRI.
Myeloma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MRI
Identification of focal lesions ≥ 5mm by axial skeletal MRI of spine and pelvis versus whole-body MRI using diffusion sequences, Fatty tissue replacement by tumoral tissue observed by hyposignal T1 and hypersignal T2 FS or short-TI Inversion Recovery ≥ 5mm, Day 0
Number of "punched out" lesions ≥ 5mm identified by whole-body MRI with diffusion sequences versus skeletal X-ray, Day 0|Agreement between identification of normal lesions ≥ 5mm by axial skeletal MRI of spine and pelvis versus whole-body MRI using diffusion sequences, Day 0|Agreement between identification of diffuse lesions ≥ 5mm by axial skeletal MRI of spine and pelvis versus whole-body MRI using diffusion sequences, Day 0|Agreement between identification of mixed lesions ≥ 5mm by axial skeletal MRI of spine and pelvis versus whole-body MRI using diffusion sequences, Day 0|Agreement between identification of salt and pepper lesions ≥ 5mm by axial skeletal MRI of spine and pelvis versus whole-body MRI using diffusion sequences, Day 0|Link between type of infiltration and spinal cord karyotype, Yes/no presence of anomaly, and if yes, type of karyotype anomaly, Day 0|Inter-observer reproducibility for the first 20 patients for the detection of focal lesions ≥ 5mm by axial skeletal MRI of spine and pelvis, Day 0
