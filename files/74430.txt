A Study of Selinexor in Combination With Temozolomide and Anti-PD-1 Antibody in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
This study is a prospective, single-arm, open label, Phase Ib/II clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of selinexor in combination with temozolomide and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody in patients with relapsed/refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma(PCNSL). Phase Ib used a "3+3" dose-climbing design to confirm the safety, maximum-tolerated dose (MTD,if any) and recommended phaseII dose (RP2D) of selinexor in combination with fixed dose of temozolomide and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for 6 cycles. Phase II was a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy and safety. Subjects who achieved complete remission or partial remission were treated with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody maintenance therapy until disease progression or recurrence, intolerance of toxicity, death, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of notification (whatever happened first).
Relapsed/Refractory Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
DRUG: Selinexor|DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody
Recommended phase 2 dose, To determine the recommended phase 2 dose for Selinexor., Up to 21days|Objective response rate (ORR) for Phase II study, The objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR at the end of induction treatment., 18 weeks
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years after enrollment|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death., Up to 2 years after enrollment|Duration of response, The duration of overall response is measured from the time achieving ORR to time of progression, relapse or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 2 years after enrollment
ctDNA mutation and mean ctDNA concentration in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, Types of ctDNA mutations and frequency are measured by next generation sequencing. The mean ctDNA concentration is the concentration of ctDNA expressed as mean tumor molecules /ml at specific time points., Up to 2 years after enrollment|The levels of cytokine concentration in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, The levels of cytokine will be analyzed by ELISA in all patients recruited at Baseline and specific time point. The cytokine profile includes IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-4, Up to 2 years after enrollment
