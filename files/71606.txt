Single-arm Study With Bimiralisib in Patients With HNSCC Harboring NOTCH1 Loss of Function Mutations
Preclinical data and limited clinical evidence suggest that Head and Neck Squameous Cell Carcinoma tumors harboring certain mutations may respond well to PI3K/mTOR inhibition (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/ mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition).

The current study enrolls patients with refractory and / or metastatic Head and Neck Squameous Cell Carcinoma based on the mutational status of their disease to assess the response to treatment with bimiralisib, an orally available pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/ mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor).
HNSCC
DRUG: Bimiralisib
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Radiological tumor assessments were performed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to a standard protocol.

ORR: comprised of all patients who achieved a confirmed partial or a confirmed complete response per RECIST 1.1, At 6 and 12 weeks after the start of therapy (Â± 3 days)
