COVID-19 and Childhood Cancer
The investigators will first examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on childhood cancer patients in Sweden and Denmark, both regarding susceptibility to severe COVID-19 among long-term childhood cancer survivors, and, for those diagnosed with childhood cancer during the pandemic, whether the path through primary care to cancer diagnosis as well as short-term survival has changed. Second, the investigators will study childhood cancer incidence before, during and after the pandemic with the particular aim to test the hypothesis regarding an infectious disease etiology for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Severe COVID-19, Defined as:

* death with COVID-19 listed as a cause of death
* hospitalization, or admission to intensive care unit, because of COVID-19 (main diagnosis) or respiratory problems (main diagnosis) AND COVID-19 as secondary diagnosis, Up to 3 years|Childhood cancer survival, Overall survival after a childhood cancer diagnosis, After three and twelve months after the cancer diagnosis and three years after cancer diagnosis|Number of contacts before childhood cancer diagnosis, Number of healthcare contacts (including primary care) the year before the cancer diagnosis, One year before cancer diagnosis|Childhood cancer incidence, Age standardized incidence rates for childhood cancer and cancer subtypes (particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia) in Sweden and Denmark during and after the pandemic and compare it to the 5 years preceding the pandemic, From 2015
