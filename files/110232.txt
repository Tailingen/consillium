Zimberelimab (AB122) With TIGIT Inhibitor Domvanalimab (AB154) in PD-1 Relapsed/Refractory Melanoma
The main goal of this study is to establish the proportion of patients with objective response to zimberelimab/domvanalimab in PD-1 R/R melanoma patients.
Melanoma
DRUG: Zimberelimab|DRUG: Domvanalimab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR), per RECIST v1.1. Complete Response (CR) is defined as disappearance of all target lesions; disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial Response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD., Up to 3 years
Objective Response Rate (ORR) (iRECIST), The proportion of patients with Complete Response (irCR) + Partial Response (irPR), per immune RECIST (iRECIST). irCR:Disappearance of non-nodal lesions. All pathologic lymphnodes \<10 mm (2 consecutive measures ≥4 weeks apart); irPR:≥30% decrease from baseline (2 consecutive measures ≥4 weeks apart) All pathologic lymph nodes \<10 mm (Non-Target Lesions: Any other than disappearance of all non-nodal lesions and reduction of pathologic lymph nodes \<10mm). Baseline tumor burden: sum of single diameters (short axis for nodal lesions, longest diameter for other lesions) for target lesions. In subsequent scans, the diameters of new measurable lesions are added to the tumor burden. Re-treatment:≤5 target lesions (=/≠ original lesions) are selected and a new baseline tumor burden will be established., Up to 3 years|6-month Progression-free Survival (PFS), The proportion of patients who remain progression-free from the initial date of treatment until 6 months afterwards, with progression defined by RECIST v 1.1.Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, Up to 6 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is the time measured from the initial date of treatment to thedate of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression),whichever occurs first, with progression defined by RECIST v 1.1. Progressive disease(PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions,taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or theappearance of one or more new lesions; appearance of one or more new lesionsand/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Up to 5 years|Overall Survival (OS), The median length of time (estimated) from the start of treatment that patients remain alive, until death from any cause., Up to 5 years|1-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), The proportion of patients who remain progression-free from the initial date of treatment until 1 year afterwards, with progression defined by RECIST v 1.1.Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Up to 1 year|2-year Progression-free Survival (PFS), The proportion of patients who remain progression-free from the initial date of treatment until 2 years afterwards, with progression defined by RECIST v 1.1.Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Up to 2 years|1-year Overall Survival (OS), The proportion of patients that remain alive from the start of treatment until death from any cause at one year., Up to 1 year|2-year Overall Survival (OS), The proportion of patients that remain alive from the start of treatment until death from any cause at two years., Up to 2 years
This is a single-arm two-stage phase II study of PD-1 inhibitor zimberelimab (AB122) in combination with TIGIT inhibitor domvanalimab (AB154) in advanced melanoma patients who have failed PD-1 inhibitor therapy.

Patients will undergo a 28-day screening evaluation consisting of systemic staging scans, tumor biopsy, and blood studies to confirm suitability. Once enrolled, patients will receive zimberelimab 360 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) and domvanalimab 15 mg/kg Q3W. Patients will undergo restaging scans at W9 following 3 cycles of therapy with response assessed using RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST. Following restaging scans, patients with response will continue to receive zimberelimab and domvanalimab till disease progression, intolerable toxicity or for up to 24 months.
