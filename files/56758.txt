Isatuximab Single Agent Study in Japanese Relapsed AND Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients
Primary Objectives:

* Phase I: To evaluate safety and tolerability of isatuximab in Japanese participants with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.
* Phase II: To evaluate efficacy of isatuximab at recommended dose and to further evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) of isatuximab in Japanese participants with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety including immunogenicity of isatuximab. The severity, frequency and incidence of all adverse events were assessed.
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of isatuximab in the proposed dosing schedule.
* To assess the efficacy using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response criteria.
* To assess the relationship between Baseline cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) receptor density on multiple myeloma cells and efficacy.
