Prevalence-based Health and Economic Model of the Bivalent Versus the Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine
This study compares the health and economic impact of the bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV-1) and the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV-2).
Human Papillomavirus Infection
OTHER: Prevalence-based model
Annual number of lesions prevented by each vaccine, Over a one-year period|Lesion related total cost averted by each vaccine, Over a one-year period|Additional costs averted by HPV-1 vaccine compared to HPV-2 vaccine, Over a one-year period
This study uses a prevalence-based model (by using efficacy data from each vaccine's respective trials and published cost data for Taiwan) which estimates the differences in lesions, genital warts, cervical cancer and costs from a healthcare payer's perspective prevented between HPV-1 and HPV-2 vaccines during one year (when all women are vaccinated). It also analyses costs from a societal perspective.
