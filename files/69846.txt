Fractionated Docetaxel and Radium 223 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The objective of this study is to determine the maximum safe dose of Ra-223 in combination with fractionated (split doses) docetaxel when given to subjects and to determine the best administering dose. The study will look at side effects that may happen while taking the combination treatment. A total of approximately 18 subjects will take part in the dose escalation part of the study and an additional 25 subjects will participate in the expansion cohort. This study will be conducted across four centers in the United States.
Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel|RADIATION: Radium 223
Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT), DLT is defined as a subject in any cohort experiencing any of the following adverse events during cycle 1 of treatment, until cycle 2 day 1 of treatment: Thrombocytopenia (platelets \< 75 x 10\^9/L on C1D15 or \< 100 x 10\^9/L on C2D1), Neutropenia (ANC \< 1000 K/mL on C1D15 or ANC \< 1500 K/mL on C2D1), Grade 3 (by CTCAE v4) fatigue lasting ≥ 7 days, other non-hematologic toxicity ≥ grade 3, lasting ≥ 48 hours at least possibly related to treatment, or any toxicity (non-hematologic or hematologic) at least possibly related to treatment requiring dose reduction or dose interruption., Up to 29 Days
Efficacy, assessed as non-progression/progression rate according to prostate cancer working group (PCWG2) criteria, Time to progression of disease, calculated as a time-to-event endpoint, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 25 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the interval from first dose date of study drug to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression (assessed per PCWG2) or death from any cause, Up to 25 years|Time to Treatment Failure (TTTF), A measurement from the date of randomization to the first event which meets the criteria for disease progression (assessed per PCWG2 criteria) or death from any cause, Up to 25 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the interval from first dose date of study drug to death from any cause., Up to 25 years|Proportion of Randomized Subjects to Complete Combination Therapy on Schedule per Protocol, The number of subjects who were able to receive both lead-in doses of docetaxel and all 6 cycles of combination docetaxel and Ra223 on time (+/- 7 days)., Up to 28 weeks|Response to treatment, as assessed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) Kinetics and Objective Responses, Measurable disease calculated at each time point in which the data is collected. We will use mixed effect models to explore the temporal trajectories for the outcome changes over time in response to the treatment., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 25 years|Satisfaction, as assessed by Quality of Life Questionnaires, Measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) Questionnaires, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 25 years|Response to Treatment, as assessed by Bone Bio-marker Outcomes, Measurement of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and urine N-telopeptides (laboratory testing), Up to 28 weeks
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and toxicity of a fractionated docetaxel schedule in combination with standard Ra-223.

Secondary Objectives include: assessment of progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, overall survival, ability of subjects to complete 6 cycles of the combination therapy, assessment of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) kinetics and objective responses (measurable disease), assessment of quality of life and assessment of bone bio-marker outcomes.

The study features a 4-week lead-in period with docetaxel monotherapy to assess for docetaxel intolerance. The lead-in period is then followed by combination therapy with Ra-223 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles in a traditional Phase I dose-escalation design.

A provision has been made to include prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) cohorts after the lead-in period if neutropenia is the dose limiting toxicity at either dose level.

The investigators hypothesize that the fractionated dosing of docetaxel will significantly mitigate the hematologic toxicity, preserve antineoplastic activity and allow for maintenance of the 4-weekly Ra-223 schedule.
