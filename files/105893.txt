Clinical Study of C402-CD19-CAR Treatment in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Lymphoma
This study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of C402-CD19-CAR treatment in subjects with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma and further determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of C402-CD19-CAR.

MTD (maximum tolerated dose) of C402-CD19-CAR, To evaluate the DLT (dose limiting toxicities), attributed to C402-CD19-CAR per cohort and determine the RP2D (recommended phase 2 dose)., 28 days following injection|AE (Adverse Event), AESI (Adverse Event of Special Interest), SAE (Severe Adverse Event), The incidence, severity and duration of AE, AESI and SAE as determined by NCI-CTCAE v5.0, up to 2 years post injection
ORR (Objective Response Rate), ORR and best overall response (BOR) of subjects with PR (partial response) and CR (complete response) as determined by local investigator using Lugano 2014, up to 2 years post injection|DOR (Duration of response), The duration of time from record of response to first progression of disease or death as determined by Lugano 2014, up to 2 years post injection|PFS (Progression free survival), The duration of time from treatment to first progression of disease as determined by Lugano 2014, up to 2 years post injection|DCR (Disease control rate), The proportion of subjects with CR (complete response), PR (partial response) or SD (stable disease lasting over 6 months) to total number of patients treated as determined by local investigator using Lugano 2014, up to 2 years post injection|OS (Overall Survival), The time from the start of treatment to the occurrence of death due to any cause, up to 15 years post injection|PK (Pharmacokinetics): AUCinf, Calculate AUCinf: area under the blood concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity, up to 2 years post injection|PK: AUC(0-t), calculate AUC(0-t): the AUC from time 0 to the last measurable concentration that represents the observed exposure to a drug, up to 2 years post injection|PK: AUC0-28d, calculate AUC0-28d: the area under the concentration-time curve from day 0 to day 28, up to 2 years post injection|PK: AUC0-90d, Calculate AUC0-90d: the area under the concentration-time curve from day 0 to day 90, up to 2 years post injection|PK: Cmax, Calculate Cmax: the highest concentration of the drug in the blood, up to 2 years post injection|PK: half-life, Calculate half-life: the time it takes for the amount of the drug's active substance in your body to reduce by half, up to 2 years post injection|PK: Tmax, Calculate Tmax: the time it takes for the drug to reach the maximum concentration after administration of a drug that needs to be absorbed, up to 2 years post injection|PK: MRT, Calculate MRT (Mean Residence Time): the average time a molecule spends in a system before being removed), up to 2 years post injection|Concentration of cytokines, Test serum concentration of IL-2、IL-4、IL-6、IL-10、IFN-γ、TNF-α before and post C402-CD19-CAR treatment, up to 2 years post injection|Concentration of Anti-Drug Antibody, Test antibodies that form in response to the administration of C402-CD19-CAR, up to 2 years post injection
Correlation between PK, cytokine concentration and efficacy, Calculate the correlation between PK data, cytokine concentration with efficacy parameters (PFS, OS, ORR, DCR, DOR), up to 2 years post injection|B cell count, Test B cell count and the subsets percentage in blood before and post C402-CD19-CAR treatment, up to 2 years post injection|RCL (replication-competent lentivirus) test, Test VSVG copies/μg gDNA in blood after treatment, up to 15 years post injection
This is a single-arm, open-label, phase 1 clinical study of C402-CD19-CAR cell therapy, to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy of C402-CD19-CAR in subject with relapsed or refractory large B cell lymphoma.

Subjects that meet inclusion criteria with positive CD19 (IHC ≥50% tumor cells or FACS ≥70% tumor cells) will receive C402-CD19-CAR treatment according to the modified 2+3+3 dose escalation design.
