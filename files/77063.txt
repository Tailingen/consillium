Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with the highest morbidity and mortality in the world. Small cell lung cancer accounts for about 15-20% of all lung cancer. Although the initial treatment is sensitive to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, patients with small cell lung cancer are prone to recurrence and metastasis in the early stage, and ultimately lead to death due to the lack of effective treatment after the disease progresses. Patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer had a poor prognosis; untreated patients had only two to three months of expected survival.Therefore, it is urgent to find a method to treat SCLC.

Two single-arm phase II clinical studies on small cell lung cancer have evaluated the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab combined with first-line chemotherapy for extensive SCLC. Two phase II single arm studies showed good efficacy and safety. Apatinib and bevacizumab are both antiangiogenic agents. S-1 is a new oral fluoropyrimidine anticancer agent, but S-1 has shown a high remission rate for metastatic NSCLC and relapsed NSCLC.

In view of the good efficacy and tolerability of oral chemotherapeutic agent S-1, and the lack of suitable targeted drugs after NGS treatment in relapsed S LCL patients after previous multithreaded treatment, this clinical trial is to study the efficacy and safety of combination of anti-angiogenesis drugs and S-1 in patients with failed or dangerous SCLC after second-line or more radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
