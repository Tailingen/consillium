Open label, nonrandomized, dose escalation study of MVT-5873/MVT-1075 to evaluate safety, dosimetry, determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), and define the pharmacokinetics of MVT-1075. The population consisted of subjects with CA19-9 positive malignancies (i.e., predominately pancreatic adenocarcinoma) who may benefit from a CA19-9-based radioimmunotherapy.

The study utilized a 3+3 study design to identify the MTD. The RP2D was planned to be no higher than the MTD. An expansion group was planned to receive MVT-5873/MVT-1075 at the RP2D in order to obtain initial estimates of response and additional information on safety.
