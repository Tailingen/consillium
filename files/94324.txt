ivWatch in Prevention of Extravasation of Vesicants in an Oncology Setting
This study aims to determine the feasibility of using the ivWatch (registered trademark) device to determine if there is an infiltration at the site of a peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheter. An infiltration is when the IV fluid leaks out of a vein and into the surrounding tissue. If medication starts leaking outside the vein, it can cause damage to the surrounding tissue. Using the ivWatch device may identify leaking fluid before the nurse is able to visually observe the signs or symptoms of the leaking fluid.
Oncology|Extravasation
DEVICE: ivWatch
Ratio of number of ivWatch devices used for vesicant therapy, the ratio of number of the device used for vesicant therapy over the total number of vesicant therapies for study participants, Up to 1 year
Change in number of extravasations while wearing ivWatch, Summary of patient level data will be reported, Up to 1 year
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Evaluate the feasibility of using the ivWatch device to detect extravasations of peripheral vesicants given in an adult oncology ambulatory population.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Evaluate the clinical outcomes of extravasations that occur with the use of the ivWatch device.
