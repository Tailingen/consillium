p53 Synthetic Long Peptides Vaccine With Cyclophosphamide for Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of cyclophosphamide to the treatment with the p53-SLP vaccine improves clinical efficacy and immunogenicity of the p53-SLP vaccine in ovarian cancer patients.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: P53-SLP vaccine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Clinical responses to the p53 synthetic long peptide vaccine preceded by cyclophosphamide will be assessed by measurement of serum CA-125 levels and CT-scan., day 105 - 126 after first gift of cyclophosphamide|Immunogenicity will be evaluated by assessing induction and frequency of p53-specific T cells by proliferation and IFN-Î³ ELISPOT., after fourth immunization
Safety of the vaccine preceded by cyclophosphamide will be assessed by monitoring the incidence and severity of adverse events using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0., durante study
