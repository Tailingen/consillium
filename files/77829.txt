Genetic Predictors to Acupuncture Response for Arthralgia Induced by Aromatase Inhibitors in Patients With Breast Cancer
Purpose:Acupuncture for arthralgia induced by aromatase inhibitors in patients with breast cancer associated with screening of SNPs.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Acupuncture group
Changes in arthralgia scores were measured by the BPI, Changes in arthralgia scores were measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) before and after acupuncture treatment., 52 weeks
Changes in arthralgia scores were measured by the WOMAC scales, Changes in arthralgia scores were measured by the McMasters College Osteoarthritis Index Score (WOMAC) scales before and after acupuncture treatment., 52 weeks
Aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia (AIA) is the most common side effect of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) used in breast cancer , may cause poor adherence to AIs. Studies have shown that acupuncture has a certain therapeutic effect on AIA in breast cancer. In this study, acupuncture was used to relieve the symptoms of arthralgia in patients, and the efficacy of acupuncture was observed by using relevant scales. Currently, studies have shown that AIA in breast cancer patients is related to some biological factors.

At the same time, we collected peripheral blood samples of patients, combined with the reported relevant literature, screened out the single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNP) related to AIA and to guide acupuncture treatment of aromatase Inhibitors induced arthralgia, balance the toxicity of endocrine therapy, and improve compliance and effectiveness.
