Study of Autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Patients With Solid Tumors
A prospective, open-label, multi-cohort, non-randomized, multicenter Phase 2 study evaluating adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with TIL \[LN-144/LN-145 (lifileucel)\] in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors or TIL \[LN-144/LN-145 (lifileucel) and LN-145-S1\] as a single agent therapy.

BIOLOGICAL: Lifileucel|BIOLOGICAL: LN-145|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|BIOLOGICAL: LN-145-S1|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Nivolumab-relatlimab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Nab-Paclitaxel|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Objective Response Rate, To evaluate the efficacy of autologous TIL in combination with ICIs in metastatic melanoma, HNSCC, and NSCLC patients and as a single therapy in metastatic melanoma and NSCLC patients as determined by objective response rate (ORR) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by Investigator, Up to 60 months|Safety Profile Measured by Grade ≥3 TEAEs, To characterize the safety profile of autologous TIL in combination with ICIs in metastatic melanoma, HNSCC, and NSCLC patients and as a single therapy in metastatic melanoma and NSCLC patients as measured by the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Up to 60 months|To evaluate the feasibility of producing lifileucel using tumor samples obtained before (Cohort 3D) or during (Cohort 3E) frontline platinum doublet chemotherapy and pembrolizumab in patients with Stage IV NSCLC, Feasibility is measured by the percentage of patients for whom lifileucel is successfully manufactured and meets release specification and defined as the number of patients with lifileucel product that meets specification divided by the total number of patients who had tumor resection., Up to 60 months
Complete Response Rate, To evaluate efficacy parameters such Complete Response (CR) rate per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator, Up to 60 months|Duration of Response, To evaluate efficacy parameters such Duration of Response (DOR) per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator, Up to 60 months|Disease Control Rate, To evaluate efficacy parameters such Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator, Up to 60 months|Progression-Free Survival, To evaluate efficacy parameters such Progression-Free Survival (PFS) per RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator, Up to 60 months|Overall Survival, To evaluate efficacy parameters such Overall Survival (OS), Up to 60 months
TIL \[LN-144/LN-145 (lifileucel) and LN-145-S1\] is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced, recurrent, or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The adoptive cell transfer therapy used in this study involves patients receiving a nonmyeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of aldesleukin. Patients in Cohorts 1A, 1D, 2A, 3A, 3C, 3D, and 3E will receive TIL plus immune checkpoint inhibitors. Patients in Cohorts 1B, 1C, and 3B will receive autologous TIL as a single therapy.
