Functional Training for the Prevention of Deep Venous Thrombosis
This study aims to analyze the post-operative functional training on the prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the patients who have accepted major surgeries for the gynecological malignancies. The functional training consists of: (1) active and passive ankle pump motions including flexion and extension, circumduction; (2) abdominal breathing training. The primary end is the incidence of DVT happened 30 days from surgery. The secondary ends include the patients satisfaction about functional training.
