TJ202 Combined With Dexamethasone in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This trial is a multi-center, single-arm phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TJ202 combined with dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who received at least 2 prior lines of treatment.

A total of 82 subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least 2 prior lines of treatment will be enrolled in this study. Prior lines of treatment must include a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulator (IMiD). All subjects will receive TJ202 and dexamethasone (DEX) in the study. The treatment will continue until endpoint events such as intolerance or progressive disease (PD).
