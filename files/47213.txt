MS Detection of Somatic Mutations in Hematological Malignancies
Detection of somatic mutations in hematological malignancies is now routinely assessed by NGS sequencing. This powerful approach is nevertheless time consuming and its costs represent limitation for its availability. An original approach is now available, using mass spectrometry (MS). In this study the analytical performance of both methods will be compared, using samples that were previously analyzed by NGS.

The goal of the study is to assess whether MS can represent or not a faster and cheaper way to detect key point mutations in patients suffering from hematological malignancies
