A Study of Efficacy and Safety of Glofitamab in Combination With Salvage Therapy in a Real-world Setting in Chinese Adult Patients With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety in the real-world settings of glofitamab in combination with salvage therapy among Chinese adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma.
