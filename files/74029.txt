WTX212A Monotherapy and in Combination With PD -1/PD-L1 Monoclonal Antibody
This trial is a single-center, open-label designed investigator-initiated clinical study (IIT) to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of WTX212A injection WTX212A injection combined with PD -1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in patients with advanced lung cancer
Advanced Lung Cancer
DRUG: WTX212A injection|DRUG: PD -1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody
To evaluate the efficacy of WTX212A injection combined with PD -1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in the treatment of patients with IO- resistant advanced lung cancer., Overall Response Rate (ORR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1, 1 year
