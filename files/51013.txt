RR is the standard heart rate which calculated by 60 divided by heart rate., Baseline C1D1through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM302|Change in Electrocardiogram (ECG)-QT interval, QT interval of 12-lead ECG will be performed in the supine position after the patients are fully rested at each timepoint for once., Baseline C1D1through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM302|Change in Electrocardiogram (ECG)-QRS duration, QRS duration of 12-lead ECG will be performed in the supine position after the patients are fully rested at each timepoint for once., Baseline C1D1through approximately 1 year after first administration of LM302
Area under the serum concentration versus time curve within one dosing interval (AUCtau), Blood samples will be collected at time points of 0 h, immediately after infusion stop, as well as at 1 h,4 h, 8 h, 24 h, 48 h (Day 3), 168 h (Day 8), and 336 h (Day 15) after infusion stop in cycle 1 and cycle 4; 0 h in cycle 2, cycle 3 and cycle 5; pre-dose (0 h) will be collected in every other cycle for the subsequent cycles. i.e., in cycle 6, cycle 8, ... etc.; at EOT/early withdraw from the study (if the EOT/early withdraw occur when PK blood sampling isn't stipulated). The timepoints of PK sample may be adjusted base on the human PK data. The blood samples for PK analysis will be collected as much as possible if the subjects end of treatment/early withdraw., Up to 1 year|Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM302, Up to 1 year|Maximum serum concentration (Cmax), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM302, Up to 1 year|Minimum serum concentration（Cmin）, To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM302, Up to 1 year|Time to reach maximum serum concentration (Tmax), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM302, Up to 1 year|Clearance (CL), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM302, Up to 1 year|Terminal half-life (T1/2), To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM302, Up to 1 year|Dose proportionality, To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of LM302, Up to 1 year|Objective response rate of LM-302., Preliminary anti-tumor activity of LM-302 according to RECIST v1.1 assessed by investigator: objective response rate (ORR, complete response(CR)+ partial response(PR)), Up to 1 year|Duration of response of LM-302., Preliminary anti-tumor activity of LM-302 according to RECIST v1.1 assessed by investigator: Duration of response (DOR), Up to 1 year|Disease control rate of LM-302., Preliminary anti-tumor activity of LM-302 according to RECIST v1.1 assessed by investigator: disease control rate (DCR, CR+PR+SD), Up to 1 year|Progression-free survival of LM-302., Preliminary anti-tumor activity of LM-302 according to RECIST v1.1 assessed by investigator:progression-free survival (PFS), Up to 1 year|To assess the immunogenicity of LM-302;, Blood samples collected for Anti-Drug Antibody(ADA) assessment will be performed at 0 h of Day 1 (within 30 min prior to infusion) in cycle 1 to Cycle 5; 0 h of Day 1 in every other cycle (within 30 min prior to infusion) for the subsequent cycles, i.e., in cycle 6, cycle 8, ... etc., the EOT/early withdraw from the study and safety follow-up. Nab will be detected if necessary., Up to 1 year
