Evaluation of Blood TMB for the Efficacy of Atezolizumab [BUDDY]
This is single arm, prospective, multi-center, cohort study to evaluate blood TMB for improved efficacy of atezolizumab in locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC at the study enrollment who failed one or more prior lines of chemotherapy including at least 1 platinum-based.
Lung Neoplasm Malignant
DRUG: Atezolizumab Injection [Tecentriq]
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR between blood TMB-High vs. Low group, At the end of cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS in Intention-to-treat (ITT) population and subgroups according to blood TMB and programmed cell death-1 (PDL1) status, At the end of cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)|Safety profile, Incidence of Treatment-related Adverse Events as assessed by CTCAE version 4, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Atezolizumab is approved as the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) and the treatment is available on the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea. Patients will be treated with atezolizumab until loss of clinical benefit or unmanageable toxicity as routine practice.

In this study, the investigators will register patients who have a plan to be treated with atezolizumab as MFDS approval condition and meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The investigators will collect study related information during routine practice and collect blood and/or tissue(optional) samples to conduct the study.

Tumor assessment will be performed by investigator on the base of RECIST (version 1.1) and related information will be collected until disease progression for patients who have discontinued treatment. However, it will be collected until treatment discontinuation for patients who continue to receive atezolizumab following initial disease progression.
