A Study of Anlotinib and AK105 Injection in Subjects With Gastrointestinal Tumors, Urinary System Tumors, Neuroendocrine Tumors
AK105 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specially binds to PD-1. Anlotinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Based on the mechanism study, tumor vascular abnormalities promote tissue hypoxia and increase lactic acid, thereby activating immunosuppression and inhibiting T cell function. Anti-angiogenic drugs enhance the infiltration of effector immune cells by inducing normalization of blood vessels and reducing immunosuppression.
Gastrointestinal Tumors, Urinary System Tumors, Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: AK105|DRUG: Anlotinib
Overall response rate (ORR), Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., up to 96 weeks
Disease control rate（DCR）, Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD)., up to 96 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR defined as time from earliest date of disease response to earliest date of disease progression based on radiographic assessment., up to 96 weeks|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from randomization until the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause., up to 96 weeks|Overall survival (OS), OS defined as the time from the first dose to death from any cause. Subjects who do not die at the end of the extended follow-up period, or were lost to follow-up during the study, were censored at the last date they were known to be alive., up to 120 weeks
