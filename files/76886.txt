Biomarkers in Phototherapy of Barrett's Esophagus
This study is being done to find out if Photodynamic Therapy (treatment with a red light and a drug called photofrin) or Radiofrequency ablation works the same for patients who have biomarkers (abnormalities in molecules of cells that may or may not help predict cancer) present in their Barrett's esophagus as for patients who do not have biomarkers.
Barrett's Esophagus|High Grade Dysplasia
PROCEDURE: Photodynamic therapy|PROCEDURE: radiofrequency ablation of barrett's esophagus
The primary assessment for our first specific aim will be to determine the effect of photodynamic therapy on biomarkers after photodynamic therapy., 12 months
The primary assessment for our second specific aim will be to assess if specific biomarkers can be correlated with the confirmed histological elimination of their Barrett's esophagus., 12 months
