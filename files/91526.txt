Brentuximab Vedotin Plus Lenalidomide and Rituximab for the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory DLBCL
Participants in this study will have diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that has come back or not gotten better with treatment. The trial will study whether brentuximab vedotin plus two drugs works better to treat this type of cancer than the two drugs alone.

Participants will be randomly assigned to get either brentuximab vedotin or placebo. The placebo will look like brentuximab vedotin, but has no medicine in it. Since the study is "blinded," participants and their doctors will not know whether a participant gets brentuximab vedotin or placebo. All participants in the study will get rituximab and lenalidomide. These are drugs that can be used to treat DLBCL.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Brentuximab vedotin|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Lenalidomide|OTHER: Placebo
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, Approximately 2 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Assessment of PD will be performed by the investigator based on the Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2014), Approximately 1 year|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of participants with best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to investigator assessment per the Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2014)., Approximately 1 year|Complete response (CR) rate, Proportion of participants with best response of CR according to investigator assessment per the Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2014), Approximately 1 year|Duration of response (DOR), Time from start of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of tumor progression by investigator assessment per the Lugano Criteria for Response Assessment (Cheson 2014) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately 1 year|Incidence of adverse events, Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigational participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment., Approximately 1 year|OS in CD30+ participants, Time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause., Approximately 2 years
