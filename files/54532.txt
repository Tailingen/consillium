Ph II Trial of Carboplatin and Pemetrexed With or Without AZD1775 for Untreated Lung Cancer
The aim of this study is to combine AZD1775 with standard front-line chemotherapy in subjects with advanced NSCLC.
Previously Untreated Stage IV Non-Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: AZD1775|DRUG: AZD1775 Matching Placebo|DRUG: pemetrexed|DRUG: carboplatin
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival is defined as the time from randomisation until the date of objective disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the subject withdraws from randomised therapy or receives another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression., 6 months
Assess the Objective Response Rates in Each Arm, The objective response rate is defined as the number of the subjects with a confirmed best overall response of CR or PR divided by the number of subjects in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) for whom measureable disease is present at baseline, Up to a maximum of 4 treatment cycles (treatment cycles will be repeated every 21 days)|Assess the Disease Control Rate in Each Treatment Arm, the disease control rate is defined as the percentage of FAS subjects with a best overall response of CR, PR or SD)., Up to a maximum of 4 treatment cycles (treatment cycles will be repeated every 21 days)|Assess the Duration of Response in Each Treatment Arm, Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or any cause death., Up to a maximum of 4 treatment cycles (treatment cycles will be repeated every 21 days)|Assess Overall Survival in Each Treatment Arm, Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause., Up to a maximum of 4 treatment cycles (treatment cycles will be repeated every 21 days)
This is a randomised, phase II trial comparing AZD1775 plus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by maintenance AZD1775 and pemetrexed versus pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by maintenance pemetrexed in patients with previously untreated metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with TP53 mutations. The primary endpoint of the trial is assessment of progression-free survival (PFS).
