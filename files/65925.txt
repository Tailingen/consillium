Bladder Sparing Treatment of Tislelizumab, Gemcitabine and Cisplatin for Patients With PD-L1 Positive Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
This is a phase II open label single-arm prospective study aiming to investigate the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitor Tislelizumab combined with conventional gemcitabine and cisplatin as bladder sparing treatment for patients with PD-L1 positive muscle invasive bladder carcinoma (T2-3N0M0).
Urothelial Carcinoma Bladder|PD-1 Inhibitor
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin
Two-year bladder-intact disease-free survival rate, Bladder-intact disease-free survival is defined as time from initiation of protocol therapy until the development of muscle-invasive bladder cancer recurrence, regional pelvic recurrence, distant metastases, bladder cancer-related death, or cystectomy., 2 years
Adverse Events, The adverse events are evaluated per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5., 2 years|Overall survival, Defined as time to death from beginning of protocol therapy, up to 5 years|Metastasis-free survival, Defined as time to the development of radiographic distant metastases from beginning of protocol therapy., up to 5 years|Disease-free survival, Defined as time to recurrence, metastasis or death from beginning of protocol therapy., up to 5 years|Disease specific survival, Defined as time to death because of bladder cancer from beginning of protocol therapy, up to 5 years
The study will enroll 20 patients with adequate organ function and performance status who either wish to attempt bladder preserving therapy or are ineligible for radical cystectomy. The bladder samples must be available and assessed as positive for PD-L1 expression . Patients will receive transurethral resection or partial cystectomy to remove all visible tumors with no residual disease left. After the surgery, patients will receive 8 cycles of tislelizumab combined with 4-6 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin.
