Study Evaluating Inotuzumab Ozogamicin In Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia
The Phase 1 portion of this study will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy at increasing dose levels of inotuzumab ozogamicin in subjects with CD22-positive relapsed or refractory adult acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in order to select the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule. The Phase 2 portion of the study will evaluate the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin as measured by hematologic remission rate (CR + CRi) in patients in second or later salvage status.
