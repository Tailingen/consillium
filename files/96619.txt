Study of Nivolumab Alone or in Combination With Ipilimumab as Immunotherapy vs Standard Follow-up in Surgical Resectable HNSCC After Adjuvant Therapy
Multicenter randomized controlled phase III study of nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab as immunotherapy vs standard follow-up in surgical resectable HNSCC after adjuvant therapy
Head and Neck Cancer
PROCEDURE: Surgical resection of primary tumor|RADIATION: Adjuvant radio(-chemo)therapy|DRUG: Neoadjuvant Nivolumab|DRUG: Adjuvant Nivolumab|DRUG: Adjuvant Nivolumab and Ipilimumab
Disease Free Survival, disease free survival (DFS) at 3 years of nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab as adjuvant immunotherapy after adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy in locally advanced resected HNSCC, approximately 71 months
Local regional control (LRC), Disease assessment (CT/ MRI) and Panendoscopy and FFPE in case of suspicion or recurrence, Time from randomization to date of first observed histologically proven or death, up to 36 month|Distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), Disease assessment (CT/ MRI), Time from randomization to date of first observed histologically proven or death, up to 36 month|Overall survival (OS), Follow Up- Visits after end of treatment every 3 months until month 36 after randomization, afterwards every 6 months, until end of study (36 months after end of therapy of the last patient), approximately 71 months|Acute toxicity and late morbidity, Adverse Events Assessment, AEs/SAEs should be collected continuously until 12 months after randomization|Quality of life (QoL): QLQ-C30, Questionaire EORTC QLQ-C30, through study completion, an average of 3 years|Quality of life (QoL): Questionnaire H&N43, Questionnaire H\&N43, through study completion, an average of 3 years|Comparison of nivolumab alone group vs control and nivolumab & ipilimumab group vs control in terms of DFS, We compare disease free survival, defined as time from randomization to date of first observed either histologically proven recurrence (local, locoregional or distant), or death from any cause whatever occurs first, of arm Ia to arm II and of arm Ib to arm II, assessed up to 36 month|Survival depending on PD-L1 Status, Assessment of PD-L1 Status, after surgery, up to 4 weeks after surgery
Surgically treated locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma often requires postoperative chemoradiation with high risk of acute and late toxicity. DFS after 2 years is approximately 70%. Combining anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 as a maintenance therapy may improve DFS due to anti-tumor effects of immunotherapy by enhancing cross-presentation of tumor antigens.
