Durvalumab in Different Combinations With Pralatrexate, Romidepsin and Oral 5-Azacitidine for Lymphoma
This is an open-label, Phase 1/2a, dose-finding study with an initial phase 1 portion, articulated in four separate treatment arms, followed by a dedicated phase 2 for qualifying treatment Arm(s).

The primary objective of the Phase 1 portion is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of the combinations of: Durvalumab, oral 5-azacitidine, and romidepsin (Arm A); durvalumab, pralatrexate, and romidepsin (Arm B); durvalumab and romidepsin (Arm C); or durvalumab and oral 5-azacitidine (Arm D), in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). The safety and toxicity profile of these combinations will be evaluated throughout the entire study.

If one or more of the combinations in Arms A, B, C, or D are found to be feasible and an MTD is established, the phase 2 portion of the study will be initiated for the combination(s) with the strongest efficacy signal provided acceptable toxicity.
Lymphoma, T-Cell
DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Pralatrexate|DRUG: Romidepsin|DRUG: 5-Azacitidine
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The highest dose of study treatment that does not cause unacceptable side effects in patients with R/R PTCL in each study arm, 1 year
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR will be defined as the sum of complete response rate and partial response rate based on evaluation of best response in each patient., 1 year|Duration of Response (DoR), Time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression, 1 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from study treatment until disease progression or death, 1 year
The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a heterogeneous group of aggressive lymphoid neoplasms and account for 10-15% of all newly diagnosed cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The current prevalence of PTCL in the United States is estimated to be approximately 9,500 patient. Treatment options for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) PTCL have been limited. This study focuses on exploring rational combinations of these T-cell active agents in an effort to develop novel treatment platforms.
