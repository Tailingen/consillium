PRaG Regimens Rechallenge for Patients With Resistance to PD1/PD-L1 Inhibitors in Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors.
Finding an effective treatment to rescue with resistance of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor has been an urgent problem.The PRaG trial as a salvage therapy in advanced solid tumors has obtained satisfactory results.We found that patients with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors resistance are more likely to benefit from the PRaG regimens(PD-1 inhibitors combined with radiotherapy and GM-CSF with IL-2). Further phase II clinical trial was conducted to confirm the efficacy and safety of PRaG regimen rechallenge for patients with resistance to PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors in refractory advanced solid tumors.

Patinets with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors resistance have limited treatment.ICIs rechallenge is one of the attractive and challenging selection strategies.The efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor rechallenge remain unclear.PRaG regimens realize the sensitization of the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors, broaden the anti-cancer spectrum of PD-1 immunotherapy, and achieve precise and minimally invasive tumor treatment.PRaG regimens might benefit the survival of patients with resistance to PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors in refractory advanced solid tumors.A phase II clinical study is planned to explore the efficacy and safety of PRaG regimens in advanced refractory solid malignancies after resistance of PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.
