Durvalumab Combined With Chemotherapy and Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) in Patients With Oligometastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
This is a Phase II, multi-center pilot study assessing the efficacy and safety of durvalumab combined with chemotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with oligo-metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
