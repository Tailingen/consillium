A Study of Pemetrexed and Folic Acid Given Before Surgery (Neoadjuvant Treatment) to Patients With Rectal Cancer.
The purpose of this study is to help answer the following research questions:

If the study drug Pemetrexed can help patients with rectal cancer; If molecular biological parameters are correlated respectively changing due to cytotoxic treatment with Pemetrexed; To evaluate adverse events
Rectal Neoplasms
DRUG: pemetrexed
Feasibility of Pemetrexed Prior to Surgery, Feasibility was defined as the ability to receive the total planned dose of Pemetrexed administered over a period of no more than 9 weeks permitting scheduling conflict. A Â±5 percent variance in the calculated total dose was allowed., 3 cycles (21-day cycles)
Pathological Complete Response (pCR), Pathological complete response was defined as the absence of any tumor cells., surgery following 3 cycles (21-day cycles) of chemotherapy|Number of Participants With Complete Tumor Resection, surgery following 3 cycles (21-day cycles) of chemotherapy|Number of Participants Receiving Sphincter Saving Surgery, surgery following 3 cycles (21-day cycles) of chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to help answer the following research questions:

If the study drug Pemetrexed can help patients with rectal cancer; If molecular biological parameters are correlated respectively changing due to cytotoxic treatment with Pemetrexed; To evaluate adverse events
