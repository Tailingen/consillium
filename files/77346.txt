Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Albumin-Stabilized Nanoparticle Formulation in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation together with carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects, the best way to give, and the best dose of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation when given together with carboplatin in treating patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Abraxane|DRUG: Abraxane|DRUG: Abraxane
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Abraxane, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Abraxane weekly days 1, 8, 15 with a carboplatin dose of AUC=6 given on day 1 of a 28 day cycle, 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Abraxane given with Carboplatin, To determine the MTD of Abraxane given every 3 weeks with carboplatin given on day 1 of a 21 day cycle, 21 days|Sequence-dependent toxicity, To determine if there is any correlation to toxicity based on the order Abraxane and carboplatin are adminstered, 28 days
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation given once weekly for 3 weeks when administered with carboplatin given once every 4 weeks.
* Determine the MTD of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation given once every 3 weeks when administered with carboplatin given once every 3 weeks.
* Determine the MTD of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation given in weeks 1 and 2 when administered with carboplatin given once every 3 weeks.
* Evaluate sequence-dependent effects on toxicity and pharmacokinetics in the combination of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin.

Secondary

* Explore the antitumor activity of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation given once weekly or once every 3 weeks.

OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm III: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Patients in arms I and II undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic studies.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.
