Radiomics for prEdiction of lunG cAncer biologY
Therapeutic progress for subgroups of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer can largely be attributed to the accumulation of molecular knowledge and the development of new drugs that specifically target molecular abnormalities. An understanding of the immune landscape of tumors, including immune-evasion strategies, has also led to breakthrough therapeutic advances.These new options require prior treatment tumoral sampling to identify patients who have neoplasms with specific genomic aberrations or favorable immune environment. Medical imaging and radiomic approach may provides surrogate markers non invasively.The objective of the present retrospective study is to build and validate a predictive model of common molecular alterations and PD-L1 expression in NSCLC using pre treatment PET/CT derived radiomics.
