Cardiovascular Assessment of Ponatinib as Third Line Treatment in Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
This study will address the therapeutic activity and the safety/biological profile of Ponatinib when used as third line therapy of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase after the only two TKIs known for their cardiovascular safety, i.e. Imatinib and Bosutinib.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
DRUG: Ponatinib 15mg QD|DRUG: Ponatinib 30mg QD
Exposure adjusted Rate of Arterial Occlusive Events and Serious Arterial Occlusive Events at 1 year after study treatment initiation of each patient, Exposure adjusted Rate of Arterial Occlusive Events (AOE) and Serious AOE (SOE) at 1 year after study treatment initiation of each patient, 1 year
Phase 2, single-arm, multicentre, open label study which aims to investigate the therapeutic activity and the cardiovascular safety profile of Ponatinib when used as third line therapy of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase, after using the only two Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) known for the safest cardiovascular profile, i.e. Imatinib and Bosutinib. Patients will be stratified according to the cause of discontinuation of the second TKI: intolerance or resistance. The safety of Ponatinib will be assessed by a combination of clinical tests such as ECG, Doppler ultrasound studies to assess arterial and venous vessels, blood pressure monitoring and lipid profiles, combined with inflammatory cytokine analysis which is a known predictor of subsequent cardiovascular adverse events.
