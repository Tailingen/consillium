A Prospective Observational Study to Evaluate the Quality of Life and the Costs in a Real Life Setting in Patients Who Are Treated With 90Y-Zevalin
The objective of this study is to compare hematological toxicity, costs, health-related quality of Life (HR-QOL) and outcomes observed in real life in the Belgian Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) population receiving 90Y-Zevalin, with model-predicted data at reimbursement on the basis of a clinical trial in heavily pre-treated NHL.
