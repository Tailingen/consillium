A Study of SGN-B6A in Chinese Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This trial will look at a drug called sigvotatug vedotin (SGN-B6A) to find out whether it is safe for Chinese participants who have solid tumors. It will study sigvotatug vedotin to find out what its side effects are. A side effect is anything the drug does besides treating cancer. It will also study how do Chinese participants' body interact with sigvotatug vedotin.
