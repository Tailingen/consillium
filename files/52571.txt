A Study of Botensilimab and Balstilimab for Rectal Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this study is to find out whether the combination of botensilimab and balstilimab (BOT/BAL) is a safe and effective treatment that causes few or mild side effects for people with mismatch repair proficient (MMRp)/microsatellite stable (MSS) locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. The investigators will also find out whether BOT/BAL is an effective treatment when given in combination with standard chemotherapy.

Best Overall Response Rate, The primary objective of this study is to determine the best overall response rate (ORR) after initial neoadjuvant combination botensilimab and balstilimab in subjects with MMRp/MSS locally advanced (stage II or III) rectal adenocarcinoma. ORR is defined by rectal MRI and endoscopic exam and graded as progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD) (sustained for 3 months), partial response (PR), near complete response (nCR) and clinical complete response (cCR). Patients with PR, nCR, or cCR will be considered responders, while the rest will be non-responders., 1 year
