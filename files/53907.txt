A Safety and Efficacy Trial of JCAR017 Combinations in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies
This is a global, open-label, multi-arm, parallel multi-cohort, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety, tolerability, PK, efficacy and patient-reported quality of life of JCAR017 in combination with various agents. This protocol is intended to evaluate various drug combinations with JCAR017, as separate arms, over the life of the protocol, using the same objectives. Each combination will be evaluated separately (ie, the intention is not to compare between combinations) for the purposes of the objectives, trial design, and statistical analysis. The following combinations will be tested:

Arm A: JCAR017 in combination with durvalumab Arm B: JCAR017 in combination with CC-122 (avadomide) Arm C: JCAR017 in combination with CC-220 (iberdomide) Arm D: JCAR017 in combination with ibrutinib Arm E: JCAR017 in combination with relatlimab and/or nivolumab Arm F: JCAR017 in combination with CC-99282 Additional arms will be added by way of amendment once combination agents have been selected.

The study will consist of 2 parts: dose finding (Phase 1) and dose expansion (Phase 2). Dose expansion may occur in one or more arms.

Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Participants enrolled in Phase 1 are considered evaluable for DLTs if they received an infusion of conforming JCAR017 cell product and at least one dose of the combination agent and completed the specified DLT evaluation period or if they have received an infusion of conforming JCAR017 cell product and at least one dose of the combination agent and experience a DLT during the DLT evaluation period., From first dose of the combination agent until 1 month (28 days) after JCAR017 infusion (pre- JCAR017 cohort) or from JCAR017 infusion until 1 month (28 days) after the first dose of combination agent (post-JCAR017 cohort)|Complete Response Rate (CRR), Percentage of participants achieving a complete response (CR). CR is complete radiologic response (CRR) and complete metabolic response (CMR). CR was measured using CT and PET and assessed for the presence of index and non-index lesions, spleen size, and the absence of new lesions or diseased bone marrow.

To be considered as having CRR participants had to have all of the following:

* Index lesions - longest transverse diameter of nodal lesions â‰¤ 1.5 cm and the absence of extranodal disease.
* Non-index lesions - the absence of non-index lesions.
* Spleen size \<13 cm
* The absence of new lesions
* Normal bone marrow assessment

To be considered as having CMR participants had to have all of the following:

* A score of 1, 2, or 3 with or without residual mass on 5-PS for index and non-index lesions.
* The absence of new lesions
* No evidence of FDG-avid disease in marrow and a normal bone marrow assessment, At 3 and 6 months post-JCAR017 infusion.
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life C30 Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) Scores - Phase 2, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scale, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). The questionnaire is scored on a 4-point Likert response scale: 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 = very much.

The raw score is calculated as the average of the items that contribute to the scale. The final scores are calculated via linear transformation of raw scores and range from 0 to 100.

For functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, cognitive and global health) higher scores indicate better QoL.

For symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting and pain) and single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties) lower scores indicate fewer symptoms, i.e. better QoL., At baseline and 29 days and 57 days post JCAR017 dose|EuroQol- 5 Dimensions of Health Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D VAS) Scores - Phase 2, The EuroQol- 5 Dimensions of Health Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-5D VAS) records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are scored from 0 to 100 i.e., 'The worst health you can imagine' (score of 0) to 'The best health you can imagine' (score of 100).

Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) is also considered an AE. All participants were monitored for AEs during the study.

Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to any study treatment., 57 days after the dose of JCAR017|Change From Baseline in D-Dimer Levels, D-dimer is a substance that is produced in the body when blood clots are broken down. The D-dimer laboratory test measures the level of D-dimer in the blood and is often used to help diagnose or rule out conditions related to blood clotting, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Elevated levels of D-dimer may indicate the presence of a blood clot, but other factors can also cause an increase in D-dimer levels. Therefore, the D-dimer test is typically used in combination with other diagnostic tests to help make an accurate diagnosis. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to any study treatment., 57 days after the dose of JCAR017|Change From Baseline in Fibrinogen Levels, Fibrinogen is a protein that plays a role in a number of processes in the body, including blood clot formation, wound healing, inflammation, and blood vessel growth. Baseline is defined as the last measurement on or prior to any study treatment., 57 days after the dose of JCAR017|Change From Baseline in Prothrombin International Normalized Ratio, The Prothrombin International Normalized Ratio (INR) is used to determine the clotting tendency of blood.

During Phase 1, different arms may be opened to test JCAR017 in combination with combination agent(s) in adult subjects with R/R aggressive B-cell NHL. Within each arm, different doses and schedules of JCAR017 and the combination agent(s) may be tested in several cohorts and subcohorts per arm.
