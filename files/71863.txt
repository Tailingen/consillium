A Phase III Trial Comparing UFT+PSK to UFT+LV in Stage IIB, III Colorectal Cancer
To compare the efficacy of tegafur/uracil (UFT) plus folinate calcium (leucovorin: LV) administered orally and UFT plus Krestin (PSK) administered orally enrolling patients with pTNM stage IIB or III colorectal cancer as subjects in a multicenter collaborative randomized open-label comparative controlled study and consequently to determine the usefulness of the above regimens as adjuvant therapy after surgery.

3-Year recurrence-free survival rate, 3-years after surgery
5-Year survival rate, incidence of adverse events, treatment compliance, QOL, type of metastasis/recurrence, and 3-year and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates and survival rates based on each parameter including colon/rectum, stage, and IAP., 5-years after surgery
To compare the efficacy of tegafur/uracil (UFT) plus folinate calcium (leucovorin: LV) administered orally and UFT plus Krestin (PSK) administered orally enrolling patients with pTNM stage IIB or III (UICC Sixth version) colorectal cancer/histological curability A (Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma, Sixth version) as subjects in a multicenter collaborative randomized open-label comparative controlled study and consequently to determine the usefulness of the above regimens as adjuvant therapy after surgery.
