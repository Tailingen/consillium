IMG-7289 in Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) or Polycythemia Vera (PV)
The purpose of this study is to assess the hematologic effects of IMG-7289 therapy in ET and PV patients who require platelet, White Blood Cell (WBC) or Red Blood Cell (RBC) control, and have failed at least one standard therapy.
Essential Thrombocythemia|Polycythemia Vera
DRUG: IMG-7289
Hematologic Response Rates, As evaluated by the International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) and European Leukemia Net (ELN) response criteria., 24 Weeks
Incidence of Treatment-Related Toxicity, As evaluated by the treating physician using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0., Up to 3 Years|Change in Total Symptom Score (TSS) as Measured by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF), As measured using the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) that includes 14 disease related symptoms each scored from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable)., Baseline, Up to 3 Years|Change in Mutational Allele Burden, Evaluated via Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) molecular profiling from serum blood sample., Baseline, Up to 3 Years|Change in Spleen Size in Centimeters, Measured via physical examination and radiologic imaging measurement., Baseline, Up to 3 Years|Change in Fibrosis Score, Assessed using a slightly modified version of European Consensus Criteria for Grading Myelofibrosis from bone marrow/aspirate sample, as presented in Thiele et al, 2005. Myelofibrosis (MF) scores are graded on a four-point scale, from MF-0 to MF-3, grading the reticulin and collagen content of bone marrow, with MF-0 being the lowest and MF-3 the highest., Baseline, Up to 3 Years
