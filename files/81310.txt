Study of Chemotherapy With Adoptive Cellular Therapy With DC-CIK Cells in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients
To access the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide combined thiotepa and carboplatin chemotherapy combined with adoptive cellular therapy with dendritic and cytokine-induced killer cells in triple negative metastatic breast cancer patients
Breast Neoplasms|Neoplasm Metastasis
progression-free survival, progression-free survivalis measured from the date therapy is initiated to the date of documented disease progression or death, six months to two year
clinical benefit response and overall survival, clinical benefit response include complete release(CR), partial release (PR), stable disease (SD)., six months to two year
1. Metastatic breast cancer patients should be definitively diagnosis based on histopathology, with ER-negative and PR-negative, FISH testing for her-2-negative
2. All the patients enrolled will be given standard cyclophosphamide combined thiotepa and carboplatin chemotherapy and cellular therapy.Cellular therapy consisting of one cycle of chemotherapy followed by an apheresis and ex vivo cultures to generate DC and CIK, followed by low-dose Oral Cyclophosphamide .
3. The response is assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST) guidelines.
4. Estimate time to progression, survival rates and clinical benefit response on patients.
5. Find biomarkers associated with drug response.
