Influenza Vaccination in Patients Receiving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor
The purpose of this study is to elucidate efficacy and safety of influenza vaccine in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor.
Influenza|Solid Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Influenza vaccination
Seroprotection rate, The percentage of vaccine recipients with a serum haemagglutination inhibition(HI) titre â‰¥40 post vaccination (21-28 days), 21 to 35 days after vaccination
Seroconversion rate, Seroconversion rate is defined as the percentage of vaccine recipients with a fourfold increase or more in post-vaccination HI titre, 21 to 35 days after vaccination|Geometric mean titer of HI, Geometric mean titers of HI (haemagglutination inhibition) after vaccination, 21 to 35 days after vaccination|Injection-related adverse events, The proportion of patients who experienced local or systemic adverse events related to vaccination, 21 to 35 days after vaccination|Immune-related adverse events, The proportion of patients who experienced immune checkpoint inhibitor induced immune-related adverse events, 6 months after vaccination|T-cell mediated immune response, The levels of intracellular cytokines measured by flow cytometry, 21 to 35 days after vaccination
* Solid cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor or cytotoxic chemotherapy will be recruited 1:2 manner in two hospitals. Target numbers are 48 and 95, respectively.
* All the participants will be vaccinated for influenza during their chemotherapy when they meet inclusion criteria.
* All the participants will be asked if they have any contraindication for influenza vaccine by a physician before vaccination.
* Hemagglutination inhibition Ab titre at pre-vaccination and post-vaccination (21-35 days after vaccination) will be examined in all participants to examine seroprotection rates, seroconversion rates, and changes in geometric mean titer.
* And they will be monitored for any vaccination-related adverse reaction or immune-related adverse events after 2-4 days(via phone call), and till 6 months after vaccination (when they visit oncology clinics).
