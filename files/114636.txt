This is a retrospective/prospective Analysis of surgical outcomes of robotic prostatectomy.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: robotic radical prostatectomy
Collect and analyze descriptive characteristics of patient population and summarize patient outcome data., up to 20 years
Correlate the patient characteristics to the surgical outcomes., up to 20 years|Determine the overall survival, up to 20 years|Determine the rate of local recurrence in patients undergoing robotic prostatectomy and compare these metrics to historical controls., up to 20 years|disease- free survival, up to 20 years
This retrospective / prospective study will allow us to collect and analyze the presurgical, peri-operative, and outcome data of patients who undergo robotic radical prostatectomy at The Arthur G.
