Molecular Predictors of Cancer in Patients at High Risk of Lung Cancer
RATIONALE: Using samples of blood, urine, sputum, and lung tissue from patients at high risk of cancer for laboratory studies may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research study is looking at molecular predictors of cancer in patients at high risk of lung cancer.
Lung Cancer
GENETIC: comparative genomic hybridization|GENETIC: gene expression microarray analysis|GENETIC: proteomic profiling analysis|OTHER: biologic sample preservation procedure|PROCEDURE: nasal brushing|PROCEDURE: Blood draw|PROCEDURE: Urine collection|PROCEDURE: sputum sample|PROCEDURE: fluorescence bronchoscopy with airway biopsy|PROCEDURE: fine needle aspiration of the lung|PROCEDURE: thoracentesis
To quantitate the molecular changes during lung cancer development, As a part of the study nasal brushing specimens, sputum, blood, urine, and a small amount of other tissue will be collected during standard of care procedures (bronchial epithelial, trans-thoracic fine needle aspiration (FNA) and thoracentesis as part of patient work up.

Clinical diagnosis is the primary goal of the procedure. All the research specimens are collected after the primary goal of the procedure is met., After collection of designated samples
Develop a method to diagnose and stage pre-invasive and invasive lesions, Use of proteomic techniques in the laboratory to find a method of diagnosing lung tissue as benign or malignant rather than relying on invasive open-chest surgery for a diagnosis, After collection of designated samples
OBJECTIVES:

* To use fixed lung tissue for histological evaluation and fresh tissue samples for molecular studies to study DNA, RNA, and protein abnormalities in lung preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions.
* To use proteomic techniques, including matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), to develop a method of diagnosing and staging both pre-invasive and invasive lesions, using less invasive methods.

OUTLINE: Blood, urine, nasal cell, and sputum samples are collected. Lung tissue samples are also collected using fluorescence bronchoscopy and epithelial cell collection.

Samples are studied by genetic and proteomic analyses, including comparative genomic hybridization, expression microarray, and protein profiling.
