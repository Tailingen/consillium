Scores for each sub scale (depression and anxiety) are summed-up and range from 0 to 21. Values from 0-7 indicate normal levels, 8-10 are border values and values from 11-21 are considered to be pathological., Baseline and postoperatively at 30 and 60 days|Changes in functional capacity from baseline, Patients will perform a 6-Minute Walk Test, Baseline and postoperatively at 30 and 60 days|Change in muscle strength, Muscle strength is measured by using an dynamometer, Baseline and postoperatively at 30 and 60 days|Change in body mass, Body mass is measured by using a bioelectrical impedance analysis, Baseline and postoperatively at 30 and 60 days|Hospital stay, Days from surgical procedure to hospital discharge, Up to 30 days
Prospective, interventionist and randomized controlled trial in a 1: 1 ratio, open to the multidisciplinary team but blind to surgeons and anaesthesiologists. The aim is to test the effectiveness of a multimodal prehabilitation protocol in patients with diagnosed or suspicious gynaecological cancer, who will undergo gynaecological surgery.

The multidisciplinary prehabilitation program will be applied to the intervention group. For the group participating in the prehabilitation and for the control group, the protocol and specific recommendations for gynecological cancer defined by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS®) guidelines will be applied.
