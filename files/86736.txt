Tumor-induced Osteomalacia Disease Monitoring Program
The objectives of this observational study are to assess the long-term safety and long-term effectiveness of burosumab in patients with TIO who are being treated with burosumab as prescribed by their physician and to monitor the course of the underlying phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor (PMT) overtime in patients with TIO irrespective of their treatment status.
