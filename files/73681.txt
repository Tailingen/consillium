Comparison Study of Standard Care Against Combination of Growth Factors Agents for Low-risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
REGIME is comparing two treatments, with Darbepoetin Alpha (DA) and Filgrastim (Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor, G-CSF), to the standard treatment for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS).

After giving Informed Consent patients will undergo a number of tests to confirm eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three treatments group: A: Darbepoetin Alpha (DA), B: Darbepoetin Alpha and Filgrastim (DA+G-CSF), C: Blood transfusion only. Patients will be required to attend the clinic once a month for 24 weeks. After 24 weeks if a patient has reacted favorably to the treatment they may continue on the treatment regime up to 52 weeks. After week 24 all patients will be required to attend the clinic twice more, at week 36 and 52.

Patients will be followed for a further 5 years to record loss of response, transformation to Acute Myeloid Leukaemia and/or Refractory Anemia with Excess Blasts and death.
