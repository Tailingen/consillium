Positron Emission Tomograph(PET) Imaging Explores the Role of SF-DEVD-2 in Monitoring Tumor Efficacy
This is a single arm study to determining the value of apoptotic molecular probe SF-DEVD-2 in the early evaluation of tumor efficacy and comparing it head-to-head wihe 18F-FDG(18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose)
Breast Cancer Stage II|Breast Cancer Stage III|Solid Tumor
DRUG: [18F]SF-DEVD-2|DRUG: [18F]-FDG
Evaluation of tissue distribution of [18F]-DEVD-2, Biodistribution of \[18F\] -DEVD-2 evaluated by the maximum standardized uptake valueï¼ˆSUVmax) in various organs during repeated \[18F\]-DEVD scans will be reported., 7 days
