A Study of Tazemetostat in Combination With Various Treatments in Participants With Blood Cancer.
This trial will study how safely the tazemetostat works with other therapies in various hematological malignancies. Hematologic malignancies are cancers that most often begin in the bone marrow or lymph nodes where blood precursors are produced.

They are often called blood cancers and fall into three categories: leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma.

Tazemetostat has been found to be a safe and effective drug that works in patients with follicular lymphoma where the disease has come back after treatment (known as relapsed) and when other treatment no longer works (known as refractory).

Combining tazemetostat with other treatments may work better in treating patients with hematological malignancies and may improve disease response and durability of response.
Relapsed Hematologic Malignancy|Refractory Hematologic Malignancy
DRUG: Tazemetostat|DRUG: Tafasitamab|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Acalabrutinib|DRUG: Daratumumab (Intravenously)|DRUG: Mosunetuzumab|DRUG: Daratumumab (Subcutaneously)|DRUG: Hyaluronidase-Fihj|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone 20mg
Phase 1b: Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of tazemetostat in combination with each partner drug, The safety and tolerability of tazemetostat in combination with each partner drug in participants with R/R malignancies will be evaluated. RP2D of tazemetostat for further evaluation in phase 2 will be selected as assessed by the occurrence of treatment-emergent dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and adverse events (AEs)., Evaluated for DLTs during the first 28-day cycle. The RP2D for Phase 2 for each arm will be selected at the end of that arm's experience in Phase 1b|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), Overall response rate is defined as proportion of participants with a best response of at least partial remission (including partial remission and complete remission for participants with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Arms 1, 2, 3, or 5 or partial remission, complete remission, stringent complete response, or very good partial response)., Time from the date of first dose of study drug to the time of response, assessed up to 24 months.
Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival is defined as the time from randomization into the study to the first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause., Up to 24 months.|Time to response (TTR), Defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the earliest date of CR or PR per Lugano Classification (Arms 1, 2, 3, and 5) or sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR per IMWG 2016 criteria (Arm 4) as assessed by Investigator review., Up to 24 months|Phase 2: Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of response is defined as the time from the initial response (at least partial remission) to documented disease progression., Up to 24 months|Phase 2: Disease control rate (DCR), Defined as the percentage of participants who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease per Lugano Classification (Arms 1, 2, 3, or 5) or stringent complete response (sCR), CR, very good partial response (VGPR), PR, or stable disease per IMWG 2016 criteria (Arm 4) at 6 months on study treatment, as assessed by Investigator review., Up to 24 months|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to date of death due to any cause., Up to 24 months|Time to next treatment (TTNT), Defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the start of subsequent anticancer therapy, Up to 24 months|Percentage of participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAEs), An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention., Up to 24 months|Percentage of participants with clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters, Percentage of participants with clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters including, hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis will be reported. The clinical significance will be evaluated by the investigator., Up to 24 months
This phase 1b/2 trial studies how safely the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat works with other therapies in various hematological malignancies. Tazemetostat has been found to be a safe and effective drug that works in patients with relapsed refractory (R/R) follicular lymphoma. Giving tazemetostat in combination with other treatments may work better in treating patients with hematological malignancies and may improve disease response and durability of response.
