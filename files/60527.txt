CAR T Therapy With GCAR1 for Relapsed Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma
A single patient study to determine whether GCAR1 is safe and effective for re-treatment of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) with GPNMB surface expression that has relapsed and is not responding to usual treatment.
Sarcoma|Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (ASPS)
BIOLOGICAL: GCAR1
Treatment Response, The overall response assessment considers the response of the target and non-target lesions and development of new lesions.

Response Classification of Target Lesions, CNS lesions and Non-Target Lesions

* Complete response (CR):
* Partial response (PR):
* Progressive disease (PD):
* Stable disease (SD):, Diagnostic imaging (CT and/or MRI) will be performed at baseline (pre-treatment) and then subsequently at 4-6 weeks after GCAR1 infusion, and at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year after last infusion to evaluate response to therapy.
CLIC-YYC-GPNMB-04 is an Open Label Individual Patient (OLIP)/Single Patient Study (SPS) developed according to the Health Canada template and guidelines released in 2019 for studies to access therapies not otherwise available to patients, in the situation where there are no options of treatment or cure remaining. The patient under consideration for CLIC-YYC-GPNMB-04 has refractory, progressive metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). There are no standard therapies for relapsed ASPS known to provide potential for cure, and there are no clinical trials available in Canada for consideration. We propose to re-treat the patient with GCAR1, a patient-specific cell therapy product containing a mixture of autologous lymphocytes transduced with a lentiviral vector containing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that enables the specific targeting towards tumor cells expressing the cell surface protein glycoprotein non-metastatic B (GPNMB). The patient was previously treated with GCAR1 under CLIC-YYC-GPNMB-01 (c#276646).
