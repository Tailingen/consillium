Study Evaluating Efficacy and Safety of FFX Versus Combination of CPI-613 With mFFX in Patients With Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
A prospective, multicenter, open label, randomized phase III study to evaluate efficacy and safety of FFX versus CPI-613 + mFFX in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with age range of 18 to 75 years
Pancreatic Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: CPI 613, mFolfirinox|DRUG: Folfirinox
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause, 38 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the duration from the date of randomization to the date of progressive disease or death from any cause.

Progressive Disease is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must have also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression., 38 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Defined as the rate of Complete Response (CR) plus Partial Response (PR): Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions;, 38 months
