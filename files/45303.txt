Construction and Validation of a Diagnostic Model for Predicting Molecular Residual Disease and Recurrence of Cervical Cancer Based on Circulating Tumor HPV
Systematic evaluation of the value of molecular residual lesions of cervical cancer based on circulating tumor HPV in the prognostic evaluation and recurrence monitoring of cervical cancer patients.
Cervical Cancer
The one-year probability of OS, OS (overall survival) is defined as the time which begins at diagnosis and up to the time of death, one year
PFS, progression free survival, 1 month post treatment
Cervical cancer has a very clear etiology, with the vast majority of cases being caused by persistent and repeated infections with high-risk HPV. In the carcinogenic mechanism of cervical cancer, there are large amounts of HR-HPV integrated into the human genome in cancer cells; these HR-HPV can be released into the bloodstream in the form of ctHPV, and most patients with stages I-IV of cervical cancer can have detectable ctHPV in their blood. Among them, the detection rate in the blood of late-stage patients ranges from 63.3% to 100%. Several studies have demonstrated that ctHPV may serve as a marker for monitoring recurrent tumor molecular residual lesions, which could be of significant importance for prognostic evaluation and monitoring whether the disease has recurred. In this study, we will systematically evaluate the value of molecular residual lesions of cervical cancer based on circulating tumor HPV in the prognostic evaluation and recurrence monitoring of cervical cancer patients
