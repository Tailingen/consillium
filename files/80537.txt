Study of Ibrutinib in Subjects With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ibrutinib alone or in combination with either cytarabine or azacitidine in the treatment of subjects with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who have failed standard treatment, or subjects without prior therapy who refuse standard chemotherapy.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: Ibrutinib|DRUG: Ibrutinib + LD-AraC|DRUG: Ibrutinib+Azacitidine
Efficacy of Ibrutinib Monotherapy or in Combination With Either LD-AraC or Azacitidine Using the Overall Remission Rate (Defined as Proportion of Subjects Achieving a CR or CRi) According to the LeukemiaNet Guidelines, Dohner's 2000 Criteria for AML: Complete Response (CR), Bone marrow blasts \< 5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \> 1.0 x 109/L (1000/µL); platelet count \>100 x 109/L (100 000/µL); independence of red cell transfusions; CR with Incomplete Recovery (CRi), All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\< 1.0 x 109/L \[1000/µL\]) or thrombocytopenia (\<100 x 109/L \[100 000/µL\]) ; Morphologic leukemia-free state, Bone marrow blasts \< 5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required; Partial Remission (PR), All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5% to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%; Relapse, Bone marrow blasts \> 5%; or reappearance of blasts in the blood; or development of extramedullary disease., When the last subject enrolled completes approximately 12 months of treatment.|Safety and Tolerability of Ibrutinib Monotherapy or in Combination With Either LD-AraC or Azacitidine, Number of Participants with Adverse Events and number of patients with lab abnormalities.The safety profile of ibrutinib was evaluated based on the incidence of adverse events (AEs) as well as clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and vital signs, and other malignancies. The safety evaluations performed in this study were standard and/or were required based on the safety data available from other clinical and preclinical settings., Up to 30 days following the last dose of study drug.
Relapse-free Survival (RFS), Event-free Survival (EFS) and Overall Survival (OS), To evaluate clinical efficacy by assessing relapse-free survival (RFS), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)., When the last subject enrolled completes approximately 12 months of treatment|Clinical Benefit Rate - as Defined as the Proportion of Subjects Who Achieve CR, CRi, Morphologic Leukemia-free State, or Partial Remission (PR), To evaluate clinical benefit defined as CR, CRi, morphologic leukemia-free state, and partial remission (PR)., When the last subject enrolled completes approximately 12 months of treatment
