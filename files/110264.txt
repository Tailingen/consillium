High-Resolution Anoscopy Perceived Discomfort Study
Study should determine if performing the less uncomfortable part of the exam (the perianal exam) results in less recalled discomfort if performed last vs. if performed first.
Pain|Anal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Perianal Exam|PROCEDURE: high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) with biopsy
High Resolution Anoscopy (HRA) discomfort scale, Visual analogue scale ranging from 1 to 10 with higher score denoting more pain., following the HRA procedure at day one
Performance of the perianal examination at the end of the high resolution anoscopy (HRA) procedure will lead to patients reporting less discomfort directly following the procedure. The study team hypothesizes at least a 10% decrease in subsequently rated pain scores in the group where the perianal exam is performed last compared to the group where it is performed first.
