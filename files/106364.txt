This study has four parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation of BDC-1001 as a single agent to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), or maximum protocol dose (MPD) recommended for Part 3. In Part 3, the selected dose will be administered as monotherapy to patients with selected advanced malignancies. Part 2 is a dose escalation of BDC-1001 in combination with nivolumab to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), or maximum protocol dose (MPD) recommended for Part 4. In Part 4, the selected dose will be administered in combination with nivolumab to patients with selected advanced malignancies.

Bolt amended the protocol to transition any subjects still receiving BDC-1001 to continue receiving BDC-1001 in the Maintenance Phase. Subjects remaining on BDC-1001 will continue to receive BDC-1001 until a criterion for discontinuation has been met.
