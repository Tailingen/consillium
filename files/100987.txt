IDH2-Post-Allo-Trial for Patients with IDH2-mut Myeloid Neoplasms After Allo-SCT
This is a prospective, open label, single arm, multi-centre phase II trial aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Enasidenib (investigational product) as prophylactic consolidation in patients with IDH2-mutated MDS, CMML and AML in remission after allo-SCT.

This is a prospective, open label, single arm, multi-centre phase II trial aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Enasidenib (investigational product) as prophylactic consolidation in patients with IDH2-mutated MDS, CMML and AML in remission after allo-SCT.

Study Design:

* interventional
* prospective, open-label, single arm, multicenter phase-II trial
* total patients sample size: 50 patients
* number of trial sites: 11 all located in Germany and members of the EBMT

Patients with AML, MDS and CMML, in whom an IDH2 mutation has been detected at diagnosis prior allo-SCT, are eligible for consolidation therapy, if they are in complete hematological remission after first allo-SCT. IDH2 mutation might be absent at this time (CRMRDnegative), or might be detectable at submicroscopical levels (CRMRDpositive) given the high sensitivity of detection methods nowadays available. Remission will be evaluated within a screening period between day +25 and day +35. Evaluation of remission will be performed locally with IDH2 mutation analysis performed at an experienced local laboratory of the respective center. The report about IDH2 mutation testing at diagnosis has to be sent to the principle investigator for review at screening to include the patient; a BM sample will be stored for central retesting, which will be performed in batch during the course of the study. Having a documented hematological CR, patients will enter the treatment phase within 30 days after this BM evaluation (latest time point day +65) and start treatment with Enasidenib. They are envisaged to receive Enasidenib (100 mg per day, day 1-28) for up to 12 cycles (=12 months). Patients will go off protocol prematurely in case of relapse, intolerability of study treatment and in case of withdrawal of consent. In those patients who relapse during study treatment subsequent therapy for relapse will be performed according to the choice of the individual treating physician. Patients who finish study as planned or prematurely will be regularly followed for one year, lost to follow up, death or withdrawal of consent.
