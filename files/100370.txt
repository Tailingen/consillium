unacceptable toxicity, "Unacceptable toxicity" is defined as any of the following toxicities: \>1 episode of grade 3/4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia \<75,000/Î¼L (despite prior dose reduction) during chemoradiation any toxicity that results in \>2 week cumulative delay in chemoradiation any toxicity that is attributed to durvalumab which results in a delay of \>8 weeks in surgery, i.e. surgery \>16 weeks from the end of radiation, for a potentially operable patient any reason that is attributed to durvalumab which leads to death within 30 days of surgery, 1 year|pathologic complete response rate, pCR, 1 year|major pahological response, MPR, 1 year
The purpose of this study is to test the the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in combination with chemoradiation before surgery for esophageal cancer.
