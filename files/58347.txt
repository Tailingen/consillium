Study of Elenestinib (BLU-263) in Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (AdvSM) and and Other KIT Altered Hematologic Malignancies
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate elenestinib (BLU-263) in participants with Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (AdvSM), SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN), and other hematologic malignancies. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Determine Recommended Dose of elenestinib (BLU-263) monotherapy for participants with AdvSM
* Safety and tolerability of elenestinib (BLU-263) monotherapy
* Efficacy of elenestinib (BLU-263) monotherapy in participants with AdvSM
* Determine Recommended Dose of elenestinib (BLU-263) in combination with azacitidine in participants with AdvSM
* Safety and tolerability of elenestinib (BLU-263) in combination with azacitidine
* Efficacy of elenestinib (BLU-263) in combination with azacitidine in participants with AdvSM

The estimated study duration for each participant will be approximately 4 years: 2 years of treatment followed by 2 years of follow-up. Participants may be required to attend monthly visits for the first six months, followed by quarterly visits for the remainder of the study.

Systemic mastocytosis includes five major subtypes: Indolent SM (ISM), SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN), aggressive SM (ASM), and MC leukemia (MCL). In 2016, the smoldering subtype of SM, a former provisional ISM subvariant, was designated as a distinct variant of SM by the World Health Organization (WHO). Aggressive SM, SM-AHN, and MCL together are referred to as Advanced SM (AdvSM).
