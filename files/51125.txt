Epidemiological Study to Evaluate the Prevalence of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutation Status in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
To estimate the prevalence of EGFR mutation in a representative sample of patients with newly diagnosed stage IIIB/IV NSCLC in Spain (predominantly Caucasian ethnicity).
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
To estimate the prevalence of EGFR mutation in a representative sample of patients with newly diagnosed stage IIIB/IV NSCLC in Spain (predominantly Caucasian ethnicity).
Correlate EGFR mutation status with clinico-pathological characteristics. The study will aim to determine the prevalence of EGFR M+ lung cancers in patients with clinico-pathological characteristics not commonly associated with EGFR mutation positivity|To describe different EGFR mutation methods used in Spain and testing turn around time associated|To determine the % of confirmed stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients who cannot be tested for EGFR mutation and the reasons for not testing (% of EGFR Mnt)
To estimate the prevalence of EGFR mutation in a representative sample of patients with newly diagnosed stage IIIB/IV NSCLC in Spain (predominantly Caucasian ethnicity).
