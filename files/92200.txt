Prepectoral and Subpectoral Implant-based Breast Reconstruction
Breast cancer is one of the main malignant tumors threatening women's lives. In recent years, the increasing demand for reconstruction of breast cancer patients in China has made the proportion of breast reconstruction increase year by year, while implant reconstruction has become the most important way of breast reconstruction due to its less injury, shorter time of operation and relatively simple surgical technique. In the long-term clinical practice, due to the lack of safe and effective alternative methods, the reconstruction method with prosthesis placed to posterior pectoralis major has been accepted by surgeons and patients, and has become the most commonly used method of prosthesis construction. However, the development of biomaterials provides new ideas for breast reconstruction. At present, more and more doctors in clinical practice discontinue the use of serratus anterior, but use the synthetic mesh (mostly titanium mesh TiLoop速 Bra) or allogeneic acellular dermal matrix mesh to cover part of the dilator or prosthesis so as to shorten the entire operation cycle and make the appearance of the reconstructed breast more natural and aesthetic. In particular, it can improve the contour of the folds under the breast and shape the breasts with a certain degree of sagging.

This study takes the patients receiving immediate reconstruction with an implant combined with TiLoop速 Bra after total mastectomy as the subjects, aiming to compare the aesthetics and safety of the placement of implant to anterior and posterior pectoralis major through a prospective and randomized study. The primary objective of the study is to analyze the aesthetics of breast appearance, patient satisfaction and postoperative quality of life (QOL) of the placement of implant to anterior and posterior pectoralis major. The secondary objective of the study is to analyze the incidence of complications and type of reoperation in both groups.
