Prevent Cancer- Greenville
Prevent Cancer-Greenville was created to provide individuals with the opportunity to have their risk of developing cancer studied. Some individuals may be at a higher risk due to their personal lifestyle, family history and/or exposures. If subjects are found to be at high risk for developing a disease, they will be sent to a healthcare provider for further care.

Participants' personal history, lifestyle behaviors and blood, urine, and cheek swab specimens will be used to detect changes or trends that might put them at risk for developing cancer. Some individuals may be at an above average risk of cancer due to lifestyle, family background, personal genetic makeup, or environmental exposures. This will be determined by a process called risk stratification. Risk stratification involves looking at all health-related aspects of a person, determining their individualized risk through screening, and educating them on measures to reduce potential for disease. Participants will complete a yearly health assessment which includes measurements for nutrition, activity, individual risk factors and body composition, including weight height and a special scale which measures fluid and fat.
