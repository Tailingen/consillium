Study of ASN004 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Participants in this study will receive ASN004 once every 3 or 4 weeks by intravenous infusion. The ASN004 dosing schedule may be modified based on emerging data and Safety Review Committee decision. The study will test various doses of ASN004 to find out the highest safe dose to test in future trials.

Eligible subjects will be sequentially enrolled in cohorts at escalated doses.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: ASN004
Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ASN004, The MTD will be determined by evaluating the number of subjects with treatment related adverse events (AEs) and DLTs., first 21 days for patients administered ASN004 every 3 weeks, and first 28 days for patients administered ASN004 every 4 weeks
Calculate the pharmacokinetic (PK) area under the plasma concentration of ASN004, Calculate the amount of ASN004 in the bloodstream, First 63 days|Calculate the maximum plasma concentration at steady state, Calculate the maximum amount of ASN004 in the bloodstream, First 63 days|Calculate the terminal elimination rate of ASN004, Calculate how fast ASN004 leaves the body, First 63 days|Change in the size of measurable tumor lesions, Change from baseline in the sum of the longest dimension in millimeters or each measurable lesion, up to 1 year|Change in the status of non-measurable tumor lesions, Number of subjects that have resolution on non-measurable tumor lesions, Up to 1 year|Appearance of new tumor lesions, Number of subjects with new lesions, Up to 1 year
Correlate 5T4 oncofetal protein (5T4) expression and clinical efficacy, Number of patients with 5T4 expression that have a complete response, partial response or prolonged stable disease when receiving ASN004., Up to 1 year
Eligible patients will be sequentially enrolled at escalating doses.

Dose escalation decisions will be based on the review of clinical safety and pharmacokinetic (PD) and pharmacodynamics (PD) data and agreed upon by the Sponsor and investigators.

The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will have an estimated DLT rate of \< 33%. Cohorts may be expanded at any dose level or at the MTD for further evaluation of safety, or PK parameters as required.
