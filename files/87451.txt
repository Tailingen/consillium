RTX-224 Monotherapy in Patients With Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multidose, first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1/2 study of RTX-224 for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R), or locally advanced solid tumors.

This is a Phase 1, open label, multicenter, multidose, first-in-human (FIH), dose escalation and expansion to determine the safety and tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose, and pharmacology, and antitumor activity of RTX-224 in adult patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic, unresectable solid tumors. The study will include a monotherapy dose escalation phase followed by an expansion phase.
