High Dose-Rate Brachytherapy and Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Prostate Adenocarcinoma
This phase II trial investigates the effect of high dose-rate brachytherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy in treating patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. Brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy, uses radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue.

Biochemical failure, Will be based on Phoenix criteria (either a rise of 2 ng/mL or more above nadir prostate specific antigen \[PSA\], or patients not meeting this criterion but underwent salvage therapies). The biochemical progression free survival (b-PFS) will be defined from the date of completing radiotherapy to the date biochemical failure, death, or last follow-up, stratified by prostate cancer risk classification. Kaplan-Meier method will be used., Up to 5 years|Patient-reported genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, Will be assessed on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index-26 (EPIC-26) questionnaire., At 90 days
Patient-reported GU symptoms, Will be assessed on EPIC-26. EPIC assesses the disease-specific aspects of prostate cancer and its therapies within the genitourinary summary domain. Response options for each EPIC item formed a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores were transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better Health-Related QoL., At end of radiotherapy, 6, 12, 24, and 60 months|Patient-reported GI symptoms, Will be assessed on EPIC-26. EPIC assesses the disease-specific aspects of prostate cancer and its therapies within the gastrointestinal summary domain.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) at the 5-year time point after combination therapy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and high dose rate (HDR)-brachytherapy (BT) boost stratified by patients with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer.

II. To estimate the rate of acute \>= grade 3 patient-reported genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms determined within 90 days after treatment completion, respectively.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate patient-reported GU symptoms at the end of radiotherapy and within 6, 12, 24, and 60 months from radiotherapy completion.

II. To estimate patient reported GI symptoms at the end of radiotherapy and within 6, 12, 24, and 60 months from radiotherapy completion.

III. To estimate the cumulative incidence of acute grade \>= 2 GU physician-scored toxicity, as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 scale.

IV. To estimate the cumulative incidence of acute grade \>= 2 GI physician-scored toxicity, as assessed by the CTCAE version 5.0 scale.

V. To estimate the cumulative incidence of late \>= 2 GU physician-scored toxicity, as assessed by the CTCAE version 5.0 scale.

VI. To estimate the cumulative incidence of late \>= 2 GI physician-scored toxicity, as assessed by the CTCAE version 5.0 scale.

VII. To determine the prostate specific antigen (PSA) complete response rate (PSA nadir =\< 0.3ng/mL) at 3 months following treatment of combination SBRT and HDR-BT boost regardless of testosterone recovery.

VIII. To determine clinical progression-free survival at 5-years. IX. To determine distant metastasis-free survival at 5-years. X. To determine overall survival at 5-years.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo HDR-BT for up to 24 hours and undergo SBRT every other day or consecutive days for up to 14 consecutive chronologic days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 90 days, every 3 months for 24 months, and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.
