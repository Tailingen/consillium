DESTINY-Endometrial01: A Phase III Study of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Plus Rilvegostomig or Pembrolizumab as First-Line Treatment of HER2-Expressing (IHC 3+/2+), Mismatch Repair Proficient (pMMR) Endometrial Cancer
DESTINY-Endometrial01 will investigate the efficacy of first-line T-DXd + rilvegostomig (Arm A) and/or T-DXd+ pembrolizumab (Arm B) when compared to chemotherapy (carboplatin + paclitaxel) + pembrolizumab (Arm C), by assessment of progression free survival (PFS), as assessed by BICR, in participants with HER2-expressing (IHC 3+/2+), pMMR, primary advanced (Stage III/IV) or recurrent EC.
Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Trastuzumab deruxtecan|DRUG: Rilvegostomig|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Docetaxel
Progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by BICR, Defined as time from randomization until progression per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), or death due to any cause., Until progression or death due to any cause (assessed up to approximately 45 months).
Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Until the date of death due to any cause (assessed up to approximately 70 months).|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator, PFS by investigator has the same attributes as estimand of PFS by BICR except tumor assessment is by the investigator., Until progression or death due to any cause (assessed up to approximately 70 months).|Time from randomization to second progression or death (PFS2), PFS2 will be defined as the time from randomization to the earliest of the progression event (following the initial investigator-assessed progression), after first subsequent therapy, or death., Until the earliest of the progression event (following the initial investigator-assessed progression), after first subsequent therapy, or death (assessed up to approximately 70 months).|Objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by BICR and investigator, ORR as assessed and confirmed by BICR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as determined and confirmed by BICR. ORR as assessed and confirmed by the investigator has the same attributes as estimand of ORR by BICR except tumor assessment per the investigator., Until progression or the starting of subsequent anticancer therapy (assessed up to approximately 45 months).|Duration of response (DoR), as assessed by BICR and investigator, DoR as assessed by BICR will be defined as the time from the date of first documented response of confirmed responders until date of documented progression per RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause.

DoR as assessed by the investigator has the same attributes as estimand of DoR by BICR except tumor assessment per the investigator., Until progression or death due to any cause (assessed up to approximately 45 months).|Safety and tolerability, Safety and tolerability will be evaluated in terms of AEs/serious AEs (SAEs), AESI, vital signs, clinical safety laboratory assessments, ECG and ECHO/MUGA scan results., Safety is assessed until the 90 days (+7) after the last dose (assessed up to approximately 70 months).|Pharmacokinetics of T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody, DXd and rilvegostomig, Serum concentration of T-DXd, total anti-HER2 antibody, DXd and rilvegostomig., Up to safety follow-up period (assessed up to approximately 45 months).|Immunogenicity of T- DXd and rilvegostomig, Presence of ADAs for T-DXd or rilvegostomig., Up to safety follow-up period (assessed up to approximately 45 months).|Patient-reported tolerability, Patient-reported tolerability will be described among participants, as treated, using the following outcomes:

* Symptomatic AEs: Descriptive summary of the proportion of participants reporting symptomatic AEs while on treatment, as assessed by items from the EORTC Item Library and the FACT/GOG-NTX-4
* Overall side-effect bother: Descriptive summary of the proportion of participants reporting overall side-effect bother on the PGI-TT while on treatment, Up to progression as assessed by BICR (assessed up to approximately 45 months).|Progression-free survival (PFS) according to MMR status to determine the clinical utility of a MMR diagnostic test, PFS is defined as time from randomization until progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by BICR, or death due to any cause., Through completion of study, assessed up to approximately 70 months.|Overall survival (OS) according to MMR status to determine the clinical utility of a MMR diagnostic test, OS defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Through completion of study, assessed up to approximately 70 months.|Progression-free survival (PFS) according to HER2 expression to determine the clinical utility of a HER2 diagnostic test, PFS is defined as time from randomization until progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by BICR, or death due to any cause., Through completion of study, assessed up to approximately 70 months.|Overall survival (OS) according to HER2 expression to determine the clinical utility of a HER2 diagnostic test, OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Through completion of study, assessed up to approximately 70 months.
