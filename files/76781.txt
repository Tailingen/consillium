Single-Port Transvesical Partial Prostatectomy Versus High Intensity Focused Ultrasound
This study aims to compare the novel single-port robotic partial prostatectomy to High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients with low to intermediate risk localized prostate cancer. These interventions have become acceptable focal therapies prevalent with beneficial oncologic outcomes and therefore need to be examined further.
Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: Transvesical Single Port Robotic Partial Prostatectomy|PROCEDURE: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
Recurrence free survival Recurrence free survival, Number of patients with absence of clinically significant prostate cancer on prostate MRI and targeted prostate biopsy, 1 year after treatment|Recurrence free survival, Number of patients with absence of clinically significant prostate cancer on prostate MRI and targeted prostate biopsy, 2 years after treatment|Recurrence free survival, Number of patients with absence of clinically significant prostate cancer on prostate MRI and targeted prostate biopsy, 3 years after treatment
Operative time, Minutes from incision to closing during surgery (median), At initial treatment (postoperative day 0)|Postoperative Complications, Clavien-dindo classification number (1-5), number (percent), Within 3 months after treatment.|Analgesic requirment, Units of oral morphine equivalent dosing (mg), median, Once at first follow up (up to 7 days after initial treatment)|Postoperative hospital stay, Time that patient is observed in the hospital after surgery, in hours (median), Up to 1 day after initial treatment|Foley catheter duration, Time at which the foley catheter is removed after treatment, in days (median), Up to 7 days after initial treatment|Time to urinary continence, Time at which the patient becomes continent in days (median), Assessed at each visit for up to 1 year after treatment|Urinary continence, Continence defined as using 1 pad for security or less for stress urinary incontince, recorded as yes or no (percent), Assessed at each visit for up to 1 year after treatment|Erectile dysfunction, Assessed using scores from a validated survey (IIEF-5). Recorded as the the score from 5 (impotent) to 25 (no impotence), median., Assessed at each visit for up to 3 years|Biochemical recurrence, PSA recurrence defined as PSA nadir after treatment +1ng/ml within 12 months or PSA Nadir + 1.5ng/ml from 12-36 months. Recorded as yes or no (percent), Assessed at each visit for up to 3 years|Secondary interventions, Time point at which the patient undergoes treatment for prostate cancer recurrence, Assessed at the time of clinic visits up to 3 years after treatment.
The primary objective is to evaluate the in-field recurrence rates and recurrence free survival - defined as the absence of clinically significant prostate cancer within the treated zone (identified by prostate MRI and subsequent targeted prostate biopsy).

Secondary objectives of interest are:

* Perioperative parameters such as operative time, perioperative complications, analgesic requirement, postoperative hospital stay, foley catheter duration
* Functional outcomes such as time to urinary continence, urinary continence, and erectile dysfunction
* Oncologic outcomes such as biochemical recurrence rates (defined in section 2.1), recurrence free survival, presence of secondary intervention for prostate cancer (HIFU, radiation, surgery, ADT)
