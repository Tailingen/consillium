Effects of US-guided SAPB During Breast Surgery
The serratus anterior plan (SAP) block is a technique that has recently gained popularity in the context of breast surgery. SAP block resulted in better hemodynamic stability, early ambulation and shorter hospital stay, as well as hospital costs for postoperative breast patients.

We aimed to investigate the effects of the serratus anterior plane block in women undergoing breast surgery, in the intraoperative period.
