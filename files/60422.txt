Identification of Integrin ab Expression in Lung Cancer Patients
It has been reported that the expression rates of integrin αvβ3 and integrin αvβ5 in NSCLC are 89% and 100%, respectively. Among RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptides, cRGDyK peptide (cRGD) known as integrin ανβ3 and ανβ5 antagonist has been widely used for targeting various cancers including NSCLC, glioblastoma, and colon carcinoma as well as prostate cancer. In this study, the investigators aim to analysis the expression of integrin ανβ3 in lung cancer patients.
Expression of Integrin ανβ3 in Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Lung cancer types
integrin expression level, Integrins expression level categorized to high and low, 20 months
Patient samples: From the Human Resource Bank of the Institute of Pathology, Korea University, the investigators collected paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 61 patients with NSCLC (adenocarcinoma =50, squamous cell carcinoma = 11) who had undergone surgical treatment for NSCLC at Korea University Guro Hospital between 2015 and 2018 under the IRB of Guro Hospital 2019GR0460. Samples were excluded when patients had undergone perioperative chemo- or radiotherapy. Among the tissues excised from lung cancer patients, lung cancer and normal tissue were classified as pathologically, defined as normal tissue and cancer tissue, and stained with an integrin ανβ3 primary antibody.
