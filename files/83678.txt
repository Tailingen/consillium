Application of Whole-course Standardized Nutrition Management During Peri-radiotherapy in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma After Radiotherapy: a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Clinical Study
This study will present an advanced equipment of tumor nutrition diagnosis and assesment for nasopharyngeal cancer(NPC) radiotherapy patients in nutritional risk screening, evaluation, diagnosis and directing nutritional intervention, aiming to explore the advantages of the whole nutritional management in acute radiation reaction rate, completion rate of radiotherapy, nutritional status, and quality of life for NPC patients.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Radiation Therapy Induced Change|Nutrition Disorders
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Formula nutrition
Incidence of acute radiation reactions, This study mainly includes oral mucosa mucositis, salivary glands injury induced by radiotherapy, laryngoesophageal mucositis referring to The 2020 Expert Consensus on the Standardized Management of Radiation Oncology for nutrition-related radiation injury responses., 12 months
Incidence of decline in nutritional status, analysis by the clinical nutrition detection analyzer, 12 months|Incidence of decline in quality of life scores（QOL）, It is measured by a standard QOL table,including 12 questions.Each question is 5 points,so there are 60 points and 5 grades(51-60 points, 41-50 points, 31-40 points, 21-30 points,\<20 points).A higher score is a better life., 12 months|Self-rating Anxiety screening Scale（GAD-7), A GAD-7 table would estimate one's anxiety according to the emotion of the past two weeks,including 9 questions and 27 points totally.There are 4 grades of anxiety, a LOWER score means a normal mind state. Actually,0-4 points is/are no anxiety.5-9 points represent slight anxiety .10-14 are in moderate anxiety.15-27 are severe anxiety,respectively., 12 months|Self-rating Scale for Depression Screening (PHQ-9), A PHQ-9 table is a simplified Scale for Depression Screening,it would estimate one's depression emotion according to the mind of the past two weeks,including 9 questions and 27 points totally.There are 4 grades of depression, a LOWER score is equal to a GOOD mind.Actually,0-4 points is/are no depression.5-9 are depressed but not obvious.10-14 are in obvious depression.15-27 are severe depression,respectively., 12 months
In this study, nutrition intervention was performed in one group of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with no nutritional risk during the periperiod of radiotherapy , and the other group with no additional intervention when without nutritional risks, for evaluating the value of overall nutritional management in the periperiod radiotherapy.
