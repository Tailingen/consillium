Head to Head Comparison of Azacitidine and Decitabine in Myelodysplastic Syndrome
In Myelodysplastic syndrome, epigenetic treatments such as Azacitidine and Decitabine have been highlighted in phase 3 studies. However, as the 1st line treatment, it has not been evaluated the head to head comparison of two drugs. This study is a retrospective study to compare the efficacy of two drugs.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Response rate, Compare Azacitidine and Decitabine's treatment response rate in MDS patients, 6 months
Efficacy, To compare hematologic improvement between Azacitidine and decitabine, 6 months|Survival rate, To compare survival rate between Azacitidine and decitabine, 6 months|Number of participants with non-hematologic toxicities, To compare toxicity between Azacitidine and decitabine, 6 months|infection rate, To compare infection rate between Azacitidine and decitabine, 6 months
Among 300 MDS patient, 200 of them have been taking Azacitidine and 100 of them have been taking Decitabine. Medical chart of these patients will be reviewed to assess the efficacy and safety between two agents.
