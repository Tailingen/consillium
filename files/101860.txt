Intra-arterial Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Intraocular Retinoblastoma
The purpose of this study is to show that chemotherapy delivered directly through the artery supplying the eye (ophthalmic artery) to patients with retinoblastoma is a safe and effective treatment alternative to conventional systemic chemotherapy, external beam radiation, and surgical removal of the eye.
Retinoblastoma
DRUG: Melphalan hydrochloride
Number of Patients Who Complete Therapy Without the Need for Additional Treatment Including Systemic Chemotherapy, External Beam Radiation, or Enucleation., The primary objective of this study is to show that intra-arterial delivery of the chemotherapeutic agent is successful in treating intraocular retinoblastoma, defined as avoiding systemic chemotherapy, external beam radiation, and enucleation., Within the first six months after the initial treatment.
Delivering the chemotherapeutic agent in the arterial system through the ophthalmic artery transforms the treatment of retinoblastoma from systemic chemotherapy to local chemotherapy. Administration of the drug directly to the targeted site thus avoids the complications and adverse events associated with toxicity from systemic, rather than local, chemotherapy.
