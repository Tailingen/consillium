Gut Microbial Metabolites Inosine Combined With PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitor for Patients With Malignant Advanced Solid Tumors
We conducted a single-center, prospective randomized ,Parallel controls, open labels Clinical Studies,The study is about Gut Microbial Metabolites Inosine Combined With PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitor for Patients with malignant Advanced Solid Tumors .One group was the inosine group , the other group was the non-inosine group.The treatment regimen of inosine group : inosine + PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor ± chemotherapy/targeting, and the treatment regimen of non-inosine group : PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor ± chemotherapy/targeting.The primary study endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival PFS, and the secondary study endpoints were objective remission rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) comparing the two groups.
Advanced Solid Tumor

overall survival (OS), Time from randomization grouping to death from any cause, 36 months|progression-free survival (PFS), Time from randomization grouping to the first recorded disease progression or death from any cause, 36 months
objective remission rate(ORR) [ Time Frame: Up to 36 months ], Proportion of subjects with best overall efficacy assessed as CR and PR, 36 months|disease control rate (DCR), Proportion of subjects with best overall efficacy assessed as CR, PR and SD, 36 months
We conducted a single-center, prospective randomized ,Parallel controls, open labels Clinical Studies,,The study is about Gut Microbial Metabolites Inosine Combined With PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitor for Patients with malignant Advanced Solid Tumors.One group was the inosine group , the other group was the non-inosine group. A total of 172 patients with advanced malignant solid tumors were collected from Capital Medical University Beijing Friendship Hospital, and randomly assigned to two groups according to 1:1, 86 patients in the inosine group and 86 patients in the non-inosine group. The regimen of inosine treatment group was: inosine + PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor ± chemotherapy/targeting, and the treatment regimen of non-inosine treatment group was: PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor ±chemotherapy/targeting,every 2 or 3 weeks protocol ,until the subject's disease progresses, death, intolerable adverse events, the investigator determines that there is no benefit from continued treatment or other termination criteria are met (pregnancy, individual patient reasons or co-morbidities), the subject requests withdrawal from the study, withdrawal of informed consent, and loss of visit.Anti-tumor efficacy is evaluated every 2/3 cycles (every 6 weeks) based on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results and their tumor markers, according to RECIST v1.1 criteria.

Inosine tablets were purchased from Tianjin Jinshi, dosage: 0.2g orally 3 times/day, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, chemotherapy and targeted combination therapy regimens were developed by the investigators according to the NCCN guidelines and CSCO guidelines and the patient's condition and its staging.
