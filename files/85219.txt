Phase I Study of Marizomib + Panobinostat for Children With DIPG
This research study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the drugs marizomib and panobinostat in pediatric patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG).

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Marizomib
* Panobinostat
Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma|Pediatric Brainstem Glioma|Pediatric Brainstem Gliosarcoma, Recurrent|Pediatric Cancer|Pediatric Brain Tumor|Diffuse Glioma
DRUG: Marizomib|DRUG: Panobinostat
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of marizomib as a single agent, To determine the toxicity profile and any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of marizomib as a single agent at doses up to 0.8 mg/m2 , in children with DIPG, 28 Days|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of marizomib in combination with panobinostat, To determine the toxicity profile and any DLT of marizomib at doses up to 0.8 mg/m2 when administered in combination with panobinostat to children with DIPG, 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose of Marizomib (single agent), To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of marizomib when administered as a single agent in children with DIPG, 28 Days|Maximum Tolerated Dose of Marizomib in combination with panobinostat, To estimate the MTD or RP2D of marizomib when administered in combination with panobinostat in children with DIPG, 28 Days|Pharmacokinetic parameters-volume of the central compartment (Vc/F), Estimated using compartmental methods. Plasma drug concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters will be presented in tabular and graphical form, Day 1 Course A1|Pharmacokinetic parameters-elimination rate constant (Ke),, Estimated using compartmental methods. Plasma drug concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters will be presented in tabular and graphical form, Course A1, Day 1|Pharmacokinetic parameters half-life (t1/2), Estimated using compartmental methods. Plasma drug concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters will be presented in tabular and graphical form, Course A1, Day 1|Pharmacokinetic parameters-apparent clearance (CL/F), Estimated using compartmental methods Plasma drug concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters will be presented in tabular and graphical form, Course A1, Day 1|Area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC), Estimated using compartmental methods Plasma drug concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters will be presented in tabular and graphical form, Course A1, Day 1
Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), Kaplan-Meier method, rPFS will be measured from the time of treatment initiation until the time of progressive disease or death from any cause in patients with an event up to 60 Months.|Overall survival (OS), Kaplan-Meier method will be used to summarize the time-to-event endpoints, i.e. OS, time from enrollment until death due to any cause up to 60 Months|Clinical Benefit Score, determined by combination of radiographic assessment, symptoms (patient/parent-reported), clinical (physician or NP) assessment, steroid use, ability to walk, and quality of life (QOL) measure, Baseline, Day 1 of every Cycle up to 2 years. One cycle is 28 days. Higher scores may indicate more clinical benefit.
This research study involves chemotherapy as a possible treatment for pediatric patients with Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG)

* The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits.
* The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

  * Marizomib
  * Panobinostat

This study consists of 2 parts:

* Part A : The investigators are looking at the highest dose (up to a targeted maximum dose) of the study drug Marizomib that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have DIPG, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study intervention. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled prior and how well the dose was tolerated.
* Part B: Participants who tolerate Marizomib alone will be treated with Marizomib and panobinostat, but at lower dose of marizomib than the dose of marizomib when given alone.

Participants are expected to be on study treatment for up to 2 years followed for up to 5 years.

It is expected that up to 45 people will take part in this research study. This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

* Marizomib has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for any disease.

  -- This is the first time Marizomib will be given to children.
* Panobinostat has not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma but it has been approved for other uses.
