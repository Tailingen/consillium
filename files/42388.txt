CRS is a nonantigen specific toxicity that occurs as result of potent immune activation mediated by large, rapid release of cytokines into blood from immune cells affected by IMP. Grading and management of CRS was based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Consensus Guidelines 2014. Allergic/Hypersensitivity reactions or acute infusion reactions are defined as disorder characterized by adverse local/general response from exposure to allergen; graded by NCI CTCAE v4.03., First IMP administration (Day 1) up to last dose of IMP + 30 days (i.e., up to 72 days)|Expansion Part: Percentage of Participants With Overall Response (OR) Per International Working Group (IWG) Criteria, Response: assessed by IWG 2003 recommendations for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and revised 2000 criteria for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

Per IWG criteria, relapse was defined as reappearance of blasts in blood or bone marrow (\>5%) or in any extramedullary site after a CR. CR:\<= 5% myeloblasts in bone marrow with no evidence of persistent dysplasia; peripheral blood showing hemoglobin\>=11g/dL. Marrow CR: no circulating blasts, \<5% blast, absolute neutrophil count \>1000/mcL, platelets \>100000/mcL, no recurrence for 4 weeks. CRi: meet all criteria for CR except platelet count and/or ANC. PR: all CR criteria except blasts decreased by \>=50% over pretreatment or less advanced than pretreatment. Progression: at least 50% decrease from maximum remission/response in granulocytes/platelets; reduction in Hgb by \>=2 g/dL; transfusion dependence., From 1st documentation of response to date of first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever came earlier (up to 42 days)|Expansion Part: Number of Participants With Disease-free Survival, Disease-free survival was defined as the time from date of first administration of study intervention until the earliest of any of the following: date of death or date of first response assessment confirming relapse or date of final response assessment which fails to confirm response whichever occurred first., First IMP administration to date of first documentation of disease progression or relapse or death, whichever came earlier (up to 42 days)
Dose Escalation Part: Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and did not necessarily had to have a causal relationship with the treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were any untoward medical occurrence that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening, required initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or considered as medically important event. TEAEs were defined as the AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the TEAE period (defined as the time from the first dose of the IMP to the last dose of IMP + 30 days)., From Baseline (Day 1) up to last dose of IMP + 30 days (i.e., up to 72 days)|Dose Escalation Part: Percentage of Participants With Objective Response Per IWG Criteria, Objective response was defined as the percentage of participants who had a marrow CR, or PR (MDS) and CR/CRi (AML) per IWG criteria.

TEAE period was defined as the time from the first dose of the IMP to the last dose of the IMP + 30 days., From Baseline (Day 1) up to last dose of IMP + 30 days (i.e., up to 72 days)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of SAR440234, Cmax was the maximum observed plasma concentration. Cmax was obtained by a non-compartmental analysis. Here in the time frame, Day = D, start of infusion = SOI, mid of infusion = MOI, end of infusion = EOI and hours = H., Cycle 1: D 1: SOI, EOI, 1, 2, 5, 7, 24, 48, 72 H post EOI; D 8: SOI, MOI, EOI, 2, 5, 168 H post EOI; D 15: MOI, EOI, 2, 5, 24 H post EOI; D 22: SOI, MOI, EOI, 2, 5, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168 H post EOI; D 29: EOI, 2 H post EOI; D 36: SOI, EOI, 2 H post EOI
The duration of the study for the participants included a period for screening of up to 14 days. The cycle duration was 42 days. Participants continued study treatment as long as clinical benefit was possible or until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reaction, participant's decision to stop treatment, or other reason of discontinuation. After study treatment discontinuation participants returned to the study site 30 days after the last administration of SAR440234 for end of treatment assessments. Participants without documented disease progression at the end of a treatment visit who had not yet started treatment with another anti-cancer therapy would proceed with monthly follow-up visits until initiation of another anti-cancer therapy, disease progression, or study cut-off date, whichever came first.
