HER2 PET Imaging in Breast Cancer Patients Using [68GA]ABY-025
This is an open-labeled, exploratory, single center study. Patients with a big primary breast cancer (â‰¥ 3 cm) or metastatic first line, routinely have their HER2-expression determined by biopsy. Patients having a HER2-positive tumor will be recruited to the study. A \[18F\]FDG PET/ceCT scan is performed for the measurement of uptake in the tumour and diagnosis of possible metastases. Each subject will receive a single injection of the investigational product \[68Ga\]ABY-025, followed by measurement of uptake in the tumour or metastases and in normal organs. The investigations will be repeated after HER2 directed therapy.
