A Study of Gilteritinib in Combination With Ivosidenib or Enasidenib in People With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
The researchers are doing this study to see if the combination of gilteritinib with ivosidenib or enasidenib is a safe and effective treatment for people with relapsed/refractory AML with FLT3/IDH1 or FLT3/IDH2 gene mutations. The researchers will also look for the highest dose of the combination of gilteritinib with ivosidenib or enasidenib that causes few or mild side effects. When the highest safe dose is found, they will test that dose in new groups of participants.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: Gilteritinib|DRUG: Ivosidenib|DRUG: Enasidenib
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), These are derived based on Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) according to BOIN dose escalation methodology., 1 year|Adverse events /toxicities, will be graded using CTCAE 5.0 and described by frequency, duration and severity of treatment-emergent, treatment-related, and serious adverse events., 1 year
Clinical response, The ORR will be estimated by sample proportion with 95% confidence intervals calculated based on exact binomial distribution., 1 year
