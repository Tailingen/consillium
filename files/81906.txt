Evaluating a New Gonadotoxic Risk Stratification System
The primary objective of this study is to assess if there is an association between a newly described gonadotoxic risk stratification system and post-treatment ovarian reserve as determined by FSH and AMH.
Cancer
Ovarian reserve, The Investigator will evaluate if there is an association between ovarian reserve (defined using AMH and FSH) and the risk stratification system categories (minimally increased risk, significantly increased risk, and high level of increased risk). Specifically Ovarian reserve goes from normal (\[FSH \<10\] AND \[AMH \>= 1.0\]), Diminished ovarian reserve (\[10 \<=FSH \< 25\] or \[ 0.5 \<= AMH \<1.0\]), primary ovarian insufficiency (\[25\<= FSH\] or \[ 0.5 \< AMH\]). AMH: ng/ml, FSH: mIU/ml. Investigator will test the amount of agreement between the two ordinal variables using a kappa statistic at each time point in the first two years of follow-up. Investigator will perform ordinal logistic regression accounting for repeated measures for participants who are not using contraception. Investigator will access patient characteristics to see if Investigator need to adjust for other covariates including age, race, ethnicity, and body mass index., 2 year follow up
The Investigator will test the amount of agreement between the two ordinal variables using a kappa statistic at each time point in the first two years of follow up. The Investigator will perform ordinal logistic regression accounting for repeated measures data for participants who are not using contraception. The Investigator will assess participant characteristics to see if the Investigator need to adjust for other covariates including age, race, ethnicity and body mass index (BMI).

Since contraception can mask an elevated FSH surge from gonadal failure, the Investigator will perform a similar model for participants on contraception using AMH only.
