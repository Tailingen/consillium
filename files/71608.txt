A Study Comparing Geriatric Co-Management With Geriatric Guided Supportive Care in Older Patients Receiving Chemoradiation Therapy for Their Head and Neck Cancer
The researchers are doing this study to see whether geriatric co-management or geriatric guided supportive care are good approaches for managing side effects in older patients who have head and neck cancer and are receiving chemoradiation therapy. This study will provide valuable information about different ways to manage side effects in older patients receiving chemoradiation therapy.
