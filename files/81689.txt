Retreatment With CTL019/CTL119
This research study is designed to evaluate the effects of retreatment with CTL019/CTL119 in patients with late relapse of B-cell lymphomas.
Lymphoma, B-Cell
DRUG: CD19 redirected autologous T cells (CTL019 or CTL119 cells)
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Safety of retreatment with CTL019/CTL119 as measured by treatment-related events, At time of consent through 1 year after the subject received CTL019/CTL119
Overall response rate using Cheson 2007 criteria, Efficacy of retreatment with CTL019/CTL119 as measured by ORR by Cheson 2007 definitions at 3 months, Month 3 post-infusion
This is a single arm open label trial that will assess the safety and efficacy of retreatment with CTL019/CTL119 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells in patients who have late relapse of diffuse large B-cell or follicular lymphoma after achieving complete remission from prior CTL019/CTL119 treatment. Patients eligible for this protocol will have been treated initially with CTL019/CTL119 under UPCC13413/NCT02030834, have experienced a durable complete response (defined as â‰¥ 6 months duration), and have a residual manufactured CTL019/CTL119 product available. This protocol will serve subjects with no available potentially curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation) who have a limited prognosis (months to \< 2 year expected survival) with available therapies.
