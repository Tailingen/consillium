Phase II Study of NGR-hTNF in Combination With Doxorubicin in Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer
The primary objective of this randomized phase II trial is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients randomized to NGR-hTNF plus an anthracycline versus patients randomized to an anthracycline alone
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: NGR-hTNF|DRUG: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin|DRUG: Doxorubicin
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Defined as the time from the date of randomization until disease progression, or death, from the date of randomization, every 6 and 8 weeks based on type of chemotherapy during treatment and every 12 weeks during the follow-up until PD or death
Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause., from the date of randomization, every 6 and 8 weeks based on type of chemotherapy during treatment and every 12 weeks during follow-up until death|Response Rate (RR), defined as the percentage of patients who have a best-response rating of complete or partial response, according to standard RECIST criteria., from the date of randomization, every 6 and 8 weeks based on type of chemotherapy during treatment and every 12 weeks during the follow-up until PD or death|Disease Control Rate (DCR), defined as the percentage of patients who have a best-response rating of complete response, partial response, or stable disease, according to standard RECIST criteria., from the date of randomization, every 6 and 8 weeks based on type of chemotherapy during treatment and every 12 weeks during the follow-up until PD or death|Duration of Disease Control, measured from the date of randomization until disease progression, or death due to any cause., from the date of randomization, every 6 and 8 weeks based on type of chemotherapy during treatment and every 12 weeks during the follow-up until PD or death|Safety and Toxicity according to NCI-CTCAE criteria (version 4.03), To evaluate safety and toxicity profile related to NGR-hTNF, from the start of treatment until 28 days after last treatment
Considering the safety/toxicity profile of NGR-hTNF characterized by mild-to-moderate constitutional symptoms, the reversibility of these adverse events generally occurring only during the infusion time; the absence of overlapping toxicities with chemotherapeutic agents; the safety and preliminary antitumor activity observed in previous trial with doxorubicin; and the objective response rate (RR) registered in a phase II trial in previously treated ovarian cancer patients seems justified to evaluate in a randomized phase II trial the efficacy of NGR-hTNF against a doxorubicin-based option in advanced ovarian cancer patients progressing or recurrent after a standard platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy.
