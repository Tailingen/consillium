Combination of Pembrolizumab and Lenvatinib, in Pre-treated Thymic CArcinoma paTIents
This is a multicentric, open-label, single arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in pre-treated thymic carcinoma patients who have progressed after at least one line of platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced disease without having received any previous immunotherapy (previous bevacizumab allowed, but not sunitinib), and not amenable to curative-intent radical surgery and/or radiotherapy, regardless of PD-L1 status.
