Go to Patient Version
Clinical Presentation
The most common site for neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors is the appendix. In a single-institution retrospective review of 45 cases of  neuroendocrine  (carcinoid) tumors in children and adolescents between 2003 and 2016, the appendix was the primary site in 36 patients.[
1
][
Level of evidence C2
]    No recurrences were observed among the patients with appendiceal primary tumors treated with appendectomy alone, which supports resection of the appendix without hemicolectomy as the procedure of choice.
Most neuroendocrine tumors of
the appendix are discovered incidentally at the time of appendectomy. Most of them are small, low-grade, localized tumors.[

Treatment of Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Appendix
Treatment options for neuroendocrine tumors of the appendix include the following:
Appendectomy.
In adults, it has been accepted practice to remove the entire right colon in patients with
large neuroendocrine tumors of the appendix (>2 cm in diameter) or with
tumors that have spread to the lymph nodes.[
5
-
8
]
In children and adolescents, however, study results  suggest that appendectomy alone is sufficient treatment for appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors, regardless of size, position, histology, or nodal or mesenteric involvement. Right hemicolectomy is unnecessary in children. Routine follow-up imaging and biological studies are not beneficial.[

Evidence (appendectomy alone):
The Italian Tumori Rari in Etá Pediatrica project performed a prospective registry study that evaluated 113 pediatric patients with appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors.[
9
][
Level of evidence C1
] Primary re-excision was not recommended for completely excised tumors smaller than 2 cm, except for microscopic/macroscopic residual tumor on the margins of the appendix. In these cases, cecum resection and pericecal node biopsy was recommended.  Decisions about  tumors larger than 2 cm were made at the discretion of the primary physicians.  However, physicians were discouraged from performing right hemicolectomy unless margins were positive. Of the 113 study participants, 108 had tumors smaller than 2 cm.   Thirty-five patients had extension of tumor beyond the appendiceal wall.    Five tumors invaded the serosa, and 28 tumors invaded the periappendiceal fat.   Margins were clear in 111 of 113 patients.
At 41 months of follow-up, all 113 patients were alive.
The five patients  with tumors larger than 2 cm did well.
One patient had resection of the cecum; no residual tumor was found.
One patient had a right hemicolectomy (tumor was <2 cm with clear margins, but an octreotide scan was possibly positive), and no tumor was found.
The study concluded that appendectomy alone should be considered curative for most pediatric patients with appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors. The procedure of choice is a resection of the appendix without hemicolectomy.
A French multicenter study of children younger than 18 years  with neuroendocrine tumors of the appendix was carried out by surveying pediatric surgeons from 1988 to 2012.  A total of 114 patients were identified.  Risk factors for secondary right hemicolectomy were tumor extension into the mesoappendix, positive margins, size larger than 2 cm, and high proliferative index.  Eighteen patients met the above criteria and were observed.[
10
]
All patients were alive and had no disease at follow-up.
In addition, follow-up radiological studies and biological tests were not helpful.
The investigator's recommendation was that appendectomy alone is sufficient treatment for neuroendocrine tumors of the appendix.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 38 studies of appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors identified 958 patients with a mean age at presentation of 11.6 years. Tumor size was 2 cm or smaller in 85% of the cases. Of the 24 papers that reported the status of the resection margin, 97% of tumors had negative margins. Nodal involvement was reported in ten series and was present in 1.4% of cases, with higher rates seen in patients whose tumors were larger than 2 cm (35%). Vascular involvement was seen in 11% of 510 patients, and invasion of the mesoappendix or periappendiceal fat was reported in 29% of 910 patients.[
8
]
According to the European and American Neuroendocrine Tumor Societies, 189 patients met the criteria for a secondary procedure after initial appendectomy, but only 69 patients underwent a secondary procedure (n = 43, hemicolectomy; n = 2, ileocecectomy; n = 1, cecectomy; n = 2, ileocolectomy; n = 21, not specified).
Of the 120 patients who did not have a secondary procedure, 91 patients had tumors extending to the mesoappendix, 5 patients had vascular invasion, 4 patients had positive margins, 12 patients had tumors 2 cm or larger, 1 patient had a high proliferative index, and 7 patients had positive lymph nodes.
No disease recurrences were reported in patients who had a secondary procedure or in those who were observed.
Preoperative and postoperative imaging was not helpful in managing patients.

Treatment and Outcome of Extra-Appendiceal Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors
Clinical Presentation
Extra-appendiceal neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors are rare. Most tumors are sporadic, but they may also be part of a hereditary syndrome. A single-institution retrospective review identified 45 cases of  neuroendocrine  tumors in children and adolescents between 2003 and 2016.[
1
][
Level of evidence C2
]  In this study, extra-appendiceal primary tumors (n = 9) were associated with a higher risk of metastasis and recurrence. The Tumori Rari in Etá Pediatrica (TREP) group registered 27 patients between 2000 and 2020.[
2
]
Extra-appendiceal neuroendocrine  tumors of the abdomen occur most often in the pancreas but can  also occur in the stomach and liver.[
2
] In the TREP series of 27 cases, 12 occurred in the pancreas and 10 occurred in the bronchi.[
2
] The most common clinical presentation is an unknown primary site. Extra-appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors are more likely to be larger and higher grade or to present with metastases.[
3
] Larger tumor size has been associated with a higher risk of recurrence.[
1
]
The carcinoid syndrome of
excessive excretion of somatostatin is characterized by flushing, labile blood
pressure, and metastatic spread of the tumor to the liver.[
4
]  Symptoms may be
lessened by giving somatostatin analogues, which are available in short-acting and
long-acting forms.[
5
]
Clinical experience with extra-appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors is reported almost entirely in adults.  Histopathology is graded by mitotic rate, Ki-67 labeling index, and presence of necrosis into well-differentiated (low grade, G1), moderately differentiated (intermediate grade, G2) and poorly differentiated (high grade, G3) tumors.[

Treatment and Outcome of Extra-Appendiceal Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors
Complete surgical resection and localized disease are associated with a favorable clinical outcome.[
2
,
7
]
In one retrospective single-institution study, the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 41% for patients with extra-appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors. The overall survival (OS) rate was 66%.[
3
]
Treatment options for resectable extra-appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors include the following:
Surgery.[
8
]
Treatment options for unresectable or multifocal extra-appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors include the following:
Embolization.[
9
]
Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) ligands.[
10
,
11
]
Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.[
12
]
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors.[
13
]
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).[
14
]
Immunotherapies.[
15
]
SSTR2 ligands include octreotide, long-acting repeatable octreotide, and lanreotide.  Octreotide is not practical for therapy because its short half-life necessitates frequent administration.  Long-acting, repeatable octreotide and lanreotide have been evaluated in prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.[
10
,
11
]  Patient age was not specified in the first trial, and eligibility was restricted to age 18 years and older in the second trial. Neither agent produced significant objective responses in measurable tumors.  Both agents were associated with statistically significant increases in progression-free survival and time to progression, and both agents are recommended for the treatment of unresectable extra-appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors in adults.
A phase III trial included 231 patients with advanced or metastatic extra-appendiceal neuroendocrine tumors. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with lutetium Lu 177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE plus long-acting octreotide or high-dose long-acting octreotide (control group). While the median OS did not reach statistical significance, there was an 11.7-month difference, with 48.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 37.4–55.2) in the 177Lu-DOTATATE group and 36.3 months (95% CI, 25.9–51.7) in the control group.[
16
] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of 177Lu-DOTATATE for children aged 12 years and older with somatostatin receptor–positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
Embolization, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, mTOR inhibitors, and TKIs have been used for treatment.[

Metastatic Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors
Treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine tumors
of the large bowel, pancreas, or stomach is complicated and requires treatment
similar to that given for adult high-grade neuroendocrine tumors. For more information about treatment options for patients with malignant carcinoid tumors, see
Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors Treatment
.

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[
3
-
5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as
Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors Treatment
