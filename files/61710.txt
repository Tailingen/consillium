Phase 1b/2 Study of Carfilzomib in Relapsed Solid Tumors, Multiple Myeloma, or Lymphoma
The primary objectives of this Phase 1b/2 study were as follows:

* Phase 1b (Bolus and Infusion): To evaluate the safety and tolerability of carfilzomib in patients with relapsed solid tumors and in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma and in patients with refractory lymphoma.
* Phase 2 (Bolus): To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) after 4 cycles of carfilzomib in patients with relapsed solid tumors.

DRUG: Carfilzomib|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Phase 1b: Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT), Participants were evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) version 3.0.

A DLT was defined as treatment-related ≥ Grade 2 neuropathy with pain, ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity, Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting 7 or more days, or thrombocytopenia with bleeding.

The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for each of the 3 populations (solid tumor, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma) was defined as the dose level at which \< 33% of participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity during the first 28-day cycle., 28 days|Phase 2: Percentage of Participants With an Overall Response After 4 Treatment Cycles, Overall response is defined as participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) after 4 cycles, assessed by the Investigator using tumor measurement and according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions;

PR: Disappearance of all target lesions, persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits and no lesions, or, at least a 30% decrease in the size of target lesions and no progression of existing non-target lesions or any new lesions.

SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest size since the treatment started, and no progression of existing non-target lesions or any new lesions., 4 months
Percentage of Participants With an Overall Response Throughout the Study, Solid tumor participants were evaluated for disease response according to RECIST, Version 1.1. Multiple myeloma participants were evaluated using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria with the addition of minimal response (MR) based on the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant Group (EBMT). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) participants were evaluated using the International Workshop NHL criteria. Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) participants were evaluated using Criteria from the Sixth International Workshop for WM.

Overall response is defined in Outcome Measure 2 for participants with solid tumors. For NHL, overall response is defined as a best overall response of CR or PR. For multiple myeloma and WM, overall response is defined as participants with a best overall response of stringent complete response (sCR), CR, very good partial response (VGPR) or PR., Tumor assessments occurred at the end of Cycle 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 and continued every 3 cycles thereafter up to 6 months after last dose. Analysis includes data up to the data cut-off date of 07 October 2014; maximum duration of treatment was 35 months.|Duration of Response, Duration of response is defined as the time from first evidence of a partial response or better (the first observation of PR before confirmation) to disease progression, with deaths owing to causes other than progression censored., Tumor assessments occurred at the end of Cycle 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 and continued every 3 cycles thereafter up to 6 months after last dose. Analysis includes data up to the data cut-off date of 07 October 2014; maximum duration of treatment was 35 months.|Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from start of treatment to disease progression or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first., Tumor assessments occurred at the end of Cycle 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 and continued every 3 cycles thereafter up to 6 months after last dose. Analysis includes data up to the data cut-off date of 07 October 2014; maximum duration of treatment was 35 months.|Time to Progression, Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as number of months between start of treatment and first evidence/documentation of disease progression., Tumor assessments occurred at the end of Cycle 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 and continued every 3 cycles thereafter up to 6 months after last dose. Analysis includes data up to the data cut-off date of 07 October 2014; maximum duration of treatment was 35 months.|Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration of Carfilzomib, Plasma concentrations of carfilzomib were determined by a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Concentration values that were below the lower limit of quantification of 0.1 ng/mL were set to zero. Treatment groups receiving the same dose (e.g. 20 mg/m²) were combined for Day 1 analyses., Cycle 1, Day 1, predose and at 5 minutes and 15 minutes post start of infusion (for 30-minute infusion groups only), and at the end of infusion, 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, and 4 hours after the end of the infusion.|Time to Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Tmax) of Carfilzomib, Cycle 1, Day 1, predose and at 5 minutes and 15 minutes post start of infusion (for 30-minute infusion groups only), and at the end of infusion, 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, and 4 hours after the end of the infusion.|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Concentration Measured (AUC0-last) for Carfilzomib, Cycle 1, Day 1, predose and at 5 minutes and 15 minutes post start of infusion (for 30-minute infusion groups only), and at the end of infusion, 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, and 4 hours after the end of the infusion.|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-inf) for Carfilzomib, Cycle 1, Day 1, predose and at 5 minutes and 15 minutes post start of infusion (for 30-minute infusion groups only), and at the end of infusion, 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, and 4 hours after the end of the infusion.|Elimination Half-life (t½) of Carfilzomib, Cycle 1, Day 1, predose and at 5 minutes and 15 minutes post start of infusion (for 30-minute infusion groups only), and at the end of infusion, 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, and 4 hours after the end of the infusion.|Clearance (CL) of Carfilzomib, Cycle 1, Day 1, predose and at 5 minutes and 15 minutes post start of infusion (for 30-minute infusion groups only), and at the end of infusion, 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, and 4 hours after the end of the infusion.|Volume of Distribution at Steady State (Vss) of Carfilzomib, Cycle 1, Day 1, predose and at 5 minutes and 15 minutes post start of infusion (for 30-minute infusion groups only), and at the end of infusion, 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, and 4 hours after the end of the infusion.|Mean Residence Time (MRT) Extrapolated to Infinity for Carfilzomib, Cycle 1, Day 1, predose and at 5 minutes and 15 minutes post start of infusion (for 30-minute infusion groups only), and at the end of infusion, 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, and 4 hours after the end of the infusion.
