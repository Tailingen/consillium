A Phase 1/2 Study Evaluating AMG 337 in Asian Subjects
This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2 study. The study will evaluate the tolerability, safety and activity of AMG 337 in Asian subjects who have advanced solid tumors (Phase 1) or subjects with MET amplified tumors with a focus on gastric/gastroesophageal junction/esophageal adenocarcinoma (Phase 2).

This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, single arm, open-label study to assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of AMG 337 in solid tumors. In the Phase 1, approximately 3 to 45 subjects enrolled in a 3+3+3 dose escalation scheme evaluating two dose levels. In the Phase 2, approximately 140 subjects will be enrolled to either Cohort 1 (subjects with MET amplified /gastroesophageal junction/esophageal (G/GEJ/E) adenocarcinoma with measurable tumor) or Cohort 2 (subjects with MET amplified solid tumors with measurable tumor and subjects with MET amplified G/GEJ/E adenocarcinoma with non-measurable tumor). All subjects will self-administer AMG 337 daily until disease progression or other protocol specified end of treatment criteria are met. Tumor assessment by RECIST 1.1 will be followed during study treatment.

Tumor tissue, biomarkers, pharmacokinetics and Patient Reported Outcomes will be assessed.
