A Study in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer
A Phase 1, Open label, Dose escalation and Dose expansion study of SCO-120 in HR +ve HER2-ve advanced/ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients to evalaute the safety, tolerability and prelimnary efficacy. Initial part with dose escalation is to determine the MTD and RP2D, and PK and PD characterisation. RP2D will be further evalauted for prelimnary efficacy in MBC patients with tretament failure on Aromatase Inhibitor/Fulvestrant/CDK4-6 inhibitors with or with out ESR1 mutation.

DRUG: Part 1|DRUG: Part 2|DRUG: Part 3
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities at each dose levels (Part 1 only), 28 Days/End of Cycle 1|Incidence and severity of adverse events with each dose level, The intensity of adverse events will be graded as per CTCAE, Version 5.0 and categorized as serious adverse events or non-serious adverse events., upto 30 days of last dose
evaluation of Cmax (Part 1 and Part 2), Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using non-compartmental analysis. The actual elapsed time from dose will be used in the final pharmacokinetic parameter calculations, Through Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (Each cycle of 28 Days)|evaluation of tmax (Part 1 and Part 2), Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using non-compartmental analysis. The actual elapsed time from dose will be used in the final pharmacokinetic parameter calculations, Through Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (Each cycle of 28 Days)|evaluation of AUC (Part 1 and Part 2), Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using non-compartmental analysis. The actual elapsed time from dose will be used in the final pharmacokinetic parameter calculations, Through Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (Each cycle of 28 Days)|tumour response, Every 8 weeks, for 'Time point Response (Partial Response[PR], Stable Disease[SD], Disease progression [DP] or Complete Response [CR]), Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
