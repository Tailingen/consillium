Trimodal Prehabilitation for Cystectomy Patients to Enhance Post-operative Care
Trimodal prehabilitation is a preoperative three-tiered (trimodal) approach to optimizing physical and mental health. It has been found to successfully improve functional recovery in patients undergoing colorectal surgery following an evidence-based enhanced-recovery pathway (ERP). It is unknown whether the same program is effective in patients undergoing a similar surgery for bladder cancer (radical cystectomy).

Objective: To evaluate the appropriateness of a standardized prehabilitation program for implementation into an enhanced recovery pathway for cystectomy patients and determine whether prehabilitation facilitates earlier recovery of functional capacity.

Hypothesis: Prehabilitation will ultimately improve recovery of functional capacity, clinical and patient-centered outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.

Design: Participants will follow an 8-week trimodal prehabilitation program consisting of exercise therapy combined with nutritional counseling, protein supplementation, and psychological care; they will be compared to a cohort of participants following ERP care alone.

Conclusion: The proposal will provide insight into the feasibility and effectiveness of trimodal prehabilitation for radical cystectomy patients and may ultimately lead to improved clinical outcomes and reduced morbidity.

COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Trimodal Prehab & ERP|OTHER: No Prehab; ERP Alone
6-minute walk test (6MWT), The 6MWT is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The distance covered over a time of 6 minutes is used as the outcome by which to compare changes in performance capacity., Multiple time-points over 20-weeks
10-meter walk test (10mWT), The 10 Metre Walk Test is a performance measure used to assess walking speed in metres per second over a short distance. It can be employed to determine functional mobility, gait, and vestibular function., Multiple time-points over 20-weeks|30s sit-to-stand test (30CST), The 30CST is a measurement that assesses functional lower extremity strength in older adults. It is part of the Fullerton Functional Fitness Test Battery. This test was developed to overcome the floor effect of the 5 or 10 repetition sit to stand test in older adults., Multiple time-points over 20-weeks|Hand-grip dynamometry, A quantitative and objective measure of isometric muscular strength of the hand and forearm, predictive of overall upper-extremity function., Multiple time-points over 20-weeks|Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Bladder Cancer (FACT-Bl)Questionnaire, A reliable and valid questionnaire that comprehensively assesses quality of life concerns pertinent to bladder cancer patients., Collected at beginning and end of 20-week participant involvement period|EuroQOL five dimensions (EQ-5D) Questionnaire, A short, generic quality of life questionnaire, Collected at beginning and end of 20-week participant involvement period|Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, A short questionnaire on self-reported physical activity., Collected at beginning and end of 20-week participant involvement period
Length of hospital stay (LOS), Length of stay in the hospital starting from post-operative day #0 and terminating when the participant is discharged from the hospital., Collected at the finale of participant-involvement (20-weeks)|30 day readmission rate, Number of participants re-admitted to hospital within 30 days of discharge as a percentage of the total number of participants involved in the study., Collected at the finale of participant-involvement (20-weeks)|Clavien-Dindo classification of Surgical Complications, A classification scheme that objectively grades surgical complications using a descriptive grading system., Collected at the finale of participant-involvement (20-weeks)
