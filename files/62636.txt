Erythropoietin for Management of Anemia Caused by Chemotherapy
This is a phase Ⅱ study of erythropoietin for management of anemia caused by chemotherapy in patients with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma. The investigators want to investigate hematopoietic response of darbepoietin alfa and the quality of life assessment of increasement of hemoglobin.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Darbepoetin alfa|DRUG: R-CHOP
Hematopoietic response, Hemoglobin level after Darbepoietin alfa administration, hemoglobin level of day 21 after Darbepoietin alfa administration
Quality of life as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scales for anemia, at baseline, Day 21 after 2th darbepoietin alfa administration, Day 21 after last darbepoietin alfa administration|Adverse events as measured by CTCAE v3.0, From the date of first drug administration to the date of the 30th days of last drug administration.|Proportion of patients requiring red blood cell transfusions, From the date of first darbepoietin alfa administration to day 21 after last darbepoietin alfa administration|Mean time to response of hemoglobin, From the date of first darbepoietin alfa administration to day 21 after last darbepoietin alfa administration
Darbepoietin alfa may cause the body to make more red blood cells. They are used to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy in patients with malignant lymphoma. Darbepoietin will be applied to R-CHOP(Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine, Prednisolone) chemotherapy every 21days ± 2days with fixed 360㎍. It will be applied to chemotherapy until increment of hemoglobin 12.0g/dL. If the hemoglobin level exceeds 12.0g/dL, administration of darbepoietin will be temporarily stopped.

And, the questionnaire of the quality of life will be conducted at the baseline, after 2th darbepoietin alfa administration, at study completion.
