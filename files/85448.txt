Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Imaging for Cervical Cancer
The investigators have developed co-registered transvaginal photoacoustic and ultrasound (US) imaging techniques that allow them to visualize ovarian tumor structure and functional changes simultaneously, which may potentially reveal early tumor angiogenesis development or residual tumors after systemic treatment that is not available by US alone. The ability to detect early angiogenesis changes, as well as tumor morphology changes using a non-invasive imaging modality will greatly enhance the care for patients. The investigators plan to explore these techniques in monitoring cervical cancer treatment response and conduct pilot feasibility studies.
Cervical Cancer|Cancer of the Cervix
DEVICE: Transvaginal probe using photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging
Number of participants who complete the imaging protocol, Approximately 18 weeks
Reduction rate of tumor angiogenesis, * The reduction rate of tumor angiogenesis of clinical responders and non-responders will be analyzed
* Responders and non-responders will be determined by standard of care PET imaging based on F18-FDG uptake, 3 months after completion of treatment, 3 months after completion of standard of care treatment (approximately 18 weeks)|Charge pattern of blood oxygen saturation, * The charge pattern of blood oxygen saturation of clinical responders and non-responders will be analyzed
* Responders and non-responders will be determined by standard of care PET imaging based on F18-FDG uptake, 3 months after completion of treatment, 3 months after completion of standard of care treatment (approximately 18 weeks)
