Laparoscopic IIeocecus-Sparing Right Hemicolectomy for Cancer of the Hepatic Flexure and Proximal Transverse Colon
To investigate whether laparoscopic ileocecus-sparing right hemicolectomy is feasible and oncologically safe
Hepatic Flexure Colon Cancer|Proximal Transverse Colon Cancer
PROCEDURE: laparoscopic ileocecus-sparing right hemicolectomy
Postoperative complications, Postoperative complications used to calculate the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) will be recorded, up to 90 days after surgery|1-year local recurrence, rate of local recurrence one year after surgery, including anastomotic recurrence, recurrence around ileocolic vessels and surgical trunk of superior mesenteric vein,, 7 days after surgery
Conversion to conventional right hemicolectomy, the rate of conversion to conventional right hemicolectomy, 1 day of surgery|Time to first flatus after surgery, days from a colectomy procedure to first occurrence of flatus during subject's postoperative recovery, up to 7 days after surgery|Number of harvested lymph nodes, Number of harvested Lymph nodes according to the pathological report, up to 1 week after surgery|R0 resection, Rate of resection without any affected margins during the surgical procedure according to the pathological report, up to 1 week after surgery|Specimen morphometry, The gross dimensions of resected specimen: length, the distal and proximal resection margins distance, vascular pedicle length, within 30 days|3-year disease free survival, the time from enrollment until disease relapse or death from any cause 3 years after surgery, 3 years
Our study is a single arm, single center clinical trial. The enrolled patients will accept laparoscopic ileocecus-sparing right hemicolectomy. The primary endpoint: postoperative complications, 1-year local recurrence. The second endpoint: conversion to conventional right hemicolectomy, time to first flatus after surgery, number of harvested lymph nodes, 3-year disease free survival, R0 resection, Specimen morphometry
