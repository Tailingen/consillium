Non-invasive Glioma Characterization Through Molecular Imaging
MRI-based sequences can provide non-invasive quantification of intratumoral 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) distribution and tumor cellularity in human gliomas and help guide the development of novel glioma therapies.

2HG Concentration via 3T MRI Scanner, 2HG concentrations as measured via 3T MRI Scanner., Day 1|2HG Concentration from tissue samples, 2HG concentrations as measured via patient's surgically excised tissue sample ex vivo by tissue based liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), Day 1
This is a pilot study aiming at developing and optimizing MRI-based sequences to provide non-invasive quantification of intratumoral 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) distribution and tumor cellularity in human gliomas and help guide the development of novel glioma therapies.
