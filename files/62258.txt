Myasthenia Gravis Registry in China
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease caused by dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction, characterized by partial or generalized skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. The estimated annual incidence rate of MG in China is 0.68/100,000, with a high rate of relapse and poor treatment compliance. This study is a prospective, observational, multi-center patient registry across China. To support standardized management and follow-up of MG patients in China, a Cloud-based MG Patient Management Platform (CN MG Base) was established in September 2023 with the support of the Chinese Rare Diseases Alliance. The platform aims to collect longitudinal clinical data including demographic information, age of onset, medical history, comorbidities, medication usage, treatment responses, and others. It is intended to collect newly registered MG cases each year and follow up with these patients at one-year intervals for ten years
Myasthenia Gravis
MSE proportion, The proportion of patients achieving minimal symptom expression (MSE, defined as reaching an ADL score of 0 or 1) after treatment., Ten years
Safety events, Safety events including upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and other infections;, Ten years|Relapse of MG symptoms, Having reached MSE for over a year but experiencing a symptom relapse, manifested as an increase in ADL score greater than or equal to 2 points., Ten years
This study is a observational nationwide multicenter MG registry research. Starting from the baseline, annual follow-ups will be conducted to prospectively collect information on treatment medications, prognosis, and safety events. The following classification definitions can be applied: ① MG clinical subtypes (ocular, early-onset generalized, thymoma-related, late-onset generalized, MuSK-related, and seronegative); ② Different treatment methods (classic immunotherapy group, B-cell-targeted therapy, complement inhibition therapy, rapid-acting therapy, and IL-6 pathway inhibitors, etc.).
