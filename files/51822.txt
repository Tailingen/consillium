Study of Brentuximab Vedotin in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to assess the antitumor efficacy of single-agent brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks, as measured by the overall objective response rate (ORR) in patients with r/r sALCL following at least 1 multiagent chemotherapy regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride \[hydroxydaunorubicin\], vincristine sulfate \[Oncovin\], and prednisone \[CHOP\] or equivalent multiagent chemotherapy regimens with curative intent).
Lymphoma
DRUG: Brentuximab vedotin
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) by Independent Review Facility (IRF) response assessment according to the International Working Group (IWG) Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma. CR is defined as the disappearance of all evidence of disease and PR is defined as regression of measurable disease and no new sites., Up to data cut-off date: 04 May 2021 (Up to approximately 7 years)
Duration of Response (DOR) as Per IRF, DOR was defined as the time between initial response and documented tumor progression in the subset of participants who achieved an objective response, either CR or PR. DOR per IRF was based upon the radiological assessment of measured lesions from an independent review facility. DOR was censored on the date of the last disease assessment documenting absence of progressive disease (PD) for participants who were lost to follow-up, withdrew consent, started a new anticancer therapy other than SCT, or discontinued treatment due to undocumented PD after the last adequate disease assessment., Until disease progression, death, or the data cut-off date: 4 May 2021 (Up to approximately 7 years)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Per IRF, PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first. PFS per IRF is based upon the radiological assessment from an independent review facility., Until disease progression, death, or the data cut-off date: 4 May 2021 (Up to approximately 7 years)|Complete Remission Rate (CRR), CRR is defined as percentage of participants with CR. CR is defined as the disappearance of all evidence of disease., Until disease progression, death, or the data cut-off date: 4 May 2021 (Up to approximately 7 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause., Until death or the data cut-off date: 4 May 2021 (Up to approximately 7 years)|Percentage of Participants Receiving Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) Following Treatment With Brentuximab Vedotin, Until disease progression, death, or the data cut-off date: 4 May 2021 (Up to approximately 7 years)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events, Related Adverse Events and Adverse Events by Severity (Grade 3 or Higher), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a medically important event., From first dose up to 30 days post last dose of study drug (Up to approximately 17 months)|Concentration of Serum Antibody-drug Conjugate (ADC) at the End of Infusion, Cycle 1, Day 1 and Cycle 3, Day 1 at the end of infusion|Concentration of Serum Total Antibody (TAb) Conjugate Plus Free Total Antibody, Cycle 1, Day 1 and Cycle 3, Day 1 at the end of infusion|Maximum Concentration for Unconjugated Drug- Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE), Cycle 1, Day 1 and Cycle 3, Day 1 at the end of infusion|Percentage of Participants With Presence of Anti-Therapeutic Antibodies (ATA) and Neutralizing Antidrug Antibody (Nab) to Brentuximab Vedotin, Up to 16 cycles (each cycle = 21 days)
