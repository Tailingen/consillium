Impact of Ribociclib on Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer
A window of opportunity study which would allow brief treatment of HPV negative SCCHN with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, in the pre-operative setting, with biomarker analyses of pre and post treatment tissue. Given that the standard treatment for this population is surgical resection, this would not impact or alter standard therapy for this population. The goal will be to learn more about the alterations in pRB1 levels, as well as other signaling markers, in order to be able to eventually plan a biomarker driven treatment study.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck
DRUG: Ribociclib
Treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, Ribociclib, decreases pRB1 levels in patients with SCCHN of the oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx., pre-treatment to post-treatment changes in pRB1 expression levels will be measured, 1-2 months
Change in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of Ki67 in tissue samples from patients, 2-3 months|Change in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of ERK1/2 in tissue samples from patients, 2-3 months|Change in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of phosphorylated-ERK1/2 in tissue samples from patients, 2-3 months|Change in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of p16 in tissue samples from patients, 2-3 months
