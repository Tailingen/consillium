A Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of HB0028 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
It is a phase I/II open label, multicenter study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of HB0028 in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumor|Cervical Cancer
DRUG: HB0028
Safety and tolerability, Number of participants with a Dose Limiting Toxicity(DLT)\[Time Frame:During the first days\]DLTs will be assessed during the first 21 days of treatment for dose-escalation phase and are defined as toxicities that meet pre-defined severity criteria,and assessed as having a suspected or definite relationship to study drug., Up to 12 Months|Maximun Tolerated Dose(MTD), MTD or Optimal Biological Dose(OBD) and/or RP2D., Up to 24 Months
AUC, AUC Area Under concentration-time Curve (AUC), Up to 24 Months|Cmax, Maximum serum concentration(Cmax), Up to 24 Months|Tmax, Half-life time of maximum concentration, Up to 24 Months|ORR, Overall response rate(ORR) as measured by RECIST v1.1., Up to 24 Months
Percentage of the lymphocyte subpopulations., The percentage of lymphocyte subpopulations of the peripheral blood will be assessed by flow cytometry., Up to 24 Months|Programmed death ligand 1(PDL1) expression level, The expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemical method., Up to 24 Months|Tubuloglomerular Feedback(TGF-β), Levels of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3 in plasma, Up to 24 Months
This is a phase I/II, multicenter, open-label, first-in-human study in patients with advanced solid tumors. During the phase I study, the safety and tolerability of HB0028 will be evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors. In the phase II study, the safety and efficacy of HB0028 at the RP2D will be evaluated in cohorts of patients with specific solid tumors.
