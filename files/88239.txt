Study of TU2218 in Combination With KEYTRUDA®(Pembrolizumab) in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study consists of phase 1b and 2a to evaluate safety, Pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of TU2218 in combination with Pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.
Solid Tumor|Biliary Tract Cancer|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: TU2218 + KEYTRUDA® (Pembrolizumab)
Phase 1b: To determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose of the Combination (RP2DC) of TU2218 given with Pembrolizumab in selected advanced solid tumors, At least 1 Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during Cycle1, During the first 21-day period (Cycle 1)|Phase 2a: To evaluate the efficacy of TU2218 by evaluating the Overall Response rate (ORR) of TU2218 administered in combination with Pembrolizumab in selected advanced solid tumors, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR) according to RECIST v1.1 Efficacy analyses will be performed on both PP and ITT Efficacy Analysis Sets., 24 weeks
Phase 1b and 2a: To further evaluate the safety and tolerability of TU2218 administered in combination with pembrolizumab., Incidence and severity of TEAEs, Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAE), Treatment Related Adverse Events (TRAE), and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)., approximately 13 months|Phase 1b and 2a: The PK of TU2218 administered in combination with pembrolizumab, TU2218 plasma concentration, Cycle 1 (each cycle is 21 days)|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the date of first documented PD., over 24 weeks|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration between first documentation of CR or PR to first documentation of PD or death., over 24 weeks|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD), over 24 weeks|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the proportion of participants with response or stabilization, over 24 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), OS time is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of death due to any cause., OS rate at 6 months = up to 24 weeks
The primary objective of phase 1b is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose of the combination (RP2DC) of TU2218 given with pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors.

The primary objective of phase 2a is to evaluate the efficacy of TU2218 administered in combination with pembrolizumab in selected advanced tumors.
