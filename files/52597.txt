Recombinant Human Thyroid Stimulating Hormone for Radioiodine 131I Treatment
Subjects: patients with postoperative local recurrent or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer .

Experimental group: Recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone injection: 0.9mg/1.0mL/piece; intramuscular injection; once a day for two consecutive days. Control group: Thyroid hormone withdraw for 4-6 weeks.

The two groups were treated with radioiodine 131I after plasma thyroid stimulating hormone elevated (\>30mU/L). The efficacy and adverse reactions were observed.
