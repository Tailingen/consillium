Feasibility Study of a 4 Stage Bowel Obstruction Cancer Diet
Bowel obstruction is a common complication in patients with ovarian, peritoneal and bowel cancer due to a mass or spread of disease, causing narrowing to the gut, as these cancers can grow on the bowel surface. Certain foods may lead to symptoms such as pain, bloating, feeling full, feeling sick, vomiting and difficulty passing a bowel motion.

There is limited evidence to establish the best diet to follow when someone is diagnosed with the risk of bowel obstruction and is experiencing symptoms after eating and drinking.

The Dietitians at the Royal Surrey have developed a 4 stage bowel obstruction diet which they have been using with patients for 3 years. The 4 stages are clear fluids, all thin liquids, low fibre soft smooth diet, low fibre soft sloppy diet. Depending on the severity of symptoms and the risk of a blockage, patients are asked to follow a certain stage of the diet. They are advised to move up and down the stages as symptoms improve or get worse.

This feasibility study aims to investigate if the diet can be used and is effective in clinical practice. The objectives are to see if this diet is easy to follow, can reduce symptoms of bowel obstruction, can improve quality of life, and reduce admissions to hospital because of bowel blockages.

Patients at risk of bowel obstruction from colorectal or ovarian cancer are eligible to participate. They will remain in the study for a period of 4 weeks, during which time they will be asked to complete a diet diary and 3 questionnaires.

OTHER: Dietary intervention
Symptoms of sub-acute bowel obstruction: abdominal pain, feeling bloated, feeling full-up quickly, nausea and / or vomiting, Measured by completion of the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale questionnaire (MSAS): a well-validated questionnaire, which asks about the frequency, severity and psychological effect of 32 symptoms. For the purpose of this study, the MSAS has been adapted to include the key additional symptom of early satiety (feeling full up quickly) that can be experienced by patients with sub-acute bowel obstruction. It is graded on a scale of 0 (not at all) - 4 (very much)., 4 weeks
A&E attendances or hospital admissions after starting to use the 4 stage diet, No of hospital admissions and A\&E attendances due to bowel obstruction in the 3 months prior to consent will be recorded. This will be compared with the number of admissions during the 4 weeks patients are on the trial., 4 weeks|Health related Quality of Life, Measured by using the EORTC Quality of Life QLQ-C30 questionnaire will be collected at baseline on entry to the study and after 4 weeks on completion of the study. QLQ-C30 developed by EORTC is designed to measure cancer patients' physical, psychological and social functions. It is scored on a scale from 0 (not at all) - 4 (very much)., 4 weeks|Weight, Measured in kilograms and as a percentage indicating percentage weight change from start to end of the trial. Participants will be weighed on consent and after 4 weeks., 4 weeks
