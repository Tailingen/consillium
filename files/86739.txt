NOV120101 (Poziotinib) for 1st Line Monotherapy in Patients With Lung Adenocarcinoma
The purpose of this open-label, single-arm, multi-center phase II trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of novel pan-HER inhibitor, NOV120101 (Poziotinib), as a first-line monotherapeutic agent in patients with lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutation.
Adenocarcinoma of Lung Stage IIIB|Adenocarcinoma of Lung Stage IV
DRUG: NOV120101 (Poziotinib)
Objective response rate (ORR), the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and/or partial response (PR), about 3 years
Progression free survival (PFS) rate at 12 months, the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and/or partial response (PR) at 12 months following start of study drug administration., 12 months after enrollment of the last subject|Disease control rate (DCR), the proportion of patients with CR, PR and/or stable disease (SD), 3 years|Progression free survival (PFS), The length of time during and after medication or treatment during which the disease being treated (usually cnacer) does not get worse., 3 years|Overall survival (OS), the time from study drug administration until death from any cause, 3 years|Change of quality of life (QoL) measured by EQ-5D questionnaire, Change means the end of treatment minus baseline in each patient, 3 years
Population pharmacokinetics (PK) of NOV120101 (Poziotinib), to observe pharmacokinetic parameter, inter-individual variability and intra-individual variability considering covariates, demographic factors, influencing PK profile., 3 months after enrollment of the last subject|Subgroup analyses according to the genetic information, to observe HGF expression status in plasma and T790M mutation induction status from plasma DNA, 3 years
EGFR TKIs are known as more effective and less toxic medications against EGFR mutated tumors. However, newly acquired resistance to these inhibitors is the inevitable obstacle in continuous treatment with them. To overcome this problem, many new class of TKIs including NOV120101 (Poziotinib) are developing these days. To evaluate the efficacy of NOV120101 (Poziotinib) as a first-line monotherapeutic medication, chemotherapy-na√Øve patients will participate in this study. Subjects will receive NOV120101 (Poziotinib) 12 mg PO once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity development. Objective response rate (ORR) will be analyzed as the primary endpoint in this trial. Secondary endpoints including PFS rate at 12 months, DCR, PFS, and OS will also be analyzed.
