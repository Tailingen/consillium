Exploration the Effect of Walking Program in Patients With Colorectal Cancer
The aims of this four-year study are to

1. explore the relationships between fatigue and muscle strength (i.e., upper limbs and lower legs)
2. comparison with the effects of 8-week, 12-week moderate intensity of walking program on muscle strength and fatigue.
3. develop a clinical guidelines of home-based walking program for patients with colorectal cancer receiving active treatment and survivors in Taiwan.
4. explore the relationships among the self-report fatigue intensity and metabolism.
