PD-1 Antibody SHR-1210 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, phase 2 trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The primary objective is to assess ORR of SHR-1210 in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Hodgkin Lymphoma, Adult
DRUG: SHR-1210
ORR Assess by IRC, rate of subjects achieved complete response plus partial response in all evaluable subjects (Response was assessed with CT and PET using 2014 Lugano Criteria for Malignant Lymphomas, CR is disappearance of all tumor lesions, PR is over 50% decrease of the sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters from baseline ;overall response:PR+CR), CT was conducted at baseline, at weeks 9, 17, 25, 37, 49, 65, 81, and 97, and then every 26 weeks; PET was conducted at baseline, weeks 17 and 25. ORR of 36 weeks based on CT and PET were reported.
DoR Assess by IRC, Duration of Response (Response was assessed with CT and PET using 2014 Lugano Criteria for Malignant Lymphomas, disease progression is over 50% increase of an product of perpendicular diameters of any target lesion from nadir with any diameter increased over 0.5cm for lesions \<=2cm or increased by 1cm for lesions \>2cm，or appearance of new lesions, or progression of non-target lesion ), CT was conducted at baseline, at weeks 9, 17, 25, 37, 49, 65, 81, and 97, and then every 26 weeks; PET was conducted at baseline, weeks 17 and 25. DoR of 36 weeks based on CT and PET were reported.|PFS Assess by IRC, Progression-free Survival (Response was assessed with CT and PET using 2014 Lugano Criteria for Malignant Lymphomas, disease progression is over 50% increase of an product of perpendicular diameters of any target lesion from nadir with any diameter increased over 0.5cm for lesions \<=2cm or increased by 1cm for lesions \>2cm，or appearance of new lesions, or progression of non-target lesion ), Up to 3 years|TTR Assess by IRC, Time to response (Response was assessed with CT and PET using 2014 Lugano Criteria for Malignant Lymphomas, CR is disappearance of all tumor lesions, PR is over 50% decrease of the sum of the product of the perpendicular diameters from baseline ;overall response:PR+CR), CT was conducted at baseline, at weeks 9, 17, 25, 37, 49, 65, 81, and 97, and then every 26 weeks; PET was conducted at baseline, weeks 17 and 25.|OS, Overall Survival, Up to 3 years|Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AE), Up to 3 years
The primary objective of this phase 2 study is to assess objective response rate of SHR-1210 in patients with relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. The secondary objective is to observe the duration of response, progression free survival, time to response, overall survival and safety of SHR-1210 in relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma. Pharmacokinetic index is also investigated in 12 patients.
