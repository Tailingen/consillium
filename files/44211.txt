The Level of Patient Participation in Lung and Esophageal Cancer Patients Treated With Definitive Radiochemotherapy.
This study aims to assess the level of participation of thoracic cancer patients undergoing definitive radiotherapy and chemotherapy ± immunotherapy in their medical processes and the association between the level of participation and patients' side effects, quality of life, and long-term survival. Additionally, this study will rate the level of participation from both the patients' and medical staff's perspectives and will compare the differences in ratings from these two viewpoints, as well as their impact on treatment outcomes.
