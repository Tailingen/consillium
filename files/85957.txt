Axitinib Plus Toripalimab as Second-line Treatment in Hepatobiliary Malignant Tumors
The investigators design a phase II clinical study to explore the efficacy and safety of axitinib plus toripalimab as a second-line treatment in patients with hepatobiliary malignant tumors and to analyze potential biomarkers of therapeutic response.

DRUG: axitinib plus toripalimab
objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients whose tumor volume has reached a predetermined value and can maintain a minimum time limit, including complete response and partial response patients., one year|Progression-free Survival (PFS), A duration from the date of initial treatment with axitinib plus toripalimab to disease progression (defined by RECIST 1.1) or death of any cause., six months
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of patients whose tumor volume control (reduced or enlarged) reaches a predetermined value and can maintain a minimum time limit., one year|Overall Survival (OS), Duration from the date of initial treatment with axitinib plus toripalimab to the date of death due to any cause., two years|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration from the first time reported partial response or complete response to the first time of disease progression or death., one year|Stable Disease (SD), Proportion of patients with stable disease status more than 4 months., one year|Progression free survival rate, Portion of patients who do not experience disease progression (defined by RECIST 1.1) or death of any cause after treated with axitinib plus toripalimab for 3 months and 6 months, respectively., six months|Rate of 6-months and 1-year overall survival, Portion of patients who die of any cause after treated with axitinib plus toripalimab for 6 months and 12 months, respectively., one year
Any adverse events related with treatment with axitinib plus toripalimab., Safety and tolerability of the treatment, one year|PD-L1 expression, PD-L1 expression in tumor tissues., six months|Tumor mutation burden, Tumor mutation burden assessed by whole exome sequencing., six months
This phase II trial is a single-arm, non-randomized and single-center clinical study.

It is estimated that 60 patients who met the study criteria will be enrolled in PUMCH and treated with axitinib plus toripalimab. The investigators will follow up and collect subjects' data each month to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment, including overall survival and time to progression, until disease progression or death. Histopathology and multi-omics data analysis will be used to explore potential biomarkers of treatment response.

Study Type: Interventional. Masking: Open Label.
