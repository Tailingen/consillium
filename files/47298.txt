Enhanced Pain Coping in Cancer (EPIC): A Study of Managing Treatment-Related Joint Pain in Breast Cancer Survivors
The researchers are doing this study to compare two different types of group therapy and find out whether they are effective approaches for helping breast cancer survivors manage joint pain caused by aromatase inhibitors (AI). This type of joint pain is called AI-associated arthralgia, or AIA, and it is common in people taking AIs. AIA and its associated symptoms can make some people decide to stop taking their medication. The study will look at the effects of two different types of group therapy on participants' cancer-related symptoms (such as pain, fatigue, and anxiety), their ability to continue taking AIs on a regular schedule, and their quality of life. We will measure participants' quality of life by having them fill out questionnaires.

Both groups will have 2-hour group therapy sessions once a week, over the course of 8 weeks. During the sessions, you will be in a group of 6-10 participants, who may be a mixture of patients from both MSK and University of California San Diego (UCSD).

Pain Interference, Pain interference will be assessed using the 7-item Pain Interference subscale from the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF). Each item is rated on a scale from 0 ("does not interfere") to 10 ("completely interferes"), with higher scores indicating worse interference. The BPI is a widely used, reliable, valid, and responsive tool for measuring pain (Cronbach's Î± 0.77-0.91). The Pain Interference subscale will be administered at baseline, weekly during the 8-week intervention, and at weeks 12 and 24. Completing the survey requires approximately 1 minute., up to 24 weeks
Pain Severity, Pain Severity will be assessed using the 4-item Pain Severity subscale from the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF). Each item is rated on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine), with higher scores indicating worse pain. Pain Severity will be administered at baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24. Completing the survey requires approximately 1 minute., baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24|Pain Catastrophizing, Pain Catastrophizing will be assessed using a 13-item Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) measuring the negative cognitive-emotional response to pain. Patients rate the degree to which they experience thoughts and feelings that may be associated with pain on a 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time) scale. The PCS yields a total score and three subscales scores assessing rumination, magnification, and helplessness. It will be administered at baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24. Completing the survey requires approximately 4 minutes., baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24|Patient Global Impression of Change, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) will be assessed on a one-item scale assessing a clinically important change from the patient's perspective. Patients respond to "How would you describe your pain since you began the treatment?" on a 7-point scale ranging from "very much worse" to "very much improved." Subjects reporting "much improved" and "very much improved" will be classified as responders. The PGI-C will be administered at week 8, week 12, and week 24. Completing the survey requires approximately 1 minute., week 8, week 12, and week 24|Anxiety/Depression, Anxiety and Depression will be assessed on a 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessing anxiety (7 items) and depression (7 items) on a 4-point scale (0-3).

The HADS will be administered at baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24. Completing the survey requires approximately 4 minutes., baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24|Insomnia, Insomnia severity will be assessed on a 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) measuring subjective insomnia severity on a 0-4 scale, with higher scores indicating more severe insomnia symptoms. Established cutoffs classify ISI as "no clinically significant insomnia (\< 8,), "subthreshold insomnia (8-14)", "clinical insomnia (moderate severity; 15-21)", and "clinical insomnia (severe, \> 21)". It will be administered at baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24. Completing the survey requires approximately 2 minutes., baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24|Fatigue, Fatigue will be assessed on a 9-item Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) instrument assessing fatigue severity (3 items) at its "worst," "usual," and "now" during normal waking hours and amount that fatigue has interfered (6 items) with different aspects of the patient's life during the past 24 hours. Responses are measured on a 0-10 scale. Higher scores indicate worse fatigue and interference. It will be administered at baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24. Completing the survey requires approximately 3 minutes., baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24|Global Health, Global Health will be assessed using a 10-item PROMIS Global Health Scale (PROMIS-GHS) survey assessing health-related quality of life, including physical, mental, social, and overall health.

Each item is rated on a 0 (not at all) to 4 (completely) scale. Ratings from all items are added together to create a PAAS total score, ranging from 0 to 32. Higher scores indicate more intense perceptions of arthralgia-associated aging. It will be administered at baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24. Completing the survey requires approximately 2 minutes., baseline, week 8, week 12, and week 24|Pleasant and painful sensations in the body, Pleasant and painful sensations in the body will be measured on Sensation Manikin 2.0 (SM 2.0) - a digital, front- and back-facing human figure silhouette overlaid with a grid of 469 "sensation" pixels where patients can report the distribution of pleasant and painful sensations in the body. SM 2.0 provides three scores: 1) unpleasant sensation score representing the total body area experienced as unpleasant; 2) pleasant sensation score, representing the total body area experienced as pleasant; and 3) a sensation ratio score.
