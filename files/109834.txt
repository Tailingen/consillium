Long-term Efficacy of Ablative Fractional Laser-assisted Photodynamic Therapy for Treatment of Lower Extremity Bowen's Disease
Er:YAG ablative fractional laser-assisted methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (AFL-PDT) has shown significantly higher efficacy and a lower recurrence rate at 12 months than methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) for treatment of Bowen's disease (BD). However, long-term follow up data are not available.
Bowen's Disease
DRUG: lidocaine-prilocaine 5% cream application|DEVICE: 2940-nm Er:YAG AFL pretreatment|DRUG: methyl-aminolevulinate application|DEVICE: Illuminating using red light-emitting diode lamps
Difference of short-term complete response (CR) rate between AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT, The response was classified as either complete response (complete disappearance of the lesion) or incomplete response (incomplete disappearance of the lesion), Short-term CR rate was evaluated at 3 months|Difference of long-term complete response (CR) rate between AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT, The response was classified as either complete response (complete disappearance of the lesion) or incomplete response (incomplete disappearance of the lesion), Long-term CR rate was evaluated at 60 months|Difference of long-term recurrence rate between AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT at 60 months, In all cases of complete response, the patients were reviewed at 60 months to check for recurrence. Post-therapy punch biopsies were performed when there was doubt concerning incomplete-response and clinical recurrence, Recurrent rate was evaluated at 60 months
Difference of the cosmetic outcome between AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT, The overall cosmetic outcome was assessed by each investigator for all lesions that achieved complete response at 60 months, and was graded using a 4-point scale: excellent (only slight occurrence of redness or change in pigmentation), good (moderate redness or change in pigmentation), fair (slight to moderate scarring, atrophy, or induration), or poor (extensive scarring, atrophy, or induration), Cosmetic outcome was assessed by each investigator for all lesions that achieved a complete response at 60 months
Differences of Adverse events(erythema, burning sensation, swelling, bleeding) between AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT, Adverse events reported by the patients were noted at each follow-up visit, including severity, duration, and need for additional therapy. All events due to PDT were described as phototoxic reactions(e.g erythema, burning sensation, swelling, bleeding), Within 60 months after each treatment
