Indocyanine Green-guided Lymphadenectomy in Laparoscopic Total Mesorectal Excision for Low Rectal Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy
The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the number of harvested locoregional lymph nodes in rectal cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic total mesorectal excision and indocyanine green (ICG)-guided lymphoadenectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does the use of ICG increase the total number of harvested lymph nodes?
* Does the use of ICG increase the number of harvested extra-mesorectal lymph nodes?

Participants will intraoperatively receive a trans-anal administration of ICG near to rectal cancer; during laparoscopic surgery, ICG-fluorescent nodes beyond the mesorectum will be separately excised and sent for pathology. A comparison will be performed with a recent cohort of patients affected by rectal cancer treated with standard surgery without the use of ICG.
