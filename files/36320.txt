Genetic Alteration After Systemic Treatment in Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of systemic treatments on genomic profiles in patients with breast cancer and to compare genomic profiling between premenopausal and postmenopausal women by systemic treatments in breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
Genomic profiling will be assessed by tissue sampling and blood., Tissue and blood will be tested for CancerSCAN, cfDNA, WES, WTS, FACS, cytokine and immunologic signature analysis platform.NAC to study the multiscale relationships among DCE-MRI features, NGS data, and pathologic response to NAC and to evaluate the role of radiogenomics in predicting pathologic response of the patients., 2year
Prospective single arm trial using three patients' cohorts. One-hundred patients for each cohort and a total of 300 patients (600 biopsy samples) will be entered to this trial.

The hypothesis is that genomic alterations measured by CancerSCAN and cfDNA, Whole exome sequencing (WES), Whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS), FACS(Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting), cytokine and immunologic signature analysis would be different between pre- and post-menopausal women and would be predictive biomarkers for each cohort according to pre- and post-menopausal status. Three groups of patients will be recruited:

1. The patients who receive neoadjuvant systemic treatments:
2. The patients who have distant metastatic sites at first and recur from surgery:
3. The patients who are going to receive first-line chemotherapy
