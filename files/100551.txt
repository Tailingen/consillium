Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin, PD-1 in Treating Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
Despite primary surgical management of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with radical cystectomy and pelvic lymphnode dissection, up to 50% of patients will eventually develop tumours at distant sites, owing to pre-existing disseminated occult micrometastases. The first line treatment for relapse or metastatic MIBC is gemcitabine and cisplatin. After the failure of first line treatment, second line chemotherapy drugs can be chosen from doxorubicin, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etc. This non-randomized, prospective study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin and PD-1 in second line treatment of MIBC.
