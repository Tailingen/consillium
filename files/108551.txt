Health Course of Patients Undergoing Per os Anti-cancer Therapy.
During the last few years, the medical care of oncohematologic cancers diagnosed patients was shaken by the arrival of new therapies : targeted therapies. Very efficient, these therapies use the oral pathway in most cases, and are taken at home. These treatments show plenty of drug interactions and side effects aren't rare and require, in their own, a rigorous follow up in order to reduce their occurrence, intensity and their impact on patients' quality of life. A bad management of the treatment could lead to an inacceptable toxicity, or to its premature interruption.

With all the new administration and follow up strains in mind, we want to elaborate the medical pathway structure for these patients by reinforcing the nurse coordination and by integrating another healthcare professional : the hospital pharmacist, which is a professional especially implicated in the drug delivery, the control of drug interactions and medical advices relative to the given drug.

Private healthcare professionals (referring physicians, pharmacists, private nurses), unsufficiently trained and informed about these new treatments and their side effects, are asking for further information concerning the drugs prescribed to their patients, and are willing to keep open a communication line for the home follow up.

These patients, who are autonomously taking their medication, are in need to be informed and supported to insure the good management of the drug, while taking in account their environment, their knowledge of their cancer and treatment and also of all the issues that could occur during their therapy, in order to resolve them.

We propose a multidisciplinary medical care taking place at the very beginning of an oral therapy treatment, in order to ensure the security of the drug administration. Patients and healthcare professionals will be closely followed during the first two treatment cycles. After this, side-effects incidence are less frequent and the usual oncohematologic follow up is sufficient.

One treatment cycle = 4 weeks, except for Sutent treatment : 1 cycle = 6 weeks|Number of private healthcare professionals visit, At the end of the 2nd cycle. One treatment cycle = 4 weeks, except for Sutent treatment : 1 cycle = 6 weeks|Number of private healthcare professionals' phone call to the hospital, At the end of the 2nd cycle. One treatment cycle = 4 weeks, except for Sutent treatment : 1 cycle = 6 weeks|Description of the exchange of information between the hospital and independent health professionals, - Evaluation of the utilization of "patients-files": Patients will be asked whether they make use of their "patient-files" and whether they share them with their healthcare professionals, if needed. (YES/NO), Day 1 of the 1st and 2nd treatment cycles. One treatment cycle = 4 weeks, except for Sutent treatment : 1 cycle = 6 weeks|Description of the patient's independence in regard of his treatment and pathology, - Number of patient's phone call to the hospital, At the end of the 2nd cycle. One treatment cycle = 4 weeks, except for Sutent treatment : 1 cycle = 6 weeks|Evaluation of patient's satisfaction in regard of MinOS protocol, - Satisfaction survey answered by patients, At the end of the patient's therapy within MinOS framework (end of cycle 2). One treatment cycle = 4 weeks, except for Sutent treatment : 1 cycle = 6 weeks|Evaluation of private healthcare professionals' satisfaction in regard of MinOS protocol, - Satisfaction survey answered by private healthcare professionals, At the end of the patient's therapy within MinOS framework (end of cycle 2). One treatment cycle = 4 weeks, except for Sutent treatment : 1 cycle = 6 weeks|Evaluation of the quality of life for patients recruited in MinOS protocol, - Score of QLQ-C30 questionnaire, Day 1 of 1st, 2nd and 3rd cycle of treatment. One treatment cycle = 4 weeks, except for Sutent treatment: 1 cycle = 6 weeks|Number of concomitant drug prescription modification by the hospital pharmacist due to drug interactions with the cancer treatment, - A high number of prescription modification will mean an important part played by the hospital pharmacist, whereas a low number of modification will mean that adding a hospital pharmacist consultation to the standard care isn't relevant., At the end of the 2nd cycle.
