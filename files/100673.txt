Prognostic Role of Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography Parameters in Stage I Lung Adenocarcinoma
The clinical and derived data from the preoperative computed axial tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) of patients with pathological stage I pulmonary adenocarcinoma will be analyzed retrospectively, classified according to the current pathological classification IASLC / ATS / ERS of pulmonary adenocarcinoma, subjected to surgical treatment in our Operating Unit between August 2006 and July 2011. A follow-up will be performed on the patients enrolled in the study up to the date of death, and in any case no later than October 31, 2019
Stage I Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma
Stratification of stage I adenocarcinoma patients, using clinical data derived from preoperative CT and PET, classify patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma in stage I (retrospective cases) based on the current pathological classification IASLC / ATS / ERS of pulmonary adenocarcinoma using clinical data and derived from preoperative CT and PET, 12 months
