Synergism of Immunomodulation and Tumor Ablation
This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center early phase II study. This proof of concept study will investigate whether the combined use of local tumor ablation/radiation plus immunomodulating drugs may induce a significant immune response in patient with incurable liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) (+/- limited extrahepatic disease) being stable or in partial remission after completion of 4-6 months first line systemic therapy.

The primary objective of the study is to show an overall response rate of lesions not treated by ablation/radiotherapy including the extrahepatic lesions (according to iRECIST criteria) higher than 10%. With the continuation of first line systemic treatment, no further responses are expected.

Secondary objectives are:

* To establish the feasibility and safety of the combined treatment modalities;
* To study the impact of the local technique (RFA/Radiotherapy) on the results;
* To investigate biomarkers to predict response to the combined treatment
Colorectal Cancer|Liver Metastases
DRUG: Durvalumab (MEDI4736)|DRUG: Tremelimumab|RADIATION: Sterotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)|OTHER: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
Best overall immune response rate (iBOR) of lesions not treated by ablation/radiotherapy including the extrahepatic lesions according to iRECIST (with response confirmation), The statistical design is based on the assumption that the continuation of first line systemic treatment would result in nearly no further response translating into a response rate of 0 to 5% at maximum in the enrolled patient's population. A response rate of 10% in the experimental arm (local treatment + immunotherapy) will be judged too low to justify this combined approach. On the contrary, a response rate of 25% will be judged very promising. An optimal Simon's two-stage design will be used for the rejection of a 10% or less iBOR rate, 36 months from first patient in
