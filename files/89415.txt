Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Versus Surgery Alone in Patients With High-Grade UTUC
The purpose of this study is to see if getting chemotherapy with Gemcitabine and Cisplatin (GC) for 2-4 cycles can help shrink the tumor before undergoing surgery and improves the overall survival for high-grade upper tract urothelial carcinoma.
