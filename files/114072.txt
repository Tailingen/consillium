FLYSYN in MRD Positive AML
This is a first in human, prospective, multicentric, nonrandomized, open-label study to investigate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of the Fc-optimized antibody FLYSYN as monotherapy in adult subjects.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: FLYSYN
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) (CTCAE V 4.03), until 28 days (i.e. Visit7, day 29) after last dosing
Incidence and severity of adverse events (AE) (CTCAE V 4.03), until 180 days (i.e.Visit 11, day 180) after last dosing|Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, Visit 1 to 13|Immunogenicity of FLYSYN based on both absolute (number and percentage of subjects who develop HAMA/HAHA) and semi-quantitative (HAMA/HAHA titer determination of confirmed positive samples) assessments, BSL; Visits 5-7;9-13|Absolute and percent change from baseline in measurements of B, T, and NK cell populations and activation, For evaluation of the status of the immune system, B, T, and NK cells will be measured frequently throughout the study (immune status). The percentage and absolute numbers as well as the absolute and percent changes from baseline of NK cells will be evaluated (determination of absolute NK cell numbers). If feasible, CD16 and CD69 expression on NK cells will be evaluated at baseline and after antibody exposition (NK cell activation). Pending sample availability, endogenous antibody titers (e.g., tetanus titers) will be measured from remaining PK back-up samples in order to gain information about the influence of FLYSYN treatment on normal plasma cells and immunity., Visits 1;3;4;5;9|Change in cytokines from baseline, Visits 1-3;5 +6|Overall response rate, defined as MRD negativity or reduction of at least one log step,, BSL; Visits1;4-13|Duration of response, time to MRD progression (log step), time to relapse, BSL; Visits1;4-13|Absolute change from baseline in overall quality of life scores (EORTC QLQ C-30), Visit 1, Visit 6,Visit 9,Visit 10, Visit 11, Visit 12, Visit 13
