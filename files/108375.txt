Comparison of Billroth-I and Roux-en-Y Reconstruction After Distal Subtotal Gastrectomy
The purpose of this trial is to compare the degree of reflux, operative outcomes and quality of life between Roux en Y and Billroth-I reconstructions after distal subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer
Gastrectomy
PROCEDURE: Billroth-I|PROCEDURE: Roux en Y
Reflux of bile content, We estimate the degree of reflux by gastrofiberscopic findings using reflux score suggested by Romaganoli. In addition, histological finding of remnant stomach by endoscopic biopsy is also investigated. Reflux symptom is surveyed by Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale., 6 months after surgery
Quality of Life, We investigate the quality of life with EORTC-C30, EORTC-STO22 questionnaire suggested by European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)., 6 months after surgery|Morbidity, We investigate the occurrence of complication during recovery after surgery., 2 month after surgery|Anastomotic time, We estimate anastomosis time, Day 1|Nutritional state, We estimate Albumin, transferrin, lymphocyte, body weight, 6 month after surgery|Mortality, We investigate the occurrence of operation-related death during recovery after surgery., 2 month after operation|Operation time, We estimate total operation time., Day 1
Most common procedure for the resection of gastric cancers located in middle or lower stomach is distal subtotal gastrectomy. However, the optimal reconstruction procedure after that has still not to be established. Although B-I reconstruction is most common method due to the safety and simplicity, the duodenal fluid may reflux into the remnant stomach which may contribute to the mucosal injury to remnant stomach and esophagus. Roux en Y reconstruction may reduce the reflux to remnant stomach due to the length of Roux en Y limb, although it is more complicated procedure.

Therefore, we plan to collect 120 patients to compare the degree of reflux between Roux en Y and Billroth-I reconstructions after distal subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. In addition, we compare the surgical outcome and quality of life between two groups.
