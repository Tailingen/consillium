Silibinin in Association With Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy and Maintenance Temozolomide in STAT3 Positive IDH Wild-type, Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients
Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial.

Patients affected by STAT3 positive newly diagnosed glioblastoma will be eligible. Patients are randomized using a stratified block randomization method with a 1:1 ratio in two arms:

• Experimental/Control arm: Concomitant radiotherapy (60 gy in 30 fractions) + temozolomide 75mg/mq + silibinin/placebo 2 sachets/day dissolved in water throughout concomitant treatment followed by temozolomide cp, 150 mg/m2-200mg/m2, g1-5 q28d + silibinin/placebo 2 sachets/day dissolved in water, day 1-28, q28d for 6-12 cycles. Silibinin/Placebo may be continued until disease progression at the discretion of the physician.

Patients will be stratified based on:

* Type of surgery (complete Vs partial)
* MGMT methylation status (methylated Vs non-methylated)
* ECOG PS (0-1 Vs 2)
Glioblastoma|IDH Wild-type and STAT3-positive Glioblastoma
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Silibinin as STAT3 inhibitor|OTHER: Placebo
Primary Objective and endpoint, Evaluation of Progression Free Survival (PFS) in patients with newly diagnosed IDH wild-type and STAT3-positive glioblastoma using silibinin 2 sachets per day (1g/day), during chemoradiotherapy and maintenance treatment with temozolomide, compared with placebo. The progression free survival (PFS) will be determined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression determined using RANO 2.0 criteria or to the date of death, whichever occurs first. Patients without a PFS event at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last assessment., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
Secondary Objective and endpoint, Evaluation of liver toxicity. Assessment of liver toxicity will be derived from the assay of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) weekly during concomitant radio-chemotherapy treatment and monthly during maintenance temozolomide treatment, using the CTCAE v5.0 system to determine the degree of toxicity, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Secondary Objective and endpoint, Evaluation of liver toxicity. Assessment of liver toxicity will be derived from the assay of total and direct blood bilirubin weekly during concomitant radio-chemotherapy treatment and monthly during maintenance temozolomide treatment, using the CTCAE v5.0 system to determine the degree of toxicity, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Secondary Objective and endpoint, Evaluation of liver toxicity. Assessment of liver toxicity will be derived from the assay of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) weekly during concomitant radio-chemotherapy treatment and monthly during maintenance temozolomide treatment, using the CTCAE v5.0 system to determine the degree of toxicity, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Secondary Objective and endpoint, Evaluation of 6/9-months Progression Free Survival (6/9m-PFS). The progression free survival at 6/9 months (6/9m-PFS) will be determined as the percentage of patient with progression of disease at 6 and 9 months, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Secondary Objective and endpoint, Evaluation of Objective Response Rate (ORR). The objective response rate (ORR) will be defined as the percentage of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) determined using modified RANO criteria, Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Secondary Objective and endpoint, Evaluation of Quality of Life assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30. EORTC QLQ-C30 has robust psychometric properties resulting from their use in several international cancer clinical trials. The EORTC QLQ-C30 (Aaronson et al, 1988) is a core measure designed to be supplemented with the disease specific module., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Secondary Objective and endpoint, Evaluation of Quality of Life assessed by QLQ-BN20. QLQBN20 has robust psychometric properties resulting from their use in several international cancer clinical trials., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
