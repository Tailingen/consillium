Weight-based Dosing for Dense Weekly Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Overweight Patients w/ Body Surface Area (BSA) > 2.0
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the side effects and effectiveness of giving standard paclitaxel chemotherapy in doses based on actual body surface area in combination with standard dosed carboplatin chemotherapy for overweight women.
Gynecologic Malignancies
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Relative Dose Intensity as Measured by Mean Percent of Intended Cycles Completed, Prospective evaluation of the Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) of weight-based dose dense weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin as measured by the average percent of completed treatment cycles out of the intended therapeutic plan, Up to 190 days
Number of Participants With Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, every 3 months for up to 2 years, then every 6 months (up to 31 months)
Primary Objective The primary objective is to prospectively evaluate the Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) and toxicity of weight-based dose dense weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in overweight patients with a BSA \> 2.0 compared to the Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group trial (JGOG 2016) during 6 - 9 cycles of chemotherapy.

Secondary Objective(s) The secondary objective is to evaluate progression-free survival in this patient population.

Study Design This is a descriptive study to determine what the relative dose intensity of patients who are overweight with a BSA of greater than 2.0 can achieve.
