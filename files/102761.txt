Adjuvant Radiation Therapy vs. Watchful Waiting Following Radical Prostatectomy in High Risk Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether adjuvant radiotherapy following radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients with positive margins or capsular penetration improves biochemical, overall and/or cancer specific survival and whether adjuvant radiotherapy is reasonably well tolerated when compared to watchful waiting.
Prostatic Neoplasms
RADIATION: Adjuvant radiotherapy
Biochemical disease-free survival, Five years|Overall survival, Five years|Cancer specific survival, 5 years
Local recurrence verified by needle or surgical biopsy, Five years|Adverse events, Five years
In this study the investigators will evaluate adjuvant radiation therapy vs. watchful waiting in prostate cancer patients with positive margins or capsular penetration after radical prostatectomy. This is a randomized, open label, multicentre, collaborative study of FinnProstate Group and Finnish Radiation Oncology group.
