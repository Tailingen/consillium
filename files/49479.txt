PROCEDURE: PEEP challenge
pulse pressure variation, Temporary increase of PEEP will be able to predict fluid responsiveness using increase of pulse pressure variation over 1%., 5 minutes after PEEP challenge
stroke volume variation, Temporary increase of PEEP will be able to predict fluid responsiveness using increase of stroke volume variation over 1%., 5 minutes after PEEP challenge
Appropriate fluid challenge is crucial during lung surgery under one-lung ventilation. Applying PEEP in mechanically ventilating patients changes dynamic hemodynamic parameters (stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation), which is more pronounced in hypovolemic patients. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the mechanically ventilating patients under one-lung ventilation requiring fluid resuscitation by applying PEEP to predict fluid responsiveness.

The investigators hypothesized that applying PEEP in one-lung ventilating patients can also change dynamic parameters and the magnitude of the change of stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation can predict fluid responsiveness. The investigator applied PEEP 10 mmHg in one-lung ventilating patients and observed the dynamic parameters including stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation and then infused 6ml/kg of crystalloid for fluid challenge and diagnosed fluid responsiveness as 10% increase of stroke volume after fluid challenge.
