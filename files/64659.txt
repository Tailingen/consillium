Phase II Study of VS-6063 in Patients With KRAS Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter, multi cohort, study of VS-6063 (defactinib), a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, in patients with KRAS mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC with a KRAS mutation is required for study entry and subjects will be enrolled into 1 of 4 cohorts based on the status of their INK4a/Arf and p53 mutations. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate if VS-6063 (defactinib) improves PFS within each cohort. The safety and tolerability of VS-6063, tumor response rate, progression free survival and overall survival will also be assessed. The pharmacodynamic effects of VS-6063 (defactinib) will be examined in a tumor biopsy and a blood sample.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Lung Cancer
DRUG: defactinib (VS-6063)
Demonstrate that VS-6063 (defactinib), will improve PFS at 12 weeks (PFS12) within each cohort., From baseline through 12 weeks of treatment
Evaluate the response rate (RR), RR is measured as the best overall response using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1., Every 6 weeks from baseline through the end of treatment, an expected average of 4 months|Evaluate progression free survival, PFS will be estimated in each cohort using Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates., From the date of first treatment to the date of progression including death from any cause, expected average at least 4 months|Evaluate Overall Survival (OS), OS in each cohort will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates., OS will be calculated from the date of first treatment to the date of death from any cause, expected average of at least 12 months. Patients who did not experience death will be censored at the last follow-up time.
Evaluation of the association between pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers and clinical outcomes (response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival), Baseline PD biomarkers will be associated with the RR (collected every 6 weeks) and PFS, both with expected average of 4 months from first treatment to progression, and OS (expected average of 12 months from first treatment to date of death)|Evaluate the safety and tolerability of VS-6063 (defactinib), Adverse events (AEs) include the incidences of all treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs); by severity, relationship to study drug, and discontinuation of patients from study therapy due to AEs and due to deaths. Safety endpoints for AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs and physical examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics as determined based on CTCAE (Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects) 4.03, From start of treatment to end of treatment, an expected average of 4 months
Eleven subjects will be enrolled into one of four cohorts: Cohort A (KRAS mutation, wild type INK4a/ARF and wildtype p53), Cohort B (KRAS mutation, INK4s/ARF mutation and wild type p53), Cohort C (KRAS mutation, wild type INK4a/ARF and p53 mutation), and Cohort D (KRAS mutation, INK4a/ARF mutation and p53 mutation). If \>/= 4 patients demonstrate PFS at 12 weeks in each cohort, an additional 23 subjects will be enrolled.
