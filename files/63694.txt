Evaluation of DASATINIB Monotherapy Efficacy in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients Refractory to VENETOCLAX-AZACITIDINE
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the efficacy of DASATINIB monotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia patients refractory to VENETOCLAX-AZACITIDINE. The main question it aims to answer is to assess the tumor response after 2 cycles of DASATINIB monotherapy treatment for patients with chemotherapy-ineligible acute myeloid leukemia refractory to VENETOCLAX-AZACITIDINE therapy.

Participants will be given DASATINIB treatment up to 3 months. Response will be assessed by a myelogram and a complete blood count at the end of every cycle. Follow up will last 6 months.
