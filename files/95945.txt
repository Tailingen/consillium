Number of Participants With Objective Response, Tumor response was assessed according RECIST criteria: PR=at least 30% reduction in the sum of the LD of all target lesions in reference to the baseline sum LD, CR=Disappearance of all non-target lesions. Objective tumor response was defined as a PR or CR., From day of first treatment through Week 25 or at time of discontinuation from study treatment.|Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Tumor response was assessed according RECIST criteria: PR=at least 30% reduction in the sum of the LD of all target lesions in reference to the baseline sum LD, CR=Disappearance of all non-target lesions. Percentage of participants with objective tumor response was determined by the number of participants with PR or CR divided by the total number of response-evaluable participants., From day of first treatment through Week 25 or at time of discontinuation from study treatment|Best Overall Response, Response assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; Partial Response (PR)=≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions; SD=small changes not meeting above criteria; Progressive Disease (PD)=appearance of new lesion(s), ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, or progression of existing non-target lesions; Clinical Progression (cPD)=deterioration related to disease requiring treatment without radiographic PD., From day of first treatment through Week 25 or at time of discontinuation from study treatment

The distribution of PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. A two-sided 95% confidence interval (Brookmeyer and Crowley method) for the median PFS was computed., From Baseline (Week 0) to time of PD or discontinuation of last participant from study treatment (Week 45)|Percentage of Participants With Progression-free Survival (PFS) at Weeks 9, 17, and 25, PFS was defined as time from first dosing date until the first date that progressive disease (PD) was observed., At Weeks 9, 17, and 25|Duration Of Objective Response, Duration of objective response was defined as the time (in weeks) between the first date that criteria for CR or PR were met and the first date that progressive disease (PD) or clinical progressive disease (cPD) was observed. Date of death was used as PD date for participants who died before reporting PD. Participants who neither progressed nor died were censored at the date of their last tumor assessment., the time (in weeks) between the first date that criteria for PR were met and the first date that PD or cPD was observed|Number of Participants With Death, Adverse Events (AEs), and AEs Leading to Discontinuation, AE=any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.

SAE=any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, results in development of drug dependency or drug abuse, is an important medical event., Continuous assessment beginning at initiation of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug|Number Of Participants With Notable Drug-related AEs, Notable drug-related AEs for dasatinib include gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain), fatigue, lethargy, headache, rash, fever, pleural effusion, and dyspnea., Continuous assessment beginning at initiation of study drug until 30 days after the last dose of study drug|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Plasma Concentration of Dasatinib at Week 3, Blood samples (3 mL) were used for measurement of dasatinib plasma concentration and metabolites., PK assessment was performed at Week 3 visit (Day 15 ±4 days). Blood samples were obtained at Time = 0 hours, and at 1, 3 and 6 hours after each dose, and a trough sample was obtained immediately prior to any dose (~12 hours).|PK: Plasma Concentration of Dasatinib at Week 7 or Week 9, Blood samples (3 mL) were used for measurement of dasatinib plasma concentration and metabolites., PK assessment was performed at Week 7 or 9 visit.
