First-In-Human Study in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Malignant Tumors
This study is an open-label, multicenter, first-in-human, Phase I, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of JSKN003 in subjects with advanced inoperable or metastatic solid malignant tumors that are expected to be HER2 expression.
Advanced Solid Tumors|Metastatic Solid Tumors
DRUG: JSKN003
MTD, Maximum tolerated dose, Postdose of last participant up to 1 year|Preliminary RDE/RP2D, recommended dose for expansion / recommended phase 2 dose, Postdose of last participant up to 1 year|DLTs, Dose Limiting Toxicities, Baseline up to 21 days after the first dose|Adverse Events, Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug, up to 1 year
Cmax of JSKN003, Maximum (Peak) Observed blood Concentration (Cmax) of JSKN003 Following First Dose, Post last dose up to Day 90|Tmax of JSKN003, Time of Maximum blood Concentration (Tmax) of JSKN003 Following First Dose, Post last dose up to Day 90|AUC of JSKN003, The blood PK parameters of JSKN003 and its analytes for area under the concentration-versus-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable concentration as calculated by the linear-up log-down trapezoidal method (AUClast) and AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) elimination rate constant associated with the terminal phase were estimated using standard non-compartmental methods., Post last dose up to Day 90|Terminal Elimination Half-life (t1/2), The blood PK parameters of Terminal elimination half-life for JSKN003, Post last dose up to Day 90|ORR, Objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review was defined as the proportion of participants who achieve either complete response \[CR\] or partial response \[PR\] per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., Postdose of last participant up to 1 year|TTR, TTR is defined as the time from the date of first study dose to the date of earliest qualifying response, Postdose of last participant up to 1 year|DoR, Duration of response for responders (CR or PR) is defined as the time interval between the date of earliest qualifying response and the date of PD or death for any cause, whichever occurs earlier., Postdose of last participant up to 1 year|PFS, PFS is defined as the time from the date of first study dose to disease progression or death whichever occurs first. Subjects without event (no disease progression or alive at last visit) will be censored at the date of "last tumor assessment"., Postdose of last participant up to 1 year|Anti-JSKN003 antibody, Status (positive or negative) and serum titers of anti-JSKN003 antibody, Post last dose up to Day 90
The dose escalation study will utilize single patient accelerated dose titration for the first two dose levels, 1.0 and 2.1 mg/kg, followed by dose cohorts 4.2, 5.2, 6.3, 7.3, and 8.4 mg/kg which will all be enrolled and monitored using the Bayesian optimal interval design, aimed at determining the MTD, RDE/RP2D of JSKN003. The dose-escalation of 9.4 mg/kg and 10.5 mg/kg should be determined per discussion between Safety Monitoring Committee and sponsor if deemed necessary, the SMC had the right of deciding to dose-escalate at other dose levels . Moreover, the SMC is also responsible for deciding the MTD and the recommended dose level for dose-expansion study.

Enrolled patients will be sequentially assigned to the planned dose levels as required by the protocol and treated with JSKN003 IV Q3W to observe the occurrence of treatment related AEs and dose limiting toxicities. The DLT observation period is 21 days from administration of the first dose of JSKN003.

The study will use a modified ADT design and BOIN design for dosing cohort management to determine the MTD and RDE/RP2D. The starting dose of JSKN003 is 1.0 mg/kg, followed by 2.1, 4.2, 5.3, 6.3, 7.3, 8.4, 9.4 and 10.5 mg/kg. The investigational product will be administered on Day 1 every 3 weeks via intravenous infusion, and the first cycle of JSKN003 treatment is for DLT evaluation.
