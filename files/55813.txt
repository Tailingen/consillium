T790M Mutation on ctDNA in Patients With NSCLC After EGFR-TKI Failure
The purpose of this study is to compare the frequency and abundance of T790M mutation among the different Clinical modes of EGFR-TKI failure.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage III|Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Metastatic
OTHER: mutation detection|OTHER: ARMS and ddPCR|GENETIC: ctDNA analysis
Number of Patients With T790M Mutation Detected by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) Assay, The investigators will describe the number of T790M mutation on ctDNA detected by ARMS assay in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)., up to 2 years|Abundance of T790M Mutation Detected by Digital Droplet PCR (ddPCR) Assay in Each Individual Patient, The investigators will describe the abundance of T790M mutation on ctDNA detected by ddPCR assay in patients with NSCLC resistant to TKIs., up to 2 years
Number of T790M Mutation by ARMS and ddPCR Assays in Each Different Clinical Modes of TKI Failure, The investigators will describe the number of participants with T790M mutation in each different clinical mode of TKI failure by ARMS and ddPCR, and employ chi-square test to analyze the distribution of T790M mutation by ARMS and ddPCR in patients among the different Clinical modes of TKI failure., up to 2 years|Differences of T790M Mutation by ddPCR Among the Different Clinical Modes of TKI Failure, The investigators will employ Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method to analyze the differences of T790M mutation by ddPCR in patients among the different Clinical modes of TKI failure., up to 2 years
An observational, non-interventional, multi-central study of comparison of the frequency and abundance of T790M mutation using both amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) methods among the different Clinical modes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) failure
