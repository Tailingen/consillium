Cord Blood Transplant in Adults With Blood Cancers
Cord blood transplants (CBT) are a standard treatment for adults with blood cancers. MSK has developed a standard ("optimized") practice for cord blood transplant (CBT). This optimized practice includes how patients are evaluated for transplant, the conditioning treatment (standard chemotherapy and total body irradiation therapy) given to prepare the body for transplant, the amount of stem cells transplanted, and how patients are followed during and after transplant.The purpose of this study is to collect information about participant outcomes after CBT following MSK's optimized practice. The researchers will look at outcomes of the CBT treatment such as side effects, disease relapse, GVHD, and immune system recovery after CBT treatment.
