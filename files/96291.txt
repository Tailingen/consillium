Recent studies have suggested that local destruction of tumor tissue by cryoablation induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells and tumor-specific T cells by cross-presentation of tumor antigens. While pd-1 blocking antibody interferes with PD-1 mediated T-cell regulatory signaling. And combination of pd-1 blocking antibody plus lenvatinib showed increased ORR in many type of human cancers, including advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cryoablation combined with Tislelizumab plus lenvatinib as second-line or later therapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
