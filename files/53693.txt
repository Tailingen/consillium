Effect of COX-2 Selective Inhibitors on Postoperative Insulin Resistance After Gastrointestinal Laparoscopic Surgery
It is well established that the resistance to the effects of insulin on glucose metabolism develops with a lot of stress hormone release after surgical trauma. This condition is known as insulin resistance (IR) characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and lactic acidosis. Surgical IR not only affect glucose metabolism but also influence protein synthesis, then further exacerbate the depletion of the carbohydrate, fat and protein.

Postoperative pain is a challenging task for patients and surgeons, and it is part of the stress response to trauma and surgery, while the fear of pain can exacerbate the stress response.

The main aim of this study was to invest whether effective postoperative analgesia can reduce the stress response and insulin resistance.
