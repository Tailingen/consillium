DOvEE - Diagnosing Ovarian & Endometrial Cancer Early
This study hopes to improve early detection of ovarian and endometrial cancers. It will determine if women with bloating, abdominal distension, abdominal/pelvic pain, increased urinary frequency and/or early satiety, benefit from earlier surgery after screening by CA-125 ovarian cancer biomarker and transvaginal ultrasound.
Ovarian Neoplasms
OTHER: Blood test: CA-125 biomarker|OTHER: Second Test: Transvaginal Ultrasound|OTHER: Follow-up phone call
Proportion of diagnoses in early, curable stage., To determine whether the provision of fast-track diagnostic evaluation of symptomatic women â‰¥50 years will result in a higher proportion of ovarian cancer, including high-grade serous cancers (HGSCs), diagnosed in low-volume, completely resectable stage., Up to 3 years
Number of participants with physical morbidity related to the program as a measure of safety and tolerability, To determine the physical morbidity associated with testing symptomatic women for ovarian cancer by CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasound.

Participants will complete the DOvE Program Impact Assessment at Visit 1, and the Impact of Program on Patient's Well-being Questionnaire at Visit 3., Up to 6 weeks
