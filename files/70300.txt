Radioimmunotherapy (211At-OKT10-B10) and Chemotherapy (Melphalan) Before Stem Cell Transplantation for the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of 211At-OKT10-B10 when given together with melphalan before a stem cell transplantation in treating patients with multiple myeloma. The radioimmunotherapy drug 211At-OKT10-B10 is a monoclonal antibody, called OKT10-B10, linked to a radioactive substance called 211At. OKT10-B10 attaches to CD38 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers 211At to kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving 211At-OKT10-B10 with melphalan before a stem cell transplant may kill more cancer cells.
Plasma Cell Myeloma
BIOLOGICAL: Astatine At 211 Anti-CD38 Monoclonal Antibody OKT10-B10|DRUG: Melphalan|PROCEDURE: Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation
Maximum tolerated dose, Defined a true dose limiting toxicity (DLT) probability of 25% of subjects, where a DLT is defined as any grade 3-5 nonhematologic regimen-related toxicity within the first 30 days following autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation., Up to 30 days post-transplant
Achievement of response, Measured per the International Myeloma Working Group criteria. The response rates (partial response \[PR\] or better) will be estimated along with the exact 95% confidence interval., Between days +80 to +90 post-transplant|Duration of response, Duration of response will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology., From response (PR or better) to disease relapse or death, assessed up to 5 years|Overall survival, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the 2-year overall survival., From transplantation to death, assessed up to 2 years post-transplant|Progression-free survival, Kaplan-Meier methodology will be used to estimate the 2-year progression-free survival., From transplantation to disease relapse or death, assessed up to 2 years post-transplant|Rates of minimal residual disease (MRD), MRD will be assessed using multi-color flow cytometry and next generation sequencing in conjunction with functional imaging (i.e., positron emission tomography-computed tomography). The proportion who achieve MRD will be estimated along with an exact 95% confidence interval., At days 28, and +80 to +90 post-transplant
OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 211At-OKT10-B10.

Patients receive 211At-OKT10-B10 intravenously (IV) continuously on day -10 to day - 4 (approximately day -7) and melphalan via infusion on day -2. Patients then undergo hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) on day 0.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days, between 80 and 90 days, at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months, and then annually thereafter.
