Post-transplantation Cyclophosphamide as GVHD Prophylaxis After HSCT
This study evaluates the efficacy of high-dose post-transplantation cyclophosphomide as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with different risk of GVHD. The risk-adapted strategy involves using single-agent cyclophosphomide in recipients of matched bone marrow graft, and combining cyclophosphomide with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in recipients of matched peripheral blood stem cells and mismatched bone marrow.
