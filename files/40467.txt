Intrathecal Trastuzumab Administration in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients Developing Carcinomatous Meningitis
The purpose of this study is:

Phase I: To determine the Trastuzumab maximum tolerated dose (MTD) when weekly administrated by intrathecal or intraventricular route to reach a intra CSF target concentration (30 µg/mL) near the conventional therapeutic concentration and depending on the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)

Phase II: Determination of antitumor activity trastuzumab when administrated by IT or intra-ventricular in terms of neurological progression-free survival at 2 months

Phase I: Secondary Outcome Measures:

Recommended dose (RD will be used in Phase II) Toxicity during treatment Clinical response to specific neurologic symptoms Time to neurologic progression Biological response: CSF cellularity and protein concentration Radiological response: cerebrospinal meningitis and neuraxis RMI Impact on quality of life Impact on survival (overall survival, survival without neurological progression, progression-free survival) Pharmacokinetics: dose of trastuzumab in CSF and plasma FCGR3A Genetic status influence on efficacy trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer

Phase II: Secondary Outcome Measures :

Toxicity during treatment Clinical response to specific neurologic symptoms Time to neurologic progression Biological response: CSF cellularity and protein concentration Radiological response: cerebrospinal meningitis and neuraxis MRI Impact on quality of life Impact on survival (overall survival, survival without neurological progression, progression-free survival) Pharmacokinetics: dose of trastuzumab in CSF and plasma (confirmation of phase I data with 5 patients) FCGR3A Genetic status influence on efficacy trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer
