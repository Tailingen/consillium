Anxiety and Fear of Cancer Before and After Banding Without Resection in Small SET Management (QUALI-BANDING-SET)
To analyze the hypothetical improvement in anxiety degree, quality of life and fear of cancer in patients diagnosed with a small gastrointestinal subeptithelial tumor when opting for the removal of the lesion.
Gastrointestinal Subepithelial Tumors
OTHER: Initial Anxiety and Fear of Cancer Test|PROCEDURE: Endoscopic band ligation without resection of the subpetihelial tumour.|OTHER: 1-2 Months Anxiety and Fear of Cancer Test|OTHER: 1 Year Anxiety and Fear of Cancer Test
Initial Anxiety degree, At 1-2 months, number of patients with a total anxiety score of 8 or more points in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), anxiety subescale.

Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), anxiety subescale, legend:

* 0-7 points: Normal.
* 8-10 points: Borderline anxiety.
* 11-21 points: Anxiety disorder., 1-2 months|Initial Fear of Cancer degree, At 1-2 months, number of patients with a total fear of cancer score of 11 or more points in the Cancer Worry Scale (CWS).

Cancer Worry Scale (CWS) legend:

* 6-10 points: Low.
* 11-15 points: Moderate.
* 16-20 points: High.
* 21-24 points: Very high., 1-2 months
Long-term Anxiety degree, At 1 year, number of patients with a total anxiety score of 8 or more points in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), anxiety subescale.

This "Quality of Life" study is directly related to the "BANDING-SET" study (NCT03247231), whose main aim is to analyze the effectiveness and safety of endoscopic band ligation without resection in the small gastrointestinal subepithelial tumours management.

Using three validated tests (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale \[HADS\], Cancer Worry Scale \[CWS\] and European Five-Dimension Quality of Live test \[EuroQol-5D\]) patients are evaluated before and after the endoscopic procedure.

Three main groups of patients are presented:

* GROUP A, in which the subephitelial tumour is successfully removed \[hypothesis: anxiety and fear of cancer should decrease\].
* GROUP B, in which the subephitelial tumour is not successfully removed due to various reasons (size \>15-mm, not technical success,...) \[hypothesis: anxiety and fear of cancer shuold be similar before-after\].
* GROUP C, in which the subephitelial tumour is not observed or is a benign entity, which does not require further interventions for these patients \[hypothesis: anxiety and fear of cancer should decrease\].
