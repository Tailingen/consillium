Artificial Intelligence Assisted Breast Ultrasound in Breast Cancer Screening
AIBU is a randomized, open-label study assessing the effectiveness of an articificial intelligence-assisted breast ultrasound breast cancer screening strategy compared to standard screening (according to the current local guidelines in each participating area) in detecting late-stage breast cancers.

Incidence rate of early breast cancer in each arm, Early cancers should meet any of the following criteria at the time of diagnosis: less than 20 milimeters in diameter, no metastatic lymph nodes in the axilla, no distant metastasis, non-invasive cancers, stage 0, stage I, and stage IIa IIb (T2N1M0) breast cancer according to American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th staging., 4 years
Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the screening methods, A true-positive screening result (sensitivity) was a positive result in a participant who was diagnosed with breast cancer by further diagnostic work-up. A false-positive screening result was a positive result in the absence of breast cancer. A true-negative screening result (specificity) was a negative result in the absence of breast cancer and a false-negative test result was a negative result followed by diagnosis of interval cancer., 4 years
we enrolled asymptomatic women Women From January 2021 to December 2022, and then followed up for the next 1 year. The main study endpoint will be measured at the end of the one year after intervention.
