Imaging Biomarker for Early Detection of Treatment Efficacy During Breast Cancer Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
This is a single-arm, single-institution pilot study that will collect preliminary data to be used in the design of a subsequent study to assess whether changes in fDM (Functional Diffusion Maps) derived from primary breast cancer diffusion weighted MRI images can serve as an early predictor of response to treatment, and whether the magnitude of the change correlates with the effectiveness of treatment.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Diffusion weighted MRI
Percent change in apparent diffusion coefficient between baseline and 8-11 days after chemotherapy, Percent change in apparent diffusion coefficient was determined by calculating the percentage change between the value prior to chemotherapy and at 8-11 days post treatment for treatment responders (patients with Complete Response \[CR\] or Partial Response \[PR\]) and for the treatment non-responders (patients with Stable Disease \[SD\] or Progressive Disease \[PD\])., baseline and 8-11 days post treatment
Change in relative tumor volume with increasing apparent diffusion coefficient between baseline and 8-11 days of chemotherapy, Determine, by Parametric Response Map (PRM), the percent relative tumor volume with increasing ADC in responders (patients with Complete Response \[CR\] or Partial Response \[PR\]) and non-responders (patients with Stable Disease \[SD\] or Progressive Disease \[PD\]., baseline and 8-11 days post treatment|Change in relative tumor volume with decreasing apparent diffusion coefficient between baseline and 8-11 days of chemotherapy, Determine, by Parametric Response Map (PRM), the percent relative tumor volume with decreasing ADC in responders (patients with Complete Response \[CR\] or Partial Response \[PR\]) and non-responders (patients with Stable Disease \[SD\] or Progressive Disease \[PD\]., baseline and 8-11 days post treatment
This trial has a two-step, sequential design, with continuation to the second part of the trial being dependent on the positive results in the first part. In Part One of the trial, the investigator will compare intrapatient variability in fDM performed at two timepoints prior to chemotherapy (chemotherapy will be chosen by the treating physician and will not be assigned as part of this study), with the change in fDM before and approximately one week after a dose of chemotherapy, to establish that treatment-related changes in fDM will occur in this clinical setting. If there are positive results in Part One, then the investigator will proceed to the second half of the trial. In Part Two, the investigator will examine changes in fDM that occur one week after each type of chemotherapy is administered, which will be compared to pathologic response, radiological response, and clinical response.
