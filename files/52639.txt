Tirelizumab Plus Surgery vs Surgery Alone for Recurrent Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Through open-label, single-center, randomised clinical trials, we intend to demonstrate that PD-1 treatment added to salvage surgery could further decrease the rate of disease progression and improve the survival outcome of patients with locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma compared with those treated with salvage surgery alone.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Tirelizumab|PROCEDURE: salvage surgery
Progress-free survival(PFS), Defined as the time interval from randomization to the observation of disease progression or the occurrence of death from any cause, 2 years
Overall survival(OS), Defined as the time interval from randomization to death due to any cause., 2 years|Locoregional failure-free survival(LRRFS), The LRRFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first locoregional relapse or until the date of the last follow-up visit, 2 years|Distant metastasis-free survival(DMFS), The DMFS is evaluated and calculated from the date of random assignment until the day of first distant metastases or until the date of the last follow-up visit., 2 years|Incidence of treatment related complications, Incidence of treatment related complications of tirelizumab or surgical treatment during follow-up, 2 years
