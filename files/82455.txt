A Study to Assess LY01005 Versus Goserelin Comparator (ZOLADEXÂ®) in Patients With Prostate Cancer
A phase I, randomized, open-label and active-control study to assess the PK, PD and safety profiles of LY01005 versus goserelin comparator to be conducted in the USA.
Cancer of Prostate
DRUG: LY01005|DRUG: Zoladex
The bio-availability of goserelin in subjects receiving goserelin compared to Zoladex using Pharmacokinetic lab results, Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) Assessment Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of gosereling from LY01005 and goserelin from Zoladex will be determined., The pharmacokinetic (PK) labs will be drawn at -30 minutes of dosing, .25, .5, 1, and 6 hours of dosing and days 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 29 and 36
The bio-availability of goserelin in subjects receiving LY01005 compared to Zoladex using Pharmacodynamic lab results, Maximum concentration (Cmax) Assessment Maximum concentration (Cmax) for the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of goserelin from LY01005 and ODV from Zoladex will be determined., The pharmacodynamic (PD) labs will be drawn at screening -30 minutes of dosing, .25, .5, 1, and 6 hours of dosing and days 2,4,7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 29 and 36
Safety profiles of LY01005 compared to goserelin comparator after a single injection, Collection of adverse events throughout the study as a measure of safety and tolerability., Safety parameters are collected at screening, days 0,2,4,7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 29,36, and follow up phone call
This will be a randomized, open-label and active-control study to assess the PK, PD and safety profiles of LY01005 versus goserelin comparator to be conducted in the USA.
