Human Papillomavirus in Young People Epidemiological Research 2 (HYPER2)
Australia was one of the countries to implement a universal school-based male vaccination program - in 2013. This research project will examine the prevalence of HPV among young men who have sex with men (MSM) who have been offered school-based HPV vaccination.

Prevalence of quadrivalent vaccine HPV types, The primary outcome of interest will be the prevalence of quadrivalent vaccine types (6, 11, 16 and 18) among 16-20 year old MSM and comparison of these with non-quadrivalent vaccine HPV types which would be expected to remain high unless there is significant cross protection. Oral, penile, and anal HPV prevalence will be calculated., Baseline
Persistent HPV infection, Detection of same HPV type at the same site at both visits (day 0 and 7). The objective of repeat sampling at day 7 is to investigate whether this might distinguish transient HPV detection from infection. A brief questionnaire will be self-completed by participants at day 7 to ascertain whether there has been any sexual re-exposure between day 0 and 7 that might explain repeat HPV positivity at day 7., Day 7
HYPER-2, will be a cross-section study, using the same recruitment and testing strategies used in HYPER 1, which determined the prevalence of anal, genital and oral HPV among men who have sex with men aged 16-20 years. Given the differing age groups that will have been offered vaccination over the 2 study period, men aged 16-19 will be recruited in the first year (2017) and men aged 16-20 will be recruited in the second year (2018) to ensure that the participants included in the HYPER-2 study would have been eligible for the free male HPV vaccine in Australia. A total of 200 men will be recruited over a 2-year period, and HPV vaccination status for each participant will be verified against the National HPV Vaccination Program Register.

This 2-year cross-sectional study will recruit men who report sex with men aged from 16 to 20 years.
