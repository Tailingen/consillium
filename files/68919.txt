The Value of MultiSpectral 3 Tesla MRI in Active Surveillance of Prostate Cancer
MultiSpectral 3 Tesla MRI (MS3TMRI) can increase the yield of Trans Rectal Ultrasound Biopsy (TRUSBx) to improve identification of patients on active surveillance requiring treatment.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: MS3TMRI
The Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of MS3TMRI-TRUSBx for detection of a patient with a cancer burden requiring consideration of immediate therapy., Compare the targeted biopsy to the random biopsies, The outcome measure will be evaluated at the time of the results of the TRUSbx which will be approximately 2 weeks after the biopsy
The number of cores required for diagnosis of prostate cancer for MS3TMRI-TRUSBx versus TRUSBx alone, The outcome measure will be evaluated at the time of the results of the TRUSbx which will be approximately 2 weeks after the biopsy
This is a prospective single arm study. 120 patients at risk for significant occult prostate cancer on an active surveillance program will undergo MS3TMRI followed by a standard TRUSBx and additional biopsies guided by the MS3TMRI results. The positive predictive value (PPV) of MS3TMRI-TRUSBx for cancer requiring consideration of therapy will be compared to the PPV of TRUSBx alone. MS3TMRI consists of T2, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCEMRI), proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) interpreted by a radiologist and by CAD methods validated on whole mount prostate specimens.
