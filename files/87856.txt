A Phase II Study Evaluating JAB-21822 Monotherapy in Adult Patients With Pancreatic Cancer and Other Solid Tumors Harboring the KRAS p.G12C Mutation.
Patients with other advanced solid tumors (excluding NSCLC and CRC) who have progressed after prior systemic therapy or are intolerant and lack satisfactory alternative treatment options, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Glecirasib in these patients.

This study is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label, basket-design, pivotal phase II trial targeting adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring the KRAS p.G12C mutation. The included populations are:

* Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have progressed or are intolerant to prior gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens or FOLFIRINOX/mFOLFIRINOX/NALIRIFOX treatments.
* Patients with other advanced solid tumors (excluding NSCLC and CRC) who have progressed after prior systemic therapies or are intolerant and lack satisfactory alternative treatment options.

The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Glecirasib in these patient populations.
