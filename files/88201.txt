Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics of ThisCART19A in Patients With Refractory or Relapsed B Cell Lymphoma
This is a phase 1/2, open-label study to assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ThisCART19A (Allogeneic Anti CD19 CAR-T) in patients with refractory or relapsed CD19 positive B cell Lymphoma.
Refractory or Relapsed B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: ThisCART19A|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Etoposide
Dose limited toxicity(DLT) observation in patient with r/r B cell Lymphoma, DLT was defined as CAR T cells-related events with onset within first 28 days following infusion., 28 days|The incidence of all grade TEAEs and ≥3 grade TEAEs, Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and ≥3 grade TEAEs, Up to 2 years after ThisCART19A infusion|Objective Response Rate, the incidence of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), or unevaluable (UE) as best response to treatment., Up to 2 years after ThisCART19A infusion|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the date of their first CR or PR (which is subsequently confirmed) to PD assessed by investigators and based on the Lugano 2014 assessment criterion for r/r B cell Lymphoma, or death regardless of cause., Up to 2 years after ThisCART19A infusion|Progress-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the ThisCART19A infusion date to the date of disease progression assessed by investigators and based on the Lugano 2014 assessment criterion, or death any cause., Up to 2 years after ThisCART19A infusion
TTR (Time to response), TTR is defined as the time from ThisCART19A infusion to first assessed CR or PR based on the Lugano 2014 assessment criterion., Up to 2 years after ThisCART19A infusion|OS (Overall survival), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of lymphodepletion until death from any cause., Up to 2 years after lymphodepletion
This is a phase 1/2, single-center, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of ThisCART19A in patients with r/r CD19 positive B cell Lymphoma and identify a treatment regimen most likely to result in clinical efficacy while maintaining a favorable safety profile. AIDS-related B-cell lymphoma were not excluded from this clinical trial.

Before initiating ThisCART19A infusion, subjects will be administered lymphodepletion chemotherapy composed of fludarabine、cyclophosphamide and VP-16. At Day 0 of the Treatment Period, subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of ThisCART19A. All subjects are monitored during the treatment period through Day 42. All subjects who receive a dose of ThisCART19A will be followed up to 2 years.
