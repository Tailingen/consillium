OTHER: Educational Intervention to enhance the adherence of Patient treated by capecitabine +/- Lapatinib
evaluation of the efficacy of the implementation of an educational program on adherence to capecitabine alone or in combination to lapatinib, the efficacy of the implementation of an educational program will be evaluated by adherence assessment using electronic monitoring system, every visit during 3 cycles i.e. 9 weeks (adherent patients) and for 6 additional cycles i.e. 18 weeks during educational intervention (nonadhererent patients)
patient satisfaction to the educational program as determined by questionnaire, at the end of the educational program i.e. approximately during the week 27|safety and tolerability as determined by adverse events frequency, for 3 cycles e.i. 9 weeks (adherent patients) or 9 cycles e.i. 27 weeks (nonadherent patients)
200 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria treated by capecitabine +/- lapatinib, will be enrolled into the study. Adherence to treatment of all subjects will be assessed during a first adherence evaluation period of 3 cycles in order to identify patients who need educational intervention(non adherent patients). Only nonadherent patients (adherence rate \< 80%) will receive an education intervention. During the educational program, the efficacy of the implementation of an educational program on adherence to capecitabine alone or in combination to lapatinib will be evaluated for the 6 subsequent cycles.
