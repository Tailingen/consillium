Carbon Ion Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer
The aim of this research project is to assess the feasibility and safety of carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for the treatment of in Chinese localized prostate cancer
Prostate Carcinoma
DEVICE: carbon-ion radiotherapy
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, From the date of CIRT to 6 months after the completion of CIRT, up to 6 months
Overall survival of all patients, From the diagnosis of localized prostate, a median of 2 years|biochemical failure-free survivalï¼ŒbFFS, From the completion of CIRT, a median of 2 years|Progression-free survival of all patients, From the completion of CIRT, a median of 2 years
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of CIRT in the treatment of localized prostate cancer and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment at the MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subacute toxicity observed during and within 6 months after the completion of CIRT. Once the MTD for localized prostate cancer is determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II part of the trial.
