Axillary Surgery De-escalation After Neoadjuvant Therapy Using Dedicate Breast PET
Some breast cancer patients with initial axillary metastasis can achieve axillary complete pathological remission(A-pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy(NAT)，These patients are candidates for axillary Surgery de-escalation. This prospective study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of axillary surgery de-escalation for the initial axillary metastasis breast cancer patients who are predicted to achieve A-pCR using multiple pathological indicators and imaging examinations (molecular typing, ultrasound and dedicated breast positron emission tomography, etc.) before and after 1-2 cycles NAT
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: axillary surgery de-escalation after NAT
Node Recurrence Rate, a recurrence in the ipsilateral axillary, supraclavicular, or internalmammary nodal basins., 2 years
