Panobinostat (LBH589): Multiple Myeloma - Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT)
The purpose of this study is to learn more about ways to prevent or delay relapse of multiple myeloma (MM). This study will determine the best dosing schedule of LBH589 maintenance therapy as well as the safety (side effects) and tolerability of LBH589 maintenance therapy after autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Panobinostat
Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) Per Cohort, Investigators will calculate RDI for each cohort. Relative dose intensity (RDI) represents the ratio of the amount of a drug actually delivered \[actual dose intensity (DI)\] to the amount planned (planned DI). The purpose of calculating RDI is to evaluate whether the planned DI of a chemotherapy treatment was actually achieved which may suggest the feasibility of planned treatment regimen. There are multitude of reports demonstrating a correlation between RDI and survival in cancer treatment. RDI = (total dose received by the patient = mg)/(planned full dose of drug = mg)., Up to 2 years
Complete Response Rate, Complete Response (CR) rate to panobinostat maintenance therapy after autologous HCT. CR: Negative immunofixation of serum and urine, disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow., Up to 5 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progressive Disease (PD) according to Uniform Response Reporting Criteria for Multiple Myeloma by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG). Increase of 25% from lowest response value in any of the following:

* Serum M- component (absolute increase must be ≥ 0.5 g/dL)
* Urine M-component (absolute increase must be ≥ 200 mg/24 h)
* Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M protein levels and without measurable disease by free light chain (FLC) levels, bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute percentage must be ≥ 10% )
* Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas
* Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium \> 11.5 mg/dL) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder, at 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS: The length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease, such as cancer, that patients diagnosed with the disease are still alive., at 2 years
