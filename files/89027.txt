Personalized Accelerated ChEmoRadiation (PACER) for Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to examine the use of hypofractionated accelerated radiation therapy (HART) to treat locally advanced lung cancer. Depending on the location and size of the tumor.
Lung Cancer
RADIATION: Hypofractionated accelerated radiation therapy
Dose limiting pulmonary and esophageal toxicity, Toxicities will be scored by the CTCAE v5.0 criteria. Specific toxicities evaluated are grade 2+ pneumonitis and grade 3+ esophagitis as well as other G3+ pulmonary, esophageal or cardiac toxicities that could be probably or definitely attributed to rT., 9 months
Acute and Late Toxicities, Patients will be evaluated by the rates of acute and late grade 2+ toxicities including lung, esophageal, cardiac, chest wall, and neurologic., 36 months|Integrated adaptive dosing regimen with an automated planning system, Evaluating the feasibility of integrating an adaptive dosing regimen with an automated planning system with the percentage of automated plans used and the time to plan approval., 36 months|Progression free survival, Determine progression free survival in patients treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy with concurrent systemic therapy, 36 months|Overall survival, Determine overall survival in patients treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy with concurrent systemic therapy, 36 months|Local control, Determine local control in patients treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy with concurrent systemic therapy, 36 months
