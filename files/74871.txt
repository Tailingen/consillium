Exploratory Clinical Study of Autologous Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocyte Injection (GT201) for Advanced Gynecologic Tumors
This study is a single-center, single-arm phase I clinical trial. A total of 24\~26 subjects (20 evaluable cases are expected) from 1 cohort will be enrolled in this study.

An "autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy" dosing regimen consisting of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (FC regimen: cyclophosphamide + fludarabine), infusion of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte injection, and interleukin-2 injection will be used.The study process is divided into: screening period, sampling and production period, clearing and chemotherapy period, treatment and observation period, and follow-up period
