Primary Objectives

1. To determine the feasibility ad safety of BCMA CAR-T cells in treating patients with multiple myeloma.
2. To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of BCMA CAR-T cells.
3. To access the efficacy of BCMA CAR-T cells in patients with multiple myeloma.

Secondary Objectives

1. To assess the bone marrow and tumor migration of BCMA CAR-T cells.
2. To investigate the tumor killing capability of BCMA CAR-T cells in vitro
3. To investigate the possibility of host immune response to the mouse derived BCMA scFv, and evaluate its correlation to CAR-T persistence.
4. To correlate the subsets and differentiation of BCMA CAR-T cells to observed anti-tumor efficacy.
