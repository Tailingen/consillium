The Short-term Efficacy of Novel NTDP-RFA in the Treatment of Small HCC With Cirrhosis.
To evaluate the short-term efficacy of novel no-touch combined directional perfusion radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Stage I|Radiofrequency Ablation
The incidence of local tumor progression (LTP), LTP was defined as the appearance of new tumor foci near 2 cm at the ablative margin after the local eradication of all tumor cells with RFA, two-years local tumor progression-free survival
Tumor-free survival, The tumor did not recur after treatment., two-years tumor-free survival
Liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 70% to 85% of primary HCC and is the leading cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. We developed a novel no-touch combined directional perfusion radiofrequency ablation system.By inserting two or more electrodes around the tumor and activating them simultaneously.The hypertonic saline solution can be directed into the focal tissue from a lateral pore through a tube within the electrode to provide more uniform and thorough necrosis.The maximum ablation volume was increased while the loss of normal tissue in the non-injection direction was reduced, thus reducing the incidence of postoperative complications. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term efficacy of novel no-touch combined directional perfusion radiofrequency ablation in the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma with cirrhosis.
