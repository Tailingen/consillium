* Participants will complete ePRO clinic for all medical oncology scheduled provider appointments during the study period per standard practice
* Participants between clinic visits, will be asked to complete the oral weekly survey at home via the mobile or web based patient portal. The survey can be completed on a computer, tablet or smartphone at home or on a tablet at the time of scheduled visit.

  * The first 100 participants to complete the survey will receive a passive care team alert for responses (per DFHCC policy)
  * The second 100 participants to complete the survey will receive an active care team alert for responses.
