Zanubrutinib Combined With BR in the First-line Treatment of Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia
Current retrospective studies have demonstrated that achieving deep remission following treatment for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) correlates with prolonged survival. While the bendamustine-rituximab (BR) regimen or single-agent zanubrutinib are currently recommended as first-line therapies, neither achieves optimal deep remission. Additionally, prolonged zanubrutinib monotherapy may lead to cumulative adverse effects. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the bendamustine-rituximab-zanubrutinib combination regimen as a first-line treatment option for MYD88-mutated WM patients.
