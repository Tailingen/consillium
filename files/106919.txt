A Phase 1/2 Study of Oral SB1518 in Subjects With Chronic Idiopathic Myelofibrosis
The study consists of two phases: The first portion of the study is a Phase 1 dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the dose limiting toxicities of SB1518 when given as a single agent orally once daily in subjects with Chronic Idiopathic Myelofibrosis (CIMF) regardless of their JAK2 mutational status. The second portion of the study is a Phase 2 study to define the efficacy and safety profile of single agent SB1518 at the recommended dose in subjects with CIMF.
