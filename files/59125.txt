Validation of the value of molecular profiling analysis in broadband laser spectroscopy on liquid biopsies for breast cancer screening, To validate the value of molecular profiling analysis in broadband laser spectroscopy on liquid biopsies for invasive breast cancer screening by comparing a cohort of patients with localized invasive breast cancer (Stage I/II) to a cohort of women without invasive breast cancer from organized or individual age-matched screening., Comparison between the different cohorts at (T0 : inclusion) and the others visits (T1:+1year; T2: +2years; T3 : +3years; T4:+4years; T5: 5years)
Correlating the results of high-speed laser spectroscopy analysis on liquid biopsies with mammography data (ACR 0-5), The results of high-speed laser spectroscopy analysis on liquid biopsies will be correlated with mammography data, T0: inclusion; T1:+1year; T2: +2years; T3 : +3years; T4:+4years; T5: 5years|Estimate detection rate of both breast cancer screening methods (spectroscopy/mammography) for control cohort, Estimate the rate of detection of invasive breast cancer occurring within 5 years of examination in the control group according to the reference method (mammography) and the innovative method ("n-variable molecular profiles") from the baseline analysis performed at Max Planck Institute and algorithmic analysis, T0 : inclusion; T2 : +2 years; T4: +4years|To study the role of confounding factors in the structure of molecular profiles derived from broadband laser spectroscopy, To study the confounding role of hormonal status and concomitant inflammatory states in the structure of molecular profiles derived from broadband laser spectroscopy, T0: inclusion; T1:+1year; T2: +2years; T3 : +3years; T4:+4years; T5: 5years|Comparison of BRCA1/2 patients molecular profiles with control and patient cohorts derived from broadband laser spectroscopy, To study the molecular profiles derived from broadband laser spectroscopy on liquid biopsies in a cohort of high-risk women (BRCA1/2) not carrying invasive breast cancer, and to compare their positioning in relation to the 2 main cohorts of the study (patients carrying invasive breast cancer without mutation and controls without invasive breast cancer)., T0: inclusion; T1:+1year; T2: +2years; T3 : +3years; T4:+4years; T5: 5years
Each patient will have one or more liquid biopsy during the follow-up according to the cohort and have a mammogram at the same time.

Biopsies will be analysed by broadband spectroscopy in order to compare the results to mammogram result.
