Phase III Clinical Trial Comparing the Safety, Efficacy, and Immunogenicity of HS022 and Trastuzumab® in Combination With Vinorelbine Bitartrate Injection in the Treatment of HER2-positive Breast Cancer
This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety and Immunogenicity of Vinorelbine Bitartrate Injection in Combination With HS022 and Trastuzumab®.There were 2 parts. Part 1 needs 8 treatment cycles ( at least 24 weeks); Part2 needs 9 treatment cycles (at least 27 weeks).
