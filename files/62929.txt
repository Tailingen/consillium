Presurgical Treatment With Letrozole in Patients With Early-stage Breast Cancer.
Some tumors use estrogen in the body to assist with growth. Letrozole is a drug that is prevents cells from producing estrogens. This should assist with the slowing of growth of tumor cells. Letrozole also promotes cell destruction by inhibiting a cellular destruction pathway.

The objectives of this study will look at the differences between the cellular destruction pathway before and after letrozole use, and the differences in the cellular destruction pathway in participants that have received letrozole versus those who did not. The study will also look at a gene in all participants called Ki67. This gene is associated with the rate of tumor cell growth. The study will measure the levels of Ki67 and compare them to the amount of activation of the cellular destruction pathway.

Participants in this study will have undergone a diagnostic biopsy of their breast tissue.

In order to meet these objectives, one group of participants (Arm A) will not receive letrozole. Tissue leftover from their diagnostic biopsy will be treated with everolimus (RAD001) in the laboratory and the effects of this drug on the cellular destruction pathway will be studied.

The other group of participants (Arm B) will take letrozole for a minimum of 10 and maximum of 21 days. They will have a second tumor sample taken as part of their surgical procedure completed to remove the tumor tissue. Any differences in the cellular destruction pathway before and after exposure to letrozole will be measured.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Letrozole
Change in Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS-1) / Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) / Serine-threonine Protein Kinase (AKT) Pathway Activation, The Primary Endpoint is to determine the effect of ex vivo mTORC1 inhibition with everolimus (RAD001) on IRS-1/PI3K/AKT pathway activation (as measured by phospho-AKT-T308 and phospho-AKT-S473) in ER+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- breast tumors treated with presurgical letrozole compared to ER+/HER2- breast tumors not treated with presurgical therapy., baseline and surgery, approximately 30 days
Percentage of Ki67 Score, The Secondary Endpoint is to compare tumor cell proliferation as measured with the Ki-67 assay in breast cancer specimens taken before and at the time of surgery, comparing specimens of patients treated with presurgical letrozole and specimens of patients who did not receive presurgical letrozole. The secondary endpoint is Ki67 score, as determined by the percentage of Ki67+ tumor cells identified by immunohistochemistry.

Whole slides were scanned at 40x (Aperio AT2, Leica Biosystems), and automated Ki67 analysis (percent positive nuclei) was determined using the Aperio ImageScope (v12.3.1.60002, Leica Biosystems) nuclear v9 algorithm. As recommended by the International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group, 3 high-power microscopic fields were selected for analysis to represent the spectrum of staining present on the whole tissue section, and a minimum of 500 malignant invasive cells were score, baseline and surgery, approximately 30 days
