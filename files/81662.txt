A Study Comparing Radiofrequency Ablation and Hepatic Resection for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to compare the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation and hepatic resection for small hepatocellular carcinomas with very homogeneous underlying conditions.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
PROCEDURE: Hepatic resection|PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency ablation
The patient survival, From the intervention up to 5 years or until the death of the participant whichever came first
The disease-free survival, From the intervention up to 5 years or until hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence whichever came first
The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to compare the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation and hepatic resection for small hepatocellular carcinomas with very homogeneous underlying conditions.
