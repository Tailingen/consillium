Phase 1 Biomarker Study of Anti-PDL-1 in Advanced Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacodynamic changes of BMS-936559 treatment on the biomarkers measured in the peripheral blood and tumor tissues of subjects with unresectable Stage III or IV Melanoma.
Stage III or IV Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: BMS-936559 (Anti-PD-L1)|BIOLOGICAL: BMS-936559 (Anti-PD-L1)|BIOLOGICAL: BMS-936559 (Anti-PD-L1)
Evidence of immunomodulatory effects of BMS-936559 as measured by changes from baseline in biomarkers assessed 1) peripheral blood assays including flow cytometry and soluble factors and 2) tumor based assays including immunohistochemistry, Baseline and within the first 24 weeks of study participation
Safety and tolerability of BMS-936559 as measured by the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, laboratory test abnormalities, and changes in vital signs, Every 2 weeks until 70 days after last treatment|Antitumor Activity of BMS-936559 as measured by the objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and progression free survival, Every 6 weeks for 1 year, every 12 weeks thereafter until confirmed disease progression|Immunogenicity of BMS-936559 as measured by the frequency of subjects with an increase in anti-drug antibody levels from baseline, Baseline, Week 6, Week 12, and then every 12 weeks until follow-up|Pharmacodynamic activity of BMS-936559 as measured by changes from baseline of the tetramer assay in HLA-A*0210 positive subject only, Predose (screening) and Cycle 3 Day 1
