Treatment of HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer With Herceptin and Bevacizumab (Antibodies Against HER2 and VEGF)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of combined treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Bevacizumab (drug), Herceptin (drug)
To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose of rhuMAb VEGF (bevacizumab) administered intravenously every 14 days to patients with HER2-amplified relapsed or metastatic breast cancer receiving concomitant Herceptin therapy
To evaluate the clinical safety and toxicities of rhuMAb VEGF when administered in combination with Herceptin|To characterize the pharmacokinetics of rhuMAb VEGF and Herceptin given in combination|To evaluate the efficacy of rhuMAb VEGF plus Herceptin in terms of clinical activity when administered as an intravenous infusion, in patients with previously untreated metastatic or relapsed breast cancer
Based on preclinical experiments conducted in our laboratories, we hypothesize that the aggressive behavior of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers is due in part to increased angiogenesis resulting from HER2-induced increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. In vivo experiments suggest that combined blockade of the HER2 receptor and VEGF results in superior anti-tumor efficacy compared with either treatment alone.

The current clinical trial, for which the phase I portion has been completed, will examine the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab (Herceptin) and bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody) in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.
