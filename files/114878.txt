A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo Controlled Phase III Study to Investigate Efficacy and Safety of First-Line Treatment With HLX10 + Chemotherapy (Carboplatin-Nanoparticle Albumin Bound (Nab) Paclitaxel) in Patients With Stage IIIB/IIIC or IV NSCLC
This study is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical study to compare the clinical efficacy and safety of HLX10 + chemotherapy vs chemotherapy in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic squamous NSCLC who have not previously received systemic treatment.

Eligible subjects in this study will be randomized to Arm A or Arm B at 2:1 ratio as follows:

Arm A (HLX10 arm): HLX10 + chemotherapy (carboplatin nab paclitaxel) Arm B (placebo arm): Placebo + chemotherapy (carboplatin nab paclitaxel) The three stratification factors for randomization include: PD-L1 expression level (Tumor Proportion Scores \[TPS\]≥50%, 50%\>TPS≥1%, TPS\<1%), Asian population (yes or no), NSCLC stage (stage IIIB/IIIC or stage IV), and carboplatin AUC (5 or 6).
