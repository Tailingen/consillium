For locally advanced cervical cancer patients undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy, distant metastasis has become a major concern. In this study, investigators selected a subgroup of patients with theoretically higher risk of distant metastasis and intensified their systematic treatment by incorporating PD-L1 inhibitors into neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in order to reduce their risk of distant metastasis and achieve good disease-free survival.
