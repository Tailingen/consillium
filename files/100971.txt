Preliminary Evaluation of Uptake of [68Ga]P16-093 in Metastatic Prostate and Renal Cancer
An phase I study to evaluate the uptake of \[68Ga\]P16-093 in known or suspected metastatic prostate or renal cancer to establish the feasibility of using \[68Ga\]P16-093 to image PSMA expressing cancer. Measurement of the whole body biodistribution of \[68Ga\]P16-093 in prostate cancer patients post primary curative-intent treatment with stable PSA to generate human radiation dosimetry data.

DRUG: [68Ga]P16-093
Uptake of [68Ga]P16-093 in metastatic prostate and renal cancer, Standard uptake value (SUV) of \[68Ga\]P16-093 in apparent lesions detected by PET/CT., 0.5 - 3 hours after injection|Radiation dosimetry of [68Ga]P16-093 in patients with a history of prostate cancer, Radiation dosimetry (organ absorbed dose and effective dose) will be determined using region of interest data drawn on sequential PET/CT images and data from blood and / or urine obtained during scanning., up to 3 hours after injection
