Trial of Ombrabulin (AVE8062) in Combination With Taxane and Platinum in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Primary Objective:

* To demonstrate progression free survival (PFS) improvement for ombrabulin compared to placebo, in combination with taxane and platinum, as first line treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Secondary Objective:

* To determine overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, safety, and evaluate potential biomarkers, pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of ombrabulin and its main metabolite, RPR258063, using a population approach.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: ombrabulin (AVE8062)|DRUG: placebo
Progression free survival (PFS), approximately 1.5 years
Overall survival (OS), approximately 1.5 years|Objective response rate (OR), approximately 1.5 years
Patients will be treated for a maximum of 6 cycles (21 days each), in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression or consent withdrawal. All patients will be followed for disease progression documentation and for patient status until up to one year after the primary analysis cutoff date.
