Reducing 30-Day Sepsis Readmissions: Impact of a Post Discharge Education Program
This study will advance the knowledge in the field by determining the effectiveness of discharge education regarding prevention of a new infection which is the highest cause of readmission for sepsis patient. In evaluating the impact care teams will develop a clearer link between specific home-based education interventions and infection prevention. This study is an exploratory study designed to identify whether patient education through an innovative teaching method can have an impact on readmissions. This study may the first of several based on findings from this initial, exploratory study.
