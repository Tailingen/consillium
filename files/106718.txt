Alcohol and Tobacco Consumption in Patients With Head and Neck or Lung Cancer : Interest of an Addiction Treatment
This is a multicenter, interventional, randomized study among patients with a first lung or head \& neck cancer who are still active smokers Â± alcohol misusers.The study will aim to compare the systematic implementation of an addiction treatment program initiated at hospital and integrated to the initial cancer treatment program (Arm A), versus the as-usual procedure, which consists in recommendations to follow an addiction treatment program (Arm B)
Upper Aerodigestive Tract Neoplasms|Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: integrated addiction treatment program|PROCEDURE: standard of care
Difference in the rates of tobacco abstinent patients at 12 months between arms A and B, to be a "tobacco abstinent" patient has to :

* be a smoker at the inclusion (M0)
* declare to be weaned at M6
* not declare a consumption between M6 and M12
* a CO rate less than 10 ppm measured with a CO test at M6 and M12

We compare the two arms in term of tobacco abstinent patients rate., 1 year
Frequency of alcohol and tobacco consumptions during the study, We considere the tobacco and alcohol consumption levels at T0, M3, M6, M12 by the consumption statement and the behaviour change towards tobacco and alcohol, thanks to questionnaires study specific., initial diagnosis, after 3, 6 and 12 months|Percentage of tobacco abstinent patients at 12 months, to be a "tobacco abstinent" patient has to :

* be a smoker at the inclusion (M0)
* declare to be weaned at M6
* not declare a consumption between M6 and M12
* a CO rate less than 10 ppm measured with a CO test at M6 and M12

We calculate the percentage of tobacco abstinent patients at 12 months considering every patient in the trial., 1 year|Difference in the rates of alcohol and tobacco abstinent patients at 12 months depending on whether or not they have received an addiction treatment, We use a specialized monitoring in addictology (tobacco/alcohol) at 12 months according to the arms. The information of a monitoring in addictology will be obtained by the study specific questionnaire at M3, M6, M12, 1 year|Median time between inclusion date and the date of death (from any cause), Time until progression. The time between the date of inclusion and the date of death whatever the cause is., 1 year|Median progression-free time, delay between inclusion date and progression date (clinical or radiological), 1 year|Percentage of Arm A patients who attended the addiction treatment program after the first systematic consultation, We note for each patient in arm A if they have at least one addictology specialized consultation after the first consultation which is imposed, during the 12 months, 1 year
* Study proposal at the first medical consultation for therapeutic management of a first upper aerodigestive tract cancer or lung cancer.
* Selection criteria validation
* Collection of an informed consent
* Randomization :

Arm A: Experimental arm : Addiction consultation to the overall cancer treatment

Arm B: standard of care

The completion of questionnaires , the measurement of exhaled carbone monoxide rate using a CO tester for all patients, and the integrated addiction treatment among patients randomized in Arm A will not interfere with the medical treatment of cancer.
