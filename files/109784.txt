A Global Phase III Study of Rilvegostomig or Pembrolizumab Plus Chemotherapy for First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Non-squamous NSCLC
The purpose of ARTEMIDE-Lung03 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig compared to pembrolizumab, both in combination with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, as a first-line treatment of patients with non-squamous mNSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1.
Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Rilvegostomig|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression per RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to approximately 5 years
Landmark overall survival (OS) rates, OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death due to any cause., Up to approximately 5 years|Landmark progression-free survival (PFS) rates, PFS is defined as the time from randomization until radiological progression per RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to approximately 5 years|Time to second progression or death (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization until the earliest of the progression event (following the initial progression event), after the start of the first subsequent therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. The date of the second progression will be recorded by the investigator in the eCRF and defined according to local standard clinical practice., Up to approximately 5 years|Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or confirmed PR, using RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 5 years|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression using RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause (in the absence of progression)., Up to approximately 5 years|Pharmacokinetic (PK) of rilvegostomig, Concentration of rilvegostomig in serum, Up to approximately 5 years|Immunogenicity of rilvegostomig, Presence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs), titer, and neutralizing antibodies for rilvegostomig, Up to approximately 5 years|Patient-reported physical functioning, Proportion of participants with maintained or improved physical functioning as measured by PROMIS PF-SF 8c - 7 day at each time point., Up to approximately 5 years|Patient-reported global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QoL), TTD of GHS/QoL as measured by the EORTC IL172. TTD is defined as time from randomization to the date of first deterioration. Deterioration is defined as a worsening change from baseline that reaches a clinically meaningful change threshold., Up to approximately 5 years|Patient-reported lung cancer symptoms of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), TTD in pulmonary symptoms as measured by the NSCLC-SAQ. TTD is defined as time from randomization to the date of first deterioration., Up to approximately 5 years
This is a Phase III, two-arm, randomized, double-blind, global, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of rilvegostomig compared to pembrolizumab, both in combination with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, as a 1L treatment for patients with non-squamous mNSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 (TC â‰¥ 1%).
