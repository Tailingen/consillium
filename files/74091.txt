Intermittent High-Dose Lapatinib in Tandem With Capecitabine for HER2 Overexpressed/Amplified Metastatic Breast Cancer With Central Nervous System (CNS) Metastases
The purpose of this study is to see if capecitabine can be taken safely with different doses of lapatinib in patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer involving brain (brain metastases) and/or in spinal fluid (leptomeningeal disease).

DRUG: Lapatinib in Tandem With Capecitabine
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), During the standard 3+3, the probability that dose escalation will occur at any stage during MTD determination is a function of the underlying DLT rate at the current dose level. This probability can be calculated as the sum of the binomial probabilities of the following two outcomes that would permit escalation to occur:

1. No DLT observed in the first three patients.
2. One DLT is observed in the first three patients followed by no DLT observed in three additional patients at the same dose level., first 28-day cycle
