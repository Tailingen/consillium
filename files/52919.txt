A Clinical Trial of SIBP-A17 Injection in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumor Patients.
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of SIBP-A17 and determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and phase II recommended dose (RP2D).
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: SIBP-A17
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), During the dose escalation phase, the first treatment cycle (21 days after the first dose) after the subject's administration was determined by the investigator to have occurred events related to the investigational drug as specified in the protocol., Day 126|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) refers to the highest dose at which DLT does not occur in \<1/3 of subjects or ≤ 1/6 of subjects during the DLT observation period., Day 260|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), Recommended Phase II Dose The optimal dose for phase II clinical trial research obtained based on clinical trial results of phase I and literature review., Day 518|Adverse Events (AE), That is adverse events, any adverse events that occurred to the participant during the study period., 28 days
AUC (Area Under The Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve), It shows the degree to which a drug is absorbed and used in the body., 15 days|Cmax (Peak Plasma Concentration), It shows the highest plasma concentration of a drug that can be achieved after administration., 15 days|ORR(Objective Response Rate), The proportion of participants whose tumor volume shrinks to a predetermined value and maintains the minimum time limit and is the sum of complete and partial responses., 5 months|DCR (Disease control rate), In clinical trials, the percentage of participants with advanced or metastatic cancer who responded fully to cancer treatment, partially responded, and had stable disease., 5 months|PFS(Progression-free survival), The time between the onset of randomization and the onset (of any aspect) of tumor progression or death (from any cause)., 5 months|OS (overall survival), From randomization to time of death due to any cause., 5 months|Δ QTcF, Changes in Δ QTcF (post administration QTcF baseline QTcF) at various time points after administration., 15 days
This study is an open, dose expanding, and indication expanding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, QT/QTc interval effects and explore potential biomarkers of SIBP-A17 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This study is divided into two stages and is planned to be set up six dose groups, including 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 mg/kg. The first stage is the dose escalation stage, adopting an improved "3+3" dose escalation design, with a planned enrollment of 14-36 participants. The second stage is the dose expansion stage, where one or two doses are selected to enter the dose expansion phase (4 indication cohorts). 20-40 late-stage solid tumor participants are enrolled in each dose group for dose expansion, and 80-160 participants are planned to be enrolled in the dose expansion phase.

After obtaining certain safety and pharmacokinetic data during the dose escalation phase, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) can discuss and decide whether to synchronize dose expansion.
