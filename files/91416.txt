Pilot Study Of Anti-Programmed Death Ligand-1 (Anti-PD-L1, Atezolizumab) In Asymptomatic Myeloma
The purpose of this pilot study is to gain initial insights into the biologic and clinical effects of Atezolizumab in patients with Asymptomatic Multiple Myeloma (AMM). The data may provide novel insights into anti-PDL-1-induced immunologic changes, which could potentially be relevant to its future development in Multiple Myeloma (MM) and other indications.
Asymptomatic Myeloma
DRUG: Atezolizumab (1200mg via IV infusion)
Prevalence of anti-SOX2 reactive T cells after Anti-PDL1 therapy, Presence or absence of SOX2 cells before and after anti-PDL1 therapy followed up to 1 year will be measured using antigen dependant stimulation., Up to 1 year
