Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations (PAVMs) in Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT)
Computed tomography (CT) is the modality of choice to characterize pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) in patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The objective of this study was to determine if CT findings were associated with frequency of brain abscess and ischaemic stroke.

This retrospective study included patients with HHT-related PAVMs. CT results, PAVM presentation (unique, multiple, disseminated or diffuse), the number of PAVMs and the largest feeding artery size, were correlated to prevalence of ischaemic stroke and brain abscess.

OTHER: Data collection from standard follow up
Yearly change in chest Computed Tomography (CT) results in patients with Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT)., The presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) (unique, multiple, disseminated or diffuse, the number of PAVMs and the largest feeding artery size) upon examination by CT could be correlated to the frequency of brain abscess and ischemic stroke in patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). These patients underwent a yearly CT scan to check for PAVM presence., Every year for 10 years
