Feasibility of Exosome Analysis in Cerebrospinal Fluid During the Diagnostic Workup of Metastatic Meningitis (Exo-LCR)
The investigators are interested in one of the most frequent tumor types causing leptomeningeal metastasis in order to investigate whether a profile can be established by a high-throughput clinical proteomic approach. All the data acquired will allow a tailored and promising approach to improve the knowledge of metastatic tumor meningitis.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Consultation|PROCEDURE: Cerebral and medullary MRI, lumbar puncture, CSF sampling|BIOLOGICAL: biological test
CSF protein composition, The CSF proteomic profile will be obtained by an unsupervised bioinformatics analysis of the CSF collected during the initial diagnostic workup for all patients and in case of renewal of the initial lumbar puncture if the 1st one was not exploitable for the CSF cytological analysis.

The bioinformatics analysis will allow to obtain the protein composition and to establish proteomic profile., 36 months|cytological analysis of the CSF, The cytological analysis of the CSF will allow to obtain 3 possible results: Positive / Negative / Equivocal at the time of the initial diagnostic workup for all patients and in case of renewal of the initial LP if the 1st one was not exploitable for the cytological analysis of the CSF, for all patients., 36 months
The primary objective is to describe on an exploratory basis the association between the type of proteomic profile from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microvesicles (from unsupervised bioinformatics analysis) and CSF cytology analysis (positive, negative, equivocal) in breast cancer patients with suspected leptomeningeal metastases, on initial CSF samples (hereafter referred to as initial proteomic profile and initial cytology).
