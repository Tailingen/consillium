A Study of Evorpacept (ALX148) With Cetuximab and Pembrolizumab for Refractory Microsatellite Stable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This Phase 2 clinical study will evaluate evorpacept (ALX148) in combination with cetuximab and pembrolizumab for refractory microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer
Microsatellite Stable Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Evorpacept (ALX148)|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Recommended dose (RD) of evorpacept (ALX148) in combination with cetuximab and pembrolizumab 1.(mg/kg), To determine the recommended dose (RD) of evorpacept (ALX148) in combination with cetuximab and pembrolizumab, 4 months|Objective response rate (ORR, per RECIST v1.1) (%), To determine the objective response rate (ORR), defined as partial response or complete response, with evorpacept (ALX148), cetuximab, and pembrolizumab using RECIST v1.1 in patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who have progressed on at least two lines of standard therapy, 6 months
Disease control rate per RECIST v1.1. (%), To determine the disease-control rate (DCR), defined as stable disease, partial response, or complete response with evorpacept (ALX148), cetuximab, and pembrolizumab using RECIST v1.1, 24 months|Duration of response per RECIST v1.1. (months), To determine the duration of response (DOR) with evorpacept (ALX148), cetuximab, and pembrolizumab, defined as the time from response (partial or complete) to progression, 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS, per RECIST v1.1) (months), To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) with evorpacept (ALX148), cetuximab, and pembrolizumab, defined as the time from enrollment to the first observation of progression using RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, 48 months|Overall survival (OS), To determine the overall survival (OS) with evorpacept (ALX148), cetuximab, and pembrolizumab, defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause, 48 months|First cycle dose-limiting toxicities in the safety run-in stage, To determine the first cycle dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of evorpacept (ALX148), cetuximab, and pembrolizumab in stage 1, 4 months|Safety and tolerability according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of evorpacept (ALX148), cetuximab, and pembrolizumab, defined and graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0, 48 months
This is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm phase II clinical trial (with safety run-in) evaluating the combination of evorpacept (ALX148), cetuximab, and pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic microsatellite stable colorectal cancer who have progressed on at least 2 lines of systemic therapy. A subset of patients will undergo study-related biopsies. There will be a safety run-in stage followed by a dose expansion stage. Patients in both stages will continue to receive study therapy until disease progression according to RECIST v1.1.
