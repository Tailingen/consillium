Glumetinib Combined With Toripalimab in the Treatment of Relapsed or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.
This is an open-label, multicenter Phase Ib/II registration clinical study, consisting of two parts: the Phase Ib dose-climbing study and the Phase II efficacy exploration study.

Phase Ib :

Phase Ib is a multicenter, single-arm study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of SCC244 combined with Toripalimab in patients with advanced relapsed or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have failed standard therapy.At the start of the study, MTPI2 was used to guide toxicity monitoring and dose climbing in combination with Toripalimab (240mg intravenous every 3 weeks), with 5 subjects planned to be enrolled in each dose group.The SMC will decide whether to add the new dose level and sample size based on the latest study data available.The MTD or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be determined during the phase Ib study on the basis of the latest availablestudy data, and the phase II study will commence once the MTD or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is confirmed.

Phase II:

Phase II is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study evaluating the efficacy and safety of a recommended dose of glumetinib combined with Toripalimab in patients with relapsed, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have failed standard therapy.The SMC determined the dose group for the Phase II study based on the safety and initial efficacy data of the Phase Ib subjects.Approximately 62 evaluable subjects will be enrolled, with the recommended dose of glutmetinib once daily and Toripalimab 240mg every 3 weeks.

Every 21 days is a treatment cycle until the subject develops disease progression,intolerable toxicity, has used JS001 for 2 years, the informed consent is withdrawn, the investigator considers that the subject should not continue the medication, lost to follow-up, death occurs, or the study is terminated, whichever comes first.

(Phase Ib), During the screening period, it is necessary to repeat the inspection three times before the first administration, with an interval of about 5 minutes between each time.

If the inspection time in the screening period is ≤ 7 days before the first administration, the review may not be necessary according to the judgment of the investigator. Check once a week in the 1st cycle of phase Ib, check once on the 1st and 15th days of the 2nd cycle, and check once every 3 weeks from the 3rd cycle.
