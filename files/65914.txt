A Study of HSK29116 in Adults With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies
This is a first-in-human Phase 1a/1b multicenter, open-label oncology study designed to evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activity of HSK29116 in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies.
Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Malignancies
DRUG: HSK29116
Number of Participants with Protocol Specified Dose-Limiting Toxicities, Phase 1a, 1 year|To establish the MTD and/or recommended Phase 1b dose of HSK29116, Phase 1a, 1 year|Number of Participants with Adverse Events and Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities, Phase 1a/1b, Up to 3 years
Pharmacokinetic(PK) Profile of HSK29116: Maximum Serum Concentration, Phase1a/1b-Sampling of the first dose, pre and post-dose at selected cycle, At the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Overall response rate(ORR) as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1a/1b, Up to 3 Years|Duration of response(DoR) as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1a/1b, Up to 3 Years|Progression-free survival(PFS) as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1a/1b, Up to 3 Years|Time to response(TTR) as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1a/1b, Up to 3 Years
This study is divided into 2 parts. Phase 1a is a dose escalation to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HSK29116 in adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies, who have required and received at least 2 prior systemic therapy and for whom no other therapies are known to provide clinical benefit. Phase 1b will investigate the efficacy of HSK29116 at the dose selected in Phase 1a in up to 3 cohorts of patients with R/R B-cell malignancy indications who have received at least 2 prior systemic therapy：

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)； Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)； Other B-cell malignancies (they will be selected according to the preliminary results of Phase Ia)
