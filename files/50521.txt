Pain Prevalence and Risk Factors Among Sarcoma/Melanoma Oncology Patients in an Outpatients Setting
The primary objective of this research project is to estimate the number of patients with sarcoma or melanoma attending an outpatients clinic that are in pain or have unmet pain needs.
Sarcoma|Melanoma
The proportion of patients with significant pain and the proportion of patients with a negative score on the pain management index (PMI)
Proportion of patients with neuropathic pain.|Potential predictors of pain. The variables tested as potential risk factors will be age, tumour type, gender and treatment type.|We will also seek to identify potential predictors of pain intensity in patients that do have pain. In addition to the risk factors already mentioned above, duration and cause of pain will also be tested in this case as potential pain predictors.
