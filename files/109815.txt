The Risk Stratification of Papillary Thyroid Cancer With AUS/FLUS by FNA
Purpose: To investigate the clinical characteristics of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) with Bethesda category III (AUS/FLUS) by fine needle aspiration (FNA) and to assisted the precision treatment.

Methods:A total of 290 patients who underwent thyroidectomies or thyroid lobectomies from August 2015 to September 2020, following a diagnosis of Bethesda category III (AUS/FLUS) from preoperative thyroid FNA were investigated.

Groups: In order to investigate the clinopathologic characteristics, the patients, were grouped according to Cytology,Gender, Tumor size.

Extra-thyroid extension, Whether there is extension of the primary tumor outside of the thyroid capsule and invasion into surrounding structures. Analyze the correlation between extrathyroid infiltration and tumor size., from 2015 to 2020
Multifocality, thyroid cancer lesions is more than two;analyze the correlation between multifocality and tumor size., from 2015 to 2020
Purpose: To investigate the clinical characteristics of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) with Bethesda category III (AUS/FLUS) by fine needle aspiration (FNA) and to assisted the precision treatment.

Methods:A total of 1739 cases diagnosed with Bethesda category III (AUS/FLUS) by FNA from August 2015 to September 2020 were reviewed, and 523 patients received thyroidectomy or lobectomy. 290 patients were diagnosed with PTC and investigated retrospectively.

Groups: In order to investigate the clinopathologic characteristics, the patients, were grouped according to Cytology,Gender, Tumor size.as follows:AUS and FLUS\&AUS/FLUS;male and female; tumor sizeâ‰¤1cm and\>1cm.
