Maintenance Bevacizumab Only or Bevacizumab Plus Metronomic Chemotherapy in Advanced Colorectal Cancer
This study consist of 4-months induction first-line chemotherapy with the G.O.N.O. FOLFOXIRI regimen plus bevacizumab followed by maintenance with bevacizumab or bevacizumab plus metronomic chemotherapy (with capecitabine and cyclophosphamide) in mCRC patients.

The main objective of this study is to preliminarily evaluate the potential effects of the combination of a metronomic chemotherapy with capecitabine and cyclophosphamide to maintenance bevacizumab on pharmacodynamic and clinical parameters among mCRC patients.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Maintenance:BEVACIZUMAB|DRUG: Maintenance:BEVACIZUMAB+CAPECITABINE+CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE
progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive,on study and progression free at the time of the analysis.Alive patients having no tumor assessments after baseline will have time to event endpoint censored on the date of randomization.Disease status will be evaluated according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., up to 4 years
Best overall response rate (ORR), It is defined as the percentage of patients,relative to the total of enrolled subjects,achieving a complete or partial response, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria,during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment.The determination of clinical response will be based on investigator reported measurements that will be subsequently confirmed by a central review.Responses will be evaluated every 8 weeks.Patients who do not have an on-study assessment will be included in the analysis as non responders., up to 4 years|Duration of response, it is defined as the time from the date when measurement criteria are met for CR or PR until first documentation of objective disease progression, up to 4 years|Resection rate, it is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, undergoing secondary R0 resection of metastases during treatment or after its completion.

Secondary R0 surgery is defined as microscopically margin-free complete surgical removal of all residual disease, allowed by tumoral shrinkage and/or disappearance of one or more lesions., up to 4 years|Time to strategy failure (TSF), it is defined as the time from the day of randomization to one of the followings:

1. progression during FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab or during a modified FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab regimen; OR
2. progression and decision to not administer FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab or a modified FOLFOXIRI + bevacizumab regimen; OR
3. introduction of a new agent not included in the study treatment according to randomization arm; OR
4. death; whichever occurs first.For patients still on-treatment at the time of analysis, the time to strategy failure will be censored on the last date the patients were known to be alive., up to 4 years|Time to 2nd progressive disease, it is defined as the time from randomization to second documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

Time to 2nd progressive disease will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on-study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive, on study and second progression-free at the time of the analysis. Alive patients having no tumor assessments after baseline will have time to event endpoint censored on the date of randomization., up to 4 years|Overall survival (OS), it is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death due to any cause. For patients still alive at the time of analysis, the OS time will be censored on the last date the patients were known to be alive., up to 4 years|Toxicity rate, it is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, experiencing a specific adverse event, according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 4.0), during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment., up to 4 years|Overall toxicity rate, it is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, experiencing any adverse event, according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 4.0), during the induction and the maintenance phases of treatment., up to 4 years
