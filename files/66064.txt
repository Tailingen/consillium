Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to be a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE was reported per protocol for the first course of treatment., Up to ~13 months (through Final Analysis database cut-off date of 19-Sept-2017)|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to be a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE.

Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by Central Radiologists' Review, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, without evidence of progression based on non-target or new lesions) as assessed by central radiologists' review per RECIST 1.1 which is modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The percentage of participants who experienced a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by central radiologists' review was reported for each arm per protocol for the first course of treatment., Up to ~13 months (through Final Analysis database cut-off date of 19-Sept-2017)|ORR Per Immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) as Assessed by Central Radiologists' Review, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had confirmed responses assessed using RECIST 1.1 before PD or an immune-related Complete Response (irCR: Disappearance of all target lesions and non-target) or an immune-related Partial Response (irPR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, stability of non-target lesions no new lesions) after a single PD per irRECIST as assessed by central radiologists' review. Per RECIST 1.1, CR or PR was confirmed by repeated radiographic assessment no less than 4 weeks from the first documented response. If site-assessed PD was verified by the central imaging vendor, the site could elect to continue treatment, repeat imaging ≥4 weeks later and assess tumor response or confirmed progression per irRECIST. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 or irCR or irPR per irRECIST as assessed by central radiologists' review was reported for each arm per protocol for first course of treatment., Up to ~13 months (through Final Analysis database cut-off date of 19-Sept-2017)|Duration of Response (DOR) Per RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by Central Radiologists' Review, For participants who demonstrated a confirmed CR (disappearance of all lesions) or confirmed PR (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by central radiologists' review, DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a CR or PR until disease progression or death. RECIST 1.1 has been modified for this study to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The DOR per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by central radiologists' review for all participants who experienced a confirmed CR or PR was reported for each arm per protocol for the first course of treatment., Up to ~13 months (through Final Analysis database cut-off date of 19-Sept-2017)|DOR Per irRECIST as Assessed by Central Radiologists' Review, For participants who demonstrated confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions) or PR (≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 or CR or PR after a single PD, DOR was defined as the time from the first documented CR or PR, or irCR or irPR, until an immune-related progressive disease (irPD) or death. DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis was to be censored at the date of their last tumor assessment.
