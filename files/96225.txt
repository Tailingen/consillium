Lopinavir and Ritonavir in Improving Immune Response to Vaccines in Patients With Complete Remission Following A Bone Marrow Transplant for Hodgkin Lymphoma
RATIONALE: HIV protease inhibitors, including Lopinavir/Ritonavir have intrinsic anti-apoptotic properties in addition to their anti-viral effect on HIV. This anti-apoptotic effect may boost the immune system to help the body create a better immune response to vaccines. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial studies giving lopinavir and ritonavir together in improving immune response to vaccines in patients with complete remission following a bone marrow transplant for Hodgkin lymphoma.

Comparison of TREC positive recent thymic emigrants, and naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers between treatment groups, 90 days
Comparison of post-vaccination anti-rabies antibody titers between treatment groups, 90 days|Comparison of post-vaccination cytokine levels, including IL1, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL7, IL8, IL10, IL12, INFgamma, TNFalpha, between treatment groups, 90 days|Comparison of post-vaccination anti-rabies ELISPOT reaction between treatment groups, 90 days
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare TREC positive recent thymic emigrants, and naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers between treatment groups. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare post-vaccination anti-rabies antibody titers between treatment groups. II. Compare post-vaccination cytokine levels, including IL1, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL7, IL8, IL10, IL12, INFgamma, TNFalpha, between treatment groups. III. Compare post-vaccination anti-rabies ELISPOT reaction between treatment groups. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral lopinavir and oral ritonavir twice daily for 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive no therapy. All patients then receive a neo-antigen rabies vaccine.
