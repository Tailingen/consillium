A Dose-escalation Study of LUNA18 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors (With Expansion).
This is a Phase 1 dose-escalation and cohort expansion study that will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary activity of LUNA18 when administered as a single agent or in combination with other anti-cancer drugs in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
