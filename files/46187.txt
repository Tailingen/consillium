XELOX Combined With Fruquintinib and Sintilimab Regimen Conversion Therapy for Gastric Cancer/Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma Only With Liver and/or Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Metastasis, a Prospective Single-arm, Multicenter Study
Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of morbidity and mortality among malignant tumors in China, and less than 30% of patients can be cured by surgery. Liver metastasis, retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis and peritoneal metastasis are the most common metastatic sites of gastric cancer, which are also the important causes of death. Improve the conversion of oligonucleotides transfer patients resection rate, prolonged progression-free survival of these patients, is an important direction to improve survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer;

This study was a prospective, single-arm, multi-center clinical study. We plan to treat patients with gastric cancer/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma with liver and/or retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis only with XELOX regimen + fruquinitinib + sintilimab for 4-6 cycles before surgery/ablation conversion therapy to achieve tumor-free status as far as possible. To explore the value of conversion therapy in patients with intrahepatic oligometastasis of gastric cancer.
