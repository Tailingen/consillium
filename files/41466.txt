Adherence to Exercise and Dietary Intervention in Cancer Patients
Intervention programs in cancer patients have been proposed with the aim of improving outcome. Bearing in mind that compliance is a limiting factor to the benefit provided from exercise and diet, assessing adherence to these interventions is paramount before pursuing further studies. Therefore the purpose of this study was to study the adherence of gastrointestinal cancer patients to a Combined Exercise and Dietary Intervention (CEDI) during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.
