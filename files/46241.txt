A Novel Application of 2% Lidocaine Injection for Male Rigid cycstoscopy-a Patient-blinded Randomised Trial
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about a novel application of lidocaine injection in male patients who needs rigid cycstoscopy test. The main question it aims to answer is:Does New Application of Lidocaine Liquid Provide Pain Relief for Patients During Cystoscopy? Before the cycstoscopy,Participants will be randomly divided into three different anesthesia mode groups,namely are Group A (intraurethral lidocaine gel alone), Group B (intraurethral lidocaine gel + lidocaine 2% injection), and Group C (intraurethral lidocaine gel + liquid paraffinl).Patients only need to prepare and cooperate according to routine surgical operationsï¼Œwhich is group B or group C.

Access the pain score using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Access the pain score assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during the procedure, The procedure was evaluated using the visual analogue scale immediately afterward (referred to as "during the procedure" for the study's purposes) and again five minutes later.
Postoperative complications, The second outcomes were included parameters such as field of view occlusion, duration of pain, hematuria duration, and lower urinary tract symptoms post-procedure., Within three days after surgery.
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy of a novel application of lidocaine injection in alleviating pain for male patients undergoing rigid cystoscopy procedures. Rigid cystoscopy is a common diagnostic examination used to visualize the interior of the bladder and urethra. However, it can be associated with discomfort and pain for patients.

The central question driving this study is whether the new application of lidocaine liquid can provide effective pain relief during cystoscopy. To address this question, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three anesthesia mode groups: Group A, which will receive intraurethral lidocaine gel alone; Group B, which will receive intraurethral lidocaine gel along with lidocaine 2% injection; and Group C, which will receive intraurethral lidocaine gel along with liquid paraffin.

Those assigned to Group B or Group C will only need to prepare and cooperate according to routine surgical operations. This standardizes the pre-procedural preparation process across the study groups, ensuring consistency in the approach to anesthesia administration.

By comparing the pain levels experienced by patients in each group during cystoscopy, the study aims to determine the effectiveness of the new lidocaine application method in providing pain relief. This information will be crucial in improving the patient experience during cystoscopy procedures and potentially optimizing anesthesia protocols for future clinical practice.
