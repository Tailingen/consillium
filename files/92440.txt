Cabozantinib in Advanced Salivary Gland Cancer Patients
Phase 2 clinical trial on the efficacy of cabozantinib in locally advanced, recurrent and/or metastatic salivary gland cancer patients.
Salivary Gland Cancer
DRUG: Cabozantinib
overall response rate, Response will be measured according to RECIST version 1.1, the overall response rate is defined as the sum of the complete remissions plus partial responses. The best response will be used in each patient, every 8 weeks (first year of treatment) and every 12 weeks (second year of treatment) a CT/MRI scan will be made to asses the response rate until progressive disease
progression free survival, progression free survival is defined as time from study enrollment until disease progression or death. Outcome will be scored as 'progressed' or 'censored' according to the FDA guidance for industry of clinical trial endpoints., every 8 weeks (first year of treatment) and every 12 weeks (second year of treatment) a CT/MRI scan will be made to asses PFS until progressive disease|overall survival, overall survival is defined as time from study enrollment until date of death of any cause. Analysis of OS will be done at the end of the study (study related follow-up will be until 3 years after start of treatment), Every OPD visit (starting with every 2 weeks, increasing to every 12 weeks after 1 year)|duration of response, duration of response is defined as time from study enrollment until date of documented tumor progression or death. Only patients with a CR or PR will be included in the assessment of duration of response., every 8 weeks (first year of treatment) and every 12 weeks (second year of treatment) a CT/MRI scan will be made to asses duration of response until progressive disease|clinical benefit rate, defined as the sum of complete remissions, partial responses, and patients with stable disease for \>6 months., every 8 weeks (first year of treatment) and every 12 weeks (second year of treatment) a CT/MRI scan will be made to asses the clinical benefit rate until progressive disease|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, adverse events will be reported as descriptive statistics in a table, through study completion. At every visit AE's will be recorded. Scheduled visits will be planned 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 68, 80, 92 and 104 weeks after start of treatment|quality of life based on the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, patients are asked to fill in the questionnaires in week 0 (before start of treatment), week 8, 16, 24, 40, 56, and at progressive disease (up to 104 weeks after start of study medication).|quality of life based on the EORTC QLQ-H&N35 questionnaire, patients are asked to fill in the questionnaires in week 0 (before start of treatment), week 8, 16, 24, 40, 56, and at progressive disease (up to 104 weeks after start of study medication).|quality of life based on the PSSHN questionnaire, patients are asked to fill in the questionnaire in week 0 (before start of treatment), week 8, 16, 24, 40, 56, and at progressive disease (up to 104 weeks after start of study medication)..|pain level assessed by the VAS(visual analog scale) questionnaire, scale range 0-10, in which a higher score represents more pain, patients are asked to fill in the questionnaire in week 0 (before start of treatment), week 8, 16, 24, 40, 56, and at progressive disease (up to 104 weeks after start of study medication).|response rate with continues tumor shrinkage end-points, response rate depicted in a waterfall plot, every 8 weeks (first year of treatment) and every 12 weeks (second year of treatment) a CT/MRI scan will be made to asses the response rate until progressive disease|circulating tumor DNA levels, circulating tumor DNA levels will be assessed to evaluate whether treatment response and disease progression can be predicted., circulating tumor DNA levels will be measured at baseline, at week 2, week 4 and before every evaluation CT/MRI scan.|correlation of c-MET immunohistochemical score with treatment response, c-MET immunohistochemical score ranges from 0 to 300., c-MET will be measured once (before treatment). Response will be measured every 8 weeks (first year) and every 12 weeks (second year of treatment)
Rationale: Salivary gland cancer (SGC) is a rare cancer with 24 histological subtypes. Treatment options for locally advanced and/or metastatic SGC are limited. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor cabozantinib suppresses tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and has been approved for renal cell carcinoma and thyroid cancer. Cabozantinib may also be of value in advanced SGC because c-MET, one of the targets of cabozantinib, is frequently overexpressed in SGC.

Objectives: To assess the objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), toxicity, and quality of life (QoL) of patients with advanced SGC treated with cabozantinib in 3 cohorts: salivary duct carcinoma (SDC), adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), other SGC's.

Study design: Single arm, single center, phase II clinical trial in 3 cohorts: ACC, SDC and other SGC's.

Study population: Patient with c-MET positive, locally advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic SGC.

Intervention: Cabozantinib tablets 60 mg once daily until progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or investigator and/or patient decision to withdraw for a maximum duration of 2 years.
