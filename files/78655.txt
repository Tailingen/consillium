Genomic Grade Index (GGI): Feasibility in Routine Practice and Impact on Treatment Decisions in Early Breast Cancer
In this prospective study the investigators sought to evaluate the feasibility of using the genomic signature - Genomic Grade Index (GGI) - in routine clinical practice and its impact on treatment recommendations.
Invasive Breast Cancer
OTHER: Sampling of tumor tissue|OTHER: Sampling of tumor tissue after breast cancer surgery|PROCEDURE: Sampling of tumor tissue after breast cancer surgery
The success rate in obtaining the Genomic Grade Index in clinical practice, To evaluate the feasibility of implementing Genomic Grade Index in community hospitals in Belgium for breast cancer patients diagnosed with node negative and 1-3 node positive early-stage invasive breast cancer, 12 months
The impact of Genomic Grade Index results on adjuvant treatment decision, The secondary objective was to evaluate the impact of Genomic Grade Index on adjuvant treatment decisions for patients with early breast cancer. This was done by comparing physicians' treatment recommendations before having knowledge of the GGI test results to recommendations with a hypothetical GG-1 and GG-3 result and to the treatment ultimately administered after discussion with the patient., 12 months
The success rate of reporting Genomic Grade Index results, To test the success rate of reporting GGI, a minimum sample size of 137 was calculated to have a power of 90% at a one-sided significance level of 5% using an empirical estimate of variance (null hypothesis H0: p â‰¤ 0.70 vs. alternative hypothesis HA: p â‰¥ 0.80)., 12 months
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing Genomic Grade Index (GGI) in community hospitals in Belgium for breast cancer patients with node negative and 1-3 node positive early breast cancer. GGI would be considered a feasible genomic test if results were obtained in \> 70% of evaluated patients.
