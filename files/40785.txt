Clinical & Pathological Studies of Upper Gastrointestinal Carcinoma
Our research of the biology of upper gastrointestinal cancers involves the study of tissue samples and cells from biopsies of persons with gastric or esophageal cancer or blood samples from upper gastrointestinal cancer patients and persons at high inherited risk for these cancers. We hope to learn the role genes and proteins play in the development of gastric and esophageal cancer.
