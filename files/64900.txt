Impact of a New Plant-based High-energy Oral Nutritional Supplement on Nutritional Outcomes in Malnourished Patients
This study aims to compare nutritional outcomes in terms of percentage of weight gain between a new planted-based high-energy ONS and a standard high-energy ONS with animal protein (cow's mil protein) in patients at malnutrition according to Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria.

Change in weight, Change in weight percentage, Changes between baseline and final visit (12 weeks).|Improvement in nutritional status, Improvement in nutritional status according to the GLIM criteria. A change in classification category from grade 2 of malnutrition to grade 1 or not meet GLIM criteria, as well as a change from grade 1 to not meet GLIM criteria are considered an improvement., From the baseline to the final visit (12 weeks)
Change in muscle strength, Measured by dynamometry, From the baseline to final visit (12 weeks)|Change in calf circumference, From baseline to final visit (12 week)|Percentage of compliance, Taking into account the number of bottles per day taken, the ml of product and the ml left over., During the study follow up|Changes in the gastrointestinal symptom scale (GSRS), Total score, From the baseline to final visit (12 week)|ONS Satisfaction, Patients satisfaction taking ONS will be considered if a patient indicates a score of at least 8 points for overall satisfaction question., Final visit (12 week)
Due to the increasingly pressing need to develop an oral nutritional supplement (ONS) that does not contain animal ingredients, Fortimel PlantBased, suitable for patients with Disease-Related Malnutrition or who wish to avoid or reduce the consumption of animal products for dietary or lifestyle reasons, is being promoted. At the same time, it is also a therapeutic option to be considered in the population with allergy or intolerance to cow's milk protein. Therefore, the aim is to offer an adapted therapeutic nutritional solution that guarantees nutritional results that are not inferior than ONS with animal protein (cow's milk protein).

This study was designed as an open-label randomized controlled non-inferiority trial with two arms: a new planted-based ONS (Fortimel PlantBased) as the intervention arm and standard ONS (Fortimel Energy) as the control arm, both high-energy formulas (1.5 kcal/m; 200ml).

The study will be carried out in patients at malnutrition according to Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, who need to supplement their diet by taking a high-energy ONS for at least 12 weeks. These patients will be treated and follow-up by the Endocrinology and Nutrition services of 6 public hospitals in Spain.
