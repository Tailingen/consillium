Exploring the Risk Factors for Colorectal Cancer in Our General Population Using Asian Pacific Screening Score: a Survey From Pakistan
In Pakistan, due to the lack of a National based cancer registry exact number of CRC cases is unknown. However, minimal data that is present in literature shows an increase in CRC cases with a concerning increase in incidence in younger age groups11. This makes it pertinent to understand current pattern of CRC and its risk factors from a local perspective. This will direct future strategies in an attempt to reduce the incidence and mortality associated with CRC in our general population.
