Study of the Response to Irradiation on Prostatic Explants ex Vivo, as a Predictive Factor of the Clinical Response to Irradiation of Prostate Cancers
Of the 50,000 prostate cancers that occur each year in France, more than half will benefit from curative radiotherapy, alone or in combination with hormone therapy from 6 months to 3 years depending on the stage of the disease. At present, there are few ways to predict the response to this irradiation.

Evaluating the early response of tumor tissue to irradiation could predict the final response to treatment. It is difficult to offer biopsies during treatment for reasons of patient comfort. This is why this study consists in analysing transcriptomic and protein responses (immunohistochemistry) to irradiation on ex vivo prostate explants. These explants will be irradiated after culture and the transcriptional and immunohistochemical changes analysed before and after irradiation to determine an early tumor tissue response profile to irradiation.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: prostate biopsies
biopsy tumor response, The centralized anatomopathological study of prostate biopsies will classify patients into good responders (absence of viable tumour cells) and poor responders (persistence of viable tumour cells)., 24 months after radiotherapy
Change in Biochemical response to radiotherapy., Biological response to radiotherapy the biological response to radiotherapy is assessed by measuring serum PSA levels according to Phoenix criteria, nadir 2 ng/ml, every 6 months for a maximum total of 24 months|prostatic Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Prostate MRI 2 years after the end of radiotherapy, used to identify the area affected by the tumor, 24 months after radiotherapy
