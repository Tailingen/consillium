Safety and Toxicity Study of Sorafenib in Patients With Kidney Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and toxicity levels of Dose Escalated Sorafenib in the treatment of patients with renal cancer.
Carcinoma, Renal Cell
DRUG: Sorafenib
Tumor progression rate by RECIST criteria, restaging every 8 weeks
Overall response rate, restaging every 8 weeks|Time to progression and overall survival, restaging every 8 weeks
Because tumors may have multiple mechanisms to induce angiogenesis, blockade with sorafenib may demonstrate efficacy. Doses of sorafenib (400 mg b.i.d.) as a single agent is with minimal toxicity, presents an opportunity to explore a more intensive drug administration. This study will allow individual patient titration (e,g,, intrapatient dose escalation) as per protocol.

This provides the basis for the dose escalation development of sorafenib. The study is designed to evaluate the ability for patients to dose escalate. Secondary endpoints include; response, time to progression, and overall survival in patients with MRCC. Tissue correlation to evaluate the impact of expression of receptor on clinical outcome will be retrospectively performed. Laboratory correlation of plasma VEGF levels will be correlated and evaluated to clinical outcome.
