Dendritic Cell Vaccines + Dasatinib for Metastatic Melanoma
Current therapeutic approaches available for patients with advanced-stage melanoma remain inadequate, and existing approaches including those involving immunotherapy with cytokines and/or targeted strategies have resulted in disappointingly low rates of durable and complete responses. Correcting immune dysfunction in advanced-stage melanoma patients using tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as dasatinib is proposed to relicense the patient's immune system to respond optimally to specific immunization. The integration of antigens expressed by tumor-associated blood vessel cells provides a means to selectively target the genetically-/antigenically-heterogeneous population of tumor cells in the advanced-stage melanoma patient.

This is a single-center, prospective randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the activity, safety and immune effects of dasatinib given in combination with an autologous type-1 polarized Dendritic Cell (αDC1) vaccine. The current trial represents a randomized Phase 2 study to determine the activity and safety of intradermal (id) administration of αDC1s loaded with a mixture of six TBVA-derived peptides at the time of, or immediately after, an initial therapy cycle with the TKI dasatinib.

Dasatinib will be administered at the standard dose and schedule recommended by the FDA (70 mg BID). The autologous type-I DC vaccine will be administered either prior to, or concomitant with, the initiation of dasatinib administration. All patients will receive dasatinib at a starting dose of 70 mg twice daily by mouth in the outpatient setting approximately every 12 hours, at the same time each day.

The DC vaccine will be administered by a single intradermal injection of approximately 10e7 cells, with all the DCs being administered on days 1 and 15 of every cycle on an outpatient basis in the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Research Center (UPCI-CTRC).

Patients on Arm A will start dasatinib administration on cycle 2, day 1 (week 5), while those patients in Arm B will start dasatinib administration on cycle 1, day 1 (week 1).

Men and women at least 18 years of age must be HLA-A2+ and have histologically confirmed melanoma that is metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable Stage IIIB/C and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.

Note: The outcome measures and time frames (previously) described in the PRS protocol record have been revised and articulated in the results section, to more accurately describe and represent the stated per-protocol investigations and endpoints, quantitatively.
Metastatic Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: DC vaccine|DRUG: Dasatinib
Immune Response Rate, Immune Response is defined as improved peripheral blood CD8+ T cell responses against 3 or more peptide epitopes after active vaccination with Type I-polarized autologous dendritic cell (αDC1) vaccine incorporating 6 tumor blood vessel-associated antigen (TBVA)-derived peptides.

The measure of Immune Response for this study is expressed as a proportion of responders: The number of HLA-A2+ melanoma patients with improved peripheral blood CD8+ T cell responses (responders) divided by the total number of evaluable patients., Up to 13 months
Best Clinical Response, The number of treated patients by best clinical response achieved (tumor measurements via radiologic evaluation) using RECIST 1.1. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) with reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial Response (PR): ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Progressive Disease (PD):≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance ≥1 new lesion(s) is considered progression., Up to 13 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of evaluable patients that achieved either partial or complete responses. Calculation: The number of patients who experienced a Partial Response (PR) + the number of patients who experienced a Complete Response (CR) / total number of response-evaluable patients.

Per RECIST v1.1, Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Up to 13 months|Worst Grade of Any Toxicity, Number of participants and severity grades for treatment-relatedness scores of possibly, probably, or definitely., Up to 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The length of time after study treatment that a patient lives with disease but the disease does not progress. Patients were followed for 1 year after removal from study treatment or until death, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, Progressive Disease is defined as a ≥ 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance ≥1 new lesion(s) is considered progression., Up to 15 months|Overall Survival (OS), The length of time from the start of study treatment, that patients remain alive., Up to 30 months|T Cell-recruiting Chemokine CXCL10/IP-10, Circulating serum concentration (levels) of T cell-recruiting chemokine CXCL10/IP-10 analyzed via ELISA assay.
