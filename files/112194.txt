Comprehensive Genomic Profiling Combined With Real Life Data of "The German-Registry of Incidental Gallbladder Carcinoma"
Multicenter German- Registry of Incidental Gallbladder Carcinoma combining clinical real-world data and comprehensive genomic profiling. The registry collects medical data from clinical observation and molecular data derived from archival tumor tissue samples but does not define any medical intervention nor does it evaluate the efficacy or safety of the treatment decision made by the investigator.
Gallbladder Carcinoma
overall survival, Overall Survival is defined as the time from date of first surgery, to the date of death (due to any cause)., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|proportion of patients with genomic alterations, The primary outcome variable of the molecular sub-project is the proportion of patients with actionable genomic alterations, defined as number of patients with actionable mutations divided by the number of patients with completed F1 CDx testing. Additionally, the two-sided 95% exact confidence interval (Clopper-Pearson) will be given., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
The proportion of patients with actionable genomic alterations in all patients, The proportion of patients with actionable genomic alterations in all patients, including those where no FoundationOne CDx test result may be obtained Â± 95% confidence interval, Through study completion, an average of 2 years
In the largest cohort of IGBC patients ever analysed in such a comprehensive approach

* determine the course of patients in this rare kind of cancer
* combine cGP analysis of histological tumor samples with clinical real-life data to get a comprehensive overview on IGBC patients analysed and evaluate data to identify possible further (targeted) treatment possibilities
* analyze potential risk factors associated with gallbladder carcinoma
* assess the frequency of targetable mutations in IGBC
