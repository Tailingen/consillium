Loop-tipped Guidewire in Selective Biliary Cannulation
1. Background

   * Advanced guidewires with a U-shaped tip could effectively cross the long or multi-occlusive segment smoothly and go into the distal outflow vessel.
   * The guidewire looping technique is a safe and effective method for the recanalization of the occluded lesions in infrapopliteal vessels.
2. Objective - To compare the performance a loop-tipped guidewire with a straight-tipped guidewire in achieving successful deep biliary cannulation.
3. Design

   - Prospective randomized trial.
4. Setting:

   - Tertiary-care medical center
5. Patients

   - This study will involve 192 patients with biliary diseases which require endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
6. Intervention - Cannulation of bile duct by using a loop-tipped guidewire or a straight-tipped guidewire
7. Main outcome measurements - Compare the cannulation success rate, the duration of the cannulation, immediate and late complications.

The cannulation success rate, Up to 9 months, The primary outcome measure will be assessed after the enrollment of patients (anticipated time: 2014/08/30).
The duration of the cannulation, immediate and late complications., Up to 9 months, The secondary outcome measure will be assessed after the enrollment of patients (anticipated time: 2014/08/30).
