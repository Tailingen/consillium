Study to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of CC-91633 (BMS-986397) in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Relapsed or Refractory Higher-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes
Study CC-91633-AML-001 is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation and expansion, first-in-human (FIH) clinical study of CC-91633 (BMS-986397) in participants with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) or in participants with relapsed or refractory higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (R/R HR-MDS). The Dose Escalation part (Part A) of the study will enroll participants with R/R AML and R/R HR-MDS and will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CC-91633 (BMS-986397), administered orally, and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or preliminary recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2D) and schedule. Throughout the study, final decisions on dose escalation/de-escalation will be made by the safety review committee (SRC). Approximately 60 participants may be enrolled in Part A of the study.

The expansion part (Part B) will confirm tolerability of the selected doses and schedules and evaluate whether efficacy is in a range that warrants further clinical development. Approximately 60 response-evaluable subjects per indication (R/R AML or R/R HR-MDS) may be enrolled.

Parts A and B will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up.
