BEHAVIORAL: I-STAMP
Usability, Patients will complete a validated 10-item system usability scale (SUS) with total scores ranging from 0-100, where a score of 100 being the best possible usability score., 2 weeks|E-scale Acceptability, Patients will rate overall acceptability of the application using a modified acceptability e-scale. This 6-item measure asks patients to rate the app on ease of use, understandability, enjoyment, helpfulness, time spent, and overall satisfaction, on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. Items are summed to for a total score, ranging from 6 to 30 with 30 being the highest acceptability score., 2 weeks
The goal of this study is to develop and refine I-STAMP (Integrated Smartphone Technology to Alleviate Malignant Pain), an electronic health record-integrated mobile health (mHealth) application designed to support advanced cancer patients and care teams in pain management.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, surveys, and interviews. It is expected that up to 73 participants will take part in this research study. Activities 1-3 are non-interventional and will be used to collect data for application development.

Activity 4: This activity will be interventional and will be added with a future amendment.
