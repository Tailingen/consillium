Rectus Sheath Block for Analgesia After Gynecological Laparotomy
Thirty subjects undergoing laparotomy for Gynecologic oncology surgery will be prospectively enrolled and will receive a bilateral rectus sheath block (RSB) under ultrasound guidance using 133 mg liposomal bupivacaine and 20 ml bupivacaine 0.25% per side. Cases will be matched in a 1:2 ratio by age, race, insurance status and duration of surgery with historical controls who received postoperative analgesia using thoracic epidural analgesia.
