HAIC in Combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors for Advanced HCC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in combination with PD-1 inhibitors and Lenvatinib in patients with different tumor burden advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT).
