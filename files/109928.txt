ENB-guided Ablation Therapy Combined With VATS in the Treatment of MPLC
The study is designed as a prospective trial whose purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of ENB-guided ablation therapy combined with VATS in the treatment of multiple primary lung cancers (MPLC).
Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: ENB-guided ablation therapy combined with VATS
Evaluation of ablation efficacy, ORR (objective response rate), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) after ablation therapy. Efficacy evaluation is based on Modifield Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST)., From date of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 years.
Evaluation of ablation efficacy, PFS (progression-free survival), PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death for any cause., From date of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 years.|Evaluation of ablation efficacy, OS (overall survival), OS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the death of the patient., From date of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years.|Observation of complications of ablation, Complications refer to the combination of serious adverse events related to the operation during or after the operation, mainly including pneumothorax and bleeding., From date of treatment to the one month after ablation.
Patients will be first screened, and only after meeting all the selection criteria, not meeting any exclusion criteria, and signing the informed consent, could they be enrolled in the group to receive ENB-guided ablation therapy combined with VATS. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.
