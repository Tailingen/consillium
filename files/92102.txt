Paclitaxel Injection (Albumin-bound) for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a systemic cytotoxic drug therapy for non-metastatic tumors before local therapy, Now it has become an important part of standard treatment for a stage II, III, and the first clinical â…£ breast cancer .Both domestic and foreign authoritative guidelines recommend the use of albumin-binding paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer .In addition, clinical studies at home and abroad have preliminarily confirmed the application value and therapeutic benefit of albumin-binding paclitaxel in breast cancer neoadjuvant therapy, and the toxic and side effects can be tolerated.
