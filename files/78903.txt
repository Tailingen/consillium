Achieving Value in Cancer Diagnostics: Blood Versus Tissue Molecular Profiling - a Prospective Canadian Study
Current guidelines in non-small cell lung cancer recommend genomic assessment for mutations in EGFR and BRAF, gene rearrangements in ALK and ROS1, and resistance mutations such as T790M upon progression during EGFR inhibitor therapy. However, obtaining sufficient tumour tissue to test for these molecular alterations, as well as those with emerging targeted therapies, is challenging in lung cancer. A promising method to improve molecular diagnostic testing in lung and other cancers is the use of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from blood samples or liquid biopsies. This multi-centre prospective study will compare blood-based profiling (using the GUARDANT360 assay) to standard of care tissue-based profiling within the Canadian system.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: GUARDANT360
Response rate to first-line therapy, Measure best response to first-line therapy using investigator-assessed RECIST 1.1, including progression free survival and time to treatment failure, in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma using the cfDNA GUARDANT360 assay versus standard of care tissue genotyping., Up to 18 Months
Proportion of patients receiving targeted therapy, Compare the proportion of patients receiving targeted therapy using the cfDNA GUARDANT360 assay versus standard of care tissue genotyping., Up to 18 Months|Time to Treatment Initiation, The time to treatment initiation using both genotyping methods, will be calculated as the number of days from the date of pathologic or clinical stage IV NSCLC diagnosis until initiation of systemic treatment. This will be compared to the turnaround time for GUARDANT360 results., Up to 18 Months|Incremental number of actionable genomic alterations, Count the number of actionable genomic alterations identified in cfDNA that were not identified in tumour tissue standard of care testing., Up to 18 Months|Turnaround time of cfDNA vs. tissue results, Calculate the time (in days) from the date of request for testing to the report date for both genotyping methods., Up to 18 Months|Costs of cfDNA vs. tissue testing, Cost consequence analysis to examine incremental mean direct and indirect costs in Canadian dollars between the two approaches (cfDNA testing vs tumour tissue genotyping)., Up to 18 Months
Response rate to immunotherapy, Assess response rate in patients (Cohort 1) who received single agent or combination immunotherapy., Up to 18 Months|Response duration to immunotherapy, Assess response duration in patients (Cohort 1) who received single agent or combination immunotherapy., Up to 18 Months|Patient reported quality of life, Patient quality of life will be measured using the EQ5D-5L, which will be administered upon entry to the study and 3 months after starting systemic therapy., Upon entry and 3 months following initiation of systemic therapy|Patient willingness-to-pay, Evaluate patient willingness-to-pay for using a next generation sequencing assay, such as the GUARDANT360, using a validated patient survey., Within 30 days of study enrollment
