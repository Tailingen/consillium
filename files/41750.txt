IMM60 and Pembrolizumab in Melanoma and NSCLC
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about IMM60 with or without pembrolizumab in participants with advanced melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer. There are two phases:

* Phase 1: This phase is designed to learn about the safety of IMM60 with or without pembrolizumab and to find a safe dose to test in Phase 2.
* Phase 2: This phase is designed to learn whether IMM60 + pembrolizumab improves progression-free survival at 12 months compared to pembrolizumab alone in participants with non-small cell lung cancer.

Phase 1 Co-Primary Objective - Identify Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), To confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMM60 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab, defined as the highest dose level at which \<2 out of 6 participants experience a dose-limiting toxicity, Assessed at the end of Cycle 1 for each patient (each Cycle is 28 days)|Phase 1 Co-Primary Objective - Safety, To characterize the safety of IMM60 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab, as assessed by the frequency of Grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events, Through Phase 1 completion, an average of 1 year|Phase 2 Primary Objective - Progression-free Survival, To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 12 months in the randomized arms comparing pembrolizumab alone versus IMM60 + pembrolizumab in patients with advanced PD-L1 â‰¥50% NSCLC, 12 months after last participant enrolled

This exploratory phase 1/phase 2 study is designed to establish a recommended phase 2 dose of IMM60 and provide preliminary estimates of safety and efficacy of IMM60 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with NSCLC and melanoma. In phase 1, initial safety will be assessed in a multiple dose escalation cohort for IMM60 alone, then for the IMM60 + pembrolizumab combination. Phase 2 of the study will recruit PD-1 pretreated melanoma participants and randomize PD-L1 \> 50% total NSCLC participants 2:1 to IMM60 + pembrolizumab vs pembrolizumab alone. There is an additional cohort of PD-L1 \< 1% NSCLC participants.
