Sarcoma,Soft Tissue|Sarcoma|Sarcoma of Bone
DRUG: Chidamide Tablets combined with AK112
The efficacy of the investigational drug will be determined by the objective tumor evaluation conducted by the research center based on the RECIL 2017 lymphoma efficacy evaluation criteria, The imaging evaluation methods for tumors are PET/CT, MR, or CT, but the evaluation methods, machines, and technical parameters should be consistent throughout the entire study period. The imaging results are interpreted by researchers or radiologists from each research center. If tumor evaluation has been conducted within 21 days before enrollment and the same methods and machines are used in the same hospital, it can be used as a baseline tumor evaluation. Baseline tumor evaluation should include the nasal cavity, chest, abdomen, pelvic cavity, and any other suspected tumor lesions. If there are clinical indications, appropriate methods can be used to examine any other known or suspected disease site, such as cranial MRI or bone scan., Baseline and testing every 6 weeks
