The Role of Tomotherapy in Hypofractionated/Dose Escalated Conformal Radiation Treatment for High Risk Prostate Cancer
Helical tomotherapy is being used to treat the prostate gland, local rates of spread and regional lymph nodes whilst sparing gross structures. The radiation to the gross disease in the prostate is hypofractionated and dose escalated. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is incorporated into pre- and post-treatment evaluation.

Rectal Toxicity, Determine the acute and late rectal toxicity of high-dose short-course hypofractionated radiotherapy in five weeks in the treatment of high rish prostate cancer., 5 weeks
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and MRSI disease control, Determine the biochemical control (freedom from PSA failure) rate, overall and disease free survival., 3 years
