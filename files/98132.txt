PD-L1 Specific 68Ga-THP-PD-L1-3 Probe for PET Imaging in Solid Tumors
The objective of the study is to constrcut a noninvasive approach 68Ga-THP-PD-L1-3 PET/CT to detect the PD-L1 expression of tumor lesions in patients with solid tumors and to identify patients benefiting from anti-PD-L1 treatment.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: 18F-FDG
Standardized uptake value（SUV）, The uptake of the tracer （68Ga-THP-PD-L1-3) in solid tumor lesions or suspected tumor lesions by measuring SUV on PET/CT., 2 years
Analysis plan: 1. recruit 10 participants to analyze preliminary pharmacokinetic/first-in-human dose (FIH), major organ distribution and tumor uptake information via whole-body PET/CT imaging; 2. recruit 20-30 participants to analyze in vivo safety and tumor targeting information; and 3. recruit all participants for a final summary.
