RET Inhibitor for Neoadjuvant Therapy in Locally Advanced RET-altered Thyroid Cancer
This study is a multicenter observational study. Patients receive neoadjuvant therapy with RET inhibitors in the real world, and those who can undergo surgery after neoadjuvant therapy receive surgical treatment. The aim of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of RET inhibitors for neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced RET-altered thyroid cancer.
