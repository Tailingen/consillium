The Value of Lymph Node Dissection of Indocyanine Green-guided Near-infrared Fluorescent Imaging in Esophagectomy
Indocyanine green (ICG) has been recently introduced in clinical practice as a fuorescent tracer. Lymphadenectomy is particularly challenging in esophageal cancer surgery, owing to the complex anatomical drainage.Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore whether the NIR-ICG imaging system could accurately assess the lymph node markers during radical resection of esophageal cancer.

This study will be accepted in esophageal cancer patients with Radical Esophag-ectomy as the research object.We will divide them into two groups: experimental group for injection of indocyanine green group and control group for injectable in-docyanine green group.We will compare with the accuracy,false positive rate and false negative rate,sensitivity, specificity and related indicators of intraoperative lymph node cleaning,in order to explore the common position of esophageal cancer sentinel lymph node,guidance of esophageal cancer lymph node cleaning thoroughly.
