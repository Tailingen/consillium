Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Cetuximab in Combination with Encorafenib Plus Binimetinib As Induction Treatment in BRAF V600E Mutated MSS Initially Resectable or Potentially Resectable Advanced Colorectal Cancer
As a result of the little benefit obtained from standard treatments and the poor prognosis of these patients, the BRAF-V600E mutant MSS aCRC represents an unmet medical need requiring clinical research.

The combination of encorafenib, cetuximab and binimetinib as second- or third-line treatment for mCRC resulted in significantly better outcomes than standard therapy in a phase 3 clinical trial, which also revealed treatment safety and tolerability to be acceptable. Compared to the control group (cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab and FOLFIRI), the triplet therapy cohort showed higher median overall survival (9.3 vs. 5.9 months) and response rates (26.8% vs. 1.8%). Grade 3 adverse events occurred in 65.8% and 64.2% of patients for triple-therapy and control groups, respectively.

Based on these results, the investigators speculated that the combination of encorafenib, cetuximab and binimetinib could be used as induction therapy to improve treatment outcomes in BRAF-V600E-mutated MSS aCRC locally advanced initially unresectable but potentially resectable; initially resectable or initially unresectable but potentially resectable oligometastatic disease; and in patients with stage II-IV who have relapsed after chemotherapy (neo and/or adjuvant) or surgery, if the shorter time after resection or from treatment end to relapse is longer than 6 months.
Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: EBC
Efficacy of cetuximab in combination with encorafenib plus binimetinib as induction therapy for the treatment of BRAF-V600E mutated MSS aCRC to perform radical treatment of the primary and/or metastases, Radical treatment rate, defined as the number of patients radically treated for their primary tumor and/or distant metastases by surgery and/or by any other radical therapeutic procedure with curative intent (i.e. radiofrequency, cryotherapy, laserhyperthermia, stereotactic body radiotherapy or chemoembolization)., From first dose to radical treatment (up 60 months)
Overall response rate (ORR), Number of patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, divided by the total number of patients., From first dose to radiographic evidence of best response (up 60 months)|Tumor regression grade (TRG), after any surgical treatment of the primary tumor and/or distant metastases, TRG1, no residual tumor; TRG2, microscopic residual tumor; TRG3, moderate response; TRG4, minor response; and TRG5, no response, From surgery until 30 days post surgery (up 60 months)|Progression-free-survival (PFS), Time in months from first dose of study treatment to disease progression or death (due to any cause), From first dose to the earliest documented PD or death due to any cause (up 60 months)|Overall survival (OS), Time in months from first dose of study treatment to death due to any cause, From first dose to death due to any cause (up 60 months)|Disease free survival (DFS), Time in months from first dose of study treatment to cancer recurrence, second cancer, or death from any cause in resected patients, From first dose to radiographic evidence of cancer recurrence, second cancer, or death (up 60 months)|Complications related to surgery and/or any other therapeutic procedure for radical treatment occurring within 60 days after surgery, Number of Participants with Perioperative mortality, transfusions, hemorrhage, infections, wound healing, general or local complications, From surgery until 30 days post surgery (up 60 months)|Incidence and severity of AEs CTCAE v5 criteria, Number of Participants with Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0 and serious Adverse Events., From first dose until 30 days post last dose of study treatment (up 60 months)
To determine the presence/expression level/levels of serum and tumour tissue biomarkers associated with cell and tumour growth and/or involved in the mechanisms of action of EBC, To be confirmed, Tumour tissue samples: at baseline and blood samples at baseline, at week12 post treatment and at progression
