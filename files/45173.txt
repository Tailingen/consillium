EUS-RFA Versus Surgery for Pancreatic Insulinoma (ERASIN-RCT)
The goal of this muticentre randomized controlled trial is to compare endoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (EUS-RFA) with surgery for treatment of pancreatic insulinoma. The main questions it aims to answer are: 1) What is the safest treatment? 2) Is efficacy comparable? Patients will be randomized to undergo EUS-RFA or surgical resection. Researchers will compare the rate of adverse events and the clinical efficacy after the two treatments to see if EUS-RFA result safer and effective compare with surgery.
