A Study to Compare How Well Odronextamab Combined With Chemotherapy Works and How Safe it is Against Rituximab Combined With Chemotherapy, in Patients With Previously Untreated Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
This study is researching an experimental drug called odronextamab, referred to as study drug, when used in combination with chemotherapy. The study is focused on patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that have not been treated before (called "previously untreated"). Patients with DLBCL that have come back after treatment (called "relapsed"), or have not responded to treatment (called "refractory"), can also participate in this study.

This study will be made up of Part 1A, Part 1B, and Part 2.The aim of Part 1A and Part 1B of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug in combination with chemotherapy is and to determine the dose and schedule of the study drug to be combined with chemotherapy in Part 2 of the study.

The aim of Part 2 of the study is to see how effective the combination of the study drug with chemotherapy is in comparison with the combination of rituximab (the comparator drug), and chemotherapy, the current standard of care treatment approved for DLBCL. Standard of care means the usual medication expected and used when receiving treatment for a condition.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug when combined with chemotherapy
* How much study drug is in the blood at different times
* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the study drug less effective or could lead to side effects)
* The impact from the study drug on quality of life and ability to complete routine daily activities

For the functioning scales and global health status / QoL, scores range from 1 = "very poor" to 7 = "excellent" with higher scores indicate better functioning; for the symptom scales, scores range from 1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much" higher scores indicate higher symptom burden., Up to 5 years|Change in patient reported outcomes, as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, Part 2 The EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social functioning), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting), a GHS/QoL scale, and six single items (constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, shortness of breath, appetite loss and financial difficulties). For the functioning scales and global health status / QoL, scores range from 1 = "very poor" to 7 = "excellent" with higher scores indicate better functioning; for the symptom scales, scores range from 1 = "not at all" to 4 = "very much" higher scores indicate higher symptom burden., Up to 5 years|Change in patient reported outcomes, as measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lymphoma Subscale (FACT-LymS), Part 2 The FACT-Lym lymphoma subscale (LymS) includes 15 items to assess NHL-related symptoms and concerns. All questions are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from "not at all" (0) to "very much" (4). Higher scores are associated with a worse quality of life., Up to 5 years|Change in patient reported outcomes, as measured by Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS), Part 2 The PGIS includes a single-item to assess how a patient perceives the overall severity of cancer symptoms over the past 7 days. Patients will choose the response that best describes the severity of their overall cancer symptoms with options on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (No symptoms) to 4 (Very Severe)., Up to 5 years|Change in patient reported outcomes, as measured by Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), Part 2 The PGIC item includes a single-item to assess how a patient perceives their overall change in health status since the start of study treatment. Patients will choose from response options on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (Much Better) to 7 (Much worse); 1- Much Better, 2-Moderately Better, 3-A Little Better, 4-About the Same, 5-A Little Worse, 6-Moderately Worse, 7-Much Worse., Up to 5 years|Change in patient reported outcomes, as measured by EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L), Part 2 The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: "no problems", "slight problems", "moderate problems", "severe problems" and "extreme problems". The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labeled "Best imaginable health state" and "Worst imaginable health state"., Up to 5 years|Change in score of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G ) GP5 item, Part 2 A single item (GP5) of the validated FACT-G questionnaire will be used to assess from the participant perspective the overall impact of treatment side-effect. The question item is on a 5-point scale ranging from "not at all" (0) to "very much" (4)., Up to 5 years
