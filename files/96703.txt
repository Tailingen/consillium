A Study to Evaluate Alnuctamab in Combination With Mezigdomide in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose and schedule, and evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of alnuctamab in combination with mezigdomide in participants with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma.
