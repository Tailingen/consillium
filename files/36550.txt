NECTAR Everolimus Plus Cisplatin in Triple (-) Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Everolimus plus Cisplatin may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to test how effective combining Cisplatin chemotherapy with Everolimus is in treating subjects with triple negative breast cancer who have residual disease after chemotherapy.
Breast Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Everolimus
Tumor Response, Evaluate tumor response using RECIST criteria after 12 weeks of treatment at definitive surgery.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.", or similar definition that is accurate and appropriate., tumor response at 12 weeks after treatment
This is a phase II clinical trial of everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, plus cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have residual disease after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Everolimus and cisplatin will be administered for 12 weeks. Patients will undergo surgery after treatment completion. Patients will have breast biopsy prior to receiving the study treatment.
