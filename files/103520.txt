CAR T-cells Against CD30 (HSP-CAR30) for Relapsed/ Refractory Hodgkin and T-cell Lymphoma.
HSP-CAR30 is a cell suspension of genetically modified T-cells to express a second generation (4-1BBz) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) directed against CD30.

This is a phase I/IIa, interventional, single arm, open label, treatment study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of HSP-CAR30 in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed/refractory T-cell lymphoma expressing CD30.
