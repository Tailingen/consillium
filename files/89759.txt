Study of AG-120 and AG-881 in Subjects With Low Grade Glioma
Study to evaluate the suppression of 2-HG (2-hydroxyglutarate) in IDH-1 mutant gliomas in resected tumor tissue following pre-surgical treatment with AG-120 or AG-881.

A phase-1, multi-center study in recurrent non-enhancing gliomas with IDH1 R132H mutation for patients who require surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the suppression of 2-HG by comparing the concentration of 2-HG in resected tumors from IDH1 mutant glioma subjects following AG-120 or AG-881 treatment with the 2-HG concentration in untreated, control tumors. The safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and anti tumor activity data from the study in subjects with recurrent non-enhancing Grade 2/3 LGG with an IDH1 R132H mutation for whom surgical resection is indicated will identify the recommended dose of AG-120 and AG-881 for future studies in glioma.
