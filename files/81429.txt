Bevacizumab, Temozolomide and Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Patients With Newly Diagnosed Malignant Glioma
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a new plan for treating glioblastoma. The usual first treatment for glioblastoma is to give focused radiation over 6 weeks in combination with a chemotherapy called temozolomide. In this study the radiation will be given over 2 weeks in combination with temozolomide and another drug, bevacizumab, will also be given. Our idea is that this treatment plan may attack both the tumor and the blood vessels feeding the tumor more effectively. This study will look at what effects, good or bad, this approach has on the patient and the tumor.
