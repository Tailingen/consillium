Temozolomide + Nivolumab in MGMT Methylated Oesophagogastric Cancer
An open label single arm phase II trial in patients with advanced unresectable previously treated oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma which is MGMT deficient.
Adenocarcinoma - GEJ|Cancer of Esophagus
DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Temozolomide 50mg/m2/day|DRUG: Temozolomide 3 month|DRUG: Temozolomide 24month
Tumour Response to nivolumab, To determine the anti-tumour activity of nivolumab, when given after temozolomide in patients with previously treated advanced oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma which are MGMT methylated., 24 months
The percentage of patients who have achieved response, The Disease control rate determine the effect of TMZ priming followed by nivolumab on disease control rates of patients with previously treated advanced oesophagogastric adenocarcinoma which is MGMT methylated.

Disease control rate, according to RECIST v1.1 and iRECIST, 6 months after starting nivolumab, and 3 months after starting TMZ, respectively., 6 months
The aim of the ELEVATE trial is to determine the activity and safety of maintenance TMZ dosing followed by nivolumab treatment to evaluate the potential for a future randomised trial against a standard of care control arm. The rationale to continue TMZ for 3 months or until PD is to evaluate the emergence of mismatch repair deficiency both with and without radiological PD, as clinically relevant MMRd may emerge before radiological progression. This will also reduce the number of patients who drop out due to symptomatic progressive disease.
