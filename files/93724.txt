D2 Resection and HIPEC (Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemoperfusion) in Locally Advanced Gastric Carcinoma
A prospective, opened, multicentric, randomised, phase III trial with two arms:

* Arm A: curative gastrectomy with D1-D2 lymph node dissection + HIPEC with oxaliplatin
* Arm B: curative gastrectomy with D1-D2 lymph node dissection

Main objective: Compare overall 5-year survival rates in patients surgically treated for advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (T3, T4 and/or N+ and/or with positive peritoneal cytology), treated either with curative gastrectomy and adjuvant HIPEC, or with curative gastrectomy alone.
