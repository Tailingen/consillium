A Phase â…¡ Clinical Study of Adebrelimab Combined With Chemotherapy and Concurrent Radiotherapy for Extensive-Stage Oligometastatic SCLC
This is an open-label, single arm Phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adebelizumab combined with carboplatin/Cisplatin plus (+) etoposide and concurrent radiotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with extensive stage oligometastatic small cell lung cancer.

Participants will receive Adebrelimab intravenously in combination with carboplatin /Cisplatin and etoposide during the induction phase (2 Cycles ). Thereafter, participants will receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy(thoracic radiation therapy and SBRT for metastases,combination with carboplatin /Cisplatin and etoposide for 1-2 Cycles).Then participants will receive Adebrelimab combination with carboplatin /Cisplatin and etoposide for 1-2 Cycles,followed by Adebrelimab maintenance until persistent radiographic PD, intolerable toxicity or withdrawal of consent during the maintenance phase.
