A Study of SHR-A1811 Monotherapy or Combined With Pyrotinib Maleate as Neoadjuvant Treatment in HER2-positive Breast Cancer Patients
This is a phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of SHR-A1811 monotherapy or combined with pyrotinib maleate in Stage II-III HER2-positive breast cancer. Subjects will receive the neoadjuvant therapy of SHR-A1811 monotherapy or combined with pyrotinib for six cycles, and then undergo surgery within 4 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy. Efficacy will be assessed every 2 cycles.
