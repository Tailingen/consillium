Part 1: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and regardless of a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable \& unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom/disease temporally associated with use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to investigational product., From Day 1 up to the end of safety follow-up (up to 28.5 months)|Part 2: Number of Participants With AEs, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and regardless of a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable \& unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom/disease temporally associated with use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to investigational product., From Day 1 up to the end of safety follow-up (up to 9.3 months)|Part 1: Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT was defined as the occurrence of any of the following toxicities related to RO7296682 and atezolizumab that occurs during the DLT assessment window and not attributable to the underlying disease or an intercurrent illness: Any Grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicity; Any Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity; any other RO7296682-related toxicity considered significant enough to qualify as a DLT in the opinion of the Investigator and after discussion with the Sponsor., From Cycle 1 Day 1 up Cycle 2 Day 8 (1 Cycle = 21 days)|Part 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was determined as the percentage of participants with an overall response (OR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by the investigator using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) having a reduction in short axis to \<10 millimeters (mm). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD. Percentages have been rounded off to the nearest decimal point., Part 2: From Day 1 up to end of safety follow-up (up to 9.3 months)
Part 1: ORR, ORR was determined as the percentage of participants with an OR of CR or PR as determined by the investigator using RECIST v.1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) having a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD. Percentages have been rounded off to the nearest decimal point., From Day 1 up to end of safety follow-up (up to 28.5 months)|Part 1 and 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was determined as the rate of participants with an OR of either CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) rate as determined by the investigator using RECIST v.1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) having a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD). PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on the study including baseline (nadir). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Percentages have been rounded off to the nearest decimal point., Part 1: From Day 1 up to end of safety follow-up (up to 28.5 months); Part 2: From Day 1 up to end of safety follow-up (up to 9.3 months)|Part 1 and 2: Duration of Response (DoR), DOR was calculated for participants who had a best OR of CR/PR. DOR was defined as time from first occurrence of a documented OR until the time of documented PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. CR=the disappearance of all target lesions or any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) having a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR=at least a 30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD. PD=at least a 20% increase in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on the study including baseline (nadir). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Participants without PD/death (within 30 days from last treatment) were censored on the last day of tumor assessment. Participants without post-baseline (PB) or with all PB assessments but known to be alive were censored at the date of study treatment initiation plus one day., Part 1: From Day 1 up to end of safety follow-up (up to 28.5 months); Part 2: From Day 1 up to end of safety follow-up (up to 9.3 months)|Part 1 and 2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from study treatment initiation to the first occurrence of documented PD (per RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on the study including baseline (nadir). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Participants without PD or death (within 30 days from last treatment) were censored at the last day of tumor assessment. Participants without PB or with all PB assessments but known to be alive were censored at the date of study treatment initiation plus one day., Part 1: From Day 1 up to end of safety follow-up (up to 28.5 months); Part 2: From Day 1 up to end of safety follow-up (up to 9.3 months)|Part 1 and 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the time of death from any cause. Participants who were still alive at the time of analysis were censored at the time of their last study assessment (for active participants) or at the last date known alive (for participants in follow-up)., Part 1: From Day 1 up to end of survival follow-up (36 months); Part 2: From Day 1 up to end of safety follow-up (up to 9.3 months)|Part 1 and 2: Area Under the Curve From Time of Dosing to the Last Timepoint at the End of the Dosing Period (AUClast) of RO7296682, Cycles 1 and 4: Predose, end of infusion, and at 24, 72, 168, and 336 hours post-dose (1 Cycle = 21 days)|Part 1 and 2: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of RO7296682, Cycles 1 and 4: Predose, end of infusion, and at 24, 72, 168, and 336 hours post-dose (1 Cycle = 21 days)|Part 1 and 2: Time of Maximum Concentration (Tmax) of RO7296682, Cycles 1 and 4: Predose, end of infusion, and at 24, 72, 168, and 336 hours post-dose (1 Cycle = 21 days)|Part 1 and 2: Volume of Distribution at Steady State Conditions (Vss) of RO7296682, Cycles 1 and 4: Predose, end of infusion, and at 24, 72, 168, and 336 hours post-dose (1 Cycle = 21 days)|Part 1 and 2: Half-life (t~1/2) of RO7296682, Cycles 1 and 4: Predose, end of infusion, and at 24, 72, 168, and 336 hours post-dose (1 Cycle = 21 days)|Part 1: Serum Concentration of Atezolizumab, 1 Cycle = 21 days., Predose on Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 9, 12, 14, and 17; End of infusion (EOI) on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 4; end of study/early discontinuation (up to 28.5 months)|Part 1 and 2: Number of Participants With Treatment-induced Changes in T Regulatory C Ells (Treg) Levels in Blood and/or Tumor as Compared to Baseline, Treg depletion was defined as a reduction to 25% of baseline. As pre-specified in the protocol, the sponsor had the discretion to discontinue any part of the study at any time. On October 3, 2022, the sponsor decided to terminate Part 2 early due to recruitment challenges. As only 3 participants were enrolled in Part 2: Cohort 1, the sponsor decided not to collect and analyze data for the pharmacodynamic endpoints in Part 2., Baseline up to 28 days post last dose (up to 24.9 months)|Part 1 and 2: Treatment-induced Changes in Teff (T-effector Cell)/Treg Ratio in Blood and/or Tumor as Compared to Baseline, As pre-specified in the protocol, the sponsor had the discretion to discontinue any part of the study at any time. On October 3, 2022, the sponsor decided to terminate Part 2 early due to recruitment challenges. As only 3 participants were enrolled in Part 2: Cohort 1, the sponsor decided not to collect and analyze data for the pharmacodynamic endpoints in Part 2., Cycle 1 Day 1 (end of infusion [EOI]); Cycle 1 Day 4 (72 hours post dose); Cycle 1 Day 8 (168 hours post dose); Cycle 1 Day 15 (336 hours post dose)
