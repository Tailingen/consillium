A Trial to Compare Surgery With Sorafenib for Hepatic Celluler Cancer With Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis
According to the guidelines recommended, only a few new targeted therapy drugs treatment, such as Sorafenib, is proper. It's 3 year survival rate is only 8% or so. According to our previous study, patients with hepatic carcinoma without portal vein tumor thrombus backbone and the contralateral tumor thrombus applyed tumor excision, along with tumor thrombus, the 3 year survival rate can reach 39.9%, the 5-year survival rate can reach 22.7%, curative effect is obviously better.
