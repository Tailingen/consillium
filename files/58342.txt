Role of Biomarkers in Disease Progression in Samples From Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood, tissue, and bone marrow from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This research trial studies the role of biomarkers in disease progression in samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

Subcellular localization of the MLL-AF1q fusion protein in leukemia cells
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the subcellular localization of the MLL-AF1q fusion protein in leukemia cells.

OUTLINE: Cryopreserved specimens are analyzed for MLL-AF1q fusion protein and AF1 gene expression by mass spectrometry, western blot analysis, semi-quantitative PCR, and qPCR.
