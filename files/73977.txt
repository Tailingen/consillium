Surgical Strategy for Head and Neck Adenoid Cystic Cancer
To investigate the relationship between surgical margins and outcomes across different tumor stages, in order to provide evidence and guidance for refining stage-specific surgical approaches.
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: surgery
Local control, defined as the absence of tumor persistence, recurrence, or progression at the primary tumor site following the completion of treatment, assessed by clinical examination and imaging at designated follow-up intervals., 5 year
Locoregional Recurrence-Free Survival (LRRFS), time from treatment initiation to either locoregional recurrence or death from any cause, 5 year|Overall Survival (OS), time from treatment initiation to death from any cause, 5 year|Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS), time from treatment initiation to either distant metastasis or death from any cause, 5 year
Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the head and neck (HNACC) presents unique surgical challenges due to its propensity for perineural spread and proximity to critical craniofacial structures. While surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment, determining the optimal extent of resection to balance oncologic control and functional preservation requires further investigation. The investigator aimed to investigate the relationship between surgical margins and outcomes across different tumor stages, in order to provide evidence and guidance for refining stage-specific surgical approaches.
