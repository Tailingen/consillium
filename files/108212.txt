Evaluation of Plerixafor Plus G-CSF to Mobilize and Collect 5×10^6CD34+ Cells/kg in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) Patients for Autologous Transplantation
The study is to determine if NHL patients mobilized with G-CSF (10 µg/kg/day \[GRAN® only\]) plus 0.24 mg/kg/day of plerixafor are more likely to achieve a target number of ≥5 × 10\^6 CD34+ cells/kg in 4 or fewer days of apheresis than NHL patients mobilized with G-CSF plus placebo.

Eligible patients who are unable to achieve adequate apheresis cell counts may enter an Open-Label Rescue Period where they will receive plerixafor, following the same study schedule as during the Double-Blind Treatment Period.
