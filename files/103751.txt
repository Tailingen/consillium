Loncastuximab Tesirine for the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Malignancies
This phase II trial tests whether loncastuximab tesirine works to shrink tumors in patients with B-cell malignancies that have come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Loncastuximab tesirine is a monoclonal antibody, called loncastuximab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called tesirine. Loncastuximab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as CD19 receptors, and delivers tesirine to kill them.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive loncastuximab tesirine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
