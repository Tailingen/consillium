Regional Lymph Node Metastasis and Survival Outcomes in Advanced HCC
Tumor-draining lymph nodes play an important role in anti-tumor immune responses. In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, the relationship between regional lymph node metastasis (LNM) and immunotherapy-based efficacy is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether extrahepatic LNM is associated with worse survival outcomes as compared to other metastatic sites in patients with advanced HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
Overall Survival(OS), OS is defined as the time from the initiation of any combination treatment to death due to any cause., up to approximately 2 years
Progression free survival(PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), The PFS is defined as the time from the initiation of any combination treatment to the first documented progressive disease (according to RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 2 years|PFS per Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST), PFS is defined as the time from the initiation of any combination treatment to the first documented progressive disease (according to mRECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 2 years|Objective response rate(ORR) per RESCIST 1.1, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response(CR) or partial response(PR) per RECIST 1.1., up to approximately 2 years|ORR per mRECIST, ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented CR or PR per mRECIST., up to approximately 2 years|Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RESCIST 1.1, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD)per RESCIST 1.1., up to approximately 2 years|DCR per mRECIST, DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a best overall response of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) per mRECIST., up to approximately 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR) per RESCIST 1.1, DOR is determined by disease assessment and is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a response of CR or PR until the first documented disease progression (according to RESCIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 2 years|DOR per mRECIST, DOR is determined by disease assessment and is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a response of CR or PR until the first documented disease progression (according to mRECIST) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., up to approximately 2 years|Adverse event(AE) per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE) 5.0, The percentage and degree of patients who experience at least one AE, whether or not considered related to the treatment, according to CTCAE version 5.0., up to approximately 2 years
In patients with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), previous studies showed that transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and molecular target therapies exhibited better efficacy (PFS and OS) as compared to the ICIs and molecular target therapies. Besides, previous studies showed that tumor-draining lymph nodes play an important role in anti-tumor immune responses in vivo and in vitro studies. However, the relationship between regional lymph node metastasis (LNM) and immunotherapy-based efficacy is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether extrahepatic LNM is associated with worse survival outcomes as compared to other metastatic sites in patients with advanced HCC who received transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in combination with ICIs and molecular target therapies. This real-world study may provide further information on treatment selection for clinical practice and trials.
