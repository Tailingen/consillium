Do Markers of Systemic Inflammatory Response and Tumor Metabolism Indicate Radioresistance in Head and Neck Cancer?
The aim of the study is to prospectively evaluate whether markers of a patient's systemic inflammatory response in addition to FDG-PET/CT metabolic parameters of the primary tumor or of nodal metastases can predict radioresistance and survival before primary radiochemotherapy in advanced head and neck cancer patients.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: Radiochemotherapy
Survival, Overall survival, disease-specific survival, local and regional recurrence-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival, Prospective analysis of various measures of survival up to 5 years after completion of the therapy. Events such as tumor recurrence or death will be recorded continually.
Correlation Analysis, Analysis of a correlation of pretherapeutic systemic inflammatory markers in differential blood analysis including neutrophil-to-lympocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lym-phocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and systemic in-flammation response index (SIRI) and FDG-PET/CT-derived parameters of tumor metabolism such as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of the primary tumor and lymph node metastases., At diagnosis
This study prospectively investigates pretherapeutic markers of systemic inflammatory response (including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, systemic inflammation response index, and systemic immune-inflammation) and FDG-PET/CT-derived metabolic parameters of tumor and nodal metastases (including maximum standardized uptake value, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis) and their potential prognostic value in head and neck cancer patients prior to primary radiochemotherapy.
