Cognitive Function as Assessed by the National Adult Reading Test (NART), the NART estimates intelligence levels of English-speaking patients. It consists of 50 short words with irregular spelling or phonetic appearance which the participant must read and pronounce. The higher the score, the higher number of correct responses. Scores are 0-50., baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks|Cognitive Function as Assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), Total Recall Score, The test consists 12 nouns, four words each from one of three semantic categories (e.g., precious gems, articles of clothing, vegetables, etc.), to be learned over the course of three learning trials. Approximately 20-25 min later, a delayed recall trial and a recognition trial are completed. The delayed recall requires free recall of any words remembered. The recognition trial is composed of 24 words, including the 12 target words and 12 false-positives, 6 semantically related, \& 6 semantically unrelated. When scoring the HVLT, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score (0-36); the delayed recall trial creates the delayed recall score ( -12) ; the retention (%) score (0-100%) is calculated by dividing the delayed recall trial by the higher of learning trial 2 or 3; and the recognition discrimination index is comprised by subtracting the total number of false positives from the total number of true positives.

This research study will look at the effects of a soy supplement called Revival on memory, quality of life, and hot flashes in men with prostate cancer who are undergoing (ADT) androgen deprivation therapy. Participants will be given either placebo or Revival. Participants will be asked to take their supplement once/day for 14 weeks.Blood will be drawn to check on liver, kidney, thyroid, cholesterol,and prostate health. Urine will be collected to check on bone markers. Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires to test memory, attention span, and vocabulary.Possible benefits may include increase in memory, decrease in hot flashes, and a general increase in quality of life.
