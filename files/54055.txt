A randomized, open, blank controlled, single-center clinical trial was conducted to compare the survival benefits of statins in breast cancer patients with dyslipidemia (low and medium risk of ASCVD). The control group used dietary intervention instead of statins. The main endpoint was 3 and 5 years DFS. The subjects were breast cancer patients. In this study, 348 patients were randomly divided into two groups according to patients' wishes and written informed consent. The experimental group: control group = 1:1. Subjects were screened and administered continuously until the disease progressed and the toxicity was intolerable. Informed consent was withdrawn or the researcher decided that the drug must be discontinued.
