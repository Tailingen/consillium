Clinical Trial to Evaluate the PK and Safety of BCD-201 and Keytruda® in Patients With Advanced Malignancies
Clinical study BCD-201-1 is a double-blind randomized study of the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and immunogenicity of BCD-201 versus Keytruda following intravenous administration to subjects with advanced unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent melanoma and NSCLC.

The study aimed to establish the equivalence of PK and similarity of the safety, immunogenicity, and PD profiles of BCD-201 and Keytruda.
