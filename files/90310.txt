The Effects of Spiritual Needs on Spiritual Well-Being in Patients With Brain Tumors: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach
The aim of this study is to describe a patient's Spiritual Needs and related factors that contribute to a patient's Spiritual Well-Being in the context of perioperative care.

The primary objective of this study is to examine the fit of the Structural Equation Model (SEM) of the theory on Spiritual Well-Being (SWB) and explain how SWB is affected by Symptom Burden (SB), Psychological Distress (PsD), and Spiritual Needs (SN) reported by the patients with brain tumors before having surgery.

The aim of this study is to describe a patient's Spiritual Needs and related factors that contribute to a patient's Spiritual Well-Being in the context of perioperative care.

The primary objective of this study is:

To examine the fit of the Structural Equation Model (SEM) of the theory on Spiritual Well-Being (SWB) and explain how SWB is affected by Symptom Burden (SB), Psychological Distress (PsD), and Spiritual Needs (SN) reported by the patients with brain tumors before having surgery.

This study will address the following secondary objectives:

1. To examine bivariate relationships between SB, PsD, and SN.
2. To explore effects of patients' spirituality on the relationship between patients' SN and SWB.

This study is not powered to test hypotheses concerning the secondary objectives but will specifically examine through descriptive statistics and confidence intervals the following:

1. SN, PsD, and SB are positively correlated with each other.
2. SN negatively influences SWB.
3. SN positively influences spirituality.
4. Spirituality positively influences SWB.
