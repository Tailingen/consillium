Outcomes of High-risk Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer Treated With Blue Light Resection
Comparing white-light cystoscopy (WLC) and blue-light cystoscopy (BLC) in TURBT for high risk (HR) non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients is crucial to determine the most effective method for reducing residual disease burden and improving recurrence-free survival. Enhanced visualization with BLC may lead to more accurate resections, potentially decreasing recurrence rates and improving long-term outcomes for bladder cancer patients. Patients will be randomized to either WLC TURBT or BLC TURBT, and outcomes will be measured using standard-of-care testing with cystoscopy and cytology, along with minimal residual disease (MRD) burden evaluation using urine next-generation sequencing.

DRUG: Cysview|DEVICE: Karl Storz D-Light C Photodynamic Diagnostic (PDD) system
Residual disease burden, The residual tumor burden will be assessed by the standard of care testing, such as cystoscopy and cytology at 3 month intervals., Up to 24 months|Minimal residual disease burden, Minimal residual disease (MRD) in urine will be measured utilizing the Convergent's UroAmp test at 3 month intervals., Up to 24 months
Recurrence-free survival, Recurrence-free survival rate will measured from the date of randomization to the first recurrence or to death from any cause., 24 months
Objectives are as follows:

Primary i) Comparison of the reduction in MRD burden score between pre-resection and post-resection urine samples across BLC and WLC resection arms of the study, and among patients with a high-grade tumor at time of resection ii) Comparison of the reduction in MRD burden score between pre-resection and post-resection urine samples across BLC and WLC resection arms of the study, and among all evaluable study participants.

Secondary i) Among all evaluable study participants: Recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 12 and 24 months using post-TURBT and three month surveillance urine sample time points in BLC and WLC arm.

ii) Among patients undergoing intravesical induction: Recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 12 and 24 months using post-TURBT and three month surveillance urine sample time points in BLC and WLC arm.
