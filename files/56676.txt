A Study Evaluating the Bioavailability and Food Effect of Veliparib Tablets Followed by an Extension in Subjects With Ovarian Cancer
This study will evaluate the bioavailability between the veliparib tablet formulation to the capsule formulation; and will assess the effect of food on veliparib bioavailability in participants with ovarian cancer.
