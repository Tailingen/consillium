BEPACT- Lung: Impact of Patient Characteristics on Pneumo-oncologists Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Systemic Treatment Decision in Belgium
The treatment landscape of metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rapidly evolving. There are new diagnostic and treatment options available in the coming months and years.

New combination treatments will give different solutions to pneumo-oncologists who might be guided by certain patient and tumor characteristics.

The link between patient and tumor characteristics in untreated stage IV non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and systemic treatment needs further investigation, allowing the identification of possible treatment issues, data gaps and/or areas of improvement.
Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
OTHER: None - Common practice
The Study Outcome is Defined as the Systemic Treatment Choice., Systemic treatment choices are defined as :

1. Chemotherapy (chemo)
2. Immunotherapy (IO)
3. immuno combined therapies (IO+IO)
4. IO+chemo
5. IO+bevacizumab+chemo (IO+bev+chemo)
6. best supportive care (BSC). There is no exposure in this study., during visits 1 and 2, up to approximately 3 weeks
This is a multicenter, non-interventional, cross-sectional study. Consecutive patients with metastatic stage IV non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) selected for systemic treatment or best supportive care will be included in the trial at the time the patient signed the informed consent form (ICF). Patients that were selected for systemic treatment, should have received at least their first dose and a maximum of one cycle of the same treatment.

The pneumo-oncologist that treats the patient will fill in the CRF, indicating the systemic treatment option and the link with the variable categories that impacted the choice for a systemic treatment option.
