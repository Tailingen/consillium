Pilot Study of Infrared Imaging of Cutaneous Melanoma
Design: this is a pilot study of infrared imaging of cutaneous lesions in patients and volunteers with and without clinically detectable melanoma, and with one or more palpable cutaneous lesions eligible for this imaging study. Participants will be evaluated with infrared camera imaging at cutaneous sites with known melanoma deposits, suspected melanoma deposits that are to be biopsied, or at cutaneous sites with other lesions, including other skin cancers, benign inflammatory lesions, benign neoplastic lesions (lipomas, epidermal cysts, dermatofibromas, scar, healing wound, etc.).
