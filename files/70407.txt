A Study of M802 (HER2 and CD3) in HER2-Positive Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of different doses of M802 in patients with HER2-positive advanced solid tumors, and to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) so as to provide basis for the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).
HER2-Positive Solid Tumors
DRUG: Chort 1 of M802|DRUG: Chort 2 of M802|DRUG: Cohort 3 of M802|DRUG: Cohort 4 of M802|DRUG: Cohort 5 of M802|DRUG: Cohort 6 of M802|DRUG: Cohort 7 of M802|DRUG: Cohort 8 of M802
MTD, Number of DLTs (dose limiting toxicities) during the first 28 days after the first administrations of study drug in each cohort., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until the forth dosing (Day 28)|RP2D, Incidence and severity of AEs, and SAEs, including but not limited to laboratory values, PK and biomarkers. All AEs will be classified as Grades 1 through 5 as defined by NCI CTCAE v5.0., From the start of administration to the end of the study or 28 days after the administration is stopped (up to 1 years and 28 days)
Area under the curve (AUC) of M802, The endpoints for assessment of PK of M802 include serum concentrations of M802 at different timepoints after M802 administration., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years).|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of M802, The endpoints for assessment of PK of M802 include serum concentrations of M802 at different timepoints after M802 administration., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years).|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of M802, The endpoints for assessment of PK of M802 include serum concentrations of M802 at different timepoints after M802 administration., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years).|Expression levels of CEA, As tumor marker, expression levels of CEA will be tested in hospitals., From the time of screening period until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years and 28 days).|Expression levels of CA15-3, As tumor marker, expression levels of CA15-3 will be tested in hospitals., From the time of screening period until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years and 28 days).|Expression levels of CA125, As tumor marker, expression levels of CA125 will be tested in hospitals., From the time of screening period until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years and 28 days).|Expression levels of CA19-9, As tumor marker, expression levels of CA19-9 will be tested in hospitals., From the time of screening period until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years and 28 days).|Expression levels of CA72-4, As tumor marker, expression levels of CA72-4 will be tested in hospitals., From the time of screening period until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years and 28 days).|Cytokines, The levels of pharmacodynamic cytokines will be determined at the PD central laboratory., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years).|Number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), The immunogenicity of M802 will be assessed by summarizing the number of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years).|The antibody titer of the neutralizing antibody, The immunogenicity of M802 will be collected by testing the antibody titer of the neutralizing antibody., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years).|ORR, Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), based on RECIST Version 1.1., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years).|DCR, Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), based on RECIST Version 1.1., From the time of first dosing (Day 1) until disease progression or toxicity intolerance (up to 1 years).
