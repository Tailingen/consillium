mHealth Physical Activity Intervention for Survivors of Adolescent and Young Adult Cancers
The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and gather preliminary data on outcomes of a 3-month mHealth intervention to promote physical activity among adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors compared to a delayed intervention control group.

BEHAVIORAL: Intervention
Accrual rate, Number of participants who agreed to participate divided by the number of months of recruitment., Through completion of study enrollment, an average of 6 months.|Participation rate, Percentage of eligible participants who agreed to participate., Through completion of study enrollment, an average of 6 months.|Retention rate at 3 months, Number of intervention participants who completed 3-month measures divided by the number who consented to participate., 3 months
Retention rate at 6 months, Number of intervention participants who completed 6-month measures divided by the number randomized to the intervention group., 6 months|Satisfaction with intervention, Ratings of satisfaction with the intervention, as measured by satisfaction questionnaire., 6 months|Adherence to physical activity monitoring, Number of days physical activity tracked, as measured by Fitbit., Through study completion, 6 months|Physical activity: objective, Change in objective levels of physical activity, as measured by accelerometry (Actigraph), from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Physical activity: self-report, Change in self-report levels of physical activity, as measured by the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Sedentary behavior: self-report, Change in self-report levels of sedentary behavior, as measured by the Marshall Sitting Time Questionnaire, from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Weight, Change in self-reported weight, from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Intrinsic motivation, Change in intrinsic motivation, as measured by the intrinsic motivation subscale of the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire for Exercise, from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months. Responses to four items comprising intrinsic motivation subscale are averaged to yield a score from 1 to 7, with higher values representing higher intrinsic motivation., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Self-efficacy for exercise, Change in self-efficacy for exercise, as measured by the Self-Efficacy and Exercise Habits Survey, from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months. Responses for two subscales (Sticking to it, Making time for exercise) are averaged to yield a score from 1 to 5, with higher values representing higher self-efficacy for exercise., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Social support for exercise, Change in social support for exercise, as measured by the Social Support for Exercise Survey, from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months. Responses for three factors (Family participation, Friend participation, Friends on social networking sites participation), ranging from 1 to 5, are summed, with higher values representing higher social support for exercise., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months
Posttraumatic growth, Change in posttraumatic growth, as measured by the Short Form of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months. Responses range from 0 to 5 and yield an overall score and subscale scores for relating to others, new possibilities, personal strength, spiritual change, and appreciation of life. Items are summed, with higher scores reflecting more positive change (i.e., posttraumatic growth)., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Positive psychosocial illness impact, Changes in positive psychosocial impact of illness, as measured by the PROMIS Psychosocial Illness Impact - Positive (4a), from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months. Responses to the 4-item short from range from 1 to 5. Items are summed, with higher scores reflecting more positive psychosocial impact., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Negative psychosocial illness impact, Changes in positive psychosocial impact of illness, as measured by the PROMIS Psychosocial Illness Impact - Negative (4a), from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months. Responses to the 4-item short from range from 1 to 5. Items are summed, with higher scores reflecting more negative psychosocial impact., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Positive affect, Changes in positive affect, as measured by the NIH Toolbox Positive Affect Short Form, from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months|Social network orientation, Changes in positive affect, as measured by the Network Orientation Scale, from baseline to 3 months, and 3 months to 6 months. Responses to 20 items range from 1 to 4. Items are summed (range: 20 to 80), with higher scores representing a more negative social network orientation., Baseline, 3 months, 6 months
Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors are not meeting recommended physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors, and few interventions to date have focused specifically on promoting physical activity among AYAs or capitalized on new technologies to deliver them. This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and gather preliminary data on outcomes of a 3-month mHealth intervention to promote PA among AYA survivors compared to a delayed intervention control group. This project will focus on how to best integrate self-monitoring with wearable trackers, increase self-efficacy, enhance autonomous motivation, and promote social support in a mobile health behavioral intervention that promotes moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) among AYA survivors. Participants will be AYA cancer survivors (N=60), diagnosed at age 15 or older and currently age 18-39. AYA cancer survivors will be recruited from the three comprehensive cancer centers in North Carolina to participate in this study. The behavioral intervention will consist of an activity tracker, Facebook group, weekly email lessons, and weekly tailored feedback emails. Assessments of objectively-measured physical activity and other outcomes will be completed at baseline, 3, and 6 months.
