Camrelizumab in Combination With Apatinib in Refractory and Relapsed DLBCL
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with apatinib in in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma failed from second line chemotherapy.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma|High-grade B-cell Lymphoma|Follicular Lymphoma Grade IIIb|Transformed Lymphoma|EBV-Positive DLBCL, Nos|ALK-Positive Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Apatinib
Overall Response Rate (ORR), Investigator-Assessed, Overall response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy criteria (LYRIC) for Malignant Lymphoma, 2016. Tumor assessments were performed with CT/MRI with or without PET., upto 24 months|The optimal dosage of apatinib combined with camrelizumab, Maximum tolerable dose（MTD）and dose-limiting toxicity（DLT）of apatinib will be conducted in Phase Ib clinical studies. MTD and DLT is defined as protocol-defined apatinib related events., up to 6 months
Progression-free Survival, The time between the start of randomization and the progression of the tumor (any aspect) or (for any reason) death, up to 36 months|Overall Survival, Time from randomization to death for any reason Time from randomization to death for any reason Time from randomization to death for any reason Time from randomization to death for any reason, up to 36 months|Duration of Response, The time from the first assessment of CR or PR to PD (progressive disease) or death from any cause, up to 36 months|Time To Progression, Time from randomization to PD, up to 36 months|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Up to 36 months
Patients with relapsed /refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma usually have a bad prognosis. These patients cannot be treated successfully with the conventional chemotherapy of CHOP. Apatinib is a new type of oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR-2. Some studies have shown that the combination of low-dose apatinib and camrelizumab shows a synergistic effect in the exploration of multiple solid tumors, and the adverse reactions of low-dose apatinib are significantly reduced, and the patients are well tolerated.The investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with apatinib in the patients with relapsed refractory diffuse large B cell lymphomafailed from second line chemotherapy.
