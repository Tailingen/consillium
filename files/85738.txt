A Study of Icotinib With Chemotherapy as Neoadjuvant Therapy for Patients With EGFRm Positive Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase II, single-Arm, prospective study of neoadjuvant Icotinib with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive, resectable for stage II to IIIB(N2) Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Icotinib|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Major Pathological Response (MPR), Defined as â‰¤10% residual cancer cells in the main tumour, as assessed per central pathology laboratory post-surgery, From date of randomization to an average of 12 weeks after the first dose
Pathological complete response (pCR), Defined as absence of any residual cancer cells in the dissected tumour samples, including the main tumour and lymph nodes, assessed post-surgery, From date of randomization to an average of 12 weeks after the first dose|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time from the date of entry to the date of death from any cause., Up to approximately 5.5 years after the last patient is randomized|Disease free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from the date of surgery until the first date of disease recurrence (local or distant) or date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From date of randomization up to approximately 42 months after date of resection|Objective response rate(ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants having a complete response or a partial response, measured by RECIST 1.1., Baseline (Prior to surgery)|Disease control rate(DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants having a complete response , a partial response and disease stability measured by RECIST 1.1., Baseline (Prior to surgery)|R0 surgical resection rate, the proportion of resection margin without macroscopic or microscopic tumor residue (negative resection margin), Post surgery (within one week)|Incidence of Adverse Events, AE captured by CYCAE 5.0, From the time of enrollment to either 28-days after the last dose of last study treatment for patients who do not undergo surgery, or 90-days post-surgery
EGFR Mutation Detection of plasma samples for the following-up patients who take TKI., Monitor the change of plasma EGFR mutation copy number before neoadjuvant therapy, cycle 2 chemotherapy and pre-surgery., Up to 8 days|Change Between Pre-treatment and Post-treatment SUVmax (Standardized Uptake Values) in primary tumor and metastatic lymph node., The reduction degree of SUVmax in primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes before and after neoadjuvant therapy was detected by PET-CT., Up to 8 weeks
