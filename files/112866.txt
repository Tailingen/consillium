Pancreatic Head Resection or Total Pancreatectomy With Islet Autotransplantation in Patients With Periampullary Cancer and High Risk Profile for the Development of Postoperative Pancreatic Fistula
The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether primary total pancreatectomy with simultaneous islet autotransplantation compared with pancreatic head resection (alone) can reduce perioperative morbidity and time to initiation of adjuvant therapy in patients with a high-risk constellation for pancreatic fistulas.
