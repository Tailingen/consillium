Incorporating Biometric Data for Patients Receiving Concurrent Chemotherapy & RT
This study will assess the feasibility of incorporating biometric data via wearable health technology (WHT) into the radiation oncology (RO) clinic workflow for patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy and systemic therapy (CRT) for cancer. The investigators hypothesize that a practical workflow could be created within a busy community RO practice that will allow providers and patients to readily appreciate physiologic declines during concurrent CRT.

Subjects will be asked to wear a device as part of this study that will collect their biometric data (heart rate, number of steps taken per day, etc) called a WHT device throughout their treatment and for 4 weeks afterward. Subjects will be asked to upload the data from their devices onto the computers in the clinic for the assessment.
Cancer
The rate of technology adoption, The rate of technology adoption will be quantified as the fraction of subjects who successfully download their WHT data into the research databases in the radiation oncology clinic. Success, on a subject-specific basis, will be defined as their reporting any of their WHT biometric data on \>40% of eligible days., Up to 12 weeks
Provider perception of the utility, The physician's and nurse's subjective assessment of the utility of having the subject's wearable health technology data such as enhanced dietary or hydration counseling, supportive medication alteration, and/or intravenous fluid hydration will be quantified, using a survey., Up to 12 weeks|Subject perception of the utility, The subjects' responses to the utility of wearable health technology data will be quantified using surveys., Up to 12 weeks
