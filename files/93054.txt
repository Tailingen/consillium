Adoptive TReg Cell for Suppression of aGVHD After UCB HSCT for Heme Malignancies
This is a single center pilot study of a non-myeloablative umbilical cord blood transplant for the treatment of a hematological malignancy with a single infusion of T regulatory (Treg) given shortly after UCB transplantation.
