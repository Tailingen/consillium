A Phase II Study of Advanced Salivary Gland Carcinoma Based on Molecular Typing
This is a single-center, open-label, phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of target therapy for patients with relapsed/metastastic salivary gland carcinoma based on molecular typing.
Advanced Salivary Gland Carcinoma
DRUG: SHR-A1811|DRUG: SHR 3680 + leuprolide|DRUG: SHR-A1921|DRUG: SHR-A1811
ORR, Objective response rate defined as the patients confirmed complete response or partial response under RECIST 1.0 criteria., at the end of every 2 cycles(for arm1, arm3 and arm4, each cycle is 21 days, for arm2, each cycle is 28 days)
DCR, DCR defined as the patients confirmed complete response or partial response or stable disease under RECIST 1.0 criteria., at the end of every 2 cycles(for arm1, arm3 and arm4, each cycle is 21 days, for arm2, each cycle is 28 days)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the recorded date of death of participants., up to 2 years|Adverse events, Hematologic and non hematologic adverse event (CTCAE 5.0）, Since the signing of informed consent forms to 30 days after the last cycle
Patients with IHC HER2 IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/ISH+ will be located into arm 1 to receive anti-her2 ADC（SHR- A1811） Patients with IHC AR positive will be located into arm 2 to receive anti-androgen therapy (SHR-3680)+leuprolide Patients with HER2 negative and AR negative will be located into arm 3 to receive anti-TROP2 ADC (SHR-A1921) Patients with IHC HER2 IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH- will be located into arm 4 to receive anti-her2 ADC（SHR- A1811）
