Mutant KRAS -Targeted Long Peptide Vaccine for Patients at High Risk of Developing Pancreatic Cancer
This Phase 1 study will evaluate safety and the immune response to pooled mutant-KRAS peptide vaccine with poly-ICLC adjuvant for patients who have been identified to be at risk of developing pancreatic cancer.

This study will evaluate safety and the immune response to pooled mutant-KRAS peptide vaccine (KRAS peptide vaccine) with poly-ICLC adjuvant. The primary endpoints of this study are to determine the safety of administering the KRAS peptide vaccine with poly-ICLC adjuvant and to assess the maximal percent change of IFN-γ-producing mutant-KRAS-specific T cells per patient at any time after vaccination. Twenty five patients will be enrolled to achieve 20 evaluable patients for Cohort A. Twelve patients will be enrolled to achieve 10 evaluable patients for Cohort B.

For all patients, the study will consist of a screening phase, treatment phase, and a follow-up visit. All subjects will have the option remaining on study with annual follow-up visits that begin approximately one year after the last vaccine dose and continue annually thereafter until study closure.
