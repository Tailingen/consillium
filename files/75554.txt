Modi-1 in Breast, Head and Neck, Ovarian, or Renal Cancer
The main objectives of this study are to assess the safety, tolerability, immunological activity, and preliminary efficacy of the Modi-1/Modi-1v vaccine, both as monotherapy and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab (where these are standard of care in a non-neoadjuvant setting), in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), advanced/unresectable human papillomavirus-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), high grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), or renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

Modi-1 will also be investigated in the neoadjuvant setting for patients with SCCHN undergoing curative intent surgical resection in combination with pembrolizumab versus the Modi-1 alone.

Incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events (AEs), To measure the incidence of AEs of Modi-1 and Modi-1v (as monotherapy and in combination with a CPI (e.g., pembrolizumab or nivolumab provided as standard of care) when administered intradermally, For the duration of the study (12 weeks after the final dose of study treatment)|Cellular immune response to Modi-1on IFNγ ELISpot assay, (i) the mean peptide-specific ELISpot response minus two standard deviations is greater than the mean pre-treatment peptide-specific response plus one standard deviation (of this mean); and (ii) the ELISpot response is more than 50 spots per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells., For the duration of the study (12 weeks after the final dose of study treatment)
Imaging Response using RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST to Modi-1 and Modi-1v in the non-neoadjuvant setting, To measure imaging response of Modi-1 and Modi1v in non-neoadjuvant cohorts, as monotherapy in patients with TNBC, advanced/unresectable HPV-negative SCCHN, HGSOC, or RCC and in combination with CPI therapy (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab and avelumab), For the duration of the study (12 weeks after the final dose of study treatment)|Overall survival, The overall survival will measured in patients vaccinated with Modi-1 and Modi-1v either as monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in the target population., For the duration of the study (12 weeks after the final dose of study treatment)|Progression-free survival in patients vaccinated with Modi-1 and Modi-1v., The progression-free survival will measured in patients vaccinated with Modi-1 and Modi-1v either as monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in the target population., For the duration of the study (12 weeks after the final dose of study treatment)|Pathological response in the neoadjuvant setting in patients vaccinated with Modi-1 or Modi-1 + Pembrolizumab, Pathological response will be measured in tumour tissue of patients vaccinated with Modi-1 monotherapy or Modi-1 + Pembrolizumab in patients with SCCHN undergoing planned resection, For the duration of the study (6 weeks after resection surgery)|Celluar immune response in the neoadjuvant setting in patients vaccinated with Modi-1 or Modi-1 + Pembrolizumab, Immune cells will be profiled and measured in tumour tissue of patients vaccinated with Modi-1 monotherapy or Modi-1 + Pembrolizumab in patients with SCCHN undergoing planned resection, For the duration of the study (6 weeks after resection surgery)
Immune cell profiling in tumour samples, Immune cells will be profiled from available biopsy tissue, For the duration of the study (12 weeks after the final dose of study treatment)|Measurement of circulating tumour deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA), ctDNA will be measured in blood in patients vaccinated with Modi-1 and Modi-1v either as monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in the target population., For the duration of the study (12 weeks after the final dose of study treatment)
This is an open-label, parallel arm, Phase 1/2 study to assess the safety, tolerability, immunological activity, and preliminary efficacy of the Modi-1/Modi-1v vaccine in patients with advanced TNBC, advanced/unresectable SCCHN, HGSOC, or RCC.

The study proposes a trial of novel Modi-1/Modi-1v vaccines, consist of a combination of specific peptides conjugated to a toll-like receptor ligand 1/2 adjuvant, designed to enhance immune responses against peptides commonly expressed or upregulated by cancer cells. Thus, improving immune recognition of these cancers and potentially increasing response rates in patients with advanced solid tumours.

The aim of this study is to investigate preliminary efficacy of Modi-1 vaccine(s), in an open labelled clinical trial, in participants with TNBC, SCCHN, RCC and HGSOC, powered to demonstrate that Modi-1 vaccines have potent anti-tumour activity.

In this trial, Modi-1/Modi-1v will be administered, either as monotherapy or in combination with a CPI (as standard of care).

In addition, an exploratory, randomised cohort will be included to assess the impact of Modi-1 (with or without pembrolizumab) in participants with SCCHN scheduled for resection surgery with curative intent.

Modi-1/Modi-1v will be administered intradermally using the MicronJet600™ microneedle device referred to as NanoPass.

The study aims to enrol 144 (114 in non-neoadjuvant cohorts and 30 in the exploratory neoadjuvant SCCHN cohort) individuals across multiple UK collaborating clinical centres.
