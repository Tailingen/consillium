Liposomal Doxorubicin in Treating Patients With Liver or Bile Duct Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of liposomal doxorubicin in treating patients with liver or bile duct cancer.
Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer|Gallbladder Cancer|Liver Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and toxicity of doxorubicin HCl liposome in patients with carcinomas of the liver and bile ducts.

OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 15 minutes every 21 days. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously starting on day 2 and continuing for 10-14 days. Disease is restaged after every 3 courses. Treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 17-26 evaluable patients accrued into this study.
