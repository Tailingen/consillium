A Study of Effect of Megakaryocytes and Platelets in Breast Cancer
Determining if Megakaryocytes and Platelets are Harmful or Helpful in Breast Cancer Cell Metastasis
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Blood draw
Platelet Counts, Measure of the number of platelets in the blood, reported as platelets per microliter of blood., Baseline
Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Measures the average size of red blood cells, reported as femtoliters (fl)., Baseline|Lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio, Ratio between the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts measured in peripheral blood., Baseline|Levels of tumor educated platelets, Number of tumor educated platelets, measured by the analysis of cell surface markers for expression of certain markers such as VEGF, PDGFR, MMP1, TGFb, and or other cell adhesion molecules., Baseline
The purpose of this study is to determine how megakaryocytes (cells in the bone marrow responsible for making platelets, which are necessary for blood clotting) affect the survival and growth/division patterns of breast cancer stem cells, and the effects of breast cancer cells on megakaryocyte survival and function. Through chart review, the study team will look at the relationship between different blood components and different breast cancer diagnoses.
