A randomized phase II trial that compares paclitaxel/carboplatin (PC) to PC chemotherapy followed by gefitinib for 2 weeks in patients with NSCLC without EGFR mutations. While previous studies with cytotoxic agents and gefitinib failed to show any benefit, we altered the schedule of administration in hopes to gain synergy between agents.
