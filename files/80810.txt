Outpatient Clinic for Late Outcome for Breast Carcinoma in MAASTRO Clinic.
In order to evaluate the late outcome in patients curatively treated for breast cancer, a special outpatient clinic will be developed.

There are two main purposes of the outpatient clinic. The first purpose is evaluating the results of the radiation treatment by mapping A) late toxicity and B) tumour control and survival.

The second purpose is that this outpatient clinic for late outcome will also function as a pilot for a new CAT (Computer Assisted Theragnostics, abbreviated CAT project) in which multiple late outcome variables will be recorded. In this pilot we want to investigate whether physical presence of the patient on the outpatient clinic, allowing physical examination, has any added value to the questionnaires filled in by the patient at home.

The ultimate aim of this new CAT project is to use these multicentric data to develop models for predicting both oncological outcome and late side effects. Insight in the beneficial and adverse effects of a certain treatment using these predictive models, will be required choose the optimal treatment for the individual patient using a shared decision making process.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Outpatient clinic
The primary endpoint is the incidence and severity of locoregional late toxicity at 10 years after radiotherapy., As primary endpoint, for each patients the STAT score will be determined, summarizing locoregional late toxicity, e.g. fibrosis, cosmetic outcome, shoulder dysfunction, lymphedema arm, pain \[Barnett et al, 2012\]., One assessment approximately 10 years after radiotherapy
The secondary endpoint is 10 year survival rate and the incidence and severity of other than locoregional late toxicity., The secondary endpoint is 10 year survival rate, and late toxicity, other than locoregional late toxicity, e.g. fatigue, neuropathy, menopausal symptoms, cardiac and pulmonary symptoms, and secondary tumors. Survival will be divided in overall survival, locoregional recurrence free survival and distant metastases free survival. For each patient other toxicity at 10 year will be scored according to CTC-AE 4., One assessment approximately 10 years after radiotherapy
In addition, we will record potential risk factors for the several outcome parameters, The following the potential risk factors are recorded:

1. Patient related risk factors:

   * Age at time of diagnosis
   * Genetic and protein profile blood samples (optional with informed consent of participant)
   * Smoking
2. Treatment related factors:

   * Type of surgery
   * Excision volume
   * Post-operative complications
   * Resection margins Free
   * Scar visibility
   * Axillary surgery
   * Radiotherapy
   * Fractionation scheme
   * Target volumes
   * Dose-volume parameters
   * Actually delivered dose
   * Chemotherapy
   * Hormonal treatment
   * Immunotherapy
3. Tumor related factors

   * Localization
   * Stage
   * Differentiation grade
   * Hormonal receptors
   * HER-2
   * Genetic profile, one consultation by physician (assistant) ten years after radiotherapy
