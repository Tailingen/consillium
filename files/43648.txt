EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (EBV+ DLBCL-NOS), is an EBV-positive clonal B-cell lymphoid proliferation and circulating EBV-DNA is a great indicator for prognosis among EBV associated disease.Currently, there is no internationally standardized treatment regimen for EBV+DLBCL, NOS. There is an urgent clinical need to explore novel effective therapeutic strategies to improve survival in this patient population.CD30 is highly expressed in EBV+DLBCL, and CD30 positivity serves as an adverse prognostic factor.

Brentuximab Vedotin (BV), a CD30-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), has shown significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and overall response rate (ORR) compared to placebo + lenalidomide + rituximab in relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients according to the ECHELON-3 study.Therefore, we propose a randomized, prospective, multicenter phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy (PFS, ORR \[CR/CRu + PR\], CRR, OS) and safety profile of Brentuximab Vedotin combined with R-CHP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin,Prednisone) in newly diagnosed EBV+DLBCL, NOS patients.
