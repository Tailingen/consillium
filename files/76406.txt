A Phase 2 Study to Evaluate DNTH103 in Adults With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (MAGIC)
The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacometrics, and efficacy of DNTH103 in participants with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).
Myasthenia Gravis, Generalized
DRUG: DNTH103|DRUG: Placebo
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Number of participants with TEAEs and treatment-emergent SAEs will be reported., Baseline (Day 1) to Week 13
Change from Baseline in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) Scale Score, The MG-ADL score is an 8-item patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument. The MG-ADL targets symptoms of disability across ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and axial symptoms. The item responses are scored from 0 to 3, and the total score of the MG-ADL is the sum of the 8 items and ranges from 0 to 24, with a higher score indicating more disability., Baseline (Day 1) to Week 13|Change from Baseline in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) Scale Score, The QMG is a clinician-reported assessment to evaluate muscle strength. The QMG consists of 13 items that measure endurance or fatiguability, with each item having a possible score that ranges from 0 - 3. The total possible QMG scores range from 0 - 39, with a higher score indicating greater disease burden., Baseline (Day 1) to Week 13|Change from Baseline to Week 13 in Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) Scale Score, The MGC is a validated assessment tool for measuring clinical status of participants with MG. The range of total MGC score is 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. A clinically meaningful improvement is reflected by a 3-point improvement in MGC score. The MGC assesses 10 important functional areas most frequently affected by MG and the scales are weighted for clinical significance that incorporates patient-reported outcomes., Baseline (Day 1) to Week 13|Incidence of TEAEs and Treatment-Emergent SAEs, Number of participants with TEAEs and treatment-emergent SAEs will be reported., Baseline (Day 1) up to Week 52 of the OLE|Serum Concentrations of DNTH103, Blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of DNTH103 at various timepoints both pre- and post-dose., Baseline (Day 1) to Week 52 of the OLE|Change from Baseline in Complement Total Blood Test (CH50), Blood samples will be collected to determine changes in CH50 at various timepoints., Baseline (Day 1) to Week 52 of the OLE|Incidence and Titer of Antidrug Antibody (ADAs) Against DNTH103, Blood samples will be collected to measure ADA against DNTH103 at various timepoints., Baseline (Day 1) to Week 52 of the OLE

* Screening (up to 10 weeks)
* Randomized, blinded, controlled treatment (RCT) period (13 weeks)
* Open-label extension (OLE) period (optional) for eligible participants (52 weeks)
* Safety follow-up (40 weeks)
