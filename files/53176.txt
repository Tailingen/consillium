CD19 CAR T Cells in Children and Adults With Relapsed or Refractory CD19 Positive B Cell Malignancies
This study seeks to examine the feasibility and safety of the administration of autologous T cells that have been modified through the introduction of a chimeric antigen receptor targeting the B cell surface antigen CD19 following administration of chemotherapy lymphodepletion regimen in children and adults with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies.
Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Malignancies
DRUG: CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells
80% Proportion of products successfully manufactured meeting the established release criteria with a goal of at least CAR-T cell 1 X 10^6 cells/kilogram., To examine the feasibility of manufacture of autologous CD19 CAR T-cells at a minimum target dose of 1 X 106 cells/kilogram using the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy® automated system, 3 years|Incidence and severity of adverse events, To determine the safety of infusion with chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD19, 3 years|Incidence and severity of Dose Limited Toxicities, Find the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for recurrent/refractory B cell malignancies, 3 years|Incidence and severity of Maximum Toxicity Dose, Find the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for recurrent/refractory B cell malignancies, 3 year
The overall goal of this study is to validate the safety profile of administration CD19 CAR T cells and describe the toxicities in children and adults with relapsed/ refractory B cell malignancies. The dose is escalated in standard 3 +3 design with a starting dose of

1x106 cell/kilogram and maximum treatment dose of 5 x 106 cell/kilogram. The minimum number of 9 subjects would occur if no dose-limiting toxicities are observed in the 3 dose escalation cohorts. The maximum sample size of 18 subjects would be enrolled in 3 dose escalation cohorts (six in each cohort) for meeting dose-limiting toxicities request. In addition, we hypothesize that we will be able to successfully manufacture CAR T cells to meet the established release criteria at a minimum target dose of 1 X 106 +-30% cells/kilogram in this patient population using the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy® closed transduction system.
