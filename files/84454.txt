Combined Incidence of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 or Worse Related to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 6, 11, 16, or 18, The endpoint included pathology panel consensus diagnosis of CIN 2 or 3, adenocarcinoma in situ, invasive squamous cervical carcinoma, or invasive adenocarcinoma of the cervix, and HPV type 6, 11, 16, or 18 detected in an adjacent section from the same tissue block. The point estimates and exact 95% confidence intervals for incidence rate were based on the Poisson distribution., Up to Month 48
