The investigators propose to evaluate Guardant Health's commercially available colorectal cancer screening assay(Guardant SHIELD) in individuals who are not up to date with CRC screening.
Colon Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: GuardantSHIELD Blood Test
Assess colorectal cancer screening completion, Assess the proportion who received any CRC screening test (blood draw, FIT or FIT-DNA, or flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) within 3 months of eligibility determination among eligible individuals in the blood test and usual care groups., Within 3 months of patient identification
Assess the proportion who completed follow-up testing., Assess the proportion who completed follow-up colonoscopy within 6 months of their result among individuals with an abnormal non-invasive test result; comparing the blood test and usual care groups., Within 6 months of abnormal FIT test
The investigators propose to evaluate Guardant Health's commercially available colorectal cancer screening assay(Guardant SHIELD) in individuals who are not up to date with CRC screening.

Primary Objective (or Aim) Assess colorectal cancer screening completion among patients who are non-adherent after receiving stool test outreach, who have an upcoming clinical appointment, and who are offered a commercially available colorectal cancer blood test versus usual care (i.e. reminder to complete stool testing during their clinical appointment).

Secondary Objectives (or Aim) Assess patients' and providers' perceived confidence in the test (based on available test performance characteristics) and willingness to obtain/offer the test on an on-going basis, based on qualitative interviews; assess preliminary rates of follow-up colonoscopy completion (after an initial abnormal test result) among participants allocated to the blood test vs. usual care condition.
