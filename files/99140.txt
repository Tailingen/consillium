Combination of BI6727 (Volasertib) and BIBF1120 in Solid Tumors
The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) in terms of safety and tolerability of BI 6727 in combination with fixed dose BIBF 1120, in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumours.
Neoplasms
DRUG: BI 6727|DRUG: BIBF 1120
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in the First Cycle for the Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)., DLT was defined as:

1. Drug-related CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicity (except untreated vomiting, untreated nausea, or untreated diarrhoea) or
2. Drug-related CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia for 7 or more days and/or complicated by infection or
3. CTCAE grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 28 days|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Volasertib in Combination With Nintedanib, The MTD was determined using a 3+3 design with de-escalation. The MTD was defined as the highest dose level at which maximal 1 out of 6 patients experienced DLT in the first course of the escalation nd de-escalation phase. However, all DLT's occurring in the trial were considered for selection of the recommended dose for further development., 28 days
Number of Participants With Drug Related Adverse Events, Number of participants with investigator-defined drug related adverse events., From first study drug administration until 28 days after the last administration of any study medication, up to 485 days|Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities, Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).

DLT was defined as:

1. Drug-related CTCAE grade 3 or 4 non-haematological toxicity (except untreated vomiting, untreated nausea, or untreated diarrhoea) or
2. Drug-related CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia for 7 or more days and/or complicated by infection or

CTCAE grade 4 thrombocytopenia, From first study drug administration until 28 days after the last administration of any study medication, up to 485 days|Cmax of Volasertib, Maximum measured concentration (Cmax) in plasma of Volasertib in Cycle 1., 0:05 h before start of Volasertib infusion and 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00, 8:00 and 24 h after start of Volasertib infusion|CL of Volasertib, Total plasma Clearance (CL) of Volasertib in Cycle 1., 0:05 h before start of Volasertib infusion and 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00, 8:00 and 24 h after start of Volasertib infusion|Vss of Volasertib, Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of Volasertib in Cycle 1., 0:05 h before start of Volasertib infusion and 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00, 8:00 and 24 h after start of Volasertib infusion|Cmax of Nintedanib, Maximum measured concentration (Cmax) of Nintedanib in Cycle 1.

400 mg Volasertib + 200 mg Nintedanib group is not displayed due to data only being available for one patient., 5 min before Nintedanib administration in the morning and 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00, 6:00 h after administration on Day 9|AUC(0-6h) of Nintedanib, Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of Nintedanib over the time interval 0 to 6 hours in Cycle 1.

400 mg Volasertib + 200 mg Nintedanib group is not displayed due to data only being available for one patient., 5 min before Nintedanib administration in the morning and 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00, 6:00 h after administration on Day 9|Tmax of Nintedanib, Time from dosing to the maximum measured concentration, Cmax, of Nintedanib (tmax) in Cycle 1.

400 mg Volasertib + 200 mg Nintedanib group is not displayed due to data only being available for one patient., 5 min before Nintedanib administration in the morning and 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 4:00, 6:00 h after administration on Day 9|Number of Patients With Best Overall Response, Best overall response based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Best overall response is defined as the best overall response (complete response, partial response, stable disease, progressive disease or not evaluable) since the start of treatment., Tumor assessment was performed at screening and every 2nd course until earliest time of progression, death or end of treatment.|Number of Patients With Objective Response (OR), Objective tumor response based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. OR is defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best response throughout the study., Tumor assessment was performed at screening and every 2nd course until earliest time of progression, death or end of treatment.|Number of Patients With Disease Control, Disease control based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Disease control is defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) as best response throughout the study., Tumor assessment was performed at screening and every 2nd course until earliest time of progression, death or end of treatment.|Duration of Disease Control, Disease control based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Patients who had a best overall tumour response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) were assessed to show disease control., Tumor assessment was performed at screening and every 2nd course until earliest time of progression, death or end of treatment.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from start of treatment with study medication to tumour progression or death whichever occurs first. Tumour response was to be documented using appropriate techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer tomography (CT)., Tumor assessment was performed at screening and every 2nd course until earliest time of progression, death or end of treatment.
