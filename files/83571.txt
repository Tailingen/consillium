Comparison of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis to Conventional Mammography
In March 2009, Health Canada approved Tomosynthesis for use in screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. The Tomosynthesis technology is designed as a complementary imaging model that is incorporated into the 2D Mammography system. This new imaging system has the capability to provide 2D, 3D and combination mode models. It consists of generating thin slice images that can be viewed individually as multiple images from the same breast. Tomosynthesis provides improved visibility of possible lesions within the breast. The study aims to compare the performance of Tomosynthesis to the conventional Digital Mammography in detecting and characterizing suspicious findings in subjects who will be having breast biopsies.
