PIONEER Study of Lifestyle Intervention to Reduced Breast Cancer Risk
A randomised controlled trial in which women discharged from the symptomatic breast clinic, who are above population risk (according to Tyrer Cuzick) will be asked to create lifestyle related goals. They will be told their estimated risk of developing breast cancer and will be randomised to one of three interventions:

* Breast cancer risk leaflet only
* lifestyle website
* lifestyle website plus group coaching.

Fifty per cent of women will also be randomised to have Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) performed, and these will be incorporated into their risk score.

The primary end point will be whether or not women achieve their lifestyle goal.

BEHAVIORAL: Lifestyle intervention to reduce breast cancer risk
Goal achievement, Whether women have achieved their lifestyle goals. Proportion answering "yes" to a binary question: Did you achieve the goal you set? Compared between the three arms., Women will be asked this 12 months after entering the study
To assess the acceptability of women to find out their personalised breast cancer risk and to commit to making a change in a modifiable risk factor, Proportion of women approached who go on to join the study, Measured when recruitment is complete, estimated at 3 months from start date|To assess the acceptability of randomisation to different arms of intervention, Attrition rate after randomisation within each group, Measured when the final participant has completed 12 months in the study, estimated 15 months from start date|To assess the impact of SNP testing on changes in behavioural risk factors, Goal achievement in SNP group compared with goal achievement in non-SNP group., Measured when the final participant has completed 12 months in the study estimated 15 months from start date|To assess the impact of the different interventions on changes in behavioural risk factors, Goal achievement compared between leaflet only group, website group and website + coaching group., Measured when the final participant has completed 12 months in the study estimated 15 months from start date|To assess the impact of knowledge of breast cancer risk on cancer anxiety scores, Change in Cancer Worry Scale (Revised) score from 0 to 3 months. Cancer Worry score is measured between 8 and 32 with 32 being the highest level of anxiety., Measured when the final participant has completed 12 months in the study estimated 15 months from start date|To identify whether there is an association between initial Cancer Worry Scale (Revised) score and change in behavioural risk factors, Cancer Worry score compared with goal achievement. Cancer Worry score is between 8 and 32 with 32 being the highest level of anxiety., Measured when the final participant has completed 12 months in the study estimated 15 months from start date|To identify whether commitment to a study of this design is sustainable and affected by study group, Participant retention rate., Measured when the final participant has completed 12 months in the study estimated 15 months from start date|To assess the impact of the different interventions on uptake and adherence to chemoprevention at 1 year, Proportion of women still taking chemoprevention at close of study compared between the three arms., Measured when the final participant has completed 12 months in the study estimated 15 months from start date|To consider the scalability of each element of the pilot study, Administration time required for each group; Average goal achievement compared to average cost of each intervention., Measured when the final participant has completed 12 months in the study estimated 15 months from start date
