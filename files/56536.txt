In Vivo Characterization of Macrophages in Pediatric Patients With Malignant Brain Tumors Using Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI
This pilot early phase I trial studies how well ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates with inflammatory (macrophage) responses in pediatric patients with malignant brain tumors. If there is good correlation, ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI can serve as a noninvasive imaging biomarker of inflammation.

Iron concentration measurements, Obtain susceptibility measurements and relaxation times (R2, R2\*, R2') in patients receiving ferumoxytol., Day 1
Macrophages on histopathology, Determine the number of macrophages in tissue samples at histopathology., Days 2-4
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To establish the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging signal characteristics of macrophages in pediatric patients (\>= 2 years old) with newly diagnosed malignant brain tumors using ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To correlate the MRI signal of ferumoxytol uptake in macrophages with the number of macrophages in surgical tumor specimen at histopathology.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive a single intravenous infusion of ferumoxytol over 15 minutes. After 24 hours, patients undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients will then undergo MRI-localized tissue sampling and tumor resection.
