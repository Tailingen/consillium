Celecoxib in Treating Patients With Progressive Metastatic Differentiated Thyroid Cancer
RATIONALE: Celecoxib may stop the growth of thyroid cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by blocking the enzymes necessary for tumor cell growth.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in treating patients who have progressive metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: celecoxib
Examine efficacy of celecoxib in patients with progressive metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma by assessing progression free survival., up to 12 months following treatment
Quantifying gene expression and protein levels of angiogenic markers[vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from pre-,during-, pre-study, every eight weeks and off study|Quantifying gene expression and protein levels of cytokines [interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, IL-6 and interferon (IFN)-γ] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from pre-,during-, and post-treatment blood samples.|Evaluate cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in tumor biopsies to correlate with clinical response.
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the efficacy of celecoxib, in terms of progression-free survival, in patients with progressive metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
* Correlate cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein expression in tumor biopsies by immunohistochemistry with clinical response in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily beginning on day 1. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 3 additional months of therapy beyond documentation of CR.

Patients are followed at 4-8 weeks.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 6 months.
