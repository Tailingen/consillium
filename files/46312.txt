Liver MRI With Primovist/Eovist in Pediatric Subjects Who Are Suspected or Have Focal Liver Lesions.
Medical records are reviewed to obtain information about the use of a MRI diagnostic imaging agent (contrast agent) called Primovist/Eovist in children older than 2 months and less than 18 years. Data that has been recorded in the child's medical records relating to the injection of Primovist/Eovist will be collected. Information will be collected from up to 2 weeks before the child received Primovist/Eovist until 12 months after the child received Primovist/Eovist. Copy of the child's MR images that were taken right before and after the child received Primovist/Eovist and all other reports (laboratory reports, other imaging reports, etc) that are part of the child's medical records during that time period will be collected.

Percentage of Participants With Overall Change in Additional Diagnostic Information Obtained When Comparing the Combined Precontrast/Postcontrast Images With the Precontrast Images., Overall Change in additional diagnostic information was defined as a change in at least 1 of the 5 variables below obtained from the combined precontrast and postcontrast images as compared with the precontrast images: 1. Change in number of lesions: greater or fewer 2. Improved border delineation of the primary lesion 3. Increased contrast of primary lesion versus. background 4. Change in size of the primary lesion: larger or smaller 5. Change in information about lesion characterization (lesion type): improved, unchanged, worsened, When precontrast and postcontrast images are available from all enrolled subjects, on average 1 year post Primovist/Eovist MRI|Number of Participants With Laboratory Values Considered to be Clinically Relevant Values or Abnormalities at Pre-injection Time Point, Laboratory parameters analyzed: Hematology: leukocytes, erythrocytes, hematocrit, platelets, hemoglobin, prothrombin time and differential counts (neutrophils total, neutrophils segmented and lymphocytes); Chemistry: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose, creatinine, bilirubin:, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, total protein, albumin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and α-fetoprotein levels., 14 days prior to Eovist/Primovist MRI|Number of Participants With Laboratory Values Considered to be Clinically Relevant Values or Abnormalities 24 Hours Post-injection, The following parameters were analyzed: Hematology: leukocytes, erythrocytes, hematocrit, platelets, hemoglobin, prothrombin time and differential counts (neutrophils total, neutrophils segmented and lymphocytes) Clinical chemistry: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose, creatinine, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, total protein, albumin, eGFR, and α-fetoprotein levels., Up to 24 hours post-Eovist/Primovist MRI|Vital Signs: Mean Change From Baseline in Heart Rate, 14 days prior to and up to 24 hours post-Eovist/Primovist MRI|Vital Signs: Mean Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure, 14 days prior to and up to 24 hours post-Eovist/Primovist MRI|Vital Signs: Mean Change From Baseline in Diastolic Blood Pressure, 14 days prior to and up to 24 hours post-Eovist/Primovist MRI
Change in Diagnosis Obtained From the Combined Precontrast and Postcontrast Images as Compared With the Precontrast Images, When precontrast and postcontrast images are available from all enrolled subjects, on average 1 year post Primovist/Eovist MRI|Change in Confidence of Diagnosis Obtained From the Combined Precontrast and Postcontrast Images as Compared With the Precontrast Images, When precontrast and postcontrast images are available from all enrolled subjects, on average 1 year post Primovist/Eovist MRI|Change in Number of Nonmalignant Lesions Obtained From the Combined Precontrast and Postcontrast Images as Compared With the Precontrast Images, Change in number of nonmalignant lesions was defined as a change from more to less or less to more obtained from the combined precontrast and postcontrast images as compared with the precontrast images, When precontrast and postcontrast images are available from all enrolled subjects, on average 1 year post Primovist/Eovist MRI|Change in Number of Malignant Lesions Obtained From the Combined Precontrast and Postcontrast Images as Compared With the Precontrast Images, Change in number of malignant lesions was defined as a change from more to less or less to more obtained from the combined precontrast and postcontrast images as compared with the precontrast images, When precontrast and postcontrast images are available from all enrolled subjects, on average 1 year post Primovist/Eovist MRI|Change in Recommended Next Course of Subject Management/Therapy Obtained From the Combined Precontrast and Postcontrast Images as Compared With the Precontrast Images, When precontrast and postcontrast images are available from all enrolled subjects, on average 1 year post Primovist/Eovist MRI|Change in Recommended Next Course of Subject Management / Therapy - Comparison of Precontrast Versus Combined Precontrast/Postcontrast Images (Only Subjects for Whom a Change Was Documented), When precontrast and postcontrast images are available from all enrolled subjects, on average 1 year post Primovist/Eovist MRI|The Overall Image Quality for the Postcontrast Image Only, When precontrast and postcontrast images are available from all enrolled subjects, on average 1 year post Primovist/Eovist MRI|Final Diagnosis (SoT) by Clinical Investigator, When precontrast and postcontrast images are available from all enrolled subjects, on average 1 year post Primovist/Eovist MRI|Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy of Blinded Read of Precontrast and Combined Precontrast/Postcontrast Images Based on Final Diagnosis., Sensitivity is the probability that a test indicates there is disease when there is disease. Specificity is the probability that a test indicates there is no disease when there is no disease. Accuracy is the probability that a test is correct: the test indicates there is no disease when there is no disease and it indicates there is disease when there is disease., When precontrast and postcontrast images are available from all enrolled subjects, on average 1 year post Primovist/Eovist MRI
