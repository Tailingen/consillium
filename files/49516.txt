Universal CAR-T Cells (REVO-UWD-03) for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Lung Cancer
This is an investigator initiated trial to assess the efficacy and safety of a GPC3-targeting CAR-T therapy (REVO-UWD-03) in the HCC and Lung Cancer. It also aims to explore the feasibility of using a novel universal CAR-T cell platform.
HCC - Hepatocellular Carcinoma|NSCLC (Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer)
BIOLOGICAL: Universal CAR-T cells injection for treating HCC and NSCLC
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The highest dose of universal GPC3-CAR-T cells that can be administered without causing unacceptable side effects, measured during the dose escalation phase., Within the first month post-infusion|Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT), The incidence of treatment-related toxicities that prevent further dose escalation., Within the first month post-infusion.|Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), The frequency and severity of adverse events that arise following the administration of universal GPC3-CAR-T cells., From the administration of UWD-03 CAR-T cells through six months post-infusion
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients with a measurable reduction in tumor size (complete or partial response) following universal GPC3-CAR-T therapy., Measured at 3 and 6 months after treatment.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The length of time during and after treatment that the patient lives without disease progression., From the start of treatment up to 5 years.|Overall Survival (OS), The duration from the start of treatment to the time of death from any cause., From the start of treatment up to 5 years.|Duration of Response (DOR), The time from initial tumor response (CR or PR) to disease progression or relapse., From the administration of UWD-03 CAR-T cells to a maximum follow-up period of five years.
The study will use T cells from healthy donors, modified using a novel universal CAR-T technology, to treat HCC and Lung Cancer patients. The antigen-binding site of the CAR molecule recognizes GPC3 as the target.

The main questions it aims to answer are: • What is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GPC3-CAR-T therapy in universal CAR-T cell treatments? • What are the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE)? • What is the treatment efficacy, as measured by objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS)? Researchers will assess whether the universal CAR-T cells have good safety and efficacy in treating HCC or Lung cancer, while improving accessibility and lowering treatment costs. Participants will: • Receive universal GPC3-CAR-T cells through a 3+3 dose escalation scheme. • Undergo chemotherapy conditioning before CAR-T infusion. • Be monitored for adverse events, immune response, and disease progression.

The study will collect data on both short-term outcomes (within the first few months post-treatment) and long-term safety and efficacy.
