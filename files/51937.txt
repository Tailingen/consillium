Immunotherapy in Lymphoma
The goal of this observational study is to compare the efficacy of advanced immunochemotherapy and classical immunochemotherapy in relapsed/refractory high grade B cell lymophoma patients. The main question it aims to answer is:

Does advanced immunochemotherapy, including CAR-T therapy, bispecific antibody, and antibody-drug conjugate offer superior survival outcomes than when treated with classical immunochemotherapy, such as proteasome inhibitors, immune modulatory drugs, and monoclonal antibodies?

Researchers will compare patients receiving advanced immunochemotherapy with those receiving classical immunochemotherapy to determine if advanced therapies result in better survival outcomes.

Laboratory findings and electronic medical records (EMR) from participants will be used to assess survival outcomes and treatment-related safety profiles.

Overall survival, Survival status is assessed through periodic follow-ups and medical records. Patients lost of follow-up are censored at their last known date of contact. The endpoint is either the date of death documented in medical records or the date of the last known follow-up for patients still alive., From the start of treatment or the date of study enrollment until death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months.
Progression-free survival, Disease progression is determined based on clinical, radiographic, or laboratory data, using the Lugano criteria. Patients without documented progression at the time of analysis are censored at their last assessment date., From the start of treatment or the date of study enrollment until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months.
