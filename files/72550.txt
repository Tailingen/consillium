Estrogen Receptors and HER2 Levels' Expression in Luminal Metastatic Breast Cancer
CYCLHER is a retrospective observational multicentric italian study aimed to evaluate the correlation between hormone receptors (HR) and HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC) levels and treatment'response in patients affected by advanced breast cancer treated with first line CDK4/6 inhibitor plus endocrine therapy.
Advanced Breast Carcinoma
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS of HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients who received endocrine treatment plus CDK4/6 inhibitor as first line treatment for metastatic disease, categorized according to estrogen and progesterone receptor levels and HER2 expression status (HER2 0,1+ or 2+ FISH negative)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year".
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR according to estrogen and progesterone receptor levels and HER2 expression status (HER2 0,1+ or 2+ FISH negative)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year".|Overall survival (OS), OS according to estrogen and progesterone receptor levels and HER2 expression status (HER2 0,1+ or 2+ FISH negative)., Through study completion, an average of 1 year".|Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), AEs related to the treatment and evaluated according to CTCAE v5.0, Through study completion, an average of 1 year".
