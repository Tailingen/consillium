EMD 121974 in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of EMD 121974 in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors. EMD 121974 may slow the growth of solid tumors by stopping blood flow to the tumor
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: cilengitide|OTHER: pharmacological study|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
MTD of cilengitide defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity., Graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0., 4 weeks|Toxic effects of cilengitide described as an adverse event that has an attribution of possibly, probably or definitely related to investigational treatment, Graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0., Up to 4 years|Biological activity of this regimen, Measured buy TUNEL assay, CD31 immunohistochemistry, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and FDG-PET scan., Up to 4 years
Pharmacokinetics of cilengitide, At 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 24.0 hours post-end-of-infusion on day 1 of course 1|Observation of response consisting of complete response, partial response, or stable disease, evaluated using the RECIST criteria, Up to 4 years|Time to progression, Up to 4 years
OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the toxic effects and maximum tolerated dose of EMD 121974 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

II. Determine the biologic activity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile and plasma biological effects of this drug and identify any relationship with its biologic activity or observed toxicity in these patients.

IV. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor efficacy of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive EMD 121974 IV over 1 hour twice weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-10 patients receive escalating doses of EMD 121974 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
