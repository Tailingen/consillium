A Phase 1b Study to Investigate Safety and Tolerability of ARGX-119 in Adult Participants with DOK7-Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS)
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ARGX-119 in adult participants with DOK7- Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes. The study will also assess how ARGX-119 is processed by the body (pharmacokinetics), how the immune system reacts to it (immunogenicity), and how it may improve the way patients feel and function.

After the screening period, eligible participants will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive intravenous infusions of ARGX-119 or placebo during the treatment period. Participants will then enter the follow-up period. The full duration of the study is approximately 11 months.
