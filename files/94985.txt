Cancer/Testis Antigen Immunotherapy Phase I Study With 740-CTA Vaccinia Virus
Monocentric open-label phase I/II trial aiming at evaluating, in adjuvant setting, safety (primary outcome), immunological and clinical efficacy (secondary outcomes) of a non replicating recombinant vaccinia virus expressing cancer/testis antigen (CTA) derived epitopes and CD80 and CD40 ligand (CD40L, CD154) costimulatory molecules in patients with CTA expressing tumors.
