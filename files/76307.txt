Study of NALIRIFOX in Advanced Unresectable Small Bowel Tumors
The study regimen will be administered on an outpatient basis and all medications are administered intravenously (IV). Subjects will receive treatment on Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle consisting of the following: nanoliposomal irinotecan at 50 mg/m2, followed by oxaliplatin 60 mg/m2, followed by leucovorin at 400 mg/m2 30 minutes after completion of oxaliplatin, followed by 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 60 minutes after leucovorin completion. Subjects will receive up to 6 cycles of NALIRIFOX then based on response and per physician discretion, de-escalated maintenance treatment with NALIRIFOX minus oxaliplatin may continue. Subjects will continue de-escalated maintenance treatment until progression per RECIST 1.1, intolerable toxicity or physician/subject choice to discontinue.
