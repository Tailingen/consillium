An Observational Study to Describe the Adherence to the SEOM Algorithm for the Treatment of Hyponatraemia in Spain
In 2014, the Spanish Sociedad Española de Oncología Médica (SEOM) algorithm for the treatment of hyponatraemia secondary to to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) in oncology patients was developed. Since it is hypothesised that the adherence to the SEOM algorithm is not 100%, the current retrospective non-interventional study will investigate the perceived and actual adherence of participating centres to the SEOM algorithm and its impact on patient outcomes
Hyponatremia|Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH (SIADH) Secretion
Number of Patients Managed According to the SEOM Algorithm (as a Result Adherence to the Algorithm Will be the % of These Patients Among the Total Number of Patients), Adherence to the algorithm will be evaluated using a pre-defined decision tree that will be provided in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and will be completed by the investigator, Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 4 days (follow-up will stop after a maximum of 6 weeks)
Time to Sodium Level Improvement for Patients Who Were and Were Not Treated in Adherence With the SEOM Algorithm (Days), Improvement is defined as a change in the baseline sodium level category (mild, moderate or severe) from a worse category to a better category or eunatraemia. Note that the time to improvement of sodium levels was defined as the first date/time of improvement of sodium levels - date/time of collection of serum sodium levels at baseline (for patients where there was an improvement in sodium levels) or as the final date/time of collection of serum sodium levels - date/time of collection of serum sodium levels at baseline (for patients that did not achieve an improvement in sodium levels \[censored patients\])., Longitudinal (up to discharge or a maximum of 6 weeks after onset of hyponatremia episode)|Time to Initiation or Re-initiation of Chemotherapy (Since the Start of the Hyponatraemia Episode) in Patients Candidate for Chemotherapy Who Were and Were Not Treated in Adherence With the SEOM Algorithm., Longitudinal (up to discharge or a maximum of 6 weeks after onset of hyponatremia episode)|Length of Hospitalisation (Measured From the Start of the Hyponatraemia Episode to Discharge) for Patients Who Were and Were Not Treated in Adherence With the Algorithm, Longitudinal (up to discharge or a maximum of 6 weeks after onset of hyponatremia episode)|Time to Sodium Level Improvement for Patients Who Were and Were Not Treated in Adherence With the SEOM Algorithm (Hours), Improvement is defined as a change in the baseline sodium level category (mild, moderate or severe) from a worse category to a better category or eunatraemia. Note that the time to improvement of sodium levels was defined as the first date/time of improvement of sodium levels - date/time of collection of serum sodium levels at baseline (for patients where there was an improvement in sodium levels) or as the final date/time of collection of serum sodium levels - date/time of collection of serum sodium levels at baseline (for patients that did not achieve an improvement in sodium levels \[censored patients\])., Longitudinal (up to discharge or a maximum of 6 weeks after onset of hyponatremia episode)
