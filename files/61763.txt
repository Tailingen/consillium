Gastric cancer is one of the malignant tumors that seriously threaten human health. It is the sixth most common malignant tumor in the world. According to Global Cancer Statistics 2020, there were about 1.089 million new cases of gastric cancer and 768,000 deaths of gastric cancer worldwide in 2020. Multidisciplinary treatment with radical surgical resection as the core is the mainstream mode of comprehensive treatment of gastric cancer at present, and radical gastrectomy is recognized as the best treatment. However, for patients with advanced gastric cancer, the effect of surgery alone is not good, and the postoperative tumor recurrence rate is high. In order to improve the disease-free survival rate and overall Surv Ival (OS) rate of gastric cancer patients after surgery, perioperative comprehensive therapy has been gradually adopted by the majority of scholars, and has achieved encouraging efficacy in clinical application.
