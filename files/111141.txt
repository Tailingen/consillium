A Phase 3, Open-label, Crossover Study to Evaluate Self-administration of Rozanolixizumab by Study Participants With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of study participants with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) to successfully self-administer rozanolixizumab after training in the self-administration technique using the syringe driver and manual push methods.
Generalized Myasthenia Gravis
DRUG: Rozanolixizumab
Percentage of Participants With Successful Self-administration of Rozanolixizumab (With Correct Use of Syringe Driver and Manual Push, Respectively) During the Self-administration Period at Visit 13 (Week 12), Successful self-administration was defined by the participant (i) choosing the correct infusion site, (ii) administering SC, and (iii) delivering the intended dose., Week 12 (last dose of Self-administration Period 1)|Percentage of Participants With Successful Self-administration of Rozanolixizumab (With Correct Use of Syringe Driver and Manual Push, Respectively) During the Self-administration Period at Visit 19 (Week 18), Successful Self-administration was defined by the participant (i) choosing the correct infusion site, (ii) administering SC, and (iii) delivering the intended dose., Week 18 (last dose of Self-administration Period 2)
Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) After Syringe Driver or Manual Push Self-administration From Visit 2 (Week 1) up to the End of Study Visit (Visit 21 [Week 26]), An Adverse Event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. A TEAE was defined as an AE starting on or after the date of first administration of rozanolixizumab in the study, up to and including 8 weeks (56 days) after the final dose., From Week 1 up to the End of Study Visit (Week 26)|Percentage of Participants With Local Site Reactions up to 24 Hours After Each Administration During the Training Period and Self-administration Periods, The local site reactions up to 24 hours after each administration were defined as AEs reported as local site reactions as per case report form within one day after RLZ administration., Up to 24 hours after each administration during the Training Period (Baseline to Week 6) and Self-administration Periods (Week 7 to Week 18)|Percentage of Participants With Medication Errors Associated With Adverse Reactions During the 2 Self-administration Periods of the Study, Medication errors were defined as an unintended failure in the drug treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the study participant. Medication Errors associated with adverse reactions during the 2 Self-administration Periods were measured., During the Self-administration Periods (Week 7 to Week 18)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of study participants with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) to successfully self-administer rozanolixizumab after training in the self-administration technique using the syringe driver and manual push methods.
