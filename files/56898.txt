Study Evaluating Cemiplimab Alone and Combined With RP1 in Treating Advanced Squamous Skin Cancer
To estimate the clinical benefit of cemiplimab monotherapy versus cemiplimab in combination with RP1 for patients with locally advanced or metastatic CSCC, as assessed by overall response rate (ORR) and complete response rate (CRR) according to blinded independent review.

RP1 is a selectively replication competent herpes simplex virus type 1(HSV-1). This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter repeat-dosing study of RP1 alone and in combination with nivolumab in patients with advanced malignancies, and contains both single agent dose escalation, dose expansion to include nivolumab, and the combination in multiple Phase 2 cohorts in individual tumor types.
