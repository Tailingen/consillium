Comparison of Needlescopic vs. Conventional Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy for Tumor Less Than 4 cm
The investigator conduct a randomized clinical trial for the needlescopic and conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy to assess whether mini laparoscopic adrenalectomy is better than conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy in terms of pain, complication rate , and wound cosmetics
Post Operative Pain, Acute
DEVICE: Needlescopic laparoscopic adrenalectomy|DEVICE: conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy
Timing that two consecutive VAS less than 3 points, Timing that two consecutive VAS less than 3 points after operation

* The nurse for pain assessement would not know the allocation of the patient to this trial arms
* Wound pain was assessed on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (none) to 10 (worst), up to 1 month postoperatively
Cumulative morphine dosing, \>On the operative day: morphine (10mg/1mL/amp) 2mg IV Q4H PRN(every 4 hours.Pro re nata) was administered intravenously.

\> Post-op Day 1: acetaminophen (500mg/tab) # 1 PO QID (quater in die) and celecoxib (200 mg/Cap) # 1 PO QD( quaque die), morphine (10mg/1mL/amp) 2mg IV Q4H PRN (every 4 hours.Pro re nata) as rescue analgesia (as VAS \>=3), Right after adrenalectomy until the morning of post-op Day 2 ( before the wound dressing change)
If the participant with unilateral PA tumor less than 4cm is willing to enter the clinical trial, he/she will be randomly assigned to two groups (conventional vs needlescopic laparoscopic adrenalectomy) in a 1:1 ratio, followed by preoperative assessement. All procedures were performed by experienced laparoscopic urologists (number of complex laparoscopic procedures \> 50 cases/yr for 10 yrs). The participant were blinded to the type of surgical procedure underwent until the pain assessment was completed in the morning of the second days after surgery
