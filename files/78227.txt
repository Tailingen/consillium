AMT-676 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 1 study will evaluate the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/the recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), safety, tolerability, anti-drug activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of AMT-676 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.
