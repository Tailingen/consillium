A Study With Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, and LY293111 in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness and side effects of LY293111 given in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: LY293111|DRUG: cisplatin
To determine if progression-free survival in patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC receiving gemcitabine and cisplatin can be improved by adding 200 or 600 mg BID of LY293111 as compared to placebo.
