Retrospective and Prospective Study of POmalidomide Plus LoW Dose Dexa Efficacy in RRMM Patients Under Real-Life Conditions
The importance of real-world evidence studies stems from the following considerations. The study population of a specific clinical trial needs to meet strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, which result in a population of participants that is not necessarily representative of the study population of interest treated in routine care. Furthermore, the outcomes of a clinical trial occur under controlled conditions that do not necessarily reflect the routine healthcare practice. This is especially true among patient populations with challenging to treat disease such as in MM, where personalized therapeutic approaches are commonly considered taking into consideration the patients' age and associated comorbidities, among other factors. In addition, observational studies, due to their non-interventional nature, often show increased degree of heterogeneity across the enrolled patient populations compared to clinical studies, thus aiding generalizability of the results.

In light of the above and due to the scarcity of evidence regarding the outcomes for patients with RRMM receiving Pom/LoDex in routine clinical practice, this retrospective chart review and prospective observational study aims to assess the PFS and response to treatment as well as to obtain real-world evidence on the utilization patterns and management strategy of Pom/LoDex in routine clinical care settings in Greece.

This is a non-interventional, multicenter, single-country, retrospective chart review and prospective cohort study which will include a representative sample of patients with RRMM who have been initiated on Pom/LoDex between 01 January 2016 and 28 February 2019 in the third line and beyond treatment setting under routine care conditions in Greece.

The study will be carried out by hospital-based hematology specialists practicing in geographically diverse locations throughout Greece and will be conducted under real-world conditions of daily clinical practice.
