Study of LP002 for the Treatment of Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Primary Mediastinal Large B-cell Lymphoma
LP002 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which prevents PD-L1 from binding to PD-1 and B7.1 receptors on T cell surface, restores T cell activity, thus enhancing immune response and has potential to treat various types of tumors. In this study, the efficacy and safety of LP002 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma will be evaluated.
Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL)
DRUG: LP002
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., up to approximately 24 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first study drug treatment to disease progression (PD) or to death of the subject due to any reason. For subjects whose progression or death is unknown, PFS will be censored at the time of the last valid evaluation., up to approximately 24 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first evidence of repsonse (PR or CR) to the first evidence of PD or the date of death for any reason in patients who have been confirmed to have response (2014 Lugano criteria, PR or CR)., up to approximately 24 months|Time to Response (TTR), Time to Response (TTR) refers to the time from the first treatment with the study drug to the first CR or PR on tumor evaluation., up to approximately 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) refers to the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, PR and SD through imaging evaluation., up to approximately 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) refers to the time from the first study drug treatment to death due to any cause. For subjects who have not been followed up to death, OS will be censored at the last effective survival follow-up time., up to approximately 24 months
