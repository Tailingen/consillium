Response-based Treatment of High-risk Neuroblastoma
The purpose of this study is to improve outcome of high risk neuroblastoma by tailoring the treatment intensity of tandem high dose chemotherapy according to the treatment response to induction chemotherapy.
Newly Diagnosed High Risk Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Ifosfamide|DRUG: Carboplatin|PROCEDURE: Tandem HDCT/auto-SCT|RADIATION: Radiotherapy|DRUG: Interleukin-2|DRUG: Isotretinoin|RADIATION: MIBG
Rate of event free survival, Up to 3 years
Rate of late adverse effects, Up to 3 years
Although the outcome of high-risk neuroblastoma improved after the introduction of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDCT/autoSCT), the outcome still needs to be unsatisfactory.

In the investigator's previous study, good responders who had greater reduction of tumor volume after induction chemotherapy showed lower relapse-free survival compared to poor responders.Simultaneously, the reduction in tumor volume also was greater in patients who died of treatment related mortality than patients who had relapsed tumors. These findings suggest that tailoring treatment intensity according to the early tumor response to induction chemotherapy may improve patient outcomes. So, in this study investigators tailored the treatment intensity of high dose chemotherapy according to the treatment response to induction chemotherapy.
