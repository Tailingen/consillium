Comparison of Imaging Characteristics of uEXPLORER and Conventional PET/CT in Patients With Lung Cancer, Lymphoma, and Melanoma
To determine the minimum scan duration for fluorine-18 positron-emitting radioactive isotope-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans performed on a total-body PET/CT scanner that results in non-inferior image quality to 18F-FDG PET/CT scans performed on a conventional PET/CT scanner. The subject population will be patients being staged for lung cancer, lymphoma, or melanoma.

Minimum scan duration on a total-body PET/CT scanner for quality, To determine the minimum scan duration for 18F-FDG PET/CT scans performed on a total-body PET/CT scanner that results in non-inferior image quality to 18F-FDG PET/CT scans performed on a conventional PET/CT scanner over 20 minutes., One imaging visit up to two hours
Minimum scan duration on a total-body PET/CT scanner for tumor recognition, To determine the minimum scan duration for 18F-FDG PET/CT scans performed on a total-body PET/CT scanner that results in non-inferior tumor conspicuity to 18F-FDG PET/CT scans performed on a conventional PET/CT scanner over 20 minutes (with an additional 2 minutes of data used for optimization purposes)., One imaging visit up to two hours
