Nivolumab in Combination With Talazoparib in Melanoma and Mutations in BRCA or BRCA-ness Genes
The purpose of this study is to evaluate how effective the study drugs, nivolumab (also known as Opdivo®) and talazoparib (also known as Talzenna®) are when given as a combination treatment for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The study team wants to know the effectiveness of these drugs together in treating cancer than if each study drug was given by itself.
Metastatic or Unresectable Melanoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Talazoparib
Best Overall Response as Defined by RECIST 1.1 Criteria, Best overall response, defined as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. Partial response (PR) is defined as a ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions., up to 24 months after treatment through study completion, an average of 2 years
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of disease progression by RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

Progressive disease (PD) is defined as a ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm., up to 24 months after treatment through study completion, an average of 2 years|Number of Participants With Treatment-related Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, as assessed by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, 30 days after start of treatment|Immune-related Overall Response (irOR) Defined by irRECIST, Immune-related overall response (irOR), defined as immune-related complete response (irCR) and immune-related partial response (irPR) by irRECIST, up to 24 months after treatment through study completion, an average of 2 years|Immune-related Progression Free Survival (irPFS), irPFS, defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the date of disease progression by irRECIST, up to 24 months after treatment through study completion, an average of 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), up to 24 months after treatment
Anti-tumor Response as Measured by Immune-infiltration of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, Anti-tumor response by measure of immune-infiltration of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes including flow cytometry on tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), At baseline, 12 weeks|Patient Reported Outcomes for Adverse Events, Patient reported outcomes for adverse events, as measured by PRO-CTCAE while on combination therapy, baseline and before each cycle (every 4 weeks) of nivolumab for a period of 12 months|Evaluation of DNA Landscape as Described by Total Somatic Mutation Burden, Evaluation of DNA landscape as described by total somatic mutation burden by DNA sequencing, At baseline, 12 weeks|Gene Expression Analysis, Gene expression by RNA sequencing, At baseline, 12 weeks
This is a phase II, single arm, multi-institutional, open label trial in a sample size of 37 primary or recurrent, unresectable or metastatic melanoma patients progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy with germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1/2 or BRCA-ness.

The primary objective of this study is to estimate the clinical efficacy of nivolumab plus talazoparib in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRCA1/2 or other DNA damage repair mutations (defined as BRCA-ness)

Secondary objectives and their endpoints include progression free survival (PFS) defined as time from first dose of treatment until disease progression, treatment related adverse events, anti-tumor activity , and immune-related progression free survival (irPFS).
