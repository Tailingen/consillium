The Supraspinal Control of Lower Urinary Tract Function in Patients with Orthotopic Sigmoid Neobladder.
Orthotopic sigmoid neobladder surgery is one of the ideal urinary diversion methods after radical cystectomy.In recent years, functional imaging studies have revealed brain regions related to urinary system function, but brain activity of lower urinary tract function in neobladder patients is still unclear.The aim of this study is to explore the brain activity of urination intention and self-controlled urination behavior in patients with orthotopic sigmoid neobladder by task-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
