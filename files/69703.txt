A Clinical Study of TQB2450 Injection Combined With Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules Versus Paclitaxel as Weekly Treatment of Relapsed Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer
A clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQB2450 injection combined with Anlotinib Hydrochloride capsules versus weekly treatment with paclitaxel of recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.A total of 405 subjects will be enrolled.
Recurrent Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules|DRUG: Paclitaxel injection|DRUG: TQB2450 injection
Disease progression-free survival(PFS) evaluated by Independent Review Committee(IRC), The period from the first use of the drug to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first);, Baseline up to two years|Overall survival (OS), The preriod from the first use of the drug to death from all causes. For subjects who are still alive at the last follow-up, the OS will be counted as data censored based on the last follow-up. For subjects who are lost follow-up, the OS will be counted as data cesored based on the last confirmed survival time before being lost to follow-up., Baseline up to two years
Disease PFS evaluated by investigators, The period from the first use of the drug to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first), Baseline up to two years|PFS rate of 6 months: including PFS rate of 6 months evaluated by IRC and investigators;, The proportion of subjects reaching 6 months from firstly- recorded objective tumor response (complete remission(CR) or partial remission(PR)) to firstly-recorded objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first) ., Baseline up to six months|Objective response rate (ORR) evaluated by IRC and investigators, , the proportion of subjects whose tumors are evaluated as complete remission(CR) and partial remission(PR) by IRC and investigators. It is recorded from the first use of the drug to disease progression or initiation of a new anticancer treatment., Baseline up to two years|Duration of response (DOR), The period from firstly-recorded objective tumor response (CR or PR) to firstly-recorded objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first) ., Baseline up to two years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of subjects whose tumors shrink or remain stable for a certain period, including complete remission（CR）, partial remission（PR） and stable disease（SD）;, Baseline up to two years|OS rate of 12 months, The proportion of subjects who survive for 12 months after the first dose, Baseline up to one year|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)，as well as abnormal laboratory examination indicators., The proportion of AEs and SAEs recorded afte signing the informed consent form(ICF)., Baseline up to two years
