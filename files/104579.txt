A Multicenter Study to Evaluate a Risk-adapted Strategy for Treatment of Extra Cranial Non Seminomateous Malignant Germ Cell Tumour in Children and Adolescent
The main objective is to assess the benefit-risk ratio of a risk-adapted strategy for treatment of extra cranial NSMGCT in children and adolescent.
Extra Cranial Non Seminomateous Malignant Germ Cell Tumour
DRUG: Velbe-Bleomycin-Cisplatin|DRUG: Vepeside-ifosfamide-Cisplatin
Progression-free survival, 24 months
Overall survival, Within 10 years after the first inclusion, from the date of inclusion to the date of death due to any cause|complete remission rate after 1st line treatment (chemotherapy and surgery), 3 weeks after the end of treatment (CT + surgery)
Two different situations will be considered:

* in NSMGCT patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, the objective is to maintain a 2-year progression-free survival rate \>80% despite a limitation of the number of course of chemotherapy (â‰¤4) after the achievement of a clinical and biological response (primary endpoint);
* in children over 10 years with testicular or extragonadal NSMGCT, the objective is to improve the overall survival by systematically classifying the patients in high-risk group to allow a dose intensification.
