A Randomized Study of GEMOX With or Without Cetuximab in Locally Advanced and Metastatic BTC
The primary objective is to investigate the objective response rate in patients receiving GEMOX (gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin) plus cetuximab as first line treatment in advanced or metastatic unresectable BTC biliary tract cancer compared to patients receiving the same chemotherapy without cetuximab. The secondary objectives include the exploration of the effect of the multimodality strategy on progression-free and overall survival, biomarker prediction, and toxicity.

objective response rate, Evaluation of tumor response according to RECIST 1.1 version Evaluation will be done at baseline and every 8 weeks. Evaluation will be performed with CT or MRI., baseline and every 8 weeks
The toxicity profiles of the combination treatments, Treatment toxicity will be graded by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.0 (CTC, v4.0) for safety evaluation, Baseline and every 2 weeks,
It is considered realistic, that within 18 months 120 patients can be included in the participating centers. Based on the previous publications an objective response rate (ORR) of 20% is expected in the GEMOX arm (Arm B). When the sample size of evaluable patients is between 110 and 120 evaluable patients (ie. 55 to 60 patients per treatment arm), then a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between an arm B response rate PB, of 20% and an arm A response rate PA of 30%, 35% or 40% based on the large sample normal approximation will have a width between 15.4% and 16.7%. We assume an objective response rate of 30% for Arm A, then a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between an arm B response rate PB, of 20% and an arm A response rate PA of 30% will have a width Â±15.4% when the sample size of evaluable patients is 120 (i.e., 60 patients per treatment arm).
