Efficacy Evaluation of TheraSphere in Patients With Inoperable Liver Cancer
The safety and effectiveness of TheraSphere will be evaluated in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in whom treatment with standard-of-care sorafenib is planned. All patients receive the standard-of-care sorafenib with or without the addition of TheraSphere.
Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: TheraSphere
Overall Survival (OS) Results Are Based on the Modified Intent-to-treat (mITT), Time from randomization until date of death due to any cause as reported by study site., From time of randomization up to date of death or last date known to be alive (data cut-off 30Apr2022), an average of 16.3 months|Overall Survival (OS) Per Protocol (PP) Population, Per Protocol = subset of the mITT population excluding patients with major protocol deviations which may affect the efficacy evaluation., From time of randomization up to date of death or last date known to be alive (data cut-off 30Apr2022), an average of 16.3 months
Time to Progression (TTP) From Time of Randomization Based on Investigator, According RECIST Criteria., Time to progression (TTP) will be calculated as the interval between the randomization date and the date of first disease progression, including the appearance of new lesion(s) (per RECIST 1.1) and death for any cause or of last contact for patients alive., From time of randomization up to date of death or last date known to be alive (data cut-off 30Apr2022), an average of 16.3 months|Time to Untreatable Progression (TTUP) From the Time of Randomization Based One or More of the Following: Investigator Assessment According to RECIST Criteria, Time to progression (TTP) will be calculated as the interval between the randomization date and the date of first disease progression, including the appearance of new lesion(s) and death for any cause or of last contact for patients alive., From time of randomization up to date of death or last date known to be alive (data cut-off 30Apr2022), an average of 16.3 months|Tumor Response, Objective Response Rate by investigator determination per RECIST 1.1, From time of randomization up to date of death or last date known to be alive (data cut-off 30Apr2022), an average of 16.3 months
