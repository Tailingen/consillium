Correlation Between the Efficacy of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Combined With Immunotherapy of Operable Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma and the Metabolites of Intestinal Flora
This study collects stool, blood, and tumor tissue samples from patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer after receiving Sintilimab and chemotherapy to explore the efficacy and intestinal microbes of chemotherapy combined with neoadjuvant immunotherapy for locally advanced operable thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma The main purpose is the relationship between its metabolites, and it will also explore the changes of intestinal flora diversity and metabolites before and after esophageal squamous cell carcinoma chemotherapy combined with immune neoadjuvant therapy
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Intestinal Flora
DRUG: SintilimabCombined With Chemotherapy
Species and abundance of gut microbiota, Alpha-diversity of samples, that measures both the richness and diversity of species within a group, was calculated on taxa that were observed at least once.

Beta-diversity, that measures the differences in microbiome composition between groups., 2 year
Explore the changes of intestinal flora and metabolomics before and after medication, Discovery of gut microbes and metabolic markers that can predict the efficacy of chemotherapy combined with neoadjuvant immunotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 2 year
