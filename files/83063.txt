Leflunomide Treatment for MEN1 Patients - the LUMEN1 Trial
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene MEN1 with the corresponding gen product menin. MEN1 is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid, pancreatic islet and anterior pituitary tumors which can release excessive amounts of hormones (= functional active tumors). Other tumors (e.g. carcinoid tumors, adrenocortical tumors, meningiomas, facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, lipomas) have also been described. There is no geno-phenotype correlation but the disease occurs after a second hit of the corresponding gene within the endocrine organ leading to an uncontrolled growth.

MEN1-patients have a decreased life expectancy, mainly due to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) which are often multiple and more aggressive than in non-MEN1 patients. To date, no prophylactic treatment exists to prevent tumor development in this hereditary disease.

Leflunomide has been used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis for many years. It is a potent inhibitor of the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). According to some preclinical studies, leflunomide showed antineoplastic activities in several malignancies, including prostate, breast, bladder, multiple myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma. A recent study identified an interaction between MEN1 mutation and DHODH inhibition. In this study, leflunomide selectively killed MEN1 deficient cells in vitro, prevented the occurrence of pancreatic tumor development in xenograft models and led to tumor regression / stabilisation in three MEN1 patients with advanced aggressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

Accordingly, leflunomide could be used as a new treatment option for patients with known MEN1 germline mutation and associated endocrine disease. The aim of this study is, therefore, to evaluate the antitumor effect of leflunomide treatment on MEN1-associated tumors in patients with known MEN1-syndrome.
MEN1 Gene Mutation
DRUG: Leflunomide 20 mg
The primary outcome is the effect of a 6 months' treatment with leflunomide 20mg/day on MEN1-associated functional and non-functional tumors, 6 months
