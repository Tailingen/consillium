BOne Metastases REgistry for Patients Undergoing cryoAbLation With curatIve purpoSe
BOREALIS is a multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study designed to investigate the effectiveness, feasibility, safety and impact on pain and quality of life of curative-intent cryoablation for the treatment of bone metastases in patients with oligometastatic or bone oligo-progressive disease.
Bone Metastases
DEVICE: Cryoablation system
Local progression-free survival rate, On a per lesion basis, proportion of target lesions free from local tumour progression using the Kaplan Meier estimate, 12 months
