This study aims to improve quality of cancer care for LEP patients through improving medical interpreters' ability to cope with difficult encounters. We propose to (1) identify the needs of medical interpreters working with cancer patients, and (2) develop and test a psychoeducational resiliency program at 3 DF/HCC cancer centers: MGH, DFCI, and BWH) intended to enhance interpreters' skills to effectively manage stressful encounters and to cope with the personal effects of encounters.
