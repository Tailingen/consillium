Transarterial Chemoembolization for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma With Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis
Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) had been proved to improve the survivals for middle stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but for advanced stage HCC its' efficacy had not been proved. The investigators hypothesize that TACE also improve the survivals for advanced stage HCC. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective control study to find out if the survivals for patients after TACE better than only best support or not.
