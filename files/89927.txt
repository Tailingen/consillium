A Trail of Second-line Chemotherapy Sequential NKG2D CAR-NK Cell Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer
This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation clinical study to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of second-line systemic chemotherapy sequential NKG2D CAR-NK cell therapy for pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic Cancer Non-resectable
BIOLOGICAL: chemotherapy sequential CAR-NK cell infusion
Maximum tolerated dose, Determine the optimal agent for NKG2D CAR-NK at maximum tolerated dose, within 28 days after NKG2D CAR-NK treatment|Dose limiting toxicity, Describe the adverse events of limiting further increases in the dose of NKG2D CAR-NK, From enrollment of the first subject to completion of follow-up of the last subject up to 2 years
Effectiveness evaluation, Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Version 1.1, At weeks 4、8 and months 3、6、9、12、16、20 and 24 after treatment
