A Study Evaluating DS-1055a in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of DS-1055a in participants with relapsed or refractory locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for which no standard treatment is available.
Solid Tumor|Advanced Cancer|Metastatic Solid Tumor
DRUG: DS-1055a
Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities, A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) that occurs during the DLT evaluation period (21 days), excluding toxicities clearly related to disease progression or intercurrent illness or to concomitant medications or to concomitant procedures and is Grade 3 or above according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0, with certain specified exceptions., 21 days of Cycle 1|Number of participants with adverse events, Adverse events were assessed using National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0., Baseline up to approximately 3 years
Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Priming Dose Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 4 Day 1, and every 2 cycles from Cycle 4 to end of treatment, within approximately 2 years (each cycle is 21 days)|Time to Reach Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax), Priming Dose Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 4 Day 1, and every 2 cycles from Cycle 4 to end of treatment, within approximately 2 years (each cycle is 21 days)|Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve Up to Last Quantifiable Time (AUClast) and During Dosing Interval (AUCtau), Priming Dose Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 4 Day 1, and every 2 cycles from Cycle 4 to end of treatment, within approximately 2 years (each cycle is 21 days)|Minimum Observed Concentration (Ctrough), Priming Dose Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 4 Day 1, and every 2 cycles from Cycle 4 to end of treatment, within approximately 2 years (each cycle is 21 days)|The Incidence of Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA) and Other Antibodies, From pre-treatment to follow-up visit (within approximately 2 years)
This Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation, first-in-human study will assess the safety and tolerability of DS-1055a, determine the maximum tolerated dose of DS-1055a, pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of DS-1055a, and the incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against DS-1055a and other antibodies.
