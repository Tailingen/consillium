Safety and Efficacy of Therapies for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
This is a master protocol designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of investigational therapies in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Acapatamab|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: AMG 404
Dose exploration only: Number of participants who experience dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), The analysis of all endpoints, unless noted otherwise, will be conducted on the Safety Analysis Set defined as all subjects that are enrolled and receive at least 1 dose of Acapatamab. The analysis of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be conducted on the DLT Analysis Set defined as all subjects that are enrolled and receive at least 1 dose of Acapatamab with an evaluable DLT endpoint. If a single subject experiences more than 1 DLT it will be counted as 1.

The DLT endpoint is evaluable if either:

1) the subject experiences a DLT; or 2) the subject does not experience a DLT after receiving all planned doses within the 28-day DLT window in cycle 1., Up to 3 years|Number of participants who experience one or more treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Up to 3 years|Number of participants who experience one or more treatment-related adverse events, Up to 3 years|Number of participants who experience a clinically significant change in vital signs, Up to 3 years|Number of participants who experience a clinically significant change in clinical laboratory tests, Up to 3 years
Objective response rate per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 with prostate cancer working group 3 (PCWG3) modifications, Up to 3 years|Number of participants who experience circulating tumor cell (CTC) response, Up to 3 years|Number of participants who experience prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, Up to 3 years|Duration of response, Up to 3 years|Overall survival (OS), Up to 3 years|Progression-free survival, Up to 3 years|Time to progression, Up to 3 years|Time to subsequent therapy, Up to 3 years|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Up to 3 years|Minimum plasma concentration (Cmin), Up to 3 years|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Up to 3 years|Accumulation ratio based on area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), Up to 3 years|Half-life (t1/2), Up to 3 years|Change from baseline in prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive tumor burden assessed using gallium (GA) 68-labelled PSMA-11 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), Baseline up to 3 years|Change from baseline in prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-negative disease burden assessed using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), Baseline to 3 years|Time to symptomatic skeletal events, Up to 3 years|Concentration of alkaline phosphatase, Up to 3 years|Concentration of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Up to 3 years|Concentration of hemoglobin, Up to 3 years|Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, Up to 3 years|Concentration of N-telopeptide in the urine, Up to 3 years
This is a master protocol designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and efficacy of Acapatamab, in combination with enzalutamide, abiraterone, or the PD1 inhibitor AMG 404, AMG 404 monotherapy, as well as Acapatamab monotherapy, in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
