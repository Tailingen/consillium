Pazopanib In Patients With Relapsed Or Refractory Soft Tissue Sarcoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity and tolerability of pazopanib in subjects with advanced and/or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma who have relapsed following standard therapies or for whom no standard therapy exists and to characterize the pharmacokinetics of pazopanib in this subject population.
Sarcoma, Soft Tissue
DRUG: pazopanib
Progression Free Survival at Week 12, Progression free survival at week 12 is the number of participants who had a complete response (CR, all detectable tumor had disappeared) or a partial response (PR, a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum) or stable disease (SD, no change) 12 weeks from start of therapy, per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.0). Clinical progression is progression of disease without documented radiological evidence. Progressive disease (PD), a \>=20% increase in target lesions., Week 12
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from start of therapy until death. Participants who were still alive at the time of analysis were censored., Start of therapy until death (up to approximately 5 years)|Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival is defined as the interval between the start of treatment and the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause. Assessments of progression were made by the investigator., Start of therapy until progression (up to approximately 5 years)|Overall Response, Overall response is the number of participants who had a best outcome of a complete response (CR, all detectable tumor had disappeared) or a partial response (PR, a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum) per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST v1.0) at some point during the study. Progressive disease (PD), a \>=20% increase in target lesions. Clinical progression is progression of disease without documented radiological evidence., Baseline until either response or progression (up to approximately 5 years)
