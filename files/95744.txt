IVAC-RCC-001: A Personalized Neoantigen Vaccine as Add-on to Standard of Care Checkpoint Inhibitor in Advanced/Metastatic RCC Patients
This is a monocenter, single-arm, prospective phase Ib trial, designed to evaluate the safety, clinical toxicity and in vivo immunological effects of a patient-individualized peptide vaccination added to standard of care checkpoint blockade (nivolumab) in adult patients with metastatic/advanced renal cell carcinoma who experienced at least stable disease after four cycles of standard of care immune therapy (ipilimumab/nivolumab).
Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: IVAC
Primary endpoint is "success of treatment" defined as a patient without unacceptable toxicity and showing a vaccination-induced T-cell response., Treatment success is defined as a patient without

1. unacceptable toxicities (grade 4 according to NCI-CTC) and in whom
2. a vaccine-specific response of CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cells could be induced. The primary endpoint will be analyzed after 10 patients have reached visit 10, 120 days
To evaluate CD4+ and/or CD8+ T-cell responses over the vaccination period., T-cell responses will be measured after completion of the study and will be analyzed with regard to the T-cell responses after 10 vaccinatuions /at day 120., 246 days|To evaluate the event-free survival (EFS) during and after treatment., EFS will be assessed on days 120 and 246., 246 days
The aim of this clinical study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of an individualized peptide vaccination approach in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who experienced at least stable disease after four cycles of standard of care immune therapy (ipilimumab/nivolumab). For this purpose, tumor-specific mutations are analyzed by comparative exome sequencing of tumor and healthy reference tissue. In a second step, HLA-binding (human leukocyte antigen-binding) peptides derived from mutated protein sequences are selected for vaccination. The peptides are administered as a vaccination cocktail with adjuvant GM-CSF and Imiquimod over a course of 9 months and a total of 16 vaccinations. Primary objective is the de novo induction of a specific T cell response without unacceptable toxicity.
