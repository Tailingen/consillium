A Study of the Safety and Tolerance of Three Doses of G17DT in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study was designed to investigate the safety and tolerance of three doses (100µg, 200µg, 500µg) of G17DT for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer.
Colorectal Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: G17DT
Injection Site Reaction, An examination was performed to assess injection site tolerability at every posttreatment visit., Through Week 12|Antibody Levels, Gastrin-17 antibodies are produced as a result of treatment with G17DT and the proportion of patients producing gastrin-17 antibodies was considered to be an appropriate measure of the immunogenicity of the dosing schedule under study., Through Week 12
Intra-gastric pH, Compare the pre-immunization 24-hour intra-gastric pH with post-immunization profiles., Through Week 8
This study was designed to investigate the safety and tolerance of three doses (100µg, 200µg, 500µg) of G17DT for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer.
