Mechanisms of Hypertension in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Women with androgen excess polycystic ovary syndrome (AE-PCOS) leads to hypertension.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|Hypertension
DRUG: GnRH antagonist|DRUG: GnRH antagonist + MethylTESTOSTERone 5 MG
Baroreflex Response to LBNP, forearm blood flow (ultrasound)/mean arterial pressure as a linear function of lower body negative pressure. This is an important measure of autonomic control of blood pressure. Indicating the the sensitivity of changes in vessel diameter in response to blood pooling (induced by lower body negative pressure)., Baseline, assessed at 7 days of GnRH, assessed at 16 days GnRH+ 5 days of Testosterone|Free Plasma Testosterone Levels, Concentration of testosterone in blood., Baseline, assessed at 7 days of GnRH, assessed at 16 days GnRH+ 5 days of Testosterone|Renal Response to LBNP, POST Lower body negative pressure Plasma renin activity, Baseline, assessed at 7 days of GnRH, assessed at 16 days GnRH+ 5 days of Testosterone|Renal Responses to LBNP, PRE lower body negative pressure Plasma renin activity, Baseline, assessed at 7 days of GnRH, assessed at 16 days GnRH+ 5 days of Testosterone|Resting Systolic Blood Pressure, Blood pressure prior to lower body negative pressure, Baseline, assessed at 7 days of GnRH, assessed at 16 days GnRH+ 5 days of Testosterone|Final Systolic Blood Pressure, SBP at the end of lower body negative pressure, Baseline, assessed at 7 days of GnRH, assessed at 16 days GnRH+ 5 days of Testosterone|Resting Sympathetic Activity, Total sympathetic nerve activity, Baseline, assessed at 7 days of GnRH, assessed at 16 days GnRH+ 5 days of Testosterone|Sympathetic Baroreflex, microneurography, diastolic blood pressure (finipres) This is an important measure of autonomic control of blood pressure. Indicating the the sensitivity of changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity in response to small changes in blood pressure induced by drug perfusion (modified Oxford)., Baseline, assessed at 7 days of GnRH, assessed at 16 days GnRH+ 5 days of Testosterone
Aldosterone, Plasma aldosterone concentration, Baseline, assessed at 7 days of GnRH, assessed at 16 days GnRH+ 5 days of Testosterone|Renal Responses, P\[ACE\], angiotensin-converting enzyme, Baseline, assessed at 7 days of GnRH, assessed at 16 days GnRH+ 5 days of Testosterone
Our scientific premise is that in AE-PCOS women, the androgen-dominant hormonal milieu causes BP increases via sympathetic activation, vasoconstriction and renal sympathetic nervous system activation. Moreover, this androgen-dominant milieu increases BP via activation of the renin-angiotensin system.
