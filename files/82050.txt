Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate was defined as the proportion of patients with a best objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1)., From Baseline to disease progress, up to 18 months
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by incidence, severity and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) and categorized by severity in accordance with the NCI CTC AE Version 5.0., From Baseline to primary completion date, about 2 years|Progression free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from enrollment to the first documented disease progression according to RECIST version 1.1, or to death from any cause, whichever occurred first, From Baseline to primary completion date, about 2 years|Overal survival, Time from randomization to death (from any cause), From Baseline to primary completion date, about 5 years
This is a single-center, single-arm, phase 2 trial. Enroll 30 patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastases and failure of standard therapy. Administer serplulimab intravenously(once every two weeks)in combination with regorafenib(from the first day to the 21th day) and hepatic artery bicarbonate infusion (once every four weeks). Medication must be discontinued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, informed consent is withdrawn, or investigator judgment is made. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse effects (AE).
