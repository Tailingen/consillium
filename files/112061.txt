CT Radiomic Features of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms
The aim of this study is to quantify inter-observer variability in delineating pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm (PanNEN) on Computerized Tomography (CT) images and its impact on radiomic features (RF), subsequently to this determination, to use CT texture analysis to predict, histological characteristics of PanNEN on CT scans.

OTHER: CT radiomic feature evaluation
Interobserver variability in delineating panNENs on CT, Asses inter-observer variability on CT- scans (with contrast alone), 6 months
Use CT texture analysis to predict, histological characteristics of PanNEN on CT scans, Evaluate histological characteristics on CT-scans with and without contrast agent in a group of subjects, 6 months
CT imaging is the most widely used modality for studying radiomic features due to its ability to assess tissue density, shape, texture and size before, during and after therapy. To the best of the investigator's knowledge, the impact of inter-observer delineation variability on the reliability of CT RF for PanNEN patients, including Hounsfield unit (HU) values-, shape-, and texture-based features, has not yet been assessed. One this has been determined, an additional evaluation will be conducted to correlate the morphologically observed images with their histopathological characteristics.

The ultimate potential objective of this research is to identify and predict characteristics of aggressiveness of PanNEN in CT scans.
