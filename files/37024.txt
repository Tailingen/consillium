Radical Cystectomy, Nutrition and Convalescence
The purpose of this study is to determine whether a goal directed nutritional intervention can reduce the convalescence period for patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC).

The aim is to examine the effect on quality of life of a standard nutritional strategy of resting the bowel till clear signs of bowel recovery and feeding orally after bowel recovery versus a goal-directed nutritional intervention combining oral intake and parenteral nutrition, in patients undergoing RC.

The study is a randomized controlled trial. Inclusion criteria: Bladder cancer, ability to give an informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Previous radiation therapy at the pelvic area, ureterocutaneostomy or robot-assisted surgery. The intervention aims to secure that 75% of the patient's total energy and protein needs are met during hospitalization.

Primary outcome: Quality of Life, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BLM30 questionnaire. Secondary outcomes: Body-weight, Hand Grip strength, biochemical measures, length of hospital stay, time to bowel recovery. The follow-up period is 12 weeks. Statistical analysis is performed in collaboration with a statistician.
