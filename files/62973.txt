Low-Dose CT - Stage I Testicular Cancer
Patients with primary germ cell cancer of the testicles confined to the testis can avoid adjuvant treatment by entering a surveillance protocol. In the surveillance protocol, patients are followed for up to ten years with serial computed tomography scans to detect recurrence. Multiple CT scans expose patients to a significant amount of radiation, which may be associated with an increased risk of secondary malignancies. This study hypothesizes that low dose CT scans are as effective as standard dose CT scans in detecting disease recurrence in this setting and will significantly reduce radiation exposure in this group of patients.
