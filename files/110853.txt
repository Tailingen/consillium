A Study of BND-35 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is an open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose optimization study designed to evaluate safety, tolerability and preliminary anti-tumor activity of BND-35 administered alone and in combination with nivolumab or with cetuximab. The study will enroll advanced cancer patients with unresectable or metastatic disease who are refractory to or are not candidates for standard approved therapy. The study will be comprised of two parts - a dose escalation phase (Part 1) and a dose optimization (Part 2). Part 1 is comprised of three sub-parts: BND-35 administered alone (Sub-Part 1A), BND-35 administered in combination with nivolumab (Sub-Part 1B), and BND-35 administered in combination with cetuximab (Sub-Part 1C). Part 2 is composed of two sub-parts: a dose optimization part where up to two doses of BND-35 per indication are administered in combination with nivolumab or with cetuximab.

DRUG: BND-35|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Cetuximab
Part 1: Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), Adverse event (AE): any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of study drug, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-emergent events were events between first dose of study drug that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state up to 30 days after last administration. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs., Through study completion, up to approximately 34 months|Part 1: Proportion of patients who discontinued study treatment due to TEAEs, Number of patients who discontinued study treatment due to TEAEs, Through study completion, up to approximately 34 months|Part 1: Incidence of TEAEs dose limiting toxicities (DLT), Incidence of TEAEs meeting protocol defined DLT criteria, Up to 21 days in Cycle 1|Part 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, Proportion of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1, Through study completion, up to approximately 24 months|Part 2: Incidence of TEAEs and SAEs, Adverse event (AE): any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with use of study drug, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-emergent events were events between first dose of study drug that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state up to 30 days after last administration. TEAEs included both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs., Through study completion, an average of 24 months
