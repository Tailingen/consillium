Concurrent Nab-paclitaxel with Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy in Patients with Stage III-IVa Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose for nab-paclitaxel when administered concurrently with radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Researchers will observe the toxicity response of patients receiving nab-paclitaxel at 180 mg/m², 200 mg/m², 230 mg/m², and 260 mg/m².
