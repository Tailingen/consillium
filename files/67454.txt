A Study to Compare Adjuvant Concurrent Chemoradiation (CCRT) to Adjuvant Radiation Therapy (RT) in Grade 2 and 3 Extremity Soft Tissue Sarcomas
The aim of the study is to retrospectively evaluate the outcome of adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation delivered to patients with high grade non-metastatic soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities at the investigators institution paired with patients treated by adjuvant radiation therapy
