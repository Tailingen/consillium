A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Vismodegib (GDC-0449) in Operable Basal Cell Carcinoma
This was a 3-cohort, open-label study of vismodegib (GDC-0449) in new (non-recurrent) operable basal cell carcinoma of the nodular subtype.
Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Vismodegib
Percentage of Participants With Complete Histologic Clearance, Complete histologic clearance was defined as the absence of histological evidence of basal cell carcinoma at the target tumor site. Histological examination was performed by an independent pathologist on specimens collected within 2 weeks of the end of treatment period, ie, at 12 weeks after Baseline in Cohort 1, at 36 weeks after Baseline in Cohort 2, and at 20 weeks after Baseline in Cohort 3., Baseline to Week 12 (Cohort 1), Baseline to Week 36 (Cohort 2), Baseline to Week 20 (Cohort 3)
Time to Complete Clinical Clearance, Time to complete clinical clearance was defined as the time from the first treatment with vismodegib until complete clinical clearance as determined by the investigator., Baseline to the end of the study (up to 12 weeks for Cohort 1; up to 36 weeks for Cohort 2, up to 20 weeks for Cohort 3)
For Cohort 1, the response to treatment was determined at the end of the 12 weeks of treatment. For Cohort 2, the response to treatment was determined after 12 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of observation. For Cohort 3, the response to treatment was determined after intermittent dosing over a 20-week period, consisting of an initial 8-week treatment period, followed by a 4-week drug holiday period, followed by a second 8-week treatment period.
