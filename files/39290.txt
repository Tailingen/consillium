Efficacy and Safety of Activated T Lymphocytes (ATL) in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This is an open-label, single arm, multicenter, Phase II clinical study to investigate the efficacy and safety profiles of autologous ATL administration in HCC patients after curative treatment. Among all the eligible patients, ratio of 7:2:1 for Stage I:II:IIIa of the HCC will be the enrolled strategy of the study to reflect the results of the previous study (Lee, Lee et al. 2015).

Eligible patients with HCC received curative treatment will be given ATL administration in this study. The investigational product ATL revealed great efficacy in previous clinical trials. This study aims to treat eligible patients, who had undergone curative treatment for HCC, with ATL as a preventive immunotherapy and to evaluate the effectiveness on the basis of patients' RFS rate in 12 months. The administration of the subject will be in a staggered manner for the first 3 patients. The 2nd and 3rd subject will not be dosed until the prior subject has taken the 4th dose of investigational products for at least 4 weeks. During the pretreatment period, peripheral blood for manufacturing the individualized ATL agent will be collected from patients at least 28 days before starting treatment. Patients will receive 200 mL of the ATL agent intravenously within 40 to 60 minutes without any premedication. They will be scheduled to receive the ATL 10 times at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 22. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed while 10% of schedule subjects were enrolled and complete 4 times of ATL infusions, the DSMB will convene a meeting to review safety data to date, including AEs and toxicities to indicate whether the study would advance unaltered, amend the protocol, or halt recruitment until a resolution of a specific issue.
