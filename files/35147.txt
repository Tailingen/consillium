Ph 1-2 Study ADI-PEG 20 Plus FOLFOX in Subjects With Advanced GI Malignancies Focusing on Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Phase 1: Assessment of safety and tolerability of ADI-PEG 20 in combination with folinic acid (leucovorin), fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) in advanced GI malignancies.

Phase 2: Assessment of the objective response rate (ORR), measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR).
Advanced Gastrointestinal (GI) Malignancies|Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Gastric Cancer|Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: ADI-PEG 20 plus modified FOLFOX6
Objective response rate (ORR), The percent of subjects who exhibit each level of tumor response, measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria as assessed by blinded independent central review., Date of first study drug administration to the date of disease progression (measured every 8 weeks) or death (whichever occurs first), up to 24 months
Progression free survival (PFS), Time from the first dose until objective tumor progression or death from any cause, Date of first study drug administration to the date of disease progression (measured every 8 weeks) or death (whichever occurs first), 12 months anticipated|Overall survival (OS), The time from first treatment with ADI-PEG 20 until death or censoring, Date of first study drug administration through study completion|Duration of response (DoR), the time in weeks between the first occurrence of objective response and the development of progressive disease or death, From date of first response until the date of documented progression or date of death, 12 month in average|Disease control rate (DCR), the proportion of subjects at each post-baseline assessment who exhibit tumor response of complete response, partial response or stable disease, Date of first study drug administration to the date of disease progression (measured every 8 weeks) or death (whichever occurs first), up to 24 months.|Pharmacodynamics, Blood levels of arginine and citrulline, At week 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 prior to ADI-PEG 20 administration|Pharmacokinetics Variable, Peripheral blood levels of ADI-PEG 20, At week 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 prior to ADI-PEG 20 administration|Immunogenicity, antibodies to ADI-PEG 20, At week 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21 prior to ADI-PEG 20 administration|AFP (alpha feto-protein) changes, Maximal percent changes of AFP during the course of study compared to AFP at baseline, At baseline, week3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23 and end of treatment
Phase 1:The primary objective of the dose escalation portion of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of ADI-PEG 20 in combination with folinic acid (leucovorin), fluorouracil (5-FU), and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) in advanced GI malignancies. The primary objective of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) expansion phase (recommended phase 2 dose \[RP2D\]) of this study was to determine preliminary estimates of efficacy, measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria, for ADI-PEG 20 in combination with FOLFOX in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastro-esophageal cancer (GEC), and colorectal cancer (CRC).

Phase 2: The primary objective of this single arm trial is ORR. Based on a two-sided exact test of a one-sample proportion with an alpha of 0.05, under a presumed ORR of 22%, there is 80% power to yield 95% confidence interval of 15-26%, which will require 46 objective responses in 225 subjects. A futility analysis will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
