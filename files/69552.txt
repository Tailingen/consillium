Erlotinib Versus Gemcitabine/Carboplatin in Chemo-naive Stage IIIB/IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Exon 19 or 21 Mutation
Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) such as erlotinib have proved effective in second or third line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC).It is well tolerated without the side effects usually associated with chemotherapy. The mutations in EGFR exons 19 or 21 have been reported to be associated with efficacy of EGFR TKIs.Based on the encouraging preliminary results from the Spanish lung cancer group' prospective study reported that the efficacy of Tarceva as first line treatment for metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation would delay disease progression,prolong overall survival and be well tolerated, medium Progression-free survival(PFS) was around 12 months and OS reach 24 monthsï¼Œour study is designed to compare PFS between the patients with mutant EGFR treated by gemcitabine/carboplatin and those by erlotinib in the first-line setting. We assumed 11 months of PFS on Tarceva arm versus 6 months on chemotherapy arm with a=0.025(alpha-spend for an interim analysis), 80% power and 12 months enrolment period, 12 months FU duration to calculate the sample size. The sample size is 69 pairs. Considering about 10% drop-out rate, the final sample size is 152 patients.So, chemo-naive staged IIIb/IV patients with EGFR mutations in exon 19 or 21 will be enrolled into this open-label, randomized,multicenter phase III study.

DRUG: erlotinib|DRUG: gemcitabine/carboplatin
Progression free survival, 12 months
OS, 24 months|ORR, 24 months|Time to Progression, 24 months|lung cancer symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), 24 months|explore the biological markers (tumor tissue), 24 months
Primary Outcome Measures:

Progression-free survival(PFS) Secondary Outcome Measures: Overall response rate(ORR), overall survival(OS), quality of life(QOL),etc.

Estimated Enrollment: 160 Study Start Date: August 2008 Estimated Study Completion Date: August 2010

The patients will be randomized into the following two arms:

Arm A: erlotinib 150mg once per day up to disease progression or intolerable toxicity.

Arm B: Gemcitabine (1000mg/m2, IV,d1 and d8) plus Carboplatin (AUC=5, IV d1) repeated every 3 weeks up to 4 cycles.
