Vital sign criteria included: Systolic BP: \<90 millimeter of mercury \[mmHg\]; Systolic BP change from baseline: maximum increase and decrease \>=30 mmHg; Diastolic BP minimum \< 50 mmHg; Diastolic BP change from baseline: maximum decrease and increase \>=20 mmHg; heart rate \<40 and \>120 beats per minute. Clinically significant changes in vital signs were determined by the investigator's discretion., Baseline up to maximum 1436 days|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Vital Signs: Continuation Cohort, Vital signs included blood pressure (sitting or supine) and heart rate. Vital sign criteria included: Systolic BP: \<90 millimeter of mercury \[mmHg\]; Systolic BP change from baseline: maximum increase and decrease \>=30 mmHg; Diastolic BP minimum \< 50 mmHg; Diastolic BP change from baseline: maximum decrease and increase \>=20 mmHg; heart rate \<40 and \>120 beats per minute. Clinically significant changes in vital signs were determined by the investigator's discretion., Baseline up to maximum 1146 days|Number of Participants With TEAEs, Serious TEAEs, Treatment Related TEAEs, Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs Based on NCI CTCAE v4.0: Continuation Cohort, AE: any untoward medical occurrence in participant who received study drug or medical device without regard to possibility of causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Serious AE: any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening; required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs: events absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Treatment-related TEAE: any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Relatedness to drug was assessed by the Investigator. NCI-CTCAE Grade: Grade 3=severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated, disabling, limiting self-care ADL; Grade 4= life-threatening consequence, urgent intervention indicated., Day 1 up to 28 days after last dose of study drug (Maximum up to 1146 days)|Number of Participants With Laboratory Test Abnormalities: Expansion Cohort, Laboratory parameters included- hematology: lymphocytes/leukocytes (%), neutrophils/leukocytes (%), basophils/leukocytes (%), eosinophils/leukocytes (%), monocytes/leukocytes (%), prothrombin time (sec), blasts/leukocytes (%); clinical chemistry: lactate dehydrogenase (u/l), protein (g/l), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (mmol/l), urate (mmol/l), chloride (mmol/l), calcium (mmol/l); urinalysis: specific gravity (scalar), pH (scalar), urine glucose (scalar), ketones (scalar), nitrite, leukocyte esterase, urine erythrocytes (scalar), urine leukocytes (scalar). In this outcome measure participants for each laboratory parameter were evaluated as normal, abnormal low only, abnormal high only or abnormal low and an abnormal high. Laboratory values were as per laboratory normal ranges. Values above normal range = abnormal high and below range = abnormal low. Participants with both an abnormal low and an abnormal high value while on study were reported as 'Abnormal low and Abnormal high'., Baseline up to maximum 1436 months
This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 study of PF-04449913 in Japanese patients. PF-04449913 will be administered orally as a single agent in patients with select advanced hematologic malignancies, or in combination with LDAC \[Low-Dose Ara-C\] or cytarabine and daunorubicin in previously untreated patients with AML \[Acute Myeloid Leukemia\] or high-risk MDS \[Myelodysplastic Syndrome\], or in combination with azacitidine in previously untreated patients with AML.
