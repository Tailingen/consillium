Efficacy and Safety of Atezolizumab Plus Capecitabine Adjuvant Therapy for Triple Receptor-Negative Breast Cancer
This study will enroll patients who received neoadjuvant therapy for TNBC prior to surgery and did not get pCR. Given the relatively poor prognosis for these patients, this population is considered novel therapeutic as adjuvant treatment. Currently, capecitabine monotherapy could be beneficial to this group of patients according to CREATE-X trial results. The investigators are addressing the effect of anti-PD-L1, atezolizumab combined with capecitabine in patients with TNBC who did not get pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to capecitabine monotherapy.
