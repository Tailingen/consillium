Safety and Efficacy Assessment of Diagnostic Microprobe (inPROBE) in Women at High Risk of Breast Cancer (Part I Study)
The purpose of this study is to preliminarily determine the correlation of HER2 receptor levels detected with the inPROBE diagnostic probe relative to receptor status as determined by standard methods (IHC/FISH), in women with both HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.
