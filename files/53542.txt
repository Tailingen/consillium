Aims to Explore the Safety, Tolerability, and Preliminary Efficacy of SCTB14 in Adult Patients With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumours.
This study aims to explore the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics, immunogenicity, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy of SCTB14 as a monotherapy in adult patients with advanced malignant solid tumours. This study is an open label, multicentre, dose-escalation and dose-expansion Phase I/II clinical trial.
