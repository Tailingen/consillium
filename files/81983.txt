Phase 1 Study of PI3 (Phosphatidylinositol-3)-Kinase Inhibitor Copanlisib With Gemcitabine or Cisplatin Plus Gemcitabine in Patients With Advanced Cancer
This open label Phase I study involves treating subjects with advanced cancer with Copanlisib in combination with either gemcitabine or cisplatin plus gemcitabine. It will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Copanlisib in combination with gemcitabine and Copanlisib in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine. The trial will involve multiple participating sites from the US. Up to a maximum of 70 subjects will be enrolled in the study.
