GARDASIL™ Study in Healthy Females Between 9 and 26 Years of Age in Sub-Saharan Africa (V501-046)
The study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a 3-dose regimen of GARDASIL™ administered to healthy females between 9 and 26 years of age, in Sub-Saharan Africa. Data from the current study are needed in order to complement existing extensive safety data from the GARDASIL™ clinical trials program, and confirm that GARDASIL™ may be administered safely and will induce immune responses in populations from and living in Sub-Saharan Africa, as GARDASIL™ has not previously been studied in this region of the world.
Papillomavirus Infections
BIOLOGICAL: Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) Recombinant Vaccine (GARDASIL™)|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo
Number of Participants Who Seroconvert to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Type 6, Seroconversion was defined as achieving an anti-HPV Type 6 competitive Luminex Immunoassay (cLIA) level of \>=20 milli Merck U/mL. The dilution-corrected limit of detection for the Type 6 cLIA was 4.2 milli Merck U/mL., Month 7 (1 month postdose 3 in study Phase A)|Number of Participants Who Seroconvert to HPV Type 11, Seroconversion was defined as achieving an anti-HPV Type 11 cLIA level of \>=16 milli Merck U/mL. The dilution-corrected limit of detection for the Type 11 cLIA was 3.9 milli Merck U/mL., Month 7 (1 month postdose 3 in study Phase A)|Number of Participants Who Seroconvert to HPV Type 16, Seroconversion was defined as achieving an anti-HPV Type 16 cLIA level of \>=20 milli Merck U/mL. The dilution-corrected limit of detection for the Type 16 cLIA was 9.7 milli Merck U/mL., Month 7 (1 month postdose 3 in study Phase A)|Number of Participants Who Seroconvert to HPV Type 18, Seroconversion was defined as achieving an anti-HPV Type 18 cLIA level of \>=24 milli Merck U/mL. The dilution-corrected limit of detection for the Type 18 cLIA was 5.8 milli Merck U/mL., Month 7 (1 month postdose 3 in study Phase A)|Number of Participants With Injection-site Adverse Experiences, Participants were prompted to report injection-site experiences of pain, erythema, or swelling and were also asked to report any other injection-site adverse experiences, Up to Day 5 after any vaccination in study Phase A|Number of Participants With Elevated Temperature (Oral Temperature >=100 °F), Up to Day 5 after any vaccination in study Phase A|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Experiences, A serious adverse experience is any adverse experience that results in death, is life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is a cancer, is an overdose, or is another important medical event that may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention, From the time of informed consent is signed through the last study visit (up to 19 months)
Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) of Anti-HPV Type 6 Antibody, Anti-HPV Type 6 antibodies were measured by cLIA. The seropositive cut-off threshold for this assay is defined as 20 milli Merck U/mL., Month 7 (1 month postdose 3 in study Phase A)|GMT of Anti-HPV Type 11 Antibody, Anti-HPV Type 11 antibodies were measured by cLIA. The seropositive cut-off threshold for this assay is defined as 16 milli Merck U/mL., Month 7 (1 month postdose 3 in study Phase A)|GMT of Anti-HPV Type 16 Antibody, Anti-HPV Type 16 antibodies were measured by cLIA. The seropositive cut-off threshold for this assay is defined as 20 milli Merck U/mL., Month 7 (1 month postdose 3 in study Phase A)|GMT of Anti-HPV Type 18 Antibody, Anti-HPV Type 18 antibodies were measured by cLIA. The seropositive cut-off threshold for this assay is defined as 24 milli Merck U/mL., Month 7 (1 month postdose 3 in study Phase A)
In Phase A of the study, healthy females between 9 and 12 years of age will be randomized (4:1) to receive the 3-dose regimen of GARDASIL™ or placebo, and those between 13 and 26 years old will receive GARDASIL™. In Phase B of the study, participants who received placebo in Phase A will have the option to receive the 3-dose regimen of GARDASIL™.
