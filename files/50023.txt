Study on the Value of Non-invasive Dual-Pet Information in Subtype of Metastatic Breast Cancer
Study on the Value of Non-invasive Dual-Pet(18F-FES PET and 68Ga-HER2-Affibody PET) Information in Subtype of Metastatic Breast Cancer
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: biopsy or surgical pathology in metastases|DRUG: 68Ga-HER2 affibody,18F-FDG, 18F-FES
Verify the subtype value of dual-PET in extrahepatic metastases, Verify whether the subtype value of FES-PET and HER2-PET is consistent with biopsy or surgical pathology in extrahepatic metastases., 2 year
Verify the HER2-PET value in liver metastasis, Verify whether the HER2-PET value is consistent with biopsy or surgical pathology in liver metastasis., 2 year|Verify the HER2-PET value in brain metastasis, Verify whether the HER2-PET value is consistent with biopsy or surgical pathology in brian metastasis., 2 year|Heterogeneity in metastatic lesions, Observe the heterogeneity of ER and HER2 expression in metastatic lesions., 2 year
A Phase II, Single-center STudy on the vAlue of Non-invasive Dual-Pet（18F-FES PET and 68Ga-HER2-Affibody PET）InformatiOn IN Subtype of Metastatic Breast Cancer(MBC)
