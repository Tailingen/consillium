Reduced Dose-density of Denosumab for Unresectable GCTB
This study is a multi-center, multi-national, open label, single arm phase 2 study of single-agent denosumab.

The objective of the trial is to evaluate the risk versus benefit of denosumab in maintenance setting in patients requiring long-term use (\> 1 year) of denosumab. For that purpose, the treatment schedule with reduced dose density (120mg SC 12-weekly instead of 4-weekly) will be investigated, starting after 1-year (12-15 months) of denosumab full dose, as per current label. The impact on OsteoNecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ) without compromising disease control will be assessed.
