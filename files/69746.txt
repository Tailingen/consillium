Procurement of Follicular B Cell Lymphoma Cells for the Purpose of Possible Use in Future Clinical Trials
In order to learn more about follicular lymphoma and anti-cancer vaccines, we are collecting samples from people with this diagnosis. We then hope to make a vaccine from this tissue to help the immune system destroy cancer cells. We plan on keeping samples in the tissue bank indefinitely.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
PROCEDURE: Procurement of Follicular B Cell Lymphoma Cells
Tissue collection for vaccine generation, Collect eligible patient samples that potentially could be used to prepare autologous cell vaccines and possibly prepare autologous tumor cell injection for vaccine induced delayed-type hypersensitiviy evaluation for the companion treatment protocol. There will be no analysis performed on this protocol, the analysis will occur on a companion vaccination protocol. Patients will be consented to this protocol separately., 2 years
- The following tests and procedures will be performed: Approximately 50cc of peripheral blood will be drawn and stored in the tissue bank; patients who have follicular lymphoma cells circulating in the blood will have about 40cc's of blood drawn and stored for processing; patients undergoing a lymph node biopsy will have samples of the biopsy stored; patients having fluid drained from the abdomen or from around the lung will have some of their fluid saved to cell collection and processing; patients undergoing a bone marrow biopsy will have some of the sample stored for cell collection and processing.
