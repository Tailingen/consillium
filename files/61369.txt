Bone Mineral Density and Cancer Recurrence in Patients With Early Stage Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Measuring bone mineral density may help doctors predict whether prostate cancer will come back. It may also help the study of prostate cancer in the future.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying whether bone mineral density affects cancer recurrence in patients with early stage prostate cancer.
Osteoporosis|Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: dual x-ray absorptiometry
Bone mineral density, DXA scan will be done after patient signs consent and eligibilty is confirmed, Baseline|Prostate Specific Antigen, PSA will be measured to look for biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, Baseline, every 6 months for 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with clinically significant early stage prostate cancer.
* Determine whether patients who have a higher level of BMD and have had a radical prostatectomy for cure are less likely to have an early relapse (i.e., less than 3 years) than those patients with a low level of BMD.

OUTLINE: This is a case-controlled study followed by a prospective, longitudinal, cohort study.

Patients undergo bone mineral density (BMD) measurements by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry with a densitometer. Posteroanterior measurements of the total hip are also recorded.

Patients also undergo blood collection to examine markers that provide evidence of systemic disease.

Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
