AMG 706 and Octreotide in Treating Patients With Low-Grade Neuroendocrine Tumors
RATIONALE: AMG 706 and octreotide may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well AMG 706 and octreotide work in treating patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors.

DRUG: AMG 706|DRUG: octreotide
Four-month Progression-free Survival Rate, Four-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate is defined as number of patients who are still progression free at 4 months after study entry divided by number of eligible and treated patients enrolled to the study. Progression is evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0, and defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the baseline measurements, or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s), or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., assessed every 4 weeks while on treatment and at three months post-treatment for participants treated for one cycle, up to month four
Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from registration until death (event), or censored at last date known alive. OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method , with 95% confidence intervals calculated using Greenwood's formula, assessed every 3 months if patient is < 2 years from study entry, then every 6 months up to 5 years|Objective Response Rate, Tumor response was evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0. Objective response rate is defined as number of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the total number of analyzable patients. CR is defined as complete disappearance of all tumor lesions, and partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter., assessed every 8 weeks while on treatment, and frequency of tumor measurements during follow-up were determined by the treating physician, assessed up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors treated with AMG 706 and octreotide acetate.

Secondary

* Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients treated with these drugs.
* Determine the toxicity and tolerability of AMG 706 in these patients.
* Determine the effect of AMG 706 on tumor perfusion by functional computerized tomography (CT) scan.
* Determine the effect of AMG 706 on tumor markers (e.g., chromogranin A, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and gastrin) specific for neuroendocrine tumors.
* Determine the effect of AMG 706 on serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels.
* Determine the expression of VEGF, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), chromogranin A, human achaete-scute homolog-1 (hASH1), and Notch1 markers of neuroendocrine tumors.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive oral AMG 706 and octreotide acetate intramuscularly once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Plasma samples are collected at baseline, periodically during study treatment, and at 4 weeks after the completion of study treatment. Samples are used to determine plasma VEGF levels. Gene expression of downstream markers of Raf kinase expression (raf, MEK, and ERK) as well as hASH1 and Notch1 are evaluated at baseline. Tumor tissue collected at diagnosis or prior surgery is examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Contrast CT scans are conducted at baseline, day 2 of course 1, and week 8 to assess tumor perfusion.

After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
