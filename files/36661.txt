New Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy Software in the Improvement of Image Quality
This trial studies how well new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) software works in improving the image quality of scans in both patients and healthy volunteers. Improving the image quality of MRI and MRSI through new software may lead to implementation of these techniques and better clinical care for patients.

PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging
Development and/or optimization of new magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy applications and analysis software, A set of images will be collected using the new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or MR spectroscopy techniques. Whenever appropriate, another set of images using the standard of care software will also be collected and this set of images by the standard of care software will be compared to the images that are collected with the new MRI or MR spectroscopy techniques., Up to 7 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To help develop and/or optimize new magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy applications and analysis software in order to provide the best MR services for our patients.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo an additional investigational MRI or MRSI sequence along with the standard MRI or MRSI. Healthy volunteers undergo an investigational MRI or MRSI sequence. Healthy volunteers may also undergo an additional standard sequence if there is one that can be compared to the investigational sequence. All MRI or MRSI procedures, including the standard MRI or MRSI, are no longer than 60 minutes.
