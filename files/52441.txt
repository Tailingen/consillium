The Changes of Body Fat Distribution in Obese Patients With PCOS After LSG
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder, with a prevalence of 5% to 15% in premenopausal women. Patients with PCOS presents as abnormal menstruation, ovulation disorders and/or hyperandrogenemia, and often accompanied by insulin resistance and other metabolic abnormalities. Abdominal fat accumulation, overweightness and obesity are frequently present in patients with PCOS . Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PCOS.Therefore，this study aim to investigate the changes of body fat distribution in obese women with PCOS after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), and to explore the factors that may predict the changes in body fat distribution in PCOS patients after LSG.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
PROCEDURE: laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG)
VAT mass, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass, 12 months
BMI, Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as follows: BMI = (body weight \[kg\])/(height \[m2\]), 12 months|FBG, fasting blood-glucose in mmol/L, 12 months|PBG, postprandial blood-glucose in mmol/L, Baseline and 12 months|FINS, fasting serum insulin in mU/L, Baseline and 12 months|PINS, postprandial insulin in mU/L, Baseline and 12 months|ALT, alanine aminotransferase in U/L, Baseline and 12 months|AST, aspartate aminotransferase in U/L）, Baseline and 12 months|UA, Uric acid in umol/L, Baseline and 12 months|CR, Creatinine in umol/L, Baseline and 12 months|LDL-c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in mmol/L, Baseline and 12 months|HDL-c, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in mmol/L, Baseline and 12 months|TC, Total Cholesterol in mmol/L, Baseline and 12 months|TG, Triglyceride in mmol/L, Baseline and 12 months|WHR, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated as follows: WHR = (waist circumference \[cm\]/(hip circumference \[cm\])., Baseline and 12 months|HC, Hip circumference, Baseline and 12 months|Ferriman-Gallwey score, Ferriman-Gallwey score, Baseline and 12 months|Menstrual Cycles, The number of menstrual cycles per year was defined as the number of menstruations during the last 12 months., Baseline and 12 months|HOMA-IR, homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance index, Baseline and 12 months|TT, total testosterone in nmol/L, Baseline and 12 months|FT, free testosterone (nmol/L), Baseline and 12 months|DHEAS, Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (ug/dl), Baseline and 12 months|SHBG, sex hormone-binding globulin in nmol/L, Baseline and 12 months|FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone in IU/L, Baseline and 12 months|LH, luteinizing hormone in IU/L, Baseline and 12 months|WC, waist circumference,, Baseline and 12 months
This study consecutively enrolled 153 patients with obesity aged 18-45 years (83 with PCOS and 70 control patients) who underwent LSG from May 2013 to September 2020 at the Department of Endocrinology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, with a 12-month follow-up. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to assess body fat distribution.
