Study of Bevacizumab and Erlotinib in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will evaluate the combination of bevacizumab and erlotinib in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: bevacizumab|DRUG: Erlotinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 3 years
There is no definite evidence of a superior therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer in elderly patients. With the exception of one known study, single agent erlotinib has not been studied exclusively in the elderly and the combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab has never been studied exclusively in the treatment naive elderly. This is an important population that needs less toxic therapies.
