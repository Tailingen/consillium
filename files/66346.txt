Study Evaluating Safety and Efficacy of CAR-T Cells Targeting CD123 in Patients With Acute Myelocytic Leukemia
This is an open, single-arm, phase I clinical study to evaluate efficacy and safety of chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) targeting CD123 in the treatment of Acute Myelocytic Leukemia. A total of 15 patients are planned to be enrolled following up one year.
Acute Myelocytic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CD123 CAR-T cells
Tumor load, Tumor load will be quantified with radiology, bone marrow and/or blood samples dependent on diagnosis., Up to 12 months
CAR-T cell persistence, CAR-T cell persistence will be quantified with flow cytometry and qPCRï¼› Percentage of CART cells in BM and copies of car per ug DNA, Up to 12 months
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells targeted against CD19 have demonstrated unprecedented successes in treating patients with hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. Besides CD19, many other molecules such as CD22, CD30,BCMA,CD123, etc. may be potential in developing the corresponding CAR-T cells to treat patients whose tumors expressing those markers. In this study, investigators will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CAR-T targeting CD123 in patients with Acute Myelocytic Leukemia. The primary goal is safety assessment including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition, disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.
