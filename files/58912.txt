Laparoscopic Gastrectomy With D2 Lymphadenectomy Combined With Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) or Not
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Locally Advanced Gastric Cancer after Laparoscopic Gastrectomy with D2 Lymphadenectomy. The main question it aims to answer is: whether HIPEC can effectively improving the 5-year overall survival rate and decrease the peritoneal metastases rate of patients with advanced gastric cancer underwent Laparoscopic Gastrectomy with D2 Lymphadenectomy. Participants will be divided into two groups, Experimental group received laparoscopic (robotic) D2 surgery plus HIPEC2 times plus systemic chemotherapy 6\~8 cycles; and Control group received laparoscopic (robotic) D2 surgery plus systemic chemotherapy 6\~8 cycles.
