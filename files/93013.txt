Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT), Number of participants with DLT for the determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). 3+3 dose escalation design. MTD based on DLTs during first treatment course. After MTD was determined, additional patients were included at the MTD in an expansion cohort., 28 days
Number of Patients With Best Overall Response, Overall response is defined as complete response, partial response and stable disease and was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.0). Complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) had to be confirmed by a subsequent tumour assessment at least 28 days after the criteria for CR or PR were first met. To confirm a status of stable disease, the duration of stable disease was to be at least 42 days., From first dose of study medication to response measurement, up to 44 months. Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Number of Patients With Objective Response (OR), OR is defined as confirmed complete response and confirmed partial response (PR) and was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.0)., From first dose of study medication to response measurement, up to 44 months. Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Number of Patients With Disease Control (DC), DC is defined as confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) and was assessed according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.0)., From first dose of study medication to response measurement, up to 44 months. Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Time to Objective Response, The time to OR was the duration from the first treatment to the time when the measurement criteria for first documented confirmed CR and/or PR were met according to RECIST 1.0 criteria., From first dose of study medication to response measurement, up to 44 months. Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Duration of Objective Response, The duration of objective response was measured from the time of first documented confirmed CR or PR to the time of progressive disease or death, whichever occured earlier., From first dose of study medication to response measurement, up to 44 months. Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Duration of Disease Control, Duration of disease control was measured from the start of study treatment to the time of progression or death, whichever occured first., From first dose of study medication to response measurement, up to 44 months. Tumour assessments were performed at screening, week 8, week 16, week 24, and every 8 weeks thereafter.|Best Percentage Change in Tumour Size, Best percentage change in tumour size was the best percentage change in the sum of diameters of target lesions and was calculated as (minimum sum of diameters post baseline - sum of diameters at baseline)/sum of diameters at baseline. Negative values indicate a decrease, positive values an increase., Screening and every 8 weeks after starting of treatment, up to 44 weeks.|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the first dose of study medication to the occurrence of tumour progression or death, whichever came first. It was assessed according to RECIST 1.0. Median time results from unstratified Kaplan-Meier estimates., From first dose of study medication to the occurrence of progression or death whichever came first, up to 44 months.|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve of Afatinib After Multiple Administrations of 40mg Afatinib in Presence and Absence of 25mg/m^2 i.v.
