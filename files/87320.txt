To Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Capecitabine Prior to Surgery in Women With Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with oral capecitabine or intravenous (IV) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), in combination with epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, prior to surgery in participants with breast cancer. The participants will receive 4 cycles of neoadjuvant Capecitabine + Epirubicin + Cyclophosphamide (CEX) or 5-FU + Epirubicin + Cyclophosphamide (FEC 100) chemotherapy during first treatment period (Period 1, Days 1-85). After 4-6 weeks of the fourth cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Day 120 +/- 7 days), breast surgery with regional lymph node dissection will be performed, followed within a maximum of 6 weeks by the second treatment period (Period 2, Days 1 to 85) when participants in both study arms will receive 4 cycles of adjuvant docetaxel 100 milligrams per meter square (mg/m\^2) by IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Upon completion of the second treatment period, participants will enter the post-treatment follow-up period which will last for 5 years from the initial date of participant randomization. During this period participants will be evaluated once a year on the anniversary date of randomization.
