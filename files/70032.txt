MyProstateScore Equivalency With and Without DRE
The purpose of the study is to quantify the concordance of MPS results between first-catch urine samples collected post-DRE and those collected without a DRE.
Prostate Cancer
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MyProstateScore
MPS equivalency with and without DRE, The process for obtaining a urine sample for MPS currently requires a DRE within one hour prior to urine collection. We aim to understand whether a DRE is a required step prior to urine collection for MPS, and to explore alternative methods that may eliminate the need for a DRE., Study participation will span 8 days|MPS validity rate with and without DRE, Rate of invalid test result equivalency in post-DRE versus non-DRE paired urine samples. Rate will be measured as the percentage of subjects who return an invalid urine sample., Study participation will span 8 days
The process for obtaining a urine sample for MPS currently requires a DRE within one hour prior to urine collection. We aim to understand whether a DRE is a required step prior to urine collection for MPS, and to explore alternative methods that may eliminate the need for a DRE. In order to do so, we will perform a crossover study in which each subject provides a sample under both conditions.
