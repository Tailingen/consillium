HRQoL Keratinocyte Carcinomas
Rationale: Keratinocyte skin cancer is known to influence the HRQoL in a specific way. Derived utility values are required for cost-effectiveness analyses of new interventions. However there is no sensitive tool to capture HRQoL that translates into utilities available.

Objective: To document the exact HRQoL in patients with in KC using the generic EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, as well as the TTO, 15D and the BaSQoL questionnaire, and to develop health utilities based on these tools.

Study design: Longitudinal observational study (at time 0 and time 0 +12 months).

Study population: Patients aged â‰¥18 years consulting a dermatologist or their GP for diagnosis, treatment or follow-up of a (pre)malignant skin lesion(s).
