HAIC Plus PD-1 Antibody vs HAIC Plus Sorafenib for Advanced HCC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) combined with Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) antibody compared with HAIC plus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: HAIC|DRUG: PD-1 antibody|DRUG: Sorafenib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documentation of disease progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), or date of death, whichever occurred first., 12 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the duration from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. Participants who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, and participants who remained alive were censored at the time of data cutoff., 12 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST., 12 months|Adverse Events, Number of adverse events. Postoperative adverse events were graded based on CTCAE v4.03, 12 months
The results of our preliminary pilot study suggested that sorafenib combined with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve the survivals for advanced hepatocellular (HCC). Programmed Cell Death Protein-1 (PD-1) antibody has been proved effective and safety for advanced HCC. There is no study about HAIC plus PD-1 antibody. Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective randomized control study to compare HAIC plus sorafenib and HAIC plus PD-1 antibody.
