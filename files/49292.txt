The main purpose of this study is to determine if AZD0530 can improve the efficacy of standard chemotherapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer

DRUG: AZD0530|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Objective Response Rate as Evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST), Number of responders (complete (CR) or partial (PR) responders). CR = disappearance of all target lesions PR = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diamete. Analysis was based on August 31, 2009 data cut-off , and was performed with patients who had measurable disease and received AZD0530 175mg or Placebo 175mg., Response is evaluated from randomization to objective disease progression per RECIST criteria or death due to any cause in the absence of progression (conducted when a minimum of 78 progression free survival events had occurred)
Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Evaluated by RECIST, Interval between date of randomization and earliest date of objective disease progression per RECIST criteria or death due to any cause in the absence of progression. Analysis was based on August 31, 2009 data cut-off (78 PFS events analysis) and was performed with patients in ITT analysis set who received AZD0530 175mg or Placebo 175mg., Date of randomization to earliest date of objective disease progression or death due to any cause (conducted when a minimum of 78 progression free survival events had occurred)|Overall Survival (Number of Deaths), Interval between date of randomization and death due to any cause. Analysis was based on January 31, 2010 data cut-off and was performed with patients in ITT analysis set who received AZD0530 175mg or Placebo 175mg. At this time, data were still immature and median overall survival was not reached. Number of deaths is presented instead, Date of randomization to death due to any cause
