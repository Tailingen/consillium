The Effect on Androxal Versus Androgel on Morning Testosterone in Men With Secondary Hypogonadism (Low Testosterone)
The study will determine the effects of three doses of Androxal(enclomiphene citrate)on morning testosterone versus AndroGel(approved topical treatment)in men with low testosterone (\<350 ng/dL)after 6 weeks of continuous dosing.
Secondary Hypogonadism
DRUG: Androxal (enclomiphene citrate)|DRUG: Testosterone
24 Hour Average and Maximum Testosterone Concentration, The primary efficacy endpoint will be 24-hour average (TTavg) and maximum (TTmax) testosterone concentration compared to baseline after 6 weeks of treatment.

Time points (in hours after dosing) at which testosterone concentration was measured are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24., Baseline and Week 6
Change in Leuteinizing Hormone (LH), Changes in morning LH after continuous dosing, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6|Change in Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Changes in morning FSH after continuous dosing, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6
Enclomiphene Pharmacokinetic Parameters at Week 6 - Cmax., The Cmax for plasma concentration., Week 6|Enclomiphene Pharmacokinetic Parameters at Week 6 - Tmax., The Tmax for plasma concentration., Week 6|Enclomiphene Pharmacokinetic Parameters at Week 6 - AUC0-24., The area under the curve for plasma concentration over time from zero to 24 hours (AUC0-24)., Week 6
Study will require 7 visits, which includes 2 overnight stays in a clinic. One visit is an eye exam. Blood samples are required at all visits including sampling every hour for a 24 hour time period during the 2 overnight stays. A six month extension study will be available for all subjects completing the 6-week study.
