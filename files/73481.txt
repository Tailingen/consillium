Pemetrexed in Maintenance in Patients With Impaired Renal Function, 2 Dose Calculation Strategies
Pemetrexed is used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Its elimination is mainly renal and its nephrotoxicity requires an interruption of treatment when the CrCLCG falls below 45 mL / min. Patients with NSCLC frequently have impaired renal function by other cytotoxic drugs.

The dose adjustment of pemetrexed is performed as a function of body surface area (SC) without any pharmacokinetic rational. The challenge is to treat patients with renal insufficiency (RR) with a safe dose, based on CRCL, providing equivalent biological exposure to patients with preserved renal function.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pemetrexed
Median time until treatment is stopped due to renal function ≤ 45mL / min, From date of randomization until the date of treatment is stopped, 1 year
Progression-free survival, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 100 weeks
* Primary objective: Evaluate the impact of calculating the dose of pemetrexed to be administered versus creatine clearance according to Cockcroft-Gault (CrCLCG) versus body surface area (SC) on median time before discontinuation of treatment for renal function ≤ 45mL / min in patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer predominantly non-squamous in maintenance.
* Secondary objective: To evaluate the impact of calculating the dose of pemetrexed to be administered versus CRCLCG versus SC over time to treatment discontinuation, progression-free survival (PFS), and patient overall survival.
