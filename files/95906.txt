Phase I-II Study to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of AUY922 in Advanced Solid Malignancies, and Efficacy in HER2+ or ER+ Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
This is a phase I/II, open-label, multicenter study of AUY922 administered intravenously in patients with advanced solid malignancies to determine the maximum tolerated dose. Phase II expansion arms will investigate efficacy in patients with either HER2 positive or ER positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Additional patients with advanced solid malignancies will also be investigated in a separate expansion arm. Safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will be assessed.
