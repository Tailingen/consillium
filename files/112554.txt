Exercise and Colon Cancer
Despite the success of surgery and chemotherapy among people with colon cancer, 30-50% of patients develop recurrent disease. Physical activity has emerged as a potential lifestyle intervention to reduce cancer recurrence and improve survival among people with colon cancer (CC). This pilot study aims to identify the dose-response effects of aerobic exercise on molecular and cellular pathways associated with physical activity and CC outcomes among patients with stage II and III CC.
