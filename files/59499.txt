Clinical Study of Short-course Radiotherapy Followed by Fruquintinib Plus Sintilimab vs Bevacizumab Plus Capecitabine as First Line Treatment in Advanced mCRC
The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of short course radiotherapy followed by fruquintinib combined with Sintilimab as the first-line treatment of advanced mCRC compared to bevacizumab combined with capecitabine in patients unfit for intensive therapy.

Anti-angiogenic therapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced mCRC has shown promising efficacy with acceptable toxicities. Radiotherapy may reshape the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby improving the efficacy of subsequent anti angiogenic drugs combined with immunotherapy.

The study is a prospective, multi-centered, two-stage clinical study with 220 unresectable advanced mCRC patients unfit for oxaliplatin or irinotecan-based intensive chemotherapy enrolled. In phase 1b, 20 patients will be recruited and the efficacy and safety of SCRT followed by fruquintinib plus sintilimab will be explored. In phase 2, 200 patients will be randomized and the efficacy and safety will be compared between SCRT followed by fruquintinib plus sintilimab and capecitabine plus bevacizumab.
