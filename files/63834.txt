Pilot Study of DRibble Vaccine for Prostate Cancer Patients
This is a pilot study of the DRibble vaccine in patients with advanced prostate cancer.
Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|BIOLOGICAL: DRibble Vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: HPV Vaccinations|DRUG: Imiquimod
Safety Assessment, Patients will come to clinic 10 times over a 28 week period and have blood tests and vital sign measurements at each visit. In addition, patients will have 8 physical exams and performance status evaluations during this time period to evaluate possible toxicities related to study treatment., 28 Weeks
Immune Response, Patients will have 11 blood draws during the study to evaluate the immune response. In addition, patients will undergo two leukapheresis procedures and provide two biopsy samples (if cancer is amenable to safe biopsy) to evaluate immune response., 28 weeks|Prostate Cancer Response to DRibble vaccine, Patients will have 8 Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Tests over a 22-week period and 3 CT scans over a 28-week period to assess response to treatment., 28 weeks
Microbiome identification, Patients will provide 3 stool samples for microbiome identification for future research to see if there is a correlation with response to treatment., 12 weeks
The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the safety and tolerability of DRibble vaccine, cyclophosphamide, imiquimod, and Ceravix in castrate resistant prostate cancer.

This study will also assess:

* the immune profile of tumor biopsy specimens if sites amenable to biopsy are present
* humoral and cellular responses to cancer antigens after DRibble vaccination
* the response to a reporter antigen vaccine (Ceravix) after DRibble vaccination

An exploratory objective is to characterize the microbiome before and after study drugs administration and correlate prostate cancer responses.
