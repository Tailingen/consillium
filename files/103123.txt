Maintainance therapy in patients with unresectable stage III, NSCLC Stage IIIA-B, unresectable, NSCLC, treated with definitive Chemo-Radiotherapy
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
DRUG: Pembrolizumab Injectable Product
OS, The primary objective is to evaluate if treatment with chemo-radiotherapy followed by Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) maintenance (up to 24 months) results in superior Overall Survival (OS) in stage IIIA-B, unresectable, NSCLC compared to chemo-radiotherapy (CT-RT) followed by observation, up to 24 months per patient
PFS, To evaluate Rate (%) of patients without disease progression at 12, 18 and 24 months, up to 24 months per patient
This is an Italian multi-center randomized phase II trial (randomization 2:1) of intravenous (IV) MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) versus observation as a maintenance therapy after chemo-radiotherapy (either concomitant or sequential, regardless of the type of chemotherapy used) in unresectable stage IIIA-IIIB non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
