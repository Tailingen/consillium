Comprehensive Study of Social Representation of Platelet Transfusion in Patients Followed for Advanced Hematological Malignancies (R-PLQ)
Limited data is available for end of life care in hematologic malignancies, moreover with thrombocytopenic patients. Thrombopenia is a frequent complication, specific of bone marrow involvement in those diseases or its treatments. Yet, a few studies was interested in, whereas platelet transfusion is the only treatment indicated. As it represent a scarce, limited resource, the ethical principles are in conflict in this setting and there's a lack of recommendation. The final decision is take by the clinician and his patient, but no study exist in representation of the two parts. We provide a qualitative study to understand what this decision is made of.
