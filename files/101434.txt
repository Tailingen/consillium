Phase 1 Every-3-Week Dosing of SCH 727965 in Patients With Advanced Cancer (Study P04630)
Part 1 and Part 2 of this trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, maximum administered dose, and dose limiting toxicity of SCH 727965 administered every 3 weeks as a 2 hour intravenous (IV) infusion (Part 1), and as an 8-hour or 24-hour IV infusion (Part 2). Each 3-week period is considered one treatment cycle. Part 3 of this trial will evaluate the effect of coadministration of antiemetic drug aprepitant on the pharmacokinetics of SCH 727965 administered as a 2 hour IV infusion once every 3 weeks.
