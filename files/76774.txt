Phase II Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of the Combination of Tagraxofusp and Venetoclax in Treatment-naive Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm Patients
The goal of this clinical trial is to study the efficacy of the tagraxofusp + venetoclax combination in treatment-naive blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm adult patients.

The main question is to verify the response in patients after 3 cycles of tagraxofusp+venetolax and to demonstrate if the combination of tagraxofusp + venetoclax increases the rate of complete remission, assessed after 3 months of treatment.

Patients will receive a ramp-up phase of venetoclax during 3 days and at least 3 cycles of venetoclax. After, the investigators will evaluate the response, and depending on the response observed, patients may receive additional cycles of treatment for a maximum of 24 cycles, or receive an allograft or discontinue the treatment in the case of therapeutic failure.
