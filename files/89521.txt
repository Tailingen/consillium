Adipose Expression of Leptin, Adiponectin and IL-6 and Plasma Levels of Adipocytokines in Women With and Without Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
The purpose of the study was to investigate adipose expression and plasma levels of different adipocytokine, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of PCOS. The investigators investigated lean and obese women with and without PCOS.
