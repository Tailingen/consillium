Evaluation of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of PHI 101 for the Treatment of AML
The purpose of this study is to find out the maximum tolerable dose and safety of PHI-101, novel FLT3 inhibitor in the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML for patients who have received standard therapy or cannot tolerate standard therapy, and/or for whom no standard therapy exists.

There will be two parts to the study, which we will call Phase Ia and Phase Ib. Phase Ia is called the dose escalation. Approximately 20 to 24 patients are planned to be enrolled into Phase Ia. Phase 1a is conducted to determine the best dose and schedule of dosing of PHI-101 to be used in Phase 1b. There will be 5 different dose levels of PHI-101 given to patients in Phase Ia.

Phase Ib is called the dose expansion. Approximately 14-34 patients (approximately 14-17 patients in each of the 2 cohorts planned) of each cohort are planned in Phase Ib based on study design. Phase Ib is also being conducted to assess anti-leukemia response, changes in transfusion requirements, and safety of PHI-101 at the dose level identified during Phase Ia.
Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: PHI-101
Safety assessed through adverse events to determine maximum tolerated dose, Safety will be measured by AEs, vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, ECOG performance., From screening to the last Safety Follow up Visit(Safety Follow-up visit occurs 30 days after from EOT)|Tolerability assessed by dose compliance, Tolerability will be measured by reviewing data of dose interruptions, reductions, and doses administered, From screening to the last Safety Follow up Visit(Safety Follow-up visit occurs 30 days after from EOT)
