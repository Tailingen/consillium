Probiotic Intervention in PCOS
The investigators are conducting a double-blinded randomized controlled trial to determine whether a probiotic mixture is effective in reducing PCOS-related symptoms. For this purpose, 180 participants will be recruited in three intervention arms (Probiotic, Placebo and Metformin), with 60 participants per arm. The intervention period will last 6 months, with extensive medical history, blood work, urine and stool analysis at the beginning and the conclusion of the trial.
