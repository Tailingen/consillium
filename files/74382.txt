The Clinical Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Trop2-ADC Monotherapy or Combination Immunotherapy Strategy in the Treatment of Advanced Triple-negative Breast Cancer.
This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of Trop2-ADC monotherapy or immune combination strategy in the treatment of advanced triple-negative breast cancer.
Metastatic Triple-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: trop2-ADC|DRUG: ADC +anti-angiogenic drug|DRUG: ADC + PD1 monoclonal antibody +anti-angiogenic drug
Objective response rate 3 months after treatment (ORR), Three months after enrollment
Overall survival (OS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|living quality, The scores of EORTC-c30 scale were compared before and after enrollment., "through study completion, an average of 1 year|Clinical benefit rate, 3 months after enrollment
This prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled study aims to evaluate the 3-month treatment efficacy (ORR) of three therapeutic strategies-ADC monotherapy, ADC in combination with immunotherapy, and ADC in combination with immunotherapy and anti-angiogenesis-in patients with advanced breast cancer, and to assess potential adverse events related to the treatment regimens. Participants will receive treatment with a Trop-2-targeting ADC drug containing a TOP1 inhibitor (such as Gosituzumab or SKB264), in accordance with the defined protocol. Regular assessments will include imaging, histopathological analysis, and safety monitoring. The objective of this study is to provide novel treatment strategies for triple-negative breast cancer by evaluating the efficacy and safety of trop2-ADC+ immunotherapy + antiangiogenic agents and trop2-ADC+ antiangiogenic agents versus trop2-ADC monotherapy in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC).
