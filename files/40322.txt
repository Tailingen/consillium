Neuroinflammation and Age-associated Brain Pathology: Two Potential Mechanisms of Cognitive Impairment in Ovarian Cancer
This clinical study will use the small molecule translocator protein (TSPO) ligand, 18F-labeled DPA- 714, to visualize and quantify neuroinflammation in treatment naivete women with stage 1-4 newly diagnosed ovarian cancer (without brain metastases) prior to starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment (baseline) and within a month of completing first 6 cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment (follow-up). In addition, we will use the well-characterized small molecule PET(Positron Emission Tomography) tracer, 11C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) to visualize and quantify the regional brain distribution of pathological amyloid deposition at baseline only. The brain amyloid PET and MRI data acquired through this study will be correlated with cognitive test data, clinical data, genetic testing, and biospecimens collected in this study.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: [11C]PiB and 18F-labeled DPA-714 PET scan
Measure neuroinflammation by calculating the concentration and regional distribution of activated brain microglia/macrophages using the PET ligand [F-18]DPA-714., Pre-study visit through 3-6 cycles of chemotherapy (each cycle is typically 2 weeks)
Correlate cognitive impairment before and after beginning cancer therapy with the concentration and regional brain distribution of pathologic amyloid deposition measured with the PET tracer [C-11]PiB prior to beginning therapy., Pre-study visit through 3-6 cycles of chemotherapy (each cycle is typically 2 weeks)
