Combination of PVSRIPO and Atezolizumab for Adults With Recurrent Malignant Glioma
This study evaluates the safety of PVSRIPO treatment in combination with Atezolizumab in patients with WHO grade IV malignant glioma. All patients will receive a single PVSRIPO infusion followed by atezolizumab infusions every three weeks for up to two years.
Malignant Glioma
BIOLOGICAL: PVSRIPO|DRUG: Atezolizumab
Number of unacceptable adverse events, Any Grade 3 or any Grade 4 toxicity that is not reversible within 2 weeks, or any life-threatening event, or treatment-related death., 14 days after first atezolizumab treatment|Proportion of patients alive, Proportion of patients alive at 24 months after PVSRIPO infusion, 24 months after PVSRIPO infusion
The purpose of this phase1b/2 study of atezolizumab in combination with oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) in patients with recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma is to assess the safety of the combination of PVSRIPO + atezolizumab, as well as describe the survival of patients receiving this novel therapy combination. Patients will receive an intratumoral infusion of PVSRIPO followed by atezolizumab treatment with possible surgical resection after the first atezolizumab treatment at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon.
