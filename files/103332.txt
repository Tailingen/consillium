A phase II, muti-cohort study to assess the efficacy and safety of Surufatinib combined with chemotherapy as a second-line treatment in patients with advanced CRC
Advanced Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Surufatinib(HMPL-012)
Objective response rate (ORR), CR + PR rate according to the RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., up to 12 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), To assess the efficacy of Surufatinib Combined With Chemotherapy as second-line therapy to Advanced CRC, patients by assessment of progression free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., up to 12 months|Overall survival time, OS was calculated from the date of pharmacy to death from any cause., up to 36 months|Assess the anti-tumor activity:DCR, Disease control rate (DCR):CR + PR + SD rate according to the RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., up to 12 months
This study adopt Simon's two-stage minimax designs method based on the primary endpoint of objective response rates. In each arm, 15 patients were planned for the first stage. If two or more responses were observed, an additional 13 patients were to be accrued for a total of 28 patients. If 7 or more of the 28 patients in an arm achieved an objective response, then that arm was designated worthy of additional investigation.

Surufatinib will be orally administered within 1 hour after breakfast once a day (QD) , Cohort 1 :Surufatinib+mFOLFOX6/FOLFIRI,Cohort 2 :Surufatinib+FOLFOXIRI for every 14-day treatment cycle until disease progression, death, intolerable toxicity or other protocol specified end-of-treatment criteria is met (which comes first).
