The Combination of Apatinib and Camerlizumab for Advanced Lung Cancer Patients With Muti-line Therapy
The combination of Apatinib and Camrelizumab for progressed NSCLC patients with muti-line therapy : a phaseâ… B clinical study.

Brief Summary: Immunotherapy has made a major progress in Lung cancer.However, challenges such as primary and acquired resistance, small fraction of benefit population and lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers even exist. The overall objective response rate is lower than 20% in second line-treatment and the progression-free survival (PFS) is also similar to or poorer than that of conventional second-line chemotherapy. Apatinib is a novel, orally administered, multitarget receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, c-Kit, and other kinases. It functions by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and proliferative signaling pathways. We would observe and analyze the effectiveness and safety of apatinib combined with Camrelizumab for advanced NSCLC after muti-line therapy to explore the synergistic effect of anti-angiogenic agents and immunotherapy.
