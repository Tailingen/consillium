OUTLINE: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically. PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
