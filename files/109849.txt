Safety Study of PRLX 93936 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of PRLX 93936 and see what kind of effect it has on patients and their cancer. This study will also determine the highest dose of PRLX 93936 that can be given without causing adverse side effects and the dose of PRLX 93936 that should be used in future studies.
Cancer
DRUG: PRLX 93936
Clinical laboratory tests, Weekly|Vital signs, Daily during dosing, then weekly during followup|Electrocardiograms (ECGs), Multiple times during dosing, then weekly during followup|Echocardiograms (ECHO), Baseline and every other cycle

This study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PRLX 93936 administered intravenously over 1 hr daily for 5 days in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients will be evaluated prior to dosing, during dosing and following dosing, on a 28-day cycle. Tumor response will be evaluated every other cycle.

Three patients will be assigned per dose level until the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is reached or a a Dose-Limited Toxicity (DLT) is encountered. Sequential cohorts of three patients will be treated with escalating doses until the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is reached.
