Clinical Trial Evaluating Metronomic Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Osteosarcoma
Preclinical models show that a daily antiangiogenic regimen at low-dose may be effective against chemotherapy-resistant tumors. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with continuous oral cyclophosphamide and methotrexate in patients with high grade, operable, metastatic osteosarcoma (OST) of the extremities. The primary end point is event-free survival (EFS) from randomization

DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Methotrexate
Efficacy and toxicity of adding metronomic therapy in disease event-free survival., To assess the impact of adding metronome therapy to the standard treatment of patients with resectable end-stage osteosarcoma and metastatic lung disease in event-free survival., Five years
Efficacy and toxicity of adding metronomic therapy in overall survival, To evaluate the impact of the addition of metronomic therapy to the standard treatment of patients with end-resectable osteosarcoma and metastatic lung disease in overall survival., Five years|Cardiotoxicity (occurrence of cardiotoxicity), To compare the occurrence of cardiotoxicity with the addition of dexrazoxane since the first cycle of doxorubicin with the findings of the previous study (GLATO 2006)., Five years|Immunohistochemistry (expression of VEGF), Immunohistochemistry the expression of VEGF in the biopsy, primary tumor and metastases, Five years
The study design includes backbone of 10 weeks of preoperative therapy using MAP (high-dose methotrexate, cisplatin, doxorubicin and dexrazoxane). Metastatic patients were randomized to high-dose chemotherapy for 31 weeks (arm 1) or concomitant metronomic therapy (MTX plus cyclophosphamide) such as 31 weeks of high-dose chemotherapy, followed by 73 weeks of metronomic therapy after completion of high-dose chemotherapy, totaling 104 weeks of metronomic therapy (arm 2).
