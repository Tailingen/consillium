Study of SQZ-AAC-HPV in Patients With HPV16+ Recurrent, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter study of the safety and tolerability, immunogenic effects, antitumor activity, and pharmacodynamics of SQZ-AAC-HPV as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors in HLA-A\*02+ patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic human papillomavirus strain 16 positive (HPV16+) solid tumors. The study includes patients with anal, rectal, cervical, head and neck, penile, vulvar, or vaginal cancer.

Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; all, related, serious, and of special interest) as assessed by CTCAE version 5.0, For SQZ-AAC-HPV administered as monotherapy, and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Part 1 and Part 2, respectively), Up to 1 year after LPFV (Last Patient, First Visit)|Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), For SQZ-AAC-HPV as a monotherapy (Part 1), Through Day 28|Number of participants with DLT, For SQC-AAC-HPV in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Part 2), Through Day 28
Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to first overall response of PD by RECIST v 1.1 or to death by any cause. This will be censored at the last RECIST v1.1 assessment if PD/death is not observed. For SQZ-AAC-HPV as a monotherapy, in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Part 1, and Part 2, respectively)., Through start of a new anticancer therapy, up to 2 years after the first dose of investigational product|Overall survival (OS), Defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to death by any cause. This will be censored at the last date patient is known to be alive if death is not observed. For SQZ-AAC-HPV as a monotherapy, in combination immune checkpoint inhibitors (Part 1, and Part 2, respectively)., Through start of a new anticancer therapy, up to 2 years after the first dose of investigational product|Objective response rate (ORR), Proportion of patients with best response of complete response \[CR\] and/or partial response \[PR\] as defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria. For SQZ-AAC-HPV as a monotherapy, in combination immune checkpoint inhibitors (Part 1, and Part 2, respectively)., Through progression per RECIST v1.1 or start of new anticancer therapy, up to 2 years after first dose of investigational product|Duration of Response (DoR), Defined as the time from overall response of CR or PR to first overall response of PD by RECIST v1.1 or to death by any cause. This is defined only for patients who have a CR or PR and will be censored at the last RECIST v1.1 assessment if PD/Death is not observed. For SQZ-AAC-HPV as a monotherapy, in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Part 1, and Part 2, respectively)., Through start of a new anticancer therapy, up to 2 years after the first dose of investigational product|Best overall Response (BoR), Evaluation of the BoR defined as CR, PR, Stable Disease \[SD\], Progressive Disease \[PD\] or Not Evaluable \[NE\] as defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria. For SQZ-AAC-HPV as a monotherapy, in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Part 1, and Part 2, respectively)., Through start of a new anticancer therapy, up to 2 years after the first dose of investigational product|Disease-control rate (DCR), Proportion of patients with best response of CR or PR or SD as defined by RECIST v1.1 criteria. For SQZ-AAC-HPV as a monotherapy, in combination immune checkpoint inhibitors (Part 1, and Part 2, respectively)., Through start of a new anticancer therapy, up to 2 years after the first dose of investigational product|Amount of investigational product (IP) from individual patient blood collection - batch yield, To determine manufacturing feasibility as assessed by batch yield (number of manufacturing runs) (Part 1), From leukapheresis through manufacture, a maximum of 28 days|Amount of investigational product (IP) from individual patient blood collection - product failures, To determine manufacturing feasibility as assessed by number of product failures (Part 1), From leukapheresis through manufacture, a maximum of 28 days
