A Phase III, Randomized, Controlled and Multi-center Study of AK112 and Chemotherapy in First-line Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This trial is a Phase III study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AK112 and chemotherapy versus bevacizumab and chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
