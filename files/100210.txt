Efficacy of Nebulized Pulmicort Respules in Primary Lung Cancer Patients With COPD
To test the hypothesis that nebulized Pulmicort Respules could reduce post operation pulmonary complication incidence in primary lung cancer patients with COPD. Compare post-operation pulmonary complication incidence in two treatment arms among primary lung cancer patients with COPD required single lobectomy from 3days before operation to 7 days after operation.
