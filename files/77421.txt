Tumour Localisation With Magnetic Clip Before Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.
The feasibility of the use of magnetic clips for tumour localisation before preoperative chemotherapy in combination with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) as tracer for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection and in combination with a magnetic clip in the index lymph node metastasis is studied.
Breast Conserving Surgery
DEVICE: Magseed|DEVICE: Metallic clip and guide wire
Specimen volume, The surgical specimen is weighed after removal., Perioperatively
The overall aim is to demonstrate that the use of magnetic clips for tumour localisation before preoperative chemotherapy is feasible at breast cancer surgery and histopathological evaluation in combination with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) as tracer for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection, and in combination with a magnetic clip in the index lymph node metastasis if targeted axillary surgery is planned.
