Chemoradiotherapy Plus Immunotherapy Followed by Surgery for Esophageal Cancer
Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is recommended as standard therapy for resectable esophageal cancer. The recurrence rate after surgery following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is about 35%. Whether achieving pathological complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is significantly associated with recurrence after surgery. It is reported that immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy improved survival compared with chemotherapy alone in first line therapy of advanced esophageal cancer. We hypothesize that the addition of immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is helpful to improving pathologic complete response and survival.
