Early Detection of Cardiac Toxicity in Childhood Cancer Survivors
To evaluate cardiac MRI and/or serum biomarkers for detecting cardiac cardiac toxicity in children who received anthracycline based chemotherapy (ABC).
Heart Failure|Cardiotoxicity
Echocardiogram marker measurements pre ABC chemo and post ABC, •Measure echocardiogram markers on pre anthracycline based chemotherapy (ABC) and post ABC echocardiograms, using standard echocardiogram measurements and speckle tracking., At the end of each cardiac MRI exam through study completion, up to 5 years
Detection of cardiac toxicity on MRI and echocardiogram, •Measure sensitivity of detecting cardiac toxicity between standard echocardiogram, speckle tracking on echo, and MRI, At the end of each cardiac MRI exam through study completion, up to 5 years|Serum biomarkers correlation, •Correlate measurement of serum biomarkers with prevalence of cardiac changes measured on echocardiograms and MRI imaging., At the end of the study, up to 10 years
Cardiac toxicity is a significant potential complication for patients receiving anthracycline chemotherapy. Cells in the cardiovascular system have limited regenerative capability, making them susceptible to long term adverse effects from these chemotherapeutic agents. The ability to detect subclinical changes in cardiac function will allow clinicians to use proven treatments to prevent further progression in this vulnerable population. The current standard testing uses echocardiography, which is not as sensitive as cardiac MRI or serum biomarkers.
