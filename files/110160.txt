Serum Proteomic Profiling for the Early Diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer
No ideal serum biomarker currently exists for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, it is urgent that accurate and reliable serum biomarkers be identified.

Expressed peptide peaks, Find differentially expressed peptide peaks from the model and identify some ideal serum biomarkers for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer, 2010.03-2012.05 (2 years)
Magnetic bead-based fractionation coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to screen serum samples from CRC patients and healthy controls.
