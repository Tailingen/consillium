Study of the Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Pamiparib (BGB-290) in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PKharmacokinetic profile and treatment effect of pamiparib in Chinese participants with advanced high-grade ovarian cancer (including fallopian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer) and triple negative breast cancer in phase I, and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pamiparib in Chinese participants with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (including fallopian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer), harboring germline breast cancer susceptibility gene 1/gene 2 (BRCA1/2) mutation in phase II.
