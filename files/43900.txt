--SuPERIOR Trial--
The Window-of-Opportunity (WOO) Network is a collaboration among Ontario's doctors and scientists to conduct clinical trials in newly-diagnosed cancer patients before they have surgery with an initial focus on understanding how cancer drugs can impact the immune system.

There is often a waiting period of two to six weeks between when a patient first receives a cancer diagnosis and their scheduled surgery. This period provides a unique opportunity to study tumours before they are treated, allowing scientists to explore new ways to identify cancer, measure how cancer cells respond to treatment, and understand how therapies work. WOO Network trials include drugs or treatments that already have been tested in other clinical trials or are already approved by Health Canada.

The SuPERIOR trial is a WOO trial and it is designed for cohort of patients patients diagnosed with newly-diagnosed cancer patients with stage two or three non-small cell lung cancer.

The patients who are enrolled in this trial will received combination of Non-ablative oligofractionated radiation (NORT) which is a low dose of radiation and one dose of Durvalumab, an immunotherapy drug before their surgery.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)|Clinical Staging T2b-3 N0-1 M0
DRUG: Durvalumab|RADIATION: Non-ablative oligofractionated radiation (NORT)
Measuring CD8 TILs density post NORT-durvalumab, Neoadjuvant durvalumab in combination with non-ablative oligofractionated radiation therapy (NORT) using 12 Gy in 3 fractions can upregulate CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in T2b-3 N0-1 M0 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 17 days
