CD30-directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CART30) Therapy in Relapsed and Refractory CD30 Positive Lymphomas
Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CART) holds great promise for treatment of tumors. In this trial, CD30 positive Hodgkin's lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma will be treated by CD30-specific CART cells (CART30).
Hodgkin's Lymphoma|Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: CART30
Occurrence of related adverse events, untill week 24
Anti-tumor response to CART30 cell infusions, Evaluated mainly by computed tomography scanning, Up to 24 weeks
in vivo existence of CART30, Measure mainly by the changes of CAR molecule levels in blood, 1 year
When patients enroll on this trial, autologous CART-33 cells were generated from the mononuclear cells of 50 to 90 ml of the patient's peripheral blood (PB). During the term of cell preparation of CART30, patients will receive a conditioning regimen including cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. One day after completing conditioning regimen, the patient will be given infusions of CART30 cells into the vein in escalating doses over a period of 3 to 5 consecutive days.

Extra blood will be drawn to measure the persistence of CART30 in vivo.
