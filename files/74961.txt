Liposomal Doxorubicin and Docetaxel in HER2 Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is an open phase II multicentre study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the non pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (Myocet®) and docetaxel (Taxotere®) combination as first-line treatment of patients with metastatic HER2/neu negative breast cancer.
Breast Cancer|Neoplasm Metastasis

Cardiotoxicity (definite or probable cardiac death), treatment period|Signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF), New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV, treatment period|Decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥ 5% to < 50% with mild signs or symptoms of CHF (NYHA class < III), treatment period|Decline in LVEF of ≥ 10% to < 50% without signs or symptoms of CHF, treatment period
Frequency and severity of intercurrent events according to the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTC) classification, treatment period|Response rate, treatment period|Median time to progression, treatment period|Progression free survival, treatment period
Phase II non comparative study, assessing the safety (primarily cardiac safety) and efficacy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HER2/neu negative breast cancer not yet treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

Myocet and Taxotere will be given for a maximum of 6 cycles. Endpoints: cardiotoxicity (left ventricular ejection fraction decrease and/or symptoms of heart failure), serious other toxicity, disease progression.
