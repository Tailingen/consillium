ExAblate Blood Brain Barrier Disruption (BBBD) for Planned Surgery in Suspected Infiltrating Glioma
This study is designed to assess the safety and feasibility of using the ExAblate, Type 2 to temporarily disrupt the blood brain barrier in non-enhancing suspected infiltrating glioma. The ExAblate Model 4000 Type-2 is intended for use as a tool to disrupt the BBB.
Glioma
DEVICE: ExAblate 4000 - Type 2
Device and procedure related adverse events, The number and severity of device and BBBD procedure related adverse events will be evaluated., At the time of the ExAblate MRgFUS procedure
Feasibility of BBB disruption, The extent and reversibility of BBB opening will be determined by the degree of contrast enhancement seen on post-procedure MRI with contrast agent, At the time of the ExAblate MRgFUS procedure and 24 hours post-procedure
This study is a prospective, single-arm, non-randomized, open-label feasibility study to evaluate the safety of focal BBBD using the ExAblateÂ® 4000 Type 2 system. Up to 15 subjects with suspected infiltrating glioma who are scheduled to undergo brain tumor resection may be recruited for the study. Only patients that have a non-enhancing tumor components in a non-eloquent region of the planned standard-of-care resection volume will be eligible. Up to 4 centers may participate in this study.
