Echopulse is specially designed, manufactured and CE marked for treating breast fibroadenoma. HIFU is a completely alternative to surgery which utilizes high-energy ultrasound to deliver a large amount of sound energy to a focal point to rapidly induce tissue heating to 85-90Â°C.This initiates tissue coagulation followed by tissue necrosis ablating the targeted area.
