A Study of Ramucirumab (LY3009806) Given by Injection Under the Skin in Participants With Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study in participants with advanced cancer is to learn more about the safety of ramucirumab when given by injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). The study will also measure how much ramucirumab gets into the bloodstream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: Ramucirumab
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (AUC) of Ramucirumab, PK: AUC of Ramucirumab over the dosing interval was evaluated. Cycle = 21 days., Cycle (C) 1 Day (D) 1:Predose; C1D2:24 hours (h) postdose;C1D4:48-96 h postdose;C1D8:predose;C1D15:predose;C1D18:48-96 h postdose;C2D1:predose;C2D8:predose;C2D11:48-96h postdose;C3D1:predose|PK: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Ramucirumab, PK: Cmax of Ramucirumab was evaluated., C1D1:Predose; C1D2:24 hours (h) postdose;C1D4:48-96 h postdose;C1D8:predose;C1D15:predose;C1D18:48-96 h postdose;C2D1:predose;C2D8:predose;C2D11:48-96h postdose;C3D1:predose|PK: Serum Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Ramucirumab, Ctrough of Ramucirumab was evaluated., C1D8: predose; C1D15: predose; C2D1: predose; C2D8: predose; C3D1: predose
Percentage of Participants With Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies, Percentage of participants with positive treatment emergent anti-drug antibodies was summarized by treatment group. A treatment-emergent ADA (TEADA) was defined as: having a negative ADA at baseline and an ADA titer greater than or equal to 1:20 (that is (i.e.), greater than 2-fold from the minimal required dilution of 1:10) any time post baseline (i.e., treatment-induced); or a 4-fold or greater change in ADA titer from baseline for participants that had a detectable ADA titer at baseline (i.e., treatment boosted)., C1D1: predose; C1D15: predose; C2D8: predose; C4D1: predose|Number of Participants With Injection Site Reactions (ISRs), The number of participants with at least one treatment-emergent injection site reaction is presented. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality is located in the Reported Adverse Events module., Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3: D1, D8, D15, D22: 5-15 min, 60 min post injection; C1D2: 24 hours (h) post injection; C1D4 (Â± 1 day)
