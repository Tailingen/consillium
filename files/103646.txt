InAdvance: Surveillance, Prevention, and Interception in a Population at Risk for Cancer
This research study is creating a way to collect and store specimens and information from participants who may be at an increased risk of developing cancer, or has been diagnosed with an early phase of a cancer or a family member who has a family member with a precursor condition for cancer.

* The objective of this study is to identify exposures as well as clinical, molecular, and pathological changes that can be used to predict early development of cancer, malignant transformation, and risks of progression to symptomatic cancer that can ultimately be fatal.
* The ultimate goal is to identify novel markers of early detection and risk stratification to drive potential therapeutic approaches to intercept progression to cancer.

OTHER: Samples
Identify exposures as well as clinical, molecular, and pathological changes that can be used to predict early development of cancer, malignant transformation, and risks of progression to symptomatic cancer that can ultimately be fatal., The InAdvance Study will screen participants for precancerous conditions and cancer through blood tests and tissue biopsies. These biologic samples will be screened for precancerous conditions through routine clinical methods, as well as using novel research level technology. This could include germline testing, whole genome and whole exome sequencing. The participants will be followed serially to track their disease progression. Participants will fill out general health questionnaires, and we will match their answers to the timepoint of their sample submission and follow changes to their answers., 5 years
The objective of this protocol is to obtain clinical information and facilitate the collection and distribution of specimens obtained during the course of clinical care or research participation.

* Blood, buccal swabs, urine or tissue or other body fluids (including stool) may be specifically acquired for research in order to perform molecular and other types of analyses for research purposes.
* These materials will be collected from all eligible participants who have a precursor lesion or an increased risk of cancer

It is expected that about 5,000 people will take part in this research study.
