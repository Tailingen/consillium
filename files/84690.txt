FOLFOXIRI With or Without Panitumumab in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (VOLFI)
The aim of the trial is to optimize response rates and rates of secondary resections of metastases in patients with initially non-resectable metastatic colorectal cancer of RAS wildtype. The patients will be treated in two therapy groups:

Experimental arm A: Chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI + panitumumab Standard arm B: Chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: FOLFOXIRI + Panitumumab|DRUG: FOLFOXIRI
