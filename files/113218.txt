Cadonilimab (AK104) Plus Chemotherapy as First-line Treatment in Non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients With Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Negative
This is a single arm, multi-center clinical trial. Target population is advanced or metastatic non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients with Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) negative, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of Cadonilimab and chemotherapy. Cadonilimab is a PD-1/CTLA-4 bi-specific antibody.

This trial enrolled advanced or metastatic non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Patients with Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) negative. Patients will receive cadonilimab (10mg/kg) plus pemetrexed(500mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC=5) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, follwed with cadonilimab (10mg/kg) plus pemetrexed (500mg/m2) every 3 weeks as maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint is 12-month progression-free-survival (PFS) rate assessed by investigators. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR), time to response (TTR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.
