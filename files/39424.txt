Study of Cadonilimab (AK104) Plus Lenvatinib in Patients With Advanced Endometrial Cancer
This is an open-label, multi-center Phase II study of cadonilimab (AK104) combined with lenvatinib in patients with advanced endometrial cancer. The primary objective is to evaluate objective response rate of cadonilimab plus lenvatinib.

DRUG: Cadonilimab|DRUG: Lenvatinib
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experiences a dose limiting toxicities (DLT) during the first cycle., the first 21 days of treatment|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), Determine the RP2D of lenvatnib, the first 21 days of treatment|Response Rate (ORR), ORR is the proportion of patients with best response of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., from the first drug administration up to two years
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Time from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of first documented tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., from the first drug administration up to two years|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of patients whose best overall response is either CR, PR, or SD., from the first drug administration up to two years|Duration of response (DOR), Time from first documented response (CR or PR) until documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., from the first drug administration up to two years|Overall survival (OS), Time from the date of first study treatment administration to the date of death due to any cause., from the first drug administration up to 2 years|Safety and tolerability, Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5.0., up to 90 days after last study treatment administration
