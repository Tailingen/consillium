Internet-Delivered Psychological Treatment for Cancer Survivors
Negative psychological effects of cancer are common, but cancer survivors are rarely offered structured psychological treatment. Internet-delivered treatments have shown some promise, but specific treatment components have not been empirically evaluated which means that it is not clear which therapies that should be prioritized. In this randomized factorial trial at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, 400 cancer survivors with psychiatric symptoms are enrolled in variations on a 10-week therapist-guided online psychological treatment intended to address the negative psychological long-term effects of cancer. The aim is to determine the contribution of treatment components to the overall effect.
