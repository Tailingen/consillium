Adebrelimab Plus Carboplatin/Paclitaxel Followed by Adebelizumab with or Without Apatinib in the Treatment of Advanced Recurrent/Metastatic Endometrial Cancer (A-CAPE): a Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Open-Label Clinical Trial
This study takes investigator-assessed Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as the primary endpoint, with plans to enroll 140 patients with advanced recurrent/metastatic endometrial cancer in a 1:1 ratio, randomized into an experimental group and a control group. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Adebelimab (PD-L1) combined with Carboplatin/Paclitaxel treatment, followed by maintenance therapy with or without Apatinib in patients with advanced recurrent/metastatic endometrial cancer. Additionally, based on molecular testing results, the study will explore the PFS and Overall Survival (OS) of patients with Deficient Mismatch Repair/Microsatellite Instability-High(dMMR/MSI-H) and Proficient Mismatch Repai/Microsatellite Stability (pMMR/MSS) endometrial cancer, providing new precision treatment options for patients with recurrent and metastatic endometrial cancer.
Recurrent/Metastatic Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: Adebelimab Combined with Apatinib|DRUG: Adebelimab
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The time from randomization until tumor progression (as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 36 months
Overall survival, OS, The time from randomization until death from any cause. For subjects who are lost to follow-up before death, the last follow-up time is usually counted as the time of death., 36 months|Objective response rate, ORR, The proportion of patients whose tumor volume decreases by a predetermined amount and maintains this reduction for the minimum required duration. It is the sum of the complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates. In other words, ORR = CR + PR., 36 months|Disease control rate, DCR, The percentage of evaluable patients who achieve a response (PR + CR) or stable disease (SD) after treatment. Simply put, DCR = CR + PR + SD, according to the RECIST criteria for at least 4 weeks., 36 months|Duration of Overall Response, DOR, The time from when a patient first achieves a CR or PR to disease progression., 36 months
