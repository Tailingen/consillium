Bladder Cancer|Gastric Cancer|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|NSCLC|Urothelial Carcinoma|Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: APR-246 (eprenetapopt) + Pembrolizumab
To Evaluate the Safety of APR-246 in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Subjects With Solid Tumors., To determine the Frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs) related to APR-246 in combination with pembrolizumab., Through study completion, approximately 1 year|To Confirm the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for APR-246 in Combination With Pembrolizumab, To determine the dose of APR-246 to be selected for the expansion phase based on the occurence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) experienced during the safety assessment period, Through safety lead in period, during cycle 1 (approximately 21 days)
This is a phase 1/2, open-label, study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of APR-246 (eprenetapopt) in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with solid tumor malignancies. In the safety lead-in part of study (phase 1), the safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of APR-246 will be investigated.

In the expansion part of the study (phase 2), both safety and efficacy for the combination therapy will be investigated in the 3 cohorts.
