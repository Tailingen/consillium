A Phase Ia Clinical Study of QLF31907 Injection in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of QLF31907 injection, to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), and determine the recommended phase Ib dose(RPIbD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D)in patients with advanced malignant tumors.
