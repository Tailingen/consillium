Preliminary Study on Eye Features of Patients With Malignant Tumors
Based on the theory of traditional Chinese Medicine, this study collects eye features of white eyes through the White Eye Imaging Health Care System under visible light and establishes a database of eye-eye features corresponding to the disease. The computer image analysis and artificial intelligence technology are used to visualize the eye. The features were extracted and classified, and the corresponding changes in the characteristics of the traditional Chinese medicine and the disease were analyzed statistically to establish an analytical model corresponding to the disease.
