Clinical Study of SI-B001+SI-B003Â± Chemotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Phase Ib: To observe the safety and tolerability of SI-B001+SI-B003 in combination and to identify RP2D in locally advanced or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma indications. Initial efficacy, pharmacokinetic characteristics and immunogenicity were evaluated. Phase II: To evaluate the efficacy of SI-B001+SI-B003 two-drug combination chemotherapy. Safety and tolerance, PK/PD, immunogenicity were evaluated.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck
DRUG: SI-B001|DRUG: SI-B003
Phase Ib: Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The RP2D is defined as the dose level chosen by the sponsor (in consultation with the investigators) for phase II study, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD data collected during the dose escalation study of SI-B001+SI-B003., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Dose Limited Toxicity (DLT), The incidence and severity of adverse events (TEAE) during treatment were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Standard for Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE, v5.0)., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib: Maximum Tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD), In the dose increment stage, the highest dose whose estimated DLT rate is closest to the target DLT rate but does not exceed the upper bound of the equivalent interval of DLT rate is selected as MTD., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase II: Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants, who has a CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions). The percentage of participants who experiences a confirmed CR or PR is according to RECIST 1.1., Up to approximately 24 months
Phase Ib/II: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally emerging, or any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition during the treatment of SI-B001+SI-B003. The type, frequency and severity of TEAE will be evaluated during the treatment of SI-B001+SI-B003., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Disease control rate (DCR), The DCR is defined as the percentage of participants who has a CR, PR, or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered PD\])., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Duration of response (DOR), The DOR for a responder is defined as the time from the participant's initial objective response to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Progression-free survival (PFS), The PFS is defined as the time from the participant's first dose of SI-B001+SI-B003 to the first date of either disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Cmax, Maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of SI-B001+SI-B003 will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Tmax, Time to maximum serum concentration (Tmax) of SI-B001+SI-B003 will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: T1/2, Half-life (T1/2) of SI-B001+SI-B003 will be investigated., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: AUC0-t, Blood concentration - Area under time line., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: CL, To study the serum clearance rate of SI-B001+SI-B003 per unit time., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Ctrough, Ctrough is defined as the lowest serum concentration of SI-B001+SI-B003 prior to the next dose will be administered., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Anti-drug antibody (ADA), Frequency and titer of anti-SI-B001, SI-B003 antibody (ADA) will be evaluated., Up to approximately 24 months|Phase Ib/II: Neutralizing antibody (Nab), Incidence and titer of Nab of SI-B001 and SI-B003 will be evaluated., Up to approximately 24 months
Phase Ib: To observe the safety and tolerability of SI-B001+SI-B003 combination and to determine the recommended dose (RP2D) for Phase II clinical studies in locally advanced or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma indications. To evaluate the initial efficacy, pharmacokinetic characteristics and immunogenicity of SI-B001+SI-B003 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Phase II: To evaluate the efficacy of SI-B001+SI-B003 dual-agent chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The safety, tolerability, PK/PD and immunogenicity of SI-B001+SI-B003 combined chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were evaluated.
