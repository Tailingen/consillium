A Phase I/II study of autologous T cells engineered using the Sleeping Beauty transposon/transposase system to express TCR(s) reactive against neoantigens in subjects with relapsed/refractory solid tumors.

An HLA Typing and Tumor Neoantigen Mutation Testing Protocol (Protocol # TCR001-002) has been used to identify patients for potential enrollment into this Study Protocol. Subjects who have completed the HLA Typing and Tumor Neoantigen Mutation Testing Protocol, i.e., subjects for whom a TCR matching the subject's somatic mutation(s) and HLA type restriction combination is available in Alaunos' TCR library will be eligible for enrollment on this study.

The Phase I part of this study is a prospective, open-label, dose-escalation study of TCR-T cell drug product in patients with progressive or recurrent solid tumors who have failed standard therapy. The Phase II part is a prospective, open-label, single dose portion of the study. The Phase II part will begin once the MTD/RP2D in the Phase I part has been determined.

Subjects with one of the following histologically confirmed solid tumors will be included:

* Cohort 1: Gynecologic cancer (e.g., ovarian, endometrial)
* Cohort 2: Colorectal cancer
* Cohort 3: Pancreatic cancer
* Cohort 4: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); NSCLC includes but is not limited to squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinomas
* Cohort 5: Cholangiocarcinoma
