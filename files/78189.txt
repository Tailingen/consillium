Melanoma Patients Immunized with Natural DenDritic Cells
The aim of this study is to determine whether adjuvant treatment with nDC vaccination, after complete radical lymph node dissection or sentinel node procedure in stage IIIB and IIIC melanoma patients, improves recurrence-free survival (RFS) as compared to treatment with matching placebo.

Recurrence-free survival rate, The primary objective of this study is to determine whether adjuvant nDC vaccination, after complete radical lymph node dissection or sentinel node procedure in stage IIIB and IIIC melanoma patients, improves 2-year RFS rate as compared to treatment with matching placebo. Defined as the percentage of patients who are alive and without recurrence of melanoma 2 years after randomization., 2 years|Treatment of melanoma patients, Adjuvant treatment with nDC vaccination or placebo, after standard treatment, The primary endpoint, 2-year RFS.

This is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, interventional study of nDC vaccination versus placebo. Dendritic cell-based immunotherapy consists of antigen-loaded autologous DC that are administered to patients with the intention of inducing antigen-specific T and B cell responses and proved safe with minimal side effects. Natural DC (nDC) consist of plasmacytoid DC and myeloid DC. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 and stratified by stage of disease, adjuvant radiotherapy, BRAF mutation status, HLA-type and nDC production centre. The treatment will be continued for a maximum of 1.5 years or until recurrence of disease, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from the study.
