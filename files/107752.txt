Observing the Perioperative Effects of Prehabilitation in Colorectal Cancer Patients
Quality Improvement Project to evaluate how prehabilitation can be incorporated into our colorectal cancer pathway and assess its clinical benefits.
Colon Cancer
OTHER: Prehabilitation
Length of stay, Time spent in hospital, From date of operation to date of discharge in number of days over a 90 day follow up period|Complication rate, All Clavien-Dindo complications, Follow up over a period of 90 days following operation
Anaerobic threshold, Measured by looking at CPET results pre- and post- prehab, CPET performed before prehabilitation and after prehabilitation (median of 36 days)
The aim was to evaluate how prehabilitation (PH) can be incorporated into our colorectal cancer pathway and assess its clinical benefits.

Patients underwent PH (exercise, nutrition and psychological support) before resection of colorectal carcinoma in a DGH over fourteen months. Patients were matched by operation, age, sex and ASA to non-prehabilitation (NPH) patients using a prospectively maintained database. Length of stay (LoS) and complication rate and 90-day readmission rates were compared using Wilcoxon and McNemar's methods.

Prehabilitation significantly improved peak VO2 and AT. This corresponds to a reduction in predicted 30-day mortality. Despite a higher Charlson index LoS was unchanged suggesting prehabilitation may permit safe resection in comorbid patients.
