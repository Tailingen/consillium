This is phase 1/2 study for patients with CLL or (SLL) who have not been previously treated. The primary endpoint is to determine safety and tolerability of the regimen and determine complete response (CR) to therapy. The secondary endpoints will assess the impact of treatment on progression free and overall survival

Eligible patients will receive obinutuzumab for 6 x 28 day cycles. Patients will also receive lenalidomide orally once daily on days 8-28 of each 28 day cycles. The starting dose for all patients is 5 mg PO daily. At the start of each cycle, there is intra-patient dose-escalation to a maximum of 25mg daily, as tolerated.
