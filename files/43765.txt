Economisation of Whipple Resection Using an Ultrasonic Dissection Device
Including 150 randomised patient, the studies aim is to determine whether an economisation and/or improvement in terms of operating time, drainage fluid, blood loss, time of hospitalisation can be found using an ultrasonic dissection device versus traditional surgical methods such as stitches an ligations.The study is performed for patients undergoing partial pancreatoduodenectomy.
