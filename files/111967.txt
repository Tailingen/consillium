A Multi-Center Phase I Study of Intravenous Deforolimus (AP23573, MK-8669) Administered QDX5 Every Other Week in Pediatric Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors (8669-028)(COMPLETED)
Ridaforolimus (Deforolimus, AP23573, MK-8669) is an mTor inhibitor shown to have promising activity in adults with a variety of solid malignancies, particularly the sarcomas. To date, no studies to evaluate appropriate dosing or to obtain pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients have been conducted. Sarcomas are the second most common solid malignancies in children and young adults, and for those patients with recurrent or refractory disease, new therapies are needed. This initial evaluation of ridaforolimus will help define appropriate dosing and toxicity evaluations, as well as establish the first pharmacokinetic and biologic correlative data in pediatric patients treated with ridaforolimus.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: ridaforolimus
To establish the DLT and the MTD of ridaforolimus administered daily x 5 every 14 days in pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory solid tumors, including lymphoma and tumors of the central nervous system., Duration of trial
To determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of ridaforolimus in pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory solid tumors, including tumors of the central nervous system. Screening at Day 1-18, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 15., Duration of trial|To evaluate the safety and efficacy data of ridaforolimus when administered at the MTD or recommended phase II dose and schedule in an expanded cohort of patients when administered daily x 5 every 14 days, Duration of trial|To assess pharmacogenomic parameters from archival tumor specimens that may correlate with response to ridaforolimus., Duration of trial
