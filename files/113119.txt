Induction Chemotherapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer
Over the last 30 years, induction chemotherapy (IC) has become important for the management of patients with locally advanced HNSCC (LAHNSCC), particularly since the introduction of taxanes. The results reported in the TAX 323 and TAX 324 trials indicate that the TPF regimen (docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) improves overall survival comparing with the PF regimen (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil), and the TPF regimen is globally the most accepted induction regimen for the treatment of LAHNSCC.

However, the TPF regimen has been associated with high toxicity rates, and patients frequently decline cisplatin during concurrent radiotherapy and require the use of infusion pumps and a central venous catheter.

Extensive efforts are ongoing to identify alternative schemes that are less toxic than the TPF regimen but are as effective for LAHNSCC and safely allow the use of definitive concurrent treatment based on cisplatin and radiotherapy.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Induction TP chemotherapy|RADIATION: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT)
Tumor response rate, Tumor response was assessed after induction chemotherapy (just before chemoradiotherapy) and 6-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.

Evaluation of tumor response was by clinical examination, nasoendoscopy, and CT or MRI imaging of the primary site and the neck (RECIST criteria 1.1)., At baseline, 2 weeks after the third cycle of IC and 6-8 weeks after the end of radiotherapy
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time of study entry to the date of death., 3 years|Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), Questionnaire of quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) was applied at baseline, before chemoradiotherapy and 60 days following last day of radiotherapy., 2 years|Adverse Events rate, Adverse events were graded according to the expanded common toxicity criteria of the Clinical Trials Group of the National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCI CTCAE v3.0). Laboratory safety data were assessed before the administration of chemotherapy and after treatment., After every cycle of IC, after every cycle of concurrent chemetherapy and up to 8 weeks after the end of radiotherapy|Progression-free survival., Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated as the date of assignment to recurrence/progression or death resulting from any cause. If the patient had no evidence of the aforementioned events, survival was censored at the time of the last documented evaluation of efficacy/contact or death resulting from another cause., 3 years
This non-randomized phase II trial evaluated the safety, feasibility and response rates of concurrent therapy (cisplatin and radiotherapy) after three cycles of an IC regimen based on the combination of cisplatin plus paclitaxel without 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (thereby avoiding infusion pumps and a central venous catheter) in LAHNSCC patients with a high tumor burden.

The patients were stratified by tumor subsite (oropharynx and hypopharynx/larynx) and by tumor resectable status (resectable or irresectable advanced squamous cell).
