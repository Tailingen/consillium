Dysregulation of Whole-body Metabolism in Ovarian Cancer: A Longitudinal Study
Minimal information is available regarding changes in whole-body metabolism in ovarian cancer patients, and no study has assessed whole-body lipid metabolism in this patient population. In this pilot study we will assess fasting and postprandial lipid metabolism of ovarian cancer patients before, during, and after treatment via indirect calorimetry.

Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest gynecological diseases, with a 5-year survival rate of only 49%. It is well established that cancer cells have fundamentally altered metabolism, which contributes to proliferation and metastasis. Recent findings in the field have recognized that lipid metabolism is altered in ovarian cancer cells, with cells utilizing lipids as a primary energy source. Due to the high demand of energy from tumor cells, it's possible that other non-malignant tissues could reprogram their metabolism to create an environment that supports tumor growth. Minimal information is available regarding changes in whole-body metabolism in ovarian cancer patients, and no study has assessed whole-body lipid metabolism in this patient population. In this pilot study we will assess fasting and postprandial lipid metabolism of ovarian cancer patients before, during, and after treatment via indirect calorimetry. Markers of metabolism (e.g. glucose, blood lipids, lactate) will be assessed at each timepoint. This is a clinically significant project as understanding the full scope of dysregulated lipid metabolism in ovarian cancer patients will allow the identification of potential targets for treatment. The primary purpose is to assess feasibility and acceptability of this study protocol designed to collect pilot data and assess the metabolic profile and lipid metabolism of patients with presumed ovarian cancer. The secondary purpose of this project is to collect pilot data and assess the metabolic profile and lipid metabolism of patients with presumed ovarian cancer. A tertiary goal of this project is to collect additional pilot data to better understand the potential link between metabolic health and other factors related to metabolic health among patients with ovarian cancer.
