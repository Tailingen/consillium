A Study of Venetoclax and Alvocidib in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
An open-label, dose-escalation study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK), to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD), and to assess the preliminary efficacy of alvocidib with venetoclax when co-administered in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
DRUG: Venetoclax|DRUG: Alvocidib
Tmax of venetoclax, Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of venetoclax, Approximately 32 days after first dose of study drug|Clearance of Alvocidib, Clearance (CL) of alvocidib, Approximately 32 days after first dose of study drug|AUC0-∞ of Alvocidib, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞) post-dose of alvocidib, Approximately 32 days after first dose of study drug|Cmax of Venetoclax, Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of venetoclax, Approximately 32 days after first dose of study drug|Half-life (t1/2) of Alvocidib, Half-life (t1/2) of alvocidib, Approximately 32 days after first dose of study drug|AUC0-24 Post-dose of Venetoclax, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC24) post-dose of venetoclax., Approximately 32 days after first dose of study drug|Cmax of Alvocidib, Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of alvocidib., Approximately 32 days after first dose of study drug|AUCt Post-dose of Alvocidib, Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUCt) post-dose alvocidib., Approximately 32 days after first dose of study drug|Dose Escalation Phase: Recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) for Venetoclax and Alvocidib, RPTD will be determined using available safety and pharmacokinetics data upon completion of the dose escalation phase., Minimum first cycle of dosing (up to 28 days)
Complete Response (CR) Rate, CR is defined as the proportion of participants with documented complete response (CR) based on International Working Group (IWG) criteria., Up to approximately 8 months|Combined CR Rate, Combined CR rate is defined as CR + CRi (CR with incomplete blood count recovery) based on IWG criteria., Up to approximately 8 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants with documented partial response (PR) or better based on IWG criteria., Up to approximately 18 months
