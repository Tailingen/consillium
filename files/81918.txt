Talactoferrin in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer or Squamous Cell Head and Neck Cancer
This phase I trial studies how well talactoferrin works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or squamous cell head and neck cancer. Biological therapies, such as talactoferrin, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing

BIOLOGICAL: talactoferrin|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Correlation of changes in cytokine composition and other immunologic measurements in tumor, tumor stroma and blood with benefit to talactoferrin, Descriptive statistics and trends in cytokine and immunological parameters both in the tumor biopsies and the blood samples will be summarized., Baseline and weeks 2, 7, 14, 21, and 49
PFS, Duration of time from start of treatment to time of documented progression or death up to at least 12 months|ORR, Baseline and then every 7 weeks|SD, Baseline and then every 7 weeks|OS, Time from the date of enrollment to the date of death due to any cause or the last date the patient was known to be alive (censored observation) at the date of data cutoff for the final analysis up to at least 12 months|Disease stability, Baseline and then every 7 weeks|Disease stability, At 7 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Monitoring of immunologic response to therapy in tumor tissue and peripheral blood. Identification of potential candidate biomarkers indicating clinical benefit to talactoferrin.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), stable disease (SD), overall survival (OS), disease stability, and disease stability at 7 weeks.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive talactoferrin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks. Courses repeat every 14 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for at least 12 months.
