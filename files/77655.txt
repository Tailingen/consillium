The Efficacy of Preventive Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface(RPNI) Reconstruction in Amputees
The trial will be carried out in Peking University People's Hospital. The whole trial will last 3 years. Amputees from orthopedics and vascular surgery will be distributed into two groups randomly and receive different treatments including traditional resection and regenerative peripheral nerve interface(RPNI) surgery.The pain outcome,the impact of post-amputation pain on life and the utilization rate of prostheses will be collected to study the efficacy, safety and prognosis of preventive regenerative peripheral nerve interface reconstruction in amputees.

Investigators believe that RPNI can effectively reduce the incidence of post-amputation pain, reduce the degree of pain, improve the wearing rate of prostheses, and help patients return to normal life.
Amputation Neuroma
PROCEDURE: preventive regenerative peripheral nerve interface reconstruction
postamputation pain, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (NRS, PROMIS) were used to assess postamputation pain.The intensity of pain is described by 11 points from 0 (painless) to 10 (the most severe pain)., 12 weeks at least after surgery
Prosthesis wearing, Whether the subject wears a prosthetic limb, and if so, what kind of prosthetic limb is worn., 12 weeks at least after surgery|Tumor recurrence and metastasis, Whether there is tumor recurrence or metastasis., 12 weeks at least after surgery|Quality of life, The medical outcomes study-short from(MOS-SF 36) is used to evaluate the difference between the RPNIs group and the control group in the quality of life after amputation.The SF-36 scale consists of 36 questions with eight dimensions:physiological function, role-physiological, physical pain, general health, vitality, social function, role-emotional, and mental health. The scoring method was used for each dimension, ranging from 0 to 100 points. The higher the score, the better the health status., 12 weeks at least after surgery
