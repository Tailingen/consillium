First-line Therapy in Metastatic PDAC
The overarching hypothesis of this trial is that the NAPOLI regimen and alternating cycles of NAPOLI and mFOLFOX6 (seq-NAPOLI-FOLFOX) are superior to the current standard of care gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. Furthermore, we propose that the NAPOLI regimen and seq-NAPOLI-FOLFOX display favourable safety profiles and allow for longer first line treatment and higher rate of transition into the second line setting.

Type of second line therapy will be recorded in a descriptive manner based on available health records., 60 months|Duration of second-line chemotherapy, Second Line Therapy III, 60 months|Quality of life as assessed by EORTC-QLQ-C30, Quality of life will be assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ).

The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale.

All of the scales ands ingle-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.

Scoring is done based on the following document: EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual, 60 months
Molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer as predictors of response to chemotherapy, Translational 1, 60 months|Evaluation of radiologic early tumor shrinkage, ETS will be assessed after 8 weeks of treatment.

Early tumour shrinkage (ETS) will be analysed based on sum of longest diameters of target lesions (SLD).

Shrinkage will be classified as ETS (shrinkage by ≥20%), mETS (minor shrinkage by 0% - \<20%), mPD (minor progression by \>0% - \<20%), PD (progression by ≥20% or new lesion).

In all caculations, shrinkage will be expressed as a positive denominator., 60 months|Evaluation of radiologic depth of response, Radiologic depth of response is (DpR) is defined as the percentage of tumour shrinkage, based on sum of longest diameters of target lesions (SLD) observed at the lowest point (nadir) compared with baseline imaging.

Tumour shrinkage (TS) will be classified as: (shrinkage by ≥20%), mTS (minor shrinkage by 0% - \<20%), mPD (minor progression by \>0% - \<20%), PD (progression by ≥20% or new lesion).

In all caculations, shrinkage will be expressed as a positive denominator., 60 months|Kinetics of circulating tumor DNA during first-line chemotherapy, Translational 1

Circulating tumour DNA will be assessed through polymerase chain reaction based techniques and the concentration will be denominated as "ng/mL of plasma". Samples will be collected at the start of each cycle to allow for the detection of changing concentrations during first-line treatment., 60 months
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains an almost uniformly lethal disease. Although there has been significant progress in understanding of the underlying molecular biology of pancreatic cancer, this progress has not translated into substantially better outcome.

Alarmingly, the number of pancreatic cancer cases is constantly rising and pancreatic cancer will be the second most frequent cause of cancer related death by 2030.

Accordingly, novel therapeutic strategies for patients with pancreatic cancer are desperately needed.

Recently, the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel proofed to be superior when compared to single agent gemcitabine (overall survival \[OS\] 8.7 months in the nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine group versus 6.6 months in the gemcitabine group; hazard ratio for death, 0.72; 95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.62 to 0.83; P\<0.001). Consequently, this combination therapy is now regarded as a standard treatment option for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and should therefore serve as control for future clinical studies.

Furthermore, the combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) was found to be more effective in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer when compared to gemcitabine monotherapy (overall survival 11.1 month in the FOLFIRINOX group versus 6.8 months in the gemcitabine group - hazard ratio for death, 0.57; 95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.45 to 0.73; P\<0.001). However, this increased activity came at the cost of higher treatment-related side effects.

Recently, the NAPOLI-1 trial yielded promising results for the combination of liposomal irinotecan (nal-Iri) in combination with 5-FU/folinic acid (FA) in patients pretreated with a gemcitabine-based first-line regimen.

Finally, Phase II data show promising efficacy and favorable toxicity with conventional FOLFIRI.3 in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.

Furthermore, studies in colorectal cancer demonstrated a comparable efficacy and favorable toxicity when comparing conventional FOLFOXIRI (+ bevacizumab) and sequential FOLFOXIRI (alternating FOLFOX and FOLFIRI) in combination with bevacizumab.

With these novel treatment options at hand it is imperative to define the optimal first-line treatment modality in order to allow for an optimized treatment sequence to ensure for maximal success with acceptable toxicity.
