This study is a single center, open, dose increasing and dose expanding phase I clinical study. The dose increasing method of "3 + 3" is used to explore the safety, tolerance and PK characteristics of BAT4706 injection in patients with advanced solid tumors. After the completion of dose increment, 1-2 tolerated doses were selected for extended research on melanoma (20-40 cases), so as to provide recommended doses for subsequent clinical trials.
