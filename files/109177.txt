Study of JDQ443 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring the KRAS G12C Mutation
This is a phase Ib/II open label study. The escalation part will characterize the safety and tolerability of JDQ443 single agent and JDQ443 in combination with the other study treatments (TNO155 and tislelizumab) in advanced solid tumor patients. After the determination of the maximum tolerated dose / recommended dose for a particular treatment arm, dose expansion will assess the anti-tumor activity and further assess the safety, tolerability, and PK/PD of each regimen at the maximum tolerated dose / recommended dose or lower dose.
