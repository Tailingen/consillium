Biliary Interventions in Critically Ill Patients With Secondary Sclerosing Cholangitis (BISCIT)
This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trial. Patients with confirmed secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC-CIP) will be randomized either in the intervention group undergoing scheduled invasive evaluation of the biliary tract or in the control group treated with non-interventional standard of care to demonstrate that programmed endoscopic therapy compared to a conservative strategy reduces the occurrence of treatment failures.

PROCEDURE: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC)
