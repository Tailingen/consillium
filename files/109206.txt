Intraperitoneal Docetaxel in Combination With mFOLFOX6 for Gastric Cancer Patients With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
This is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled Phase 1 study of intraperitoneal docetaxel in combination with systemic mFOLFOX6 for patients who have gastric cancer with gross peritoneal carcinomatosis (GC-PC).
Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
DRUG: Intraperitoneal docetaxel
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal docetaxel in conjunction with the standard of care treatment regimen of intravenous mFOLFOX6 in patients with primary gastric cancer with gross peritoneal carcinomatosis, 20 weeks
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival rate at 20 weeks, which is defined as the percentage of patients alive and free of disease progression at 20 weeks., 20 weeks
Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States and has a five-year survival of 40% after surgical resection. Metastatic gastric cancer has an even poorer prognosis and most patients die within the first year of diagnosis. Most patients are diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease due to non-specific or lack of symptomatology and treatment options are then limited to systemic chemotherapy. The peritoneum is the most frequent site of metastasis as well as cancer recurrence. Peritoneal Carcinomatosis (PC) results in adverse clinical sequelae and is ultimately responsible for 60% of all gastric cancer-related deaths. While visceral metastases originating from primary gastric cancer are relatively chemosensitive, peritoneal carcinomatosis is particularly challenging to treat because of inadequate drug delivery from systemic circulation. The primary purpose of this trial is to determine the safety of administering intraperitoneal docetaxel in conjunction with the standard of care treatment regimen of intravenous mFOLFOX6 (5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) in patients with primary gastric cancer with gross peritoneal carcinomatosis.
