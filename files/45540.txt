This is a single-center, open, one-arm, dose-escalation study to observe the safety and efficacy of cord blood-derived dualCAR-NK19/70 cells in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.9-18 patients are planned to be enrolled in the dose-escalation trial (2×10\^6 cells/kg, 4×10\^6 cells/kg, 8×10\^6 cells/kg) . Each dose was given once a week for 3 weeks.The primary endpoints are DLT, MTD, and the second endpionts are the overall response rates (CR and PR), overall survival, and progression-free survival. Based on the results in the dose-escalation trial, the recommended dose will be determined. Another 30 patients will be enrolled to estimate the safety and efficacy of CB CAR-NK019 under the best dose.
