Characterization of the Autofluorescence of Healthy and Pathological Tissues of Vocal Cords
The aim of this clinical trial is to provide information about autofluorescence of pathological versus healthy vocal folds tissues.

Experimentations are performed on vocal folds biopsies obtained from patients, surgered at ENT department, university hospital of Besançon. After being extracted, samples of vocal folds are submitted to excitations at 365 nm, 405 nm and 450 nm; light spectral absorptions are measured, and results are compared to reference anatomopathology.
