The Reproducibility of Microvascular Flow Imaging in Fibroids and Its Correlation With 2D and 3D Power Doppler Outcomes
The investigators hypothesized that Macrovascular Flow imaging could contribute to 2D power Doppler and 3D power Doppler in depicting fibroid vascularity. However, data concerning the feasibility and reproducibility of Macrovascular Flow imaging is lacking. Therefore the purpose of our study was to determine 1) the reproducibility of Macrovascular Flow imaging, 2) its correlation with 2D and 3D power Doppler, and 3) penetration depth, in order to investigate the added value for daily clinical practice.
Fibroid Uterus
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: microvascular flow imaging
reproducibility by inter- and intraobserver agreement, The primary outcome was calculated by the assessment of intercorrelation coefficient (ICC) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using a two-way mixed model. An ICC value of 0.75-1.00 indicates a good to excellent agreement(19). Bland-Altman plots showed the distribution of data., Day 1
penetration in centimeters, The penetration was measured along the direction of the ultrasound wave, from the probe to the deepest ultrasound signal visible, both for Microvascular Flow and power Doppler. Differences in ordinal data was tested by Mann Whitney U, non-normal continuous data by Wilcoxon rank test and normally distributed continuous data by a one sample t-test., Day 1|architecture, architecture of vessels visible in different regions yes/no., Day 1|presence doppler signal, yes/no in different regions, Day 1
