Pre-operative Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy for Esophageal Carcinoma
Surgery (esophagectomy or removal of the esophagus)has been the standard treatment for cancer of the esophagus. However, evidence suggests that preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy may add benefit. The purpose of this study is to determine if a treatment program of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy prior to surgery and chemotherapy after surgery will delay or eliminate recurrence of the cancer.
