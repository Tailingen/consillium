Management of Imatinib-associated Severe Skin Rash in Patients With Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor
To achieve optimal clinical outcomes with imatinib in GIST patients, it is crucial to maintain standard imatinib dose. Skin rash is a relatively common and sometimes severe adverse event of imatinib in GIST patients and may affect imatinib compliance. Our previous retrospective study suggested that severe skin rash induced by imatinib can be managed by systemic steroid without imatinib dose interruption or reduction. This phase II study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of systemic steroid in GIST patients with imatinib-associated severe skin rash.

treatment success rate, Treatment success was defined as maintaining imatinib without persistence or recurrence of skin rash requiring 1) additional systemic steroid treatment, and 2) interruption or dose reduction of imatinib., 2 years
