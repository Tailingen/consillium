ME-344 Given in Combination With Hycamtin® in Patients With Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of ME-344 when given in combination with Hycamtin® in patients with solid tumors
Solid Tumors
DRUG: ME-344|DRUG: Topotecan
Number of Adverse Events, The AE Profile will be determined by the number of AEs regardless of severity, Through study completion- an average of 2 years|Number of Serious Adverse Events, The SAE Profile will be determined by the number of SAEs, Through study completion- an average of 2 years
Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of ME-344 in combination with topotecan, Cycle 1 Day 1, at 0, .5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours post-dose and Day 15 at 0 and end of infusion|Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration for ME-344 (Tmax), Various pharmacokinetic parameters for ME-344 in plasma were calculated based on the plasma concentration data., Cycle 1 Day 1, at 0, .5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours post-dose and Day 15 at 0 and end of infusion|Minimum Plasma Concentration (Cmin) of ME-344, Various pharmacokinetic parameters for ME-344 in plasma were calculated based on the plasma concentration data., Cycle 1 Day 1, at 0, .5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours post-dose and Day 15 at 0 and end of infusion|Mean Terminal Half-life (t 1/2), Various pharmacokinetic parameters for ME-344 in plasma were calculated based on the plasma concentration data., Cycle 1 Day 1, at 0, .5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours post-dose and Day 15 at 0 and end of infusion|Estimate Overall Response Rate for ME-344 Given in Combination With Topotecan, Overall response rate was defined as the total number of patients with Complete Response plus Partial Response. All efficacy assessments were to include a baseline assessment and follow-up assessments at a minimum of every 8 weeks for the first 6 cycles, then every 12 weeks thereafter, while receiving study drug. Tumor response and progression-free survival were assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria or GCIG criteria for CA-125 levels., Response was assessed throughout the trial up to 13 months|Estimate the Overall Survival (OS), 41 subjects were analysed. Overall survival is defined as the first day of study drug administration to death., Up to 2 years
