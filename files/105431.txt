Role of Neutrophils and Electro-bioluminescence in the Rehabilitation
The clinical study is to find out the effect of a course of immunomodulatory drugs and detoxification scheme on finger bioelectroluminescence and neutrophil function and their correlation with changes in quality of life and life expectancy in patients with malignant diseases against the background of restorative treatment and rehabilitation.

Questions:

1. does the quality of life of patients with lung cancer change with the use of a course of immunomodulatory drugs and detoxification scheme?
2. does phagocytosis function, liposomal activity, mitochondrial function of neutrophils change against the background of the course?
3. does bioluminescence of fingers of hands change against the background of the course of immunotherapy? Participants will take Calcitreol capsules, Magnesium B-6 capsules, products containing quercetin flavonoids, Naderin (sodium deoxeribonucleate) daily for 21 days. before the course, after the course and after one year they will answer the QLQ-LC13, WHOQOL BREF, L.H. Garkavi adaptation self-assessment questionnaire and give blood for laboratory analysis of neutrophil function assessment.

Every year, 36,000 new cases of oncology are detected in Kazakhstan, and 14,150 people (39.3%) die from oncology in Kazakhstan each year. The lowest five-year survival rate for patients with lung cancer is 12.6%. Today, an important criterion in choosing a treatment method for oncologic diseases is the level of quality of life corresponding to the treatment performed. To assess this level, special questionnaires and scales are also developed, for example, QLQ-C30 (the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 version 3.0), which appeared thanks to the separation and expansion of the GHRQL (global health-related quality of life) questionnaire. In addition to quality of life, it is very important to improve life expectancy by increasing the adaptive reserves of the organism and preventing complications. To achieve this goal it is necessary to conduct oncologic rehabilitation and course reconstructive therapy for patients with lung cancer with prevention of fiborosis development. To assess the quality of life in dynamics, it is necessary to interview patients using international questionnaires. And for objective assessment of changes in adaptation reserves it is planned to check the effectiveness of the method of functional assessment of neutrophils, bioelectroluminescence in comparison with the generally recognized neutrophil/lymphocyte index. Important in the work is the mutual control of the obtained clinical indicators with the patient's experience and his assessment of changes in the quality of life on the background of the received therapy. The expected result of the study is an increase in the average annual survival rate of patients and improved quality of life. Creation of a responsive health care system to the needs of patients.

Scientific novelty: previously such studies have not been conducted in Kazakhstan.
