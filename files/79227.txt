A Study of Immunotherapy Treatment in People With Sarcoma
The purpose of this study is to collect information from participants' medical records to improve our knowledge about immunotherapy use and how effective it is as a treatment for people with sarcoma. Immunotherapy drugs boost the immune system's ability to fight cancer by blocking proteins that act as a "brake" on the immune system. Blocking these proteins is like releasing the brakes, so that the immune system can target cancer cells and destroy them. This action is sometimes described as "immune checkpoint blockade.
Sarcoma
To collect real-world observational clinical, radiographic, and molecular features, of sarcoma patients treated with ICB, as documented in medical records, to improve knowledge about immunotherapy use and efficacy in sarcoma. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the overall study population and their clinicopathologic characteristics using median, interquartile range and range, frequency and/or percentages., up to 5 years
