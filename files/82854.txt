A Study of HRS7415 Tablets in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors
This study is a multicenter, open phase I clinical study of dose escalation and dose extension of HRS7415 in subjects with advanced malignant tumors. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of HRS7415 tablets.
