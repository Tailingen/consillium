NEPC Study: An Exploratory Safety and Efficacy Study With PSMA, SSTR2 and GRPR Targeted Radioligand Therapy in Metastatic Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in the expression of treatment targets on the surface of tumor cells (Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), Somatostatin Receptor 2 (SSTR2), and Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor (GRPR) between the start and after the completion of radioligand therapy (RLT). Study will use radioligand imaging (RLI) to determine predominantly expressed target on the surface of tumor cells. Based on predominant expression of target, corresponding RLT targeting PSMA, SSTR2, or GRPR RLT will be given for up to 6 cycles every 6 weeks as intravenous (i.v.) injection in participants with metastatic neuroendocrine prostate cancer (mNEPC).

The screening period for each subject includes imaging with 3 radioligand imaging (RLI) compounds to assess expression level of PSMA, SSTR2 and GRPR. Participants will be assigned to the radioligand treatment (RLT) corresponding to their predominantly expressed target based on blinded independent central review (BICR). During the treatment period, participants will receive up to 6 cycles of the assigned RLT, corresponding to a total dose of 44.4 GBq (+/-10%) for \[177Lu\]Lu-PSMA-617 or \[177Lu\]Lu-DOTA-TATE , and 55.5 GBq (+/-10%) for \[177Lu\]Lu-NeoB. No crossover to a different type of RLT is allowed.

At end of treatment (EoT) with RLT, participants will be scanned again with the 3 RLIs. All EoT PET/CT scans should be performed using the same PET/CT camera, acquisition and reconstruction protocols as used for screening PET/CT for the participant.

The post-treatment follow-up period consists of a 42-days post EoT safety follow-up visit and long-term follow-up until radiographic disease progression, death, lost to follow-up or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first.

The planned duration of treatment is up to 36 weeks for all treatment arms in this study, with treatment given every 6 weeks. Participants may be discontinued from treatment earlier due to unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, and/or at the discretion of the Investigator or the participant.
