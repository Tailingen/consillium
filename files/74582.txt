A Safety and Efficacy Study to Evaluate Luspatercept in Subjects With Myeloproliferative Neoplasm-associated Myelofibrosis Who Have Anemia With and Without Red Blood Cell-transfusion Dependence
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of luspatercept in subjects with MPN-associated myelofibrosis and anemia with and without RBC-transfusion dependence. The study is divided into a Screening Period, a Treatment Period (consisting of a Primary Phase, a Day 169 Disease Response Assessment, and an Extension Phase), followed by a Posttreatment Follow-up Period.
Primary Myelofibrosis|Anemia
DRUG: Luspatercept
The Number of Participants With Anemia Responses Over Any 84-Day Period During the Primary Treatment Period, The number of participants that achieved anemia response as it relates to hemoglobin (Hgb) increase and red blood cell (RBC)-transfusion independence is defined below:

Cohorts 1 (anemia only) and 3A: The number of participants achieving ≥ 1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline over any consecutive 84-day period without an RBC transfusion from Day 1 up through and including Day 168.

Cohorts 2 (RBC-transfusion dependent) and 3B: The number of participants who become RBC-transfusion free over any consecutive 84-day period from Day 1 up through and including Day 168.

Baseline value is defined as the last value (including "unscheduled") measured on or before the first dose., Any consecutive "rolling" 84-day period from Day 1 through and including Day 168
Time to Anemia Response During the Primary Treatment Period, Time to anemia response follows the definitions below:

Cohorts 1 (anemia only) and 3A: Time between first administration of luspatercept and the first hemoglobin increase of ≥ 1.5 g/dL from baseline that starts a consecutive 84-day period of consecutive increase ≥ 1.5 g/dL without RBC transfusions.

Cohorts 2 (RBC-transfusion dependent) and 3B: Time between first administration of luspatercept and the first day of an RBC transfusion-free period of 84 days.

Baseline value is defined as the last value (including "unscheduled") measured on or before the first dose., From first dose up to first onset of anemia response (calculated from Day 1 through and including Day 168)|Duration of Anemia Response, The duration of anemia response is defined as the duration of time from first day of longest response to the last day of longest response. Participants who achieved and maintained the anemia response at the time of the analysis are censored at the efficacy cutoff date. For Cohorts 1 and 3A, an anemia responder was defined as a subject with ≥ 1.5 g/dL hemoglobin increase from baseline over any consecutive 84-day period without an RBC transfusion. For Cohorts 2 and 3B, an anemia responder was defined as a subject who becomes RBC transfusion free over any consecutive 84-day period.

Baseline value is defined as the last value (including "unscheduled") measured on or before the first dose., From first dose through last day of longest response (calculated from Day 1 through end of treatment, up to approximately 232 weeks)|The Number of RBC Units Transfused Per Participant Per 28 Days (Cohorts 2 and 3B Only), Frequency of RBC transfusion is defined as the mean number of RBC units transfused per participant every 4 weeks (28 days). The primary treatment period is from Day 1 to and including Day 168. The entire treatment period is from Day 1 through the end of treatment., From Day 1 through end of treatment (up to approximately 232 weeks).|The Number Participants Achieving >=50% RBC Transfusion Burden Reduction From Baseline Over Any 84-Day Period (Cohorts 2 and 3B Only), The number of participants who reduce their transfusion burden by ≥ 50% from baseline over any consecutive 84-day period. Baseline is defined as average number of RBC units per 28 days over the 84 days period on or prior to the C1D1 date. The primary treatment period is from Day 1 to and including Day 168. The entire treatment period is from Day 1 through the end of treatment., Baseline and from Day 1 through end of treatment (up to approximately 232 weeks).|The Number of Participants Who Achieve ≥ 50% Reduction in Fatigue Symptom as Measured by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score (MPN-SAF TSS), Symptoms response improvement will be assessed using the number of participants who achieve ≥ 50% reduction in fatigue symptoms. Fatigue is 1 out of 10 total symptoms scored on a 0 (absent/as good as it can be) to 10 (worst imaginable/as bad as it can be).

The primary treatment period is from Day 1 to and including Day 168. The entire treatment period is from Day 1 through the end of treatment. Baseline is defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug.

Last Available = Last available assessment on or before the end of the treatment period.

Mean = Mean value of the weekly assessments over the treatment period., Baseline and from Day 1 through end of treatment (up to approximately 232 weeks)|The Number of Participants Who Achieve ≥ 50% Reduction in Total Symptom Score (TSS) as Measured by the Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom Score (MPN-SAF TSS), TSS includes 10 items - worst fatigue, concentration, early satiety, inactivity, night sweats, itching, bone pain, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and fevers, scored on a 0 (absent/as good as it can be) to 10 (worst imaginable/as bad as it can be). For participants who completed at least six of these 10 items, the MPN-SAF TSS was computed as the average of the observed items multiplied by 10 to achieve a 0-to-100 scale. The MPN-SAF TSS thus had a possible range of 0 to 100.

The primary treatment period is from Day 1 to and including Day 168. The entire treatment period is from Day 1 through the end of treatment. Baseline is defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug.

Last Available = Last available assessment on or before the end of the treatment period.

Mean = Mean value of the weekly assessments over the treatment period., Baseline and from Day 1 through end of treatment (up to approximately 232 weeks)|Mean Changes in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anemia (FACT-An) Total Scores Over the Study Compared to Baseline, The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anemia (FACT-An) questionnaire includes 47 items rating on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) on five primary subscales:

* Physical well-being (sum of 7 items, score range from 0-28)
* Social/Family well-being (sum of 7 items, score range from 0-28)
* Emotional well-being (sum of 6 items, score range from 0-24)
* Functional well-being (sum of 7 items, score range from 0-28)
* Anemia-related symptoms (sum of 20 items, score range from 0-80)

A total score for the FACT-An can be calculated by summing the five primary subscales with a score range from 0-188. Higher scores representing better quality of life. Baseline is defined as the last value on or before the first dose of study drug., Day 169 and End of treatment (up to approximately 232 weeks)|Mean Change in EQ-5D-5L Utility Score Compared to Baseline, The European Quality of Life 5D-5L Scale (EQ-5D-5L) assesses general health-related quality of life. Health is defined in 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Responses are coded so that a '1' indicates no problem, and '5' indicates the most serious problem. The responses for the 5 dimensions are combined in a 5-digit number. The EQ-5D-5L health utility index for this analysis will be derived using the United Kingdom (UK) value sets based on UK time trade-off (TTO) valuation techniques and will use the Decision Support Unit (DSU) model to cross-walk to the EQ-5D-3L value set from the UK to derive a single index value. The EQ-5D-3L health utility index based on the UK population weights range from -0.594 to 1.0 with higher scores indicating higher health utility., Day 169 and End of treatment (up to approximately 232 weeks)|The Number of Participants Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE), TEAE is defined as any AEs that begin or worsen on or after the day of the first dose. An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that: results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or constitutes an important medical event.
