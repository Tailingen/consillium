Hypofractionated Radiotherapy Versus Stereotactic Irradiation With Hyaluronic Acid
The present randomized, open, multicentric Phase II trial, in parallel groups with two arms of treatment, compares the treatment A, moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy of 62Gy, to treatment B, stereotactic irradiation of 37.5 Gy with hyaluronic acid injection in the space between the prostate and the rectum to preserve the rectal-wall from high doses of irradiation. The study aims to assess the rates of late urinary toxicities of grade ≥ 2 induced by a moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy (62Gy in 20 fractions of 3.1Gy) and by a stereotactic radiotherapy (37.5Gy in 5 fractions of 7.5Gy), and the rectal toxicities after an injection of hyaluronic acid between the rectal wall and the prostate.

Ninety-six patients and 9 centers are included in the protocol.
