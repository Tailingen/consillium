Nivolumab in Treating Patients With Primary Myelofibrosis, Post-Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis, or Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis
This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with primary myelofibrosis, post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis, or post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

Objective Response Rate, Defined as Complete Remission + Partial Remission + Clinical Improvement, Responses will be categorized according to the revised International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment and European LeukmiaNet consensus criteria for myelofibrosis., 14 weeks (after 8 doses of therapy)
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the efficacy/clinical activity of nivolumab in patients with myelofibrosis (MF).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the safety of nivolumab in patients with MF.

TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To explore time to response and duration of response. II. To assess changes in symptom burden. III. To explore changes in bone marrow fibrosis. IV. To explore changes in Janus kinase 2 valine at amino acid position 617 (JAK2V617F) (or other molecular marker) allele burden or changes in cytogenetic abnormalities.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once every 2 weeks for 8 doses and then once every 12 weeks thereafter. Treatment may continue for up to 4 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 100 days.
