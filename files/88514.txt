Study to Investigate the Absorption, Metabolism and Excretion of [14C] ASP2215 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 14C-labeled gilteritinib, in particular, the routes of excretion and extent of metabolism of gilteritinib following administration of a single dose of 14C-labeled gilteritinib after repeated doses of gilteritinib.

This study will also evaluate the safety of repeated oral administration of gilteritinib in subjects with advanced solid tumors as well as identify the metabolic profile of gilteritinib in plasma, urine and feces after a single oral dose of 14C-labeled gilteritinib.
