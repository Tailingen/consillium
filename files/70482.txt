Comparing SonoVue With Sonazoid Using CEUS-LIRADS in HCC
The new version of CEUS LI-RADS published at 2018(version 2017). In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the diagnosing performance of CEUS LI-RADS by administrating different contrast agents (SonoVue/ Sonazoid).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Cirrhosis
DRUG: Sonovue and Sonazoid|DRUG: Sonazoid and Sonovue
CEUS LI-RADS Grades of SonoVue and Sonazoid agents in enrolled patients., CEUS LI-RADSÂ® v2017 which is published by ACR is a standardized system for technique, interpretation, reporting, and data collection for contrast-enhanced ultrasound exams in patients at risk for developing HCC., 6 months
The sensitivity and specificity of CEUS-LI-RADS by different contrast agencies., The sensitivity and specificity are calculated using parameters such as ture postive, false positive, Ture negative, false negetive., 6 months
Independent radiologists from department of ultrasound will report their diagnosing results according to CEUS LI-RADS version 2017 without getting any information about patients. The researcher of this subject will collect all results and evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS LI-RADS and the diagnosing performance with different contrast agents.
