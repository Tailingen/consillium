131I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory Neuroblastoma
This expanded access is the best available therapy/compassionate use designed to determine the palliative benefit and toxicity of 131I-MIBG in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma who are not eligible for therapies of higher priority. Patients may receive a range of doses depending on stem cell availability and tumor involvement of bone marrow. Response rate, toxicity, and time to progression and death will be evaluated.

DRUG: 131 I-Metaiodobenzylguanidine|DRUG: Potassium Iodide|DRUG: G-csf
Primary Objective is to provide access to therapy with 131I-MIBG for patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma.

Secondary Objectives are to (1) assess disease response to 131I-MIBG therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma; (2) gain more information about the toxicities of 131I-MIBG therapy; and (3) assess improvement of symptoms, including pain and fatigue, for patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma or metastatic pheochromocytoma who are receiving 131I-MIBG therapy.
