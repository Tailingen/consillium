Neoantigen Derived DCs as Cancer Treatment
Tumor lysate or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) derived DCs-based therapy is safe and can elicites remarkable T-cell responses but mostly did not really transfer into significant clinical benefit. One possible reason is the lack of effective antigen and the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Now we are exploring another new strategy, prediction of neoantigen for priming DCs as cell-based therapy with or without booster of anti-VEGF/anti-PD-1.

Number of subjects experienced limiting toxicities in the first 6 weeks., The following toxicities that happened during first 6 weeks are considered LTs. Toxicities are graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0:

* \>=Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity
* \>=Grade 4 hematological toxicity
* Any death not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes.
* Any case meeting Hy's law
* Recurrent grade 2 pneumonitis, 6 weeks
Percentage of patients who had a clinical response, Response was assessed by the iRECIST., 1 year|Number of participants who did not progressed or survived at 1 year, 1 year progression-free survival and overall survival rate, 1 year|Number of subjects experienced any ≥ grade 3 toxicities., any ≥ grade 3 toxicities rate, 1 year
Number of subjects experienced immune response, The production of IFN-γ that occurs subsequent to the dendritic cells-based therapy as determined by ELISPOT Assay or Flow Cytometry Analysis. Other immune response biomarker study including but not limited to whole exome sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing and single cell RNA sequencing., 1 year
The human immune system can recognize and destroy cancer cells but cancer cells are capable of escaping from immune system by different ways, including the PD-1/PDL-1 axis and the VEGF signaling pathway. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis represents an adaptive immune resistance mechanism exerted by tumor cells. Previous study also revealed VEGF-A could induce tumor-associated macrophages, Treg cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment that prevent the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and inhibit the activation of NK cells and T cells. Our research group already completed some early phase clinical trials of DCs-based therapy, which illustrated tumor lysate or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) derived DCs-based therapy is feasible and safe in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and lung cancer, respectively. However, although DCs-based therapy elicited remarkable T-cell responses but mostly did not really transfer into significant clinical benefit in previous study. One possible reason is the lack of effective antigen and the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Now we are exploring another new strategy, prediction of neoantigen for priming DCs as cell-based therapy with or without booster of anti-VEGF/anti-PD-1.
