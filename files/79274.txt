Men With Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated With Either Sipuleucel-T (Provenge®), Abiraterone Acetate (Zytiga®) or Enzalutamide (Xtandi®) Undergoing Cardiopulmonary EXercise Testing
This is a pilot exercise physiology and quality of life study of subjects receiving standard of care therapy for their prostate cancer using FDA-approved drugs per their labeling (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or sipuleucel-T). Subjects with progressive, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC scheduled to be treated with either enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate for ≥3 months or a course of sipuleucel-T will be allocated to one of the treatments arms, according to the treatment chosen by the treating physician.
