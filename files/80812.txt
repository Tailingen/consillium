Adjuvant Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Versus Adjuvant Systemic Chemotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine that adjuvant systemic chemotherapy is superior to adjuvant transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE) in prolonging recurrence free survival（RFS） in patients after radical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma.
