Efficacy and Safety of CO2 vs Room Air Insufflation During ESD for Gastric Tumor
Insufflation is essential procedure to observe the lumen of gastrointestinal tract in gastroscopy or colonoscopy Currently, most of hospital in Korea are using room air for insufflation According to recent clinical studies have shown that carbon dioxide have better safe and reduce stomachache than room air when endoscopy and endoscopic procedure is performed.

However, there was still no research data or study in Korea. In this study, the investigators will try to make comparison between Carbon dioxide and room air insufflation for endoscopic submucosal dissection for Gastric Tumor and investigate the efficacy and safety
Gastric Tumor
PROCEDURE: CO2 or room air insufflation during ESD for gastric tumor
Abdominal pain related to each insufflation, Patients will be received questionnaire (100mm visual analogue scale, VAS) and record their score in 0, 1, 3, 6, 24 hours after endoscopic procedure., 1 day
Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, The investigators will check the side effect during and after pocedure. If any side effect occur, the investigators will stop the procedure and act right away., 1 day
