177Lu-DOTATATE for Recurrent Meningioma
Novel treatments are urgently needed for meningiomas progressing after local therapies (surgery, radiotherapy). So far, no effective systemic therapies are known in this situation. The LUMEN-1 trial will investigate in a prospective randomized trial the efficacy of the precision medicine "theranostic" concept of combining diagnostic patient selection using PET-based molecular imaging and target-specific therapeutic intervention using a systemically administered radioligand.

The rationale for the LUMEN-1 trial is based on the following: (a) high somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression in meningiomas, (b) wide-spread availability of clinically established SSTR-PET imaging, (c) proven efficacy of SSTR-targeting radioligand therapy using \[177Lu\]Lu-DOTATATE in another tumor type (neuroendocrine tumors), and (d) promising experiences with \[177Lu\]Lu-DOTATATE therapy in compassionate use applications and retrospective case series and interim results from one ongoing uncontrolled prospective trial in meningiomas. LUMEN-1 is the first randomized clinical trial to investigate \[177Lu\]Lu-DOTATATE therapy in refractory meningioma and may open new avenues for treatment and research in this area.
Recurrent Meningioma
DRUG: Local standard of Care|DRUG: 177Lu-DOTATATE
Progression Free Survival (PFS), To examine whether \[177Lu\]Lu-DOTATATE demonstrates sufficient antitumor activity in patients with recurrent meningioma to justify further investigation. Progression-free survival computed based on MRI-based RANO meningioma response criteria as assessed by the local investigator., From the date of randomization till the date of disease progression or death (time till death is up to 2 years after patient enrolment in the study)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS), OS probability at 6 (OS6) and 12 months (OS12), median OS (mOS), From the date of randomization till the date of death (time till death is up to 2 years after patient enrolment in the study)|Radiological response rate, Best overall response (BOR, defined as CR, MR or PR during study treatment) rate. Complete response (CR) rate is computed by MRI based RANO meningioma response criteria as assessed by the local investigator., From the date of randomization till the date of disease progression or death (time till death is up to 2 years after patient enrolment in the study)|Radiological response rate, Median best overall response (BOR, defined as CR, MR or PR during study treatment) duration. Median complete response (CR) duration is computed by MRI based RANO meningioma response criteria as assessed by the local investigator., From the date of randomization till the date of disease progression or death (time till death is up to 2 years after patient enrolment in the study)|The magnitude of change in Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), The magnitude of change in HRQoL in terms of global health status from EORTC QLQ-C30 during treatment., From the date of randomization regardless of progression status up to 2 years after patient enrolment in the study.|The magnitude of change in Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), The magnitude of change in HRQoL in terms of physical functioning from EORTC QLQ-C30 during treatment., From the date of randomization regardless of progression status up to 2 years after patient enrolment in the study.|The magnitude of change in Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), The magnitude of change in HRQoL in terms of motor disfunction from EORTC QLQ-BN20 during treatment., From the date of randomization regardless of progression status up to 2 years after patient enrolment in the study.|Neurological function (NANO scale), Change of neurological function (NANO scale) from baseline during study treatment., From the date of randomization regardless of progression status up to 2 years after patient enrolment in the study.|Toxicity According to CTCAE Version 5.0, This study will use the International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0), From the date of randomization regardless of progression status up to 2 years after patient enrolment in the study.
