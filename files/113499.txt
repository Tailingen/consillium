An Open-label, Single-arm, Multicenter Phase II Clinical Study： Evaluating RC48-ADC Combined With Triplizumab in the Neoadjuvant Treatment of Her2-positive Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer.It's arm to evaluate the neoadjuvant treatment of Her2-positive Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer in patients with objective response rate (ORR),Duration of response (DoR) , progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.
Neoadjuvant Treatment of Her2-positive Muscle-invasive Bladder Cance
DRUG: RC48- ADC
Pathological response (PaR) rate, Pathological response (PaR) rate per central pathology review, Up to approximately 6 months|recommended dose for phase II safety (RP2D), tolerability, Up to approximately 6 months|Incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, safety, Up to approximately 6 months
The pathological complete response, The pathological complete response rate refers to all target lesions disappear, Up to approximately 6 months|Progression free survival, Follow-up was made after the first month after the operation, and then with an every three months until the tumor relapsed or progress, Up to approximately 24 months|Overall survival, The time from start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause, Up to approximately 48 months|Duration of response, This is the time from when the tumor begins to respond to treatment until the disease gets worse, Up to approximately 24 months
Objective response rate (ORR), Duration of response (DoR) (according to RECIST 1.1 Standard Edition)，progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life (QoL)and safety. Evaluation once every 2 weeks before cystectomy, If the efficacy results of the evaluation are complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), confirmed imaging efficacy at 9 weeks after the initial assessment ， efficacy evaluation time window of ± 14 days.
