ABemaciclib, ET ± paclItaxel in aGgressive HR+/HER2- MBC trIaL
This is a multicenter, randomized, 2 arm, open label, phase II study. It is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib combined with ET (letrozole or fulvestrant) versus a short course with induction chemotherapy with paclitaxel followed by maintenance therapy with abemaciclib combined with ET (letrozole or fulvestrant) in patients with previously untreated, unresectable locally advanced, or metastatic HR positive/HER2 negative breast cancer with aggressive disease criteria.

The ABIGAIL study aims to provide consistent evidence that the combination of abemaciclib with ET -consisting of letrozole or fulvestrant-as first-line regimen is non-inferior to the optimal first-line chemotherapy -consisting of weekly paclitaxel-in terms of early ORR after the first 12 weeks of treatment in patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative ABC and at least one feature of aggressive disease associated with poor prognosis.
