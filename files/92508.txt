A Study of Cadonilimab Combined With Regorafenib in Patients With Advanced HCC
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of cadonilimab combined with regorafenib in patients with HCC who progressed on systemic therapy.
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Currently, second-line treatment options for advanced HCC (aHCC) patients including single TKI or anti-PD-(L)1 remains limited survival benefits and objective responses. To explore more effective and safer second-line or later therapies for aHCC is necessary. Cadonilimab is a first-in-class humanized IgG1 bispecific antibody that binds to PD-1 and CTLA-4 simultaneously. Dual checkpoint inhibition of the PD-1 and CTAL4 pathways with single cadonilimab has the potential to boost immune surveillance in HCC. Previously data indicated that cadonilimab possesses an encouraging anti-tumour activity and an improved safety profile compared to the co-administration of anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Regorafenib is a TKI and approved for second-line treatment of uHCC globally. Here, the investigators evaluated the safety of cadonilimab plus regorafenib as second-line or later therapy in patients with aHCC.
