Sodium Pertechnetate (99Tc) Injection Generator: 99mTc From Neutron-activation 99Mo v 99mTc From Fission 99Mo
A non-fission sourced, solvent generator produced 99mTc intravenous injection, as 99mTc -MDP, is to be used as a bone scan diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for assessment of bone pathology using the same oncologic indications as nuclear reactor sourced 99mTc, as 99mTc-MDP.

DRUG: 99mTc MDP Injection:neutron-bombardment
Number of Participants Analyzed for Diagnostic Efficacy of Technetium (99mTc) Medronate Injection Prepared With 99mTc Derived From Neutron-activation Produced 99Mo Imaging Sensitivity Versus 99mTc Derived From Fission-produced 99Mo Imaging Sensitivity., All enrolled patients were re-imaged 3 to 28 days post a standard of care fission derived 99Mo bone scan using neutron-activation produced 99Mo as the investigational product. Per protocol dosage, time factors, injection site and imaging camera were matched. Resulting image sets (fission and neutron-activation) were analyzed visually for concordant biodistribution., 60 days
This clinical trial will be a comparison of diagnostic and imaging equivalency of 99mTc Pertechnetate intravenous injection (labeled with commercial MDP kits) produced by a non-fission sourced/solvent generator and a nuclear reactor/column sourced generator. Each oncologic participant acts as their own control to reduce error variance.
