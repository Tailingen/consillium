Neo-Adjuvant Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Treating Patients With Early Stage of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Based on available data, the concept of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy seems to be promising for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. The exploration of new drugs and regimens are warranted. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical response rate of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with operable non-small cell lung cancer stage IB, IIA-B, IIIA.
