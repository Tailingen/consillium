Evaluate The Accuracy Of Breast MRI Biopsy In Diagnosing A Complete Tumor Response For Some Women Following Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy For Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to test the ability of a breast MRI biopsy to accurately diagnose a complete tumor response to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) that the patient just finished. Numerous studies have shown that MRI has the highest accuracy for diagnosing a complete tumor response. The investigator wants to see if in a certain group of women who's breast cancer is no longer visible on the post-treatment MRI that the biopsy specimens from a MRI guided biopsy will accurately diagnose a complete tumor response to treatment which may in the future make breast surgery unnecessary in some women.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: MRI Biopsy
estimate the negative predictive value (NPV) of a percutaneous MRI biopsy, In this context NPV is defined as the number of true negatives (biopsy negative, i.e., no disease found on the percutaneous biopsy and pCR) divided by the number of all biopsy negatives. While NPV is of primary interest we will also estimate positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of the biopsy., 2 years
