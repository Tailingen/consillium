Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation With 5-FU(or Capecitabine) and Oxaliplatin Combined With Hyperthermia in Rectal Cancer
This trial examines the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of a combination of radiotherapy (over a period of five weeks) and chemotherapy (with 5-FU or Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin) and 10 fractions of deep regional hyperthermia in patients with primary locally advanced or locally recurrent rectal cancer. Previous pelvic irradiation in case of a local recurrence is not excluded from the trial. The treatment protocol aims on a preoperatively improved tumor regression allowing less aggressive surgery in primary locally advanced rectal cancer and a higher rate of curative resections in heavily pretreated locally recurrent rectal cancers.

Primary endpoint of the trial is the feasibility rate of a multimodal regimen consisting of radiochemotherapy and hyperthermia. Secondary endpoints are local control, survival rates, and toxicity. It is planned to include a total number of 59 patients over a period of 2.5 years.

RADIATION: Radiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Hyperthermia|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Feasibility rate (i.e. rate of patients not experiencing dose-limiting toxicity [DLT]), Participants will be followed for the duration of therapy and for 6 weeks after the last study treatment dose (approximately 11 to 12 weeks)|Number of hyperthermia applications by patient, Duration of therapy (approximately 5 to 6 weeks)
Local progression-free survival, Participants will be followed for up to 5 years after the end of therapy (Follow up period)|Distant metastasis-free survival, Participants will be followed for up to 5 years after the end of therapy (Follow up period)|Overall survival, Participants will be followed for up to 5 years after the end of therapy (Follow up period)|Response rate, Participants will be followed for up to 5 years after the end of therapy (Follow up period)|Rate of R0-resections, Only of participants who are considered as resectable receive surgery in curative intention 4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiation (results app. after 10 to 12 weeks after start of therapy)|Rate of acute and late toxicity, Participants will be followed for up to 5 years after the end of therapy (Follow up period)
