Revumenib in Combination With 7+3 + Midostaurin in AML
This research is being conducted to determine a safe and effective dose of revumenib that can be given in combination with standard induction (initial therapy to induce a remission) + FLT3 targeted therapy (midostaurin) and a single cycle of post-remission therapy + FLT3 targeted therapy (midostaurin) to participants with newly diagnosed Nucleophosmin (NPM1) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Revumenib (SNDX-5613) (a type of menin inhibitor)
* Midostaurin (a type of multi-kinase including FLT3 inhibitor)
* Cytarabine (a type of antineoplastic agent)
* Daunorubicin (a type of antineoplastic agent)

Number of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Detailed DLT consideration outline in protocol section 5.4., Up to 12 weeks|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), MTD is determined by the number of patients who experience a DLT. See previous primary outcome measure for the DLT definition. If 0 out of 3 participants experience DLT, next dose level will be proceeded. If \>=1 out of the group suffer DLT, dose escalation will be stopped and 3 additional participants will be entered at the next lowest dose level. If \<=1 out of 6 DLTs, this dose level is considered as MTD., Up to 12 weeks|Recommended phase II dose (RP2D), The RP2D is determined by a combination of the MTD (see previous primary outcome measure), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and response rate to different doses of revumenib in combination with chemotherapy and the FLT3 inhibitor midostaurin., Up to 12 weeks
Complete Remission (CR) rate with induction chemotherapy, CR rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a CR as defined by the ELN 2022 response criteria after completion of induction chemotherapy., Up to 8 weeks|Complete Remission (CR) rate with consolidation chemotherapy, CR rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a CR as defined by the ELN 2022 response criteria after completion of consolidation chemotherapy., Up to 12 weeks|Flow Measurable Residual Disease Negative (MRD-) rate with induction chemotherapy, Flow MRD rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve MRD negativity (MRD-) after completion of induction chemotherapy assessed by MRD sensitive flow cytometry., Up to 8 weeks|Flow Measurable Residual Disease Negative (MRD-) rate with consolidation chemotherapy, Flow MRD rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve MRD negativity (MRD-) after completion of consolidation chemotherapy assessed by MRD sensitive flow cytometry., Up to 12 weeks|Molecular Measurable Residual Disease Negative (MRD-) rate with induction chemotherapy, Molecular MRD rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve MRD negativity (MRD-) after completion of induction chemotherapy as assessed by NPM1 MRD testing as well as FLT3 ITD MRD testing and duplex sequencing., Up to 8 weeks|Molecular Measurable Residual Disease Negative (MRD-) rate with consolidation chemotherapy, Molecular MRD rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve MRD negativity (MRD-) after completion of consolidation chemotherapy as assessed by NPM1 MRD testing as well as FLT3 ITD MRD testing and duplex sequencing., Up to 12 weeks|Relapse-Free Survival at 1 year (RFS1), RFS is defined as the length of time after the completion of a particular medical treatment during which a patient remains free of any signs or symptoms of disease relapse or recurrence based on Kaplan-Meier methodology., Up to 1 year|Overall Survival at 1 year (OS1), OS1 is the probability estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; OS is defined as the time from study entry to death, or censored at the date last known alive., Up to 1 year
This is a single arm open label phase I trial of the menin inhibitor, revumenib, in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin (7+3) chemotherapy and the multikinase inhibitor midostaurin for the frontline treatment of Nucleophosmin (NPM1) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutated Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

Investigators are trying to determine the highest dose of revumenib that can be given safely in combination with these chemotherapy drugs. Treatment consists of 1-2 cycles of so-called "induction treatment" (initial chemotherapy to induce a remission of the leukemia). This "induction treatment" consists of revumenib + 7+3 (7 days of cytarabine + 3 days of daunorubicin) chemotherapy + midostaurin.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the combination of revumenib, cytarabine, daunorubicin, and midostaurin as a treatment for AML.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, study treatment visits, blood and urine tests, bone marrow biopsies, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).

Participants will receive study treatment as long as there are no serious side effects and the disease does not progress.

The trial will include up to 12 participants in dose finding phase and 10 additional participants in the dose expansion phase for a total participant number of 22 participants.

Syndax Pharmaceuticals is supporting this research study by supply revumenib (SNDX-5613).
