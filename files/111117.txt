Evaluate the feasability to determine the difference of tumoral metabolism before and after artificial nutrition.
Head and Neck Cancer|Oesophageal Cancer
DEVICE: PET/TDM
rate of Standardized Uptake Value (SUV), The variation of the SUVmax is defined as the difference of the tumoral SUV max between the TEP1 and the TEP2, 3 months
Evaluation of the feasability to determine the difference of tumoral metabolism before and after artificial nutrition. This activity will be measured with TEP/TDM 18F-FDG
