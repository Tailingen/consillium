A Clinical Study of the Efficacy of Natalizumab on Reducing Disability Progression in Participants With Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis
This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, international study conducted in 2 parts. Upon completion of the placebo-controlled period (Part 1), participants will have the option of enrolling in a 2-year open-label extension (Part 2).

Part 1: The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether treatment with natalizumab slows the accumulation of disability not related to relapses in participants with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS).

The secondary objectives of Part 1 of this study are to determine the proportion of participants with consistent improvement in Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), the change in participant-reported ambulatory status as measured by the 12-item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), the change in manual ability based on the ABILHAND Questionnaire, the impact of natalizumab on participant-reported quality of life using the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 Physical (MSIS-29 Physical), the change in whole brain volume between the end of study and Week 24 using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the proportion of participants experiencing progression of disability as measured by individual physical Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) system scores.

Part 2: The primary objective of Part 2 of the study is to evaluate the safety profile of natalizumab in participants with SPMS.

The secondary objectives of Part 2 of the study are to investigate long-term disability (based on clinical or participant-reported assessments) in participants with SPMS receiving natalizumab treatment for approximately 4 years and to assess change in brain volume and T2 lesion volume.
Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis
DRUG: natalizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Part 1: Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Progression of Disability in One or More of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW), or 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), Confirmed disability progression, defined as ≥1 of the following criteria (confirmed at a second visit ≥6 months later and at Week 96):

* Confirmed progression in EDSS (EDSS score increased from baseline \[BL\] by ≥1 point if BL EDSS ≤5.5 or by ≥0.5 points if BL EDSS ≥6);
* Confirmed progression in T25FW (T25FW increased by ≥20% of the BL walk);
* Confirmed progression in 9HPT (9HPT increased by ≥20% of the time taken at BL on either hand and confirmed on the same hand).

The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test where the participant is timed while walking for 25 feet. The 9HPT is a quantitative test of upper extremity function that measures the time it takes to place 9 pegs into 9 holes and then remove the pegs. The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the percentage is based on normal approximation., Up to 96 weeks (2 years)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), AE: any untoward medical occurrence that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. SAE: any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death; in the view of the Investigator, placed the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. An SAE may have also been any other medically important event in the opinion of the Investigator., 218 weeks
Part 1: Percentage of Participants With a T25FW Response, T25FW response is defined as any improvement from the best pre-dose T25FW in at least 75% of the scheduled on-treatment visits through Week 96. The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed walk over 25 feet. The participant is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the participant has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. The score for the T25FW is the average of the 2 completed trials. The 95% CI of the percentage is based on normal approximation., Up to 96 weeks|Part 1: Change From Baseline in the 12-Item MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12), MSWS-12 is a participant self-assessment of the walking limitations due to MS during the past 2 weeks. It contains 12 items that measure the impact of MS on walking. Items are summed to generate a total score and transformed to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater impact on walking. A negative number on change from BL value indicates an improvement in MSWS-12., Baseline and Week 96|Part 1: Change From Baseline in Manual Ability Score Based on the ABILHAND Questionnaire, The ABILHAND Questionnaire measures the participant's perceived difficulty in performing everyday manual activities in the last 3 months. The participant completes a 56-item questionnaire by estimating their own difficulty or ease in performing each of 56 activities. Items are summed to generate a total score and transformed to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where high scores indicate greater impact on manual ability. A positive number on change from baseline value indicates an improvement in ABILHAND., Baseline and Week 96|Part 1: Change From Baseline in the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 Physical (MSIS-29 Physical) Score, The 29-item MSIS-29 is a participant-reported outcome measure to assess the impact of MS on day-to-day life during the past 2 weeks from a participant's perspective; it measures 20 physical items and 9 psychological items. The physical score is generated by summing individual items and then transforming to a scale with a range of 0 to 100, where high scores indicate worse health. A negative number on change from baseline value indicates an improvement in MSIS-29., Baseline and Week 96|Part 1: Percentage Change From Week 24 in Whole Brain Volume at Week 96, Whole brain volume as measured by MRI., Week 24 and Week 96|Part 1: Percentage of Participants Defined as Confirmed Progressors on EDSS Functional System Scores, The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist. Participants with confirmed progression of disability in EDSS physical functional system scores will be defined as those who met one of the following criteria:

* an increase of ≥ 1 point from baseline system score of ≥ 1 or an increase of ≥ 2 points from baseline system score of 0 in at least 2 physical functional systems, or
* an increase of ≥ 2 points from baseline system score of ≥ 1 or an increase of ≥ 3 points from baseline system score of 0 in any 1 physical functional system.

A confirmed progressor was defined as a participant who met the criteria for disability progression at any given visit and at the 6-Month Confirmation Visit. The 95% CIs are based on normal approximation., Up to 96 weeks|Part 2: Percentage of Participants With Disability Worsening at 156 Weeks, Percentage of participants with disability worsening at each scheduled efficacy visit in Part 2, defined as one or more of the following: • ≥ 20% worsening from Part 1 baseline in T25FW; • ≥ 20% worsening from Part 1 baseline in 9HPT; • Worsening from Part 1 baseline in EDSS (≥ 1 point increase if Part 1 baseline EDSS ≤ 5.5 or ≥ 0.5 point increase if Part 1 baseline EDSS \> 5.5). The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test where the participant is timed while walking for 25 feet. The 9HPT is a quantitative test of upper extremity function that measures the time it takes to place 9 pegs into 9 holes and then remove the pegs. 95% CIs of percentages are based on normal approximation., Week 156|Part 2: Absolute Change From Baseline (Part 1) in T25FW, The T25FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-foot walk.

The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the participant has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately repeated; the score for the T25FW is the average of the two completed trials. Lower scores on time taken to reach 25 foot mark reflect a better outcome.
