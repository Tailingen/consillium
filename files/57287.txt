Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
The prognosis for children and adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved significantly over the years. Nevertheless, patients who experience disease relapse or induction failure along with patients having unfavorable genetics \[t(4;11) or t(9;22)\] have dismal prognosis. For these patients, novel therapeutic approaches such as immunotherapy are needed. In this clinical trial, investigators evaluate whether it is feasible to make a vaccine from leukemia cells and whether this vaccine enables direct immunity against cancer cells in patients.
Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CD 40
Rate Of Successful Vaccine Preparation, Vaccine preparation is a success if an adequate number of CD40 activated cells (at least 1 x 10\^8 cells) can be generated., 6 weeks
OBJECTIVES Primary

* To determine feasibility of generating a cellular vaccine composed of CD40-activated autologous ALL cells
* To determine feasibility of vaccine administration according to the proposed schedule
* To determine toxicity of vaccination with CD40-activated autologous ALL cells

Secondary

* To assess ALL-specific immunity following vaccination
* To assess the generation of immunity to control antigens
* To develop preliminary information on effect vaccination on tumor response
