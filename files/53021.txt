A Phase 1 Study of LY2835219 In Participants With Advanced Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of Abemaciclib to be given to participants with advanced cancer and to determine any side effects that may be associated with Abemaciclib in this population. Efficacy measures will be used to assess the activity of Abemaciclib in this population.
Advanced Cancer
DRUG: Abemaciclib|DRUG: Fulvestrant
Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Effects, The number of participants with clinically significant findings in the study were reported in this outcome measure., Baseline up to 233 weeks
Percentage of Participants With Tumor Response - Overall Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), ORR is the percentage of participants who exhibit a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as classified by the investigator according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). CR is a disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. PR is an at least 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the baseline sum diameter) without progression of non-target lesions or appearance of new lesions.

DCR is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who exhibit a stable disease (SD) or confirmed CR or PR relative to baseline during the study. SD is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD) for target lesions, no progression of non-target lesions, and no appearance of new lesions., Baseline through Study Completion (Up to 285 weeks)|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration at Steady State (Cmax,ss) of Abemaciclib, PK: Cmax,ss of Abemaciclib., Day 28 (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24 hours post-dose) of Cycle 1|PK: Area Under the Steady State Plasma Concentration-time Curve Over 24 Hours (AUC 0-24hr,ss) of Abemaciclib, PK: AUC 0-24hr,ss of Abemaciclib., Day 28 (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24 hours post-dose) of Cycle 1|Part A: Recommended Dose for Phase 2 Studies, The recommended dose was determined based on a review of overall toxicity, dose reductions, omissions, and pharmacokinetic information from the study., Baseline through Study Completion (Up to 285 weeks)
