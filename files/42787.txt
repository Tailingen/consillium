A Phase I/II Study of WJB001 Combination Therapy on Safety and Efficacy for Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase I/II study to preliminarily explore of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of WJB001 combination therapy, consisting of three stages: Dose escalation (Phase Ia), dose extension (Phase Ib), and efficacy extension (Phase II). The preliminary plan includes five combination therapy regimens, namely Arm A: WJB001+taxanes (A1: WJB001+paclitaxel, A2: WJB001+albumin paclitaxel); Arm B: WJB001+platinum (B1: WJB001+carboplatin, B2: WJB001+nedaplatin); Arm C: WJB001+paclitaxel+carboplatin; Arm D: WJB001+PARP inhibitor; Arm E: WJB001+VEGF inhibitor.

The study is a multicenter,phase I/II clinical trial, divided into three parts:

In the Dose Escalation phase(Phase Ia): BOIN design were used to search the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), allowing to increase or decrease the dose of one or separate drugs in the combination for dosage exploration.Recruitment by Arm, estimate 5 cohort, with 3 dose levels planned for each cohort:

In the Arm A/B/C combination therapy, chemotherapy (taxanes, platinum) is administered for a maximum of 6 cycles. After chemotherapy, WJB001 monotherapy is used to maintain treatment until the subject's disease progresses or withdrawl; In the Arm D combination therapy, the PARP inhibitor, such as Niraparib, is administered every 21 days in a cycle until the subject's disease progresses or withdrawl.

In the Arm E combination therapy, as an example, Bevacizumab can be treated for a maximum of 22 cycles or unacceptable side effects occur (whichever occurs first), and then Bevacizumab treatment is terminated and maintained with WJB001 monotherapy until the subject's disease progression or withdrawal In the Dose Expansion phase(Phase Ib): 1 to 2 dose levels for each group will be selected the sponsor and the SMC based on the previous data, to further evaluate the preliminary efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the combination therapy in the target population, and confirm the RP2D dose of different combination regimens.

Efficacy Expansion Stage(Phase II): At the RP2D regimen determined in the Phase IB study, to explore the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of WJB001 combination therapy in the target population. And 2 to 3 cohorts is preliminarily planned for expansion and the "Simon Two-Stage" design is adopted.
