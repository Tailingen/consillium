Screening Trial of Nivolumab With Image Guided, Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) Versus Nivolumab Alone in Patients With Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
Nivolumab is an antibody (a type of human protein) that is designed to boost your body's immune system. It does this by allowing immune cells to grow and fight the cancer. Nivolumab has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma (a form of skin cancer) and lung cancer. It is currently under study for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell cancer.
