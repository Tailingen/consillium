Isunakinra Alone and in Combination With a PD-1/PD-L1 Inhibitor in Patients With Solid Tumors
Isunakinra - a potent Interleukin-1 receptor inhibitor - will be given to patients with solid tumors to determine safety and tolerability of three different doses. Isunakinra will then be combined with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamic effects of monotherapy treatment as well as the combination will be evaluated.
Solid Tumor, Adult
BIOLOGICAL: Isunakinra|BIOLOGICAL: PD-(L)1 Inhibitor
Proportion of patients who experience DLTs, The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of patients who experience DLTs. The MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) will be determined based on the dose escalation cohorts. The evaluation period for DLTs will be 21 days following the first dose of Isunakinra and 28 days following addition of PD1-PDL1 inhibitor, From baseline to 49 days of treatment|Proportion of patients who experience decrease of IL-6 or hsCRP by >20%, Optimal Biological Dose (OBD) as indicated by changes in IL-6 and hsCRP plasma levels., From baseline to 49 days of treatment
Percent of individuals who experience radiographic response, Overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1, Two years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time, in days, between treatment initiation and when the patient is found to have recurrent and/or metastatic disease on imaging, or death for any reason., Two years|Overall survival, Defined as the time, in days, between treatment initiation and when the patient dies from any cause regardless of etiology., Two years
