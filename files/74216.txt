The most important treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer is based on anti-HER2 targeted therapy, combined with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. China's original new anti-HER2 targeted therapy drug, pyrotinib, has obtained rapid approval from the country for its outstanding phase II clinical trial efficacy. In patients enrolled in the phase II trial, pyrotinib has a significant effect, but the combination of pyrotinib and capecitabine significantly increases the adverse reactions of diarrhea. For this reason, there is a lack of research on other combination schemes of pyrotinib in HER2 advanced breast cancer. In the first-line treatment, the combination therapy (HN) of trastuzumab and vinorelbine has shown that it also has a synergistic effect with vinorelbine in anti-HER2 targeted therapy. It provides a good evidence-based basis for the trial design of pyrotinib combined with vinorelbine soft capsules. This phase II clinical study is specially designed for preliminary exploration.
