A Phase II Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study of Sorafenib or Placebo in Combination With Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) Performed With DC Bead and Doxorubicin for Intermediate Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC).
This study will look at whether our drug (sorafenib) in combination with chemotherapy delivered directly into your tumor using beads (DC Bead) will slow the progression of the disease. The beads used with the chemotherapy will slowly release the chemotherapy reducing the adverse effects that normally occur with chemotherapy.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)|DRUG: Placebo
Time to Progression (TTP) - Independent Radiological Review (Primary Analysis), TTP is defined as the time (days) from randomization to radiological confirmed disease progression. Participants without progression at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., From randomization of the first participant until 28 months later (cut-off date)
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time (days) from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact., From randomization of the first participant until 28 months later (cut-off date)|Time to Untreatable Progression (TTUP), Time to untreatable progression (TTUP) was defined as the time (days) from randomization to untreatable progression. Participants without untreatable progression at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., From randomization of the first participant until 28 months later (cut-off date)|Time to Vascular Invasion/Extrahepatic Spread (TTVI/ES), Time to vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread (TTVI/ES) was defined as the time (days) from randomization to vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread. Participants without vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., From randomization of the first participant until 28 months later (cut-off date)|Tumor Response - Independent Radiological Review, Tumor Response was defined as the number of participants with a confirmed Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all clinical and radiological tumor lesions, Partial Response (PR)= at least 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters (LD) of tumor lesions, Stable Disease (SD)= neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase for progressive disease, or Progressive Disease (PD)=at least 20% increase in the sum of LD of measured lesions, observed during trial period assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria., From randomization of the first participant until 28 months later (cut-off date)|Tumor Response - Investigator Assessment, Tumor Response was defined as the number of participants with a confirmed Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all clinical and radiological tumor lesions, Partial Response (PR)= at least 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters (LD) of tumor lesions, Stable Disease (SD)= neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase for progressive disease, or Progressive Disease (PD)=at least 20% increase in the sum of LD of measured lesions, observed during trial period assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria., From randomization of the first participant until 28 months later (cut-off date)
Safety issues will be reported in Adverse Event section. In addition to the secondary outcome measures, Biomarkers and Patient Report Outcome will also be analyzed as other variables.
