A Clinical Trial on the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of TQB3019 Capsule in Subjects With Advanced Malignant Tumors
The trial was divided into two phases: dose escalation and dose expansion. The dosing regimens were single-dose study and continuous dosing study. A single-center, open, non-randomized, single-arm clinical trial design was adopted. Subjects with advanced malignant tumors were selected to take TQB3019 capsules orally to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of TQB3019 capsules.
