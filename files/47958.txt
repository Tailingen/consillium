A Dose Escalation Phase I Study Of Human- Recombinant Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 Administrated Via CED In GBM Patients
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of intra-tumor and interstitial therapy with hBMP4 in increasing doses in patients with progressive and/or multiple recurrent Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
Glioblastoma
DRUG: hrBMP4
DLTs, Number of patients who experienced Dose-Limiting Toxicities. DLT is collected to determine Maximum-Tolerated Dose (MTD), Up to 8 Weeks after each cohort of 3 patients
Tumor response, MRI scans with the following variables: volumetric T1, T2, volumetric Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) and volumetric T1 with contrast. Preoperative assessment by clinical presentation and MRI appearance of the tumour burden will be taken and will be used as the reference point to determine the objective tumour response.

Objective tumour response: Duplicates of all scans are to be made at the time of each scan and to be retained for the option of a central reading at the end of the trial. Tumour responses must be confirmed by repeat evaluations which should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria of response was first met.

Tumor response will be evaluated in accordance to Macdonald criteria, Within 28 days before resection, intraoperative, up to 24 hours post start infusion, after 4-6 days post start infusion (end of infusion) and 4, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 52 weeks after hospitalization|EORTC QLQ-C30 Summary Score, The EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) will be used to assess quality of life.

The questionnaires will be available in local languages as per country requirements., After 4-6 days post start infusion (end of infusion) and during 4,8,12 and 52 weeks after hospitalization|Maximum observed plasma concentration of BMP4 (Cmax), Blood samples were obtained and plasma concentrations were determined using a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography method., Prior to the infusion, after 4-6 days post start infusion (end of infusion) and 4 weeks after hospitalization|Lowest concentration of BMP4 in the blood (Ctrough), Blood samples were obtained and plasma concentrations were determined using a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography method., Prior to the infusion, after 4-6 days post start infusion (end of infusion) and 4 weeks after hospitalization|Area under the curve (AUCâˆž), Blood samples were obtained and plasma concentrations were determined using a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography method., Prior to the infusion, after 4-6 days post start infusion (end of infusion) and 4 weeks after hospitalization|Central and peripheral volumes of distribution (Vd), Blood samples were obtained and plasma concentrations were determined using a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography method., Prior to the infusion, after 4-6 days post start infusion (end of infusion) and 4 weeks after hospitalization|Clearance, Blood samples were obtained and plasma concentrations were determined using a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography method., Prior to the infusion, after 4-6 days post start infusion (end of infusion) and 4 weeks after hospitalization|Half-life (t1/2), Blood samples were obtained and plasma concentrations were determined using a validated high-pressure liquid chromatography method., Prior to the infusion, after 4-6 days post start infusion (end of infusion) and 4 weeks after hospitalization
This multicentre, open-label, dose escalating, Phase I study will enrol approximately 18 patients with progressive and/or multiple recurrent GBM, who after failure of standard therapies will receive GMP Human- recombinant Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 via intra-tumour and interstitial delivery by CED.

Patients will undergo a resection or biopsy of the tumour, confirmation of viable malignant glioma tumour cells during frozen section performed by the institutional pathologists, and intra-tumor and interstitial placement under neuronavigational guidance of 2 or 3 catheters. No catheters will be placed at time of resection. After resection, catheters will be placed during a separate procedure several days later based upon the patient's condition as determined by both a clinical examination and routine MRI scan.

Patients will receive intra-tumour and interstitial CED of increasing amounts of hrBMP4 solutions (at a starting dose of 0.5 mg) and 1:70 gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) in a total of 44-66 ml over up to 4-6 days at the discretion of the investigator.

Gd-DTPA will be co-infused with hrBMP4 to determine the extent of intra-tumour and interstitial drug delivery. Patients will be hospitalized from the time of the original surgery until the end of infusion of hrBMP4.

Patients will be followed for the duration of the study. The primary endpoint of the study is monitoring feasibility and patient safety for the incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) following intra-tumour and interstitial therapy with hrBMP4 and to determine whether there is a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).
