A Clinical Study Conducted in Multiple Centers Evaluating Escalating Doses of Veliparib in Combination With Capecitabine and Radiation in Patients With Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
An open-label, Phase 1b, dose escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of the PARP inhibitor Veliparib in combination with capecitabine and radiation in subjects with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).
Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer
DRUG: veliparib|DRUG: capecitabine|RADIATION: radiation
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or establish the recommended phase two dose (RPTD), From first study drug dose and at each weekly treatment visit until dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) observed or completion of dosing period (anticipated to be approximately 5 weeks).
Assess the safety (number of participants with adverse events and types of adverse events observed), From screening and ongoing at each weekly treatment visit through dosing period (anticipated to be approximately 5 weeks), prior to surgery and at the final visit.|Assess the tolerability (number of participants with adverse events and types of adverse events observed), From first study drug dose and ongoing at each weekly treatment visit, through completion of dosing period (anticipated to be approximately 5 weeks).|Assess the pharmacokinetic profile by area under the curve vs. dose of veliparib, Multiple measurements over time points (0, .5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 hours post dose) Day 1, Day 2 and at the pre-dose time point on Day 5 and week 2 visit.
An open-label, Phase 1b, dose escalation study evaluating the safety and tolerability of the PARP inhibitor Veliparib in combination with capecitabine and radiation in subjects with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).
