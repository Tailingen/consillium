A Multicenter Open Clinical Study of Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic Profile, and Initial Clinical Efficacy of BAT 8010 for Injection Combined With BAT 1006 in the Treatment of Locally Advanced or Metastatic Tumors
This study is a multicenter, open, exploratory Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial in humans The combination of BAT8010 and BAT1006 was administered in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors(HER-2 expression, including IHC3+, IHC2+/FISH+, and IHC2+/FISH- patients)Tolerance and PK characteristics, to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and provide recommendations for subsequent clinical studies Recommended dose (RP2D) and rational administration regimen, and preliminary evaluation of antitumor efficacy. There are two main studies In the first stage, the "3+3" dose escalation rule is proposed to explore the safety and tolerance of the drug Sex; The second stage selects the appropriate dose and administration according to the preliminary safety and efficacy results of the previous stage The drug regimen and tumor species were expanded to further explore the combination of BAT8010 and BAT1006 for injection，The safety and clinical effectiveness of drug administration provided the basis for the follow-up clinical study.
