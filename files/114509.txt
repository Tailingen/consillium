Biological Effect of Nab-paclitaxel Combined to Gemcitabine in Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
The prognostic of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is dismal and the treatment gold standard since the end of the 90s' is gemcitabine; unfortunately all trials testing combinations of gemcitabine with chemotherapeutic agents or targeted agents had failed to demonstrate any superiority over gemcitabine monotherapy.

In a recently published phase I/II study of combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC), the combination gave an impressive response rate of 48% (Gemcitabine 1g/m² and nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m² once a week for 3 weeks, every 4 weeks). The safety profile was correct (fatigue, sensory neuropathy, nausea, haematological side effects). This efficacy can be related to an improvement of gemcitabine delivery to the tumor bed, as shown on preclinical studies: the response rate in xenografts was better with the combination; this improvement was associated with an increase of intratumoral gemcitabine concentration in mice receiving the combination when compared to mice receiving gemcitabine alone. This might be associated to modifications of peritumoral stroma with reduction of stromal content and increase in dilated vessels.

The aim of this study is to evaluate if the combination of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine induces a modification in vascularization of pancreatic adenocarcinoma on the primary tumor and of liver metastases after 2 cycles of treatment by comparison to baseline.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Nab-paclitaxel + Gemcitabine
Vascularization parameters of pancreatic carcinoma, Vascularization parameters of pancreatic carcinoma:

* on the primary tumor assessed by contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)
* and on liver metastases assessed by contrast enhanced ultrasonography (ceUS), 2 months
Stiffness, Stiffness will be assessed in the primary tumor using ratio-elastography, 2 months|Density, Density will be assessed in liver metastases on CTscan using density measurement before injection of contrast agent and after injection during the portal phase (80 sec post IV), 2 months|Safety, Adverse events of the treatment will be evaluated according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.03), 2 months|Response rate, Response rate will be evaluated according to RECIST V1.1 and CHOI criteria, 2 months
