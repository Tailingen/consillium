Collaborative Wilms Tumour Africa Project
Significant progress has been made in the treatment of Wilms tumor in high income countries, where survival is now around 85% - 90%. Survival in low income countries is much lower; specific challenges include late presentation, malnutrition, less intense supportive care facilities and failure to complete treatment.

A comprehensive treatment guideline was introduced in Malawi in 2006 which included nutritional support and social support to enable parents to complete treatment. Survival has increased to around 50%; 95% of children completed their treatment. A multi-disciplinary group of African clinicians and 'state of the art' experts produced a consensus treatment guideline for children with Wilms tumor in sub-Saharan Africa. This guideline will be implemented as a multi-center prospective clinical trial in 2014 in six - eight institutes, expecting about 200 new patients per year.

The hypothesis is that 2 year event free survival will be 50%, with \<10% failure to complete treatment and \<10% treatment related mortality. Other research questions include efficacy and toxicity of preoperative chemotherapy and the comparison of surgical staging, local pathology and central review pathology in stratifying postoperative chemotherapy.
