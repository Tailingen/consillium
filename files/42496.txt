Concurrent Laparoscopic Hysterectomy and Weight Loss Surgery in Obese Patients With Endometrial Carcinoma or Endometrial Intraepithelial Neoplasia
To assess the feasibility of an expedited referral process for the obese endometrial cancer or EIN patient from her gynecologic oncologist to the Brigham Center for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (CMBS) in order to undergo concurrent weight loss surgery and hysterectomy within 8 weeks of first appointment with a gynecologic oncologist (or 12 weeks for EIN patients).

The most common risk factor for endometrial cancer is obesity. However, because early-stage endometrial cancer has a very high survival rate, patients more often suffer from long-term issues related to their weight, like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Weight loss surgery has been shown to help patients lose weight and also decrease their risk for obesity-related diseases.

This research study is a Feasibility Study. This is the first-time investigators are studying both 1) the referral process of patients with endometrial cancer to the Center for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery without delaying curative treatment of endometrial cancer 2) the combined surgery of both hysterectomy and weight loss surgery. The combined surgery of hysterectomy and weight loss surgery has been performed both at this institution and others without increased complications, but it has not been formally studied.

Approximately 30 patients are expected to participate in this study at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH).
