The International Polycap Study 3 (TIPS-3)
The randomized 2x2x2 factorial design placebo controlled trial will enroll 5000 participants (women 60 years or older and men 55 years or older) without known heart disease or prior stroke and without a clear indication or contraindication to any of the study medications. Eligible and consenting individuals will be randomized to receive either the active study medications or placebo (dummy pills) and will be monitored for an average of 5 years. The study will include people from at 10 countries, will be conducted by an international group of scientists and physicians and will be coordinated by the Population Health Research Institute at Hamilton Health Sciences.

Polycap Primary Objective, To determine whether the Polycap reduces the risk of the composite outcome of CVD events which includes major CVD (CV death, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal MI), plus heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or arterial revascularization compared to placebo., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Aspirin Primary Objective, To determine whether aspirin reduces the risk of composite outcome of major CV events (CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke,) compared to its placebo., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Vitamin D Primary Objective, To determine whether vitamin D reduces the risk of fractures compared to its placebo., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Combined Effects of Polycap and Aspirin on CVD Events, To determine the combined effect of aspirin and the Polycap (i.e. double treatment) on major CV events (CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke), heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or arterial revascularization compared to double-placebo., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years
Polycap Secondary Objective, To determine whether the Polycap reduces the risk of the composite of CV death, non-fatal stroke, and non-fatal MI compared to its placebo.To determine whether the Polycap reduces the risk of the composite outcome of major CVD (CV death, non- fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction \[MI\]), heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, arterial revascularization, or angina with evidence of ischemia., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Aspirin Secondary Objective, To determine whether a daily aspirin reduces the risk of the composite outcome of major CV events (CV death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke) and cancers compared to its placebo., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Vitamin D Secondary Objective, To determine whether vitamin D reduces the risk of the composite outcome of CV events, fractures and cancers, and the risk of falls compared to its placebo., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Combined Effects of Polycap and Aspirin on CVD Events Secondary Outcome A, To determine whether the Polycap and aspirin reduces the risk of the composite of CV death, non-fatal stroke, and non-fatal MI compared to double placebo., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Combined Effects of Polycap and Aspirin on CVD Events Secondary Outcome B, To determine whether the Polycap and aspirin reduces the risk of the composite outcome of major CVD (CV death, non- fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction \[MI\]), heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, arterial revascularization, or angina with evidence of ischemia, compared to double-placebo, Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years
Total mortality, To assess the effect of each of the 3 treatments on total mortality., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Incident and recurrent CV events, To determine whether the Polycap reduces the risk of incident and recurrent CV events (which is comprised of major CVD (CV death, non- fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction \[MI\]), plus heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest or arterial revascularization))., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Long term safety, To assess the long-term safety of each treatment (Polycap, Aspirin or Vitamin D) versus their respective placebo on safety and tolerability., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Visual acuity, To assess the effect of the Polycap and Aspirin on visual acuity change from baseline and onset of age-related macular degeneration., Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Cognitive Function, To assess the effect of each of the 3 treatments on cognitive function, Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years|Health Economics, To assess the economic impact of the Polycap, Participants will be followed for an average of 4.25 years
Cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancers and osteoporosis collectively make up the largest disease burden globally. CVD is the major cause of death and disability and affects about half of the population over their lifetimes. Cancers are a leading cause of death and it accounts for 13.0% of all deaths. The commonest forms include lung, breast, prostate, colorectum, stomach and liver cancer. It is estimated that over 200 hundred million people worldwide are living with osteoporosis. This is the underlying pathologic predisposition to fractures of the hip, vertebral body, and distal forearm. CVD, cancers and osteoporotic fractures increase with age and so their burden is expected to substantially increase over the next few decades. Simple, safe and effective preventive strategies which can reduce the incidence and prevalence of these 3 diseases are therefore urgently needed

It is suggested that this polypill could be given to all individuals with a CVD event as well as to anyone over 55 years (primary prevention) without the need for any measurement of risk factors. The polypill contains 3 blood pressure lowing medications and a statin in a single tablet. This includes hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg), atenolol (100 mg), ramipril (10 mg) and simvastatin (40 mg). In addition, to the polypill (Polycap), participants will be randomized to receive aspirin (75mg) and vitamin D (60,000 IU monthly). This factorial design on 3 distinct treatment arms which could reduce CVD, fractures and cancers could have large implications for the prevention of several of the important chronic diseases in middle and old age, using safe and inexpensive medications/supplements.
