Romiplostim in Chemotherapy-Induced Thrombocytopenia
Prospective interventional randomized controlled trial to assess safety and efficacy of romiplostim in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in children and adolescents with solid malignancy
Chemotherapy-induced Thrombocytopenia|Solid Malignancy
DRUG: Romiplostim
Hematologic response, Platelet count increase to \> 75 x 10e9/L, as well as toleration of chemotherapy resumption for at least 8 weeks or two cycles without subsequent chemotherapy dose reduction or dose delay because of recurrent CIT, 12 weeks
Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) frequently complicates cancer treatment causing delays in treatment and dose reduction for subsequent administration of cancer-directed treatment.

Romiplostim is a potential agent that can improve platelet counts, allowing the resumption of chemotherapy, decreasing the need for platelet transfusions, and increasing the nadir platelet counts thus improving dose intensity.
