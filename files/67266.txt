Concurrent and Adjuvant Nimotuzumab Combined With Induction Chemotherapy Plus Chemoradiation in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Nimotuzumab is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Nimotuzumab has been granted approval for use in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), glioma and nasopharyngeal cancer in different countries. This is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial, with the purpose to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab combined with induction chemotherapy plus chemoradiation and adjuvant therapy in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma by AJCC V8 Stage
DRUG: Nimotuzumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy
overall survival(OS), Overall survival is measured from day of diagnosis until death due to any cause or the latest known date alive.OS will be measured by the Method of Kaplan and Meier., 5 years
Tumor control probability (TCP), Tumor control probability is defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who have a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1., 5 years|Disease-free survival(DFS), DFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression or death due to disease progression per RECIST 1.1. DFS will be measured by the Method of Kaplan and Meier., 5 years|Locoregional failure-free survival(LRRFS), LRRFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of locoregional relapse per RECIST 1.1. LRRFS will be measured by the Method of Kaplan and Meier., 5 years|Distant Metastasis-free survival(DMFS), DMFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of first distant metastasis. DMFS will be measured by the Method of Kaplan and Meier., 5 years|Incidence rate of investigator-reported adverse events (AEs), Analysis of investigator-reported adverse events (AEs) are based on treatment-related AEs (trAEs) and immune-related AEs (irAEs), and all-grade AEs and grade 3-4 AEs. AEs are evaluated by investigators according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 and radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG) toxicity criteria., 5 years|Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 (V3.0), Score of survival quality according to the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 (V3.0) before treatment, during treatment, after treatment., 5 years
