Evaluating Innovative Technologies and Approaches to Addressing Cervical Cancer in Gaza and Maputo Cidade Provinces in Mozambique
The goal of this operational research study is to develop, implement and test integrated CCS\&PT and voluntary FP service delivery models to evaluate whether integrated service delivery can optimize uptake and health impact of both services. The study objectives and learning questions are listed below, along with key outcomes that will be measured.

Objectives:

The study objectives are outlined below:

1. To quantify the health impact of CCS\&PT on the uptake of voluntary FP services.
2. To quantify the health impact of voluntary FP on the uptake of CCS\&PT services.
3. To determine which promotional strategies are most effective to increase uptake of CCS\&PT services.
4. To identify cost to deliver high quality CCS\&PT services integrated into existing voluntary FP programs.
5. To determine client and provider acceptability of integrated CCS\&PT and voluntary FP services using new screen and treat technologies.
