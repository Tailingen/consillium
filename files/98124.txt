Study of AXT-1003 in Adult Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas
This is an open-label, multicenter, phase I study of AXT-1003 to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in adult subjects with Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas.
Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: AXT-1003
Number of Participants With Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) (Dose Escalation), Dose Escalation only: to characterize the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of AXT-1003., Up to 28 days|Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs) by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE version 5.0), timing, seriousness and relationship to study treatment., An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category. Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator., Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug|Number of Participants with Clinically Significant Change from Baseline in Laboratory Abnormalities by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE version 5.0), and timing, Laboratory parameters included: hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis and coagulation. Clinical significance of laboratory parameters was determined at the investigator's discretion., Baseline up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug
Overall response rates (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with a CR or PR., Up to 3 years|Duration of response(DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the initial objective response to progression of disease (PD) or death after the response, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years|Progression free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first PD or death for any reason in the absence of documented PD, whichever occurs first, Up to 3 years|Time to response (TTR), Time to response is defined as the time from first dose of study treatment to the first objective tumor response., Up to 3 years|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of subjects with a CR, PR, or stable disease(SD)., Up to 3 years|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of AXT-1003, Pharmacokinetics of AXT-1003, Up to 15 days|Time of maximum observed concentration (tmax) of AXT-1003, Pharmacokinetics of AXT-1003, Up to 15 days|Area under the curve from the time of dosing to the time of the last measurable concentration (AUC0-t) of AXT-1003, Pharmacokinetics of AXT-1003, Up to 15 days|The partial area from dosing time to dosing time plus Tau (AUC0-tau) of AXT-1003, Pharmacokinetics of AXT-1003, Up to 15 days|Trough concentration of AXT-1003, Pharmacokinetics of AXT-1003, Up to 5 months|Minimum observed concentration (Cmin) of AXT-1003, Pharmacokinetics of AXT-1003, Up to 15 days|Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of AXT-1003, Pharmacokinetics of AXT-1003, Up to 15 days|Total body clearance (CL/F) of AXT-1003, Pharmacokinetics of AXT-1003, Up to 15 days
The study is being conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AXT-1003 in subjects with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphomas (R/R NHL) and relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (R/R PTCL), a subtype of R/R NHL.
