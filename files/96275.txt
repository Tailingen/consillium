Study of RTXM83 Plus CHOP Chemotherapy Versus a Rituximab Plus CHOP Therapy in Patients With Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study comparing the efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and immunogenicity profile of RTXM83 (rituximab biosimilar) vs reference rituximab (MabThera®), both with CHOP, as first-line treatment of Diffuse-Large-B-Cell-Lymphoma (DLBCL).

Rituximab biosimilar and MabThera® were both administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle with CHOP chemotherapy for six cycles. Two additional cycles of treatment were permitted at the Investigator's discretion. Patients were followed up for 9 months after last study dose.
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: RTXM83|BIOLOGICAL: Mabthera
Response Rate (RR) Achieved After Cycle 6 With RTXM83 Plus CHOP Compared to the RR Obtained With Mabthera® Plus CHOP (R-CHOP) in Patients With DLBCL, Per International Working Group (IWG) revised criteria for Malignant Lymphomas (Cheson et al. 2007) and assessed by positron-emission tomography scan, or by computed tomography scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging if Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan was not feasible. Tumor response was classified according to the International Working Group criteria, as Complete Remission (CR): Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms if present before therapy; Partial Response (PR): At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses; Stable disease (SD) or; Progressive disease. Response rate was the sum of CR and PR., Tumor response assessed after Cycle 6 or at the end of treatment
AUC 0-∞ (h μg/mL) at Cycle 1 of RTXM83 and Mabthera®, Compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter (AUC 0-∞) calculated from start of the first infusion until start of the second infusion (i.e. at Cycle 1) in a population PK model.

For the PK similarity assessments, regulatory guidelines on bioequivalence were followed whereby two treatments are judged not to be different from one another if the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the ratio between the geometric means of the measure (AUC 0-∞ ) falls completely within the range 80%-125%., Cycle 1 (first dose): Day 1 (pre-dose, mid-infusion), Day 8 and Day 15|AUC 0-∞ (h μg/mL) at Cycle 6 of RTXM83 and Mabthera®, Compare the PK parameter (AUC 0-∞) calculated from start of the first infusion until Day 21 of administration of Cycle 6 in a population PK model.

Flow cytometry of peripheral blood was performed for immediate analysis of cells with cluster of differentiation 19 (CD19+) and CD20+.

The primary endpoint of the investigation is to determine if the response rate obtained with RTXM83 combined with CHOP is non inferior to the response rate obtained with reference rituximab combined with CHOP.

The present study is a non inferiority trial and the study hypothesis is the following: H0: pc ≥ pe + δ vs. H1: pc \< pe + δ where, pe: proportion of successes in the experimental group (RTXM83+CHOP) pc: proportion of successes in the control group (Reference Rituximab+CHOP) Type I error: the difference pc-pe is less than δ when in fact the difference is greater than or equal to δ ie, the investigators choose the experimental treatment when the control treatment is actually substantially better.

Type II error: the difference -pe is greater than or equal to δ when it is actually lest than δ ie, the investigators choose the control treatment when the experimental treatment is essentially just as good.
