FPI-2265 (225Ac-PSMA-I&T) and Olaparib for Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC)
This study is an open-label, multicenter study designed to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of FPI-2265 (225Ac-PSMA-I\&T) in combination with Olaparib in participants with mCRPC. The dose optimization Phase 2 part will be investigating the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of novel dosing regimens of FPI-2265 and Olaparib in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: FPI-2265|DRUG: Olaparib
Evaluate anti-tumour activity of FPI-2265 administered in combination with olaparib, The frequency and proportion of participants with PSA50 response will be summarized, where PSA50 is defined as â‰¥50% decline in PSA level from pre-treatment., From first dose until approximately 12 weeks after the first administered dose of FPI-2265|Evaluate the safety and tolerability of FPI-2265 administered in combination with olaparib, Safety will be assessed by percentage of patient with treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events; percentage of patients with SAEs during the first year of the long term follow up and the number of AESIs during the 5 year follow up period. Percentage of patients with interruption of FPI-2265; percentage of patients who discontinue treatment; number and grade for AEs related to study treatment., From first dose until end of long-term follow-up, 5 years from the last administered dose of FPI-2265
This study is an open-label, multicenter study designed to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of FPI-2265 (225Ac-PSMA-I\&T) in combination with Olaparib in participants with mCRPC. The study will be conducted in two parts, with Part A enrolling participants who have been previously treated with lutetium-177 (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan or other 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy (RLT) and Part B enrolling participants who have not been previously treated with lutetium-177 (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan or other 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy. For each part of the study, a Simon 2-stage design will be used to evaluate two dosing regimens. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the recommended FPI-2265 dose and regimen. Conclusions from this Phase 2 study will be based on safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity data. Participants with PSMA-positive mCRPC will be allocated to Arm 1 and Arm 2 in a singular, alternating fashion, until all Stage 1 participants are enrolled into each of the two regimens:

Arm 1: Will consist of up to six doses of FPI-2265 every six weeks at Dose A and olaparib twice a day on days 1 to 14 of each cycle.

Arm 2: Will consist of up to nine doses of FPI-2265 every four weeks at Dose B and olaparib twice a day on days 1 to 14 of each cycle Participants will be monitored and assessed for efficacy response, disease progression, and adverse events.
