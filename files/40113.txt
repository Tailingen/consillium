Risk-Reducing Surgeries for Hereditary Ovarian Cancer
Based on studies of "Inherited Susceptible Genes Among Epithelial Ovarian Cancer" (NCT03015376, clinicaltrials.gov) and "Cohort Study of Universal Screening for Lynch Syndrome in Chinese Patients of Endometrial Cancer" (NCT03291106, clinicaltrials.gov), we provide risk-reducing surgeries of salpingo-oophorectomy with/without hysterectomy for healthy carriers with mutation genes of hereditary ovarian cancer, which is defined ovarian cancer with relevant pathogenic mutations.
