Treatment of Tumors in the Urinary Collecting System of the Kidney or Ureter Using a Light Activated Drug (WST11)
The purpose of this study is to test the safety of a combination of the study drug called WST11 and PDT. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a type of ablation therapy (treatment which destroys tumor cells) which has been previously approved for the treatment of patients with other cancers. It works by using a drug that is given through the vein and then is activated in the tumor by light administered during endoscopy, which results in destruction of the cancer cells.
Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: WST11 mediated vascular targeted phototherapy (VTP)|PROCEDURE: Endoscopy
Maximum tolerated laser fluence rate, The MTD will be defined as the dose whose toxicity rate does not exceed an acceptable threshold of toxicity 20%.in this study, we shall start at 100mW/cm and will carefully escalate the dose to a maximum of 200 mW/cm., 2 years
