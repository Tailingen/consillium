LungPoint ATV for Biopsy in Patients Undergoing Lobectomy
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the LungPoint ATV System.
Lung Cancer
DEVICE: LungPoint ATV System
Ability to complete procedure using system, The proportion of cases (attempted nodules) in which the procedure could be substantially completed by the investigator divided by the number of cases (nodules) for which at least one attempt to pass any LungPoint study device into the bronchoscope was made., At completion of procedure
Proportion of nodules biopsied yielding tissue sufficient for diagnosis, The number of nodules with at least one biopsy sufficient for a tissue diagnosis divided by the number of nodules sampled using the LungPoint ATV system., Upon asssessment of histology of tissue sample taken during procedure|Number of significant adverse events, The number of SAEs rated as probably or definitely related to the study device and/or procedure divided by the number of patients in whom an attempt at study device use was made. The adverse events specifically tracked in this study are hemoptysis and pneumothorax., Up through lobectomy of lobe at end of procedure
The LungPoint ATV System is an image-guided navigation system used to access tissue samples in the lungs. This feasibility study is being conducted to assess the ability of the investigator to access and sample tissue using this system in patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy. Navigation to and sampling of the patient's lung cancer tumor is conducted immediately prior to the scheduled lobectomy or pneumonectomy.

Note: This study was conducted as a single-center feasibility clinical trial to determine the feasibility of this device. The primary outcome measures related only to feasibility and not to health outcomes. Therefore it was not registered on clinicaltrials.gov prior to the start of enrollment. Subsequently, it was determined that the results were compelling and therefore it was registered to facilitate publication.
