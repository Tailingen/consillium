Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of Tarlatamab in Advanced Extrapulmonary Neuroendocrine Carcinoma Patients
This is a phase 2 single-arm, open-label clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tarlatamab in patients with relapsed extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma (EPNEC) who have previously received platinum-based first-line chemotherapy. Participants will receive tarlatamab on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), Day 8 (C1D8), and Day 15 (C1D15), followed by administration every two weeks thereafter. No placebo control is included in this study.

DRUG: Tarlatamab
Objective response rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of participants who have a partial response or complete response based on investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), From the date of first dose until the date of the first confirmed objective response (PR or CR) per RECIST v1.1, assessed up to 36 months
Progression free survival (PFS), defined as time from treatment initiation until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first for all subjects. Progression will be based on investigator assessment of disease response per RECIST 1.1, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months|Overall Survival(OS), defined as time from treatment initiation until death from any cause, From the date of the safety follow-up visit for up to 36 months after the last subject is enrolled or 1 year after the last subject's final dose of study treatment, whichever is later|Duration of response (DOR), defined as the time from the first documentation of OR until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Only subjects who have achieved OR will be evaluated for DOR, From the date of the first recorded objective response (partial response [PR] or complete response [CR]) for up to 36 months, until the first documented date of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.
1. study rationale Extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas (EPNECs) are rare, aggressive malignancies with poor prognosis, lacking established second-line treatments. First-line therapy, adapted from small cell lung cancer (SCLC), consists of platinum-based chemotherapy, but responses are short-lived, and salvage options offer limited benefit (response rates 10-30%, overall survival 5-7 months).

   Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) is highly expressed in EPNECs, making it a promising therapeutic target. Tarlatamab, a DLL3-targeting bispecific T cell engager (BiTE), has demonstrated durable antitumor activity in relapsed SCLC. Given its efficacy in DLL3-expressing tumors, tarlatamab may provide a novel treatment option for EPNECs.
2. Study Design This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 2 study that will evaluate efficacy and safety of tarlatamab (AMG 757) for the treatment of subjects with extrapulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas (EPNECs) who have progressed after 1 prior line of platinum-containing therapy. The study will be composed of 2 cohorts; cohort 1 (gastrointestinal and pancreaticobiliary NEC) and cohort 2 (genitourinary NEC).

   The study consists of a 21-day screening period, a treatment period, a safety follow-up (SFU) visit, and a long-term follow-up (LTFU) period.
3. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of tarlatamab based on the objective response rate (ORR) as determined by investigator assessment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. The primary estimand focuses on the proportion of participants achieving a partial or complete response.

   A secondary objective is to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from treatment initiation until disease progression or death.
4. Intervention Details

Participants will receive tarlatamab via intravenous (IV) infusion according to the following schedule:

Cycle 1:

Day 1 (C1D1): 1 mg IV over 60 minutes Day 8 (C1D8): 10 mg IV over 60 minutes Day 15 (C1D15): 10 mg IV over 60 minutes Subsequent Cycles: 10 mg IV every two weeks There is no placebo in this study.
