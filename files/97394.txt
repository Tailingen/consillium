Proton Beam Irradiation for the Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Cancer and Cholangiocarcinoma
In this study the investigators will be studying the effects of proton beam radiation therapy. This is a very accurate kind of treatment that has been shown to affect less normal tissue than a photon radiation beam. The accuracy allows the investigators to more safely increase the amount of radiation delivered to eliminate cancer. This accuracy will potentially reduce side effects that participants would normally experience using photon radiation therapy. The purpose of this study is to determine if radiation using proton beam therapy will kill the cancer cells in the participants liver.

RADIATION: Proton Beam Irradiation
2 Year Local Control Rate, The percentage of participants with local control after two years as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0. The duration of control was measured from the start of treatment. Local control is the absence of local failure. Local Failure is defined as evidence of tumor growth/regrowth in any direction beyond that present of the pre-treatment imaging studies in the treated lesion(s)., 2 years|Median Overall Survival, The median survival time in months as measured from the start of treatment until death due to any cause or until the participants is censored. Participants are censored at the date of their last follow-up., 5 years
Number of Participants With Treatment Related Adverse Events â‰¥ Grade 3, Summary of the proton radiation related grade 3 or greater adverse events that participants experienced. Adverse events were assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3)., 2 years|Patterns of Failure, A summary of the patterns of treatment failure, shown as the number of participants that fall into each category at the end of study follow-up, 2 years
* Participants will receive treatment as an outpatient in the Francis H. Burr Proton Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital, the MD Anderson Proton Therapy Center or the Roberts Proton Therapy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
* Not everyone who participates in this study will be receiving the same dose of radiation. The dose received will be determined by the location of the tumor(s) within the liver.
* Proton Beam radiation therapy to the liver will be given once a day, 5 days a week (Monday-Friday), for 2 weeks.
* The following procedures will be performed once a week during treatment on days 1, 8 and 15, as well as on the last day of radiation: physical examination and blood tests.
