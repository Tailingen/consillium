Organoid Models of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
A promising tool to elucidate the molecular characteristics of HCC are patient-derived organoids (PDOs), three-dimensional cultures of cells that self-organise according to tissue-specific patterns and can be used to test the susceptibility of a specific tumour to anticancer agents. In this study, PDOs for HCC will be developed that closely resemble the tumour microenvironment in vivo and mimic the crosstalk of the gut-liver axis to establish a correlation with patient prognosis and test the efficacy of available systemic therapies.

PROCEDURE: organoids models
Organoid model development, The primary endpoint of this study is to assess the correlation between the genomic and histological characteristics of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surgical biopsies and clinical outcomes, specifically disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)., 2-18 months
The objectives of the project will be 1) to develop HCC PDOs from tumour and non-tumour patient liver tissue obtained from surgical specimens or liver biopsies; 2) to evaluate genomic and transcriptomic changes resulting from the integration of HCC PDOs with patient-derived gut microbiota and host immune cells, and to assess the correlation with patient prognosis; 3) to exploit HCC PDOs to test the efficacy of systemic therapies (ICI and TKIs) and to understand possible modifying cofactors.

Researchers with laboratory experience have been recruited who will focus on the construction of PDOs and the analysis of immune-inflammatory pathways. State-of-the-art technologies will be used, in particular next-generation sequencing, flow cytometry, high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic analysis, ultrafiltration, drug screening, multiplex immunoassays and enzyme immunoassays. The project aims to study the mechanisms involved in the modulation of therapeutic efficacy in patients with HCC. Therefore, the experimental model could be a valuable support to be integrated into real clinical practice to maximise therapeutic efficacy through a fully customised strategy.
