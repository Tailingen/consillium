DRUG: PF-06263507|DRUG: PF-06263507
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT), DLT was defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) occurring in the first cycle of treatment (21 days) which were attributable to PF-06263507: 1) Grade 4 neutropenia lasting \>7 days, 2) Febrile neutropenia, 3) Grade \>=3 neutropenia with infection, 4) Any grade thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant or life-threatening bleeding, 4) Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, 5) Any grade \>=3 non-hematologic toxicities, 6) A positive cardiac troponin I result, 7) Persisting non-hematologic toxicities resulted in more than 2 weeks delay in receiving the next scheduled cycle. Severity of AEs was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0., Baseline up to Cycle 2 Day 1 (22 days)
Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), by Maximum National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for AEs (CTCAE) (Version 4.0) Grade, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent AEs are events which occurred between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. If the same participant in a given treatment had more than 1 occurrence in the same preferred term event category, only the worst CTCAE grade was reported., Baseline, Day 1 to 15 for Cycle 1, Day 1 to end of treatment for Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles, and follow-up.|Number of Participants With Treatment-related AEs, by Maximum NCI CTCAE (Version 4.0) Grade, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship.

Complete response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR)\>=30% decrease in sum of longest dimensions of lesions taking as reference baseline sum longest dimensions. Progressive disease (PD) \>=20% increase in sum of longest dimensions of lesions taking as a reference smallest sum of the longest dimensions since treatment start, or the appearance of \>=1 new lesion. Stable disease (SD)=neither shrinkage for PR or increase for PD taking as reference smallest sum of longest dimensions since treatment start., Baseline, every 6 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity up to 24 months.|Objective Response, Number of particpants with objective response: confirmed CR or confirmed PR according to RECIST. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. A PR was defined as a ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements in participants with responding tumors had to have been confirmed by repeat studies that were performed ≥ 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met., Baseline, every 6 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity up to 24 months.|Overall Survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from initial dose until death from any cause, and was measured in the intent-to-treat population., Baseline to death|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Serum PF-06263507 Concentration (Tmax), Baseline,Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose,1,4,8,12,24, and 48 hrs post dose,Day 5,Day 8 and Day 15;Day 1 of Cycle 2 and 3,Day 1 of Cycle 4 pre-dose,1,8,12,24 hr post dose, Day 8 and Day 15,every cycle thereafter on day 1 pre-dose, and up to 21 days after last dose.|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Serum PF-06281192 Concentration (Tmax), Baseline,Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose,1,4,8,12,24, and 48 hrs post dose,Day 5,Day 8 and Day 15;Day 1 of Cycle 2 and 3,Day 1 of Cycle 4 pre-dose,1,8,12,24 hr post dose, Day 8 and Day 15,every cycle thereafter on day 1 pre-dose, and up to 21 days after last dose.|Time to Reach Maximum Observed Serum PF-06264490 Concentration (Tmax), Baseline,Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose,1,4,8,12,24, and 48 hrs post dose,Day 5,Day 8 and Day 15;Day 1 of Cycle 2 and 3,Day 1 of Cycle 4 pre-dose,1,8,12,24 hr post dose, Day 8 and Day 15,every cycle thereafter on day 1 pre-dose, and up to 21 days after last dose.
