Adagrasib in Patients With KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC Who Are Elderly or Have Poor Performance Status
ADEPPT is an international, multicentre, single-arm phase II trial. The protocol treatment consists of adagrasib, which is administered at a dose of 600 mg orally, twice daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity.The primary objective of this trial is to assess the clinical efficacy of adagrasib treatment, in terms of objective response, in patients with KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC, including the elderly (≥70 years) or patients with poor performance status (ECOG PS=2).
NSCLC Stage IV|KRAS P.G12C
DRUG: Adagrasib
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1, assessed at 12 weeks., The primary objective of this trial is to assess the clinical efficacy of adagrasib treatment, in terms of objective response as defined as the rate of patients achieving a best overall response \[complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)\] according to RECIST v1.1, From date of enrolment until 12 weeks post-enrolment
Durable clinical benefit, Durable clinical benefit (DCB) is defined as the rate among all enrolled patients who are alive and without disease progression who achieve CR or PR, according to RECIST v1.1, or stable disease (SD) lasting for at least 24 weeks., From date of enrolment until at least the 24-week assessment.|Time-to-progression (TTP), Time-to-progression (TTP) is defined as the time from the date of enrolment until the date of documented progression (according to RECIST v1.1). Censoring for patients without documented progression will occur at the date of last tumour assessment without PD. Patients without a post-baseline tumour assessment will be censored at the date of enrolment plus 1 day., From the date of enrolment until last tumour assessment (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of enrolment until the date of documented progression (according to RECIST v1.1) or death, if progression is not documented. Censoring (for patients without progression or death) will occur at the date of last tumour assessment. Patients without a post-baseline tumour assessment will be censored at the date of enrolment plus 1 day., From the date of enrolment until last tumour assessment (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of enrolment until the date of death from any cause. Censoring for patients who are not reported as dead will occur at the last date they are known to be alive. Data for patients who do not have post-baseline information will be censored at the date of enrolment plus 1 day., From the date of enrolment until last patient last visit (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Safety and tolerability, The toxicity and safety profile of the protocol treatment will be evaluated by:

* Adverse events (AEs) according to CTCAE v5.0 (any-cause, as well as treatment-related) including AEs leading to dose delays and/or interruptions, withdrawal of protocol treatment, and death
* Severe and serious AEs
* Deaths, From the date of enrolment until last patient last visit (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Laboratory parameters and abnormalities 1, Hemoglobin \[g/dl\], From the date of enrolment until last patient last visit (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Laboratory parameters and abnormalities 2, Platelet count \[G/L\], From the date of enrolment until last patient last visit (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Laboratory parameters and abnormalities 3, White blood cell count \[G/L\], From the date of enrolment until last patient last visit (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Vital signs 1, Blood pressure systolic \[mmHg\], From the date of enrolment until last patient last visit (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Vital signs 2, Blood pressure diastolic \[mmHG\], From the date of enrolment until last patient last visit (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Vital signs 3, Heart rate \[beats/min\], From the date of enrolment until last patient last visit (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Vital signs 4, Body temperature \[°C\], From the date of enrolment until last patient last visit (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Patient-reported outcomes NFLSI-17, Patient-reported symptoms and functioning will be assessed by NCCN-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Lung Symptom Index-17 (NFLSI-17)., From the date of screening until patient's end of treatment (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Patient-reported outcomes PRO-CTCAE®, The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse effects of adagrasib (diarrhoea and vomiting) that are not covered by the NFLSI-17 will be assessed by the NCI Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE®)., From the date of screening until patient's end of treatment (approximately 20-26 months after enrolment of the first patient)
