A Study of Pyrotinib Plus Capecitabine in Patients With Brain Metastases From HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors.This study is a single-arm, prospective, open label clinical study of pyrotinib plus capecitabine as the Therapy of brain metastases from HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
HER2 Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pyrotinib plus Capecitabine
Objective Response Rate of Intracranial Lesion (ORR), the proportion of patients with the best intracranial response of confirmed complete or partial response according to RECIST 1·1, as assessed by the investigator, Estimated up to 1 year
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), time from the first dose to disease progression or any-cause death, Estimated up to 3 year|Objective Response Rate of Extracranial Lesion (ORR), proportion of patients with confirmed extracranial complete or partial response per RECIST 1·1, Estimated up to 1 year|Duration of response (DOR), time from the first documented intracranial objective response to intracranial or extracranial disease progression in patients with confirmed response, Estimated up to 1 year|Overall survival（OS）, time from the first dose of study drug to any-cause death, Estimated up to 3 year
Brain metastases occur in 30-50% of patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In the case of solitary brain metastases, surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery are the preferred therapeutic approaches.Chemotherapy is used after further progression of disease but it has limited effectiveness. In HER2-positive tumours, trastuzumab therapy has been postulated to be associated with an increased risk of development of brain metastases.Thus new therapeutic options are urgently needed to improve patients'outcome. Pyrotinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2 receptors. We designed the study to explore the possibility of pyrotinib plus capecitabine for brain metastases from HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
