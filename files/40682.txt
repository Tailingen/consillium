Functional Recovery, Functional recovery was defined as partial or complete resolution of gastrointestinal manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease. Gastrointestinal manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and bleeding. Complete response (CR) of intestinal GVHD was defined as the absence of any symptoms referable to intestinal GVHD. Partial response (PR) was defined as clearing of abdominal pain (or withdrawal of opioid analgesic requirements in patients treated for abdominal pain) and of grossly visible bleeding if present, and resolution of diarrhea or decrease in the three day average stool volume by ≥ 500 mL in patients with stool volumes of ≥ 500 mL. Progression of GVHD was defined as an increase in the three day average stool volume by \> 500 mL, or the development of new abdominal pain (or new opioid analgesic requirements) or new intestinal bleeding., at 28 days after starting treatment with the study product
Duration of Treatment With the Study Product, Number of days from beginning of orally administered lithium carbonate to the end of orally administered lithium carbonate, Up to 6 months|Mucosal Anatomic Recovery, Endoscopic evaluation of improvement. Categories include 1) no improvement, 2) regenerative changes, 3) limited improvement, 4) partial improvement and 5) complete response. Endoscopic manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease include edema, erythema, mucosal ulceration and denudation. Complete mucosal recovery was defined as the appearance of intact mucosa with at least 98% of the luminal surface covered by epithelium. Partial response was defined as the appearance of mostly intact mucosa with at least 80% improvement or less than 10% denuded. Limited response was retrospectively designated to describe visible improvement that was less than partial response. Regenerative change was retrospectively designated to describe early reappearance of mucosal integrity in a previously denuded area but not sufficient to meet criteria for partial response. Failure to respond was defined as failure to meet partial response criteria., 2 to 3 weeks after starting treatment with the study product|Mucosal Anatomic Recovery, Endoscopic evaluation of improvement.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the effects of lithium on functional and mucosal anatomic recovery in the small or large bowel of patients with acute GVHD.

II. Functional recovery will be evaluated according to changes in clinical manifestations of gastrointestinal GVHD. III. Mucosal anatomic recovery will be evaluated by review of results from clinically indicated endoscopic evaluations.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the tolerability of lithium administration in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lithium carbonate once or twice daily. Treatment continues for up to 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
