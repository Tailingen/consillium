A Phase 1b Study of Paclitaxel And Ricolinostat For The Treatment Of Gynecological Cancer
Participants with Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer that has recurred within 12 months of prior treatment that includes Platinum Chemotherapy are invited to take part in this study. This research study is studying a combination of a new chemotherapy drug called Ricolinostat together with the chemotherapy Paclitaxel and a drug called Bevacizumab as a possible treatment for this diagnosis.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Ricolinostat|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Analysis Report on the MTD In The Dose Escalation Portion Of The Study, Not assessed, the MTD was not reached as the study was terminated., 2 years|Best Overall Response Measured From, Start Of Treatment To The End, This is now the primary outcome measure as the study was terminated prematurely., 13 months
Peripheral Neurotoxicity Assessed Using TNS by Measuring 5 Categories, No assessed TNS would only be assessed during escalation which we did not reach as the study was terminated., 0 years|Duration Of Overall Response, Measured From The Time Measurement Criteria Are Met For PR or CR Until The First Date Recurrent Or Progressive Disease Is Objectively Documented., Not assessed, study was terminated., 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), No assessed, study was terminated., 2 years
This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational intervention to use for further studies.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ricolinostat as a treatment for any disease. The FDA has approved Paclitaxel as a treatment option for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer . The FDA has approved Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy as a treatment option for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer .

In this study, we are hoping to learn what is the highest dose of Ricolinostat that can be given safely together with Paclitaxel on a weekly basis or with Paclitaxel on a weekly basis and Bevacizumab every other week. Ricolinostat is a drug that stops cancer from growing by blocking the action of a protein called HDAC.
