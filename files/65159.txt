Safety and Efficacy of SMART101 in Pediatric and Adult Patients With Hematological Malignancies After T Cell Depleted Allo-HSCT
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of SMART101 (Human T Lymphoid Progenitor (HTLP)) injection to accelerate immune reconstitution after T cell depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in adult and pediatric patients with hematological malignancies.
Hematological Malignancies
BIOLOGICAL: Allogeneic T cell progenitors, cultured ex-vivo
Cumulative incidence of grade III-IV GvHD, to evaluate the safety profile of the study drug, 100 days post-HSCT|Occurrence of adverse events related to SMART101, Number of adverse events and serious adverse events related to SMART101 tabulated for each dose and by age group to evaluate the safety profile of the study drug, 100 days post-HSCT|CD4+ T cell count, to evaluate the efficacy of the study drug, 100 days post-HSCT
T cell immune reconstitution, Time course of the T cell immune reconstitution, with a focus on naive CD4+ cells and total CD8+ cells, up to Month 12 post-HSCT|Cumulative incidence of infections, Day 90, and Months 6, 12 and 24 post-HSCT|Non-relapse mortality (NRM), Day 90, and Months 6, 12 and 24 post-HSCT
