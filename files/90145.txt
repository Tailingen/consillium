A Phase 1 Study of ZE50-0134 in Relapsed and Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, and Select Low-grad Lymphomas
This is a clinical study aiming to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of ZE50-0134 in relapsed and refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, and select low-grad lymphomas.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who have a best overall response of PR or better as determined by investigators using the iwCLL guidelines, Lugano guidelines, or Waldenstrom guidelines., Up to 24 cycles, 4 weeks each|Assess duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined in responders as the time from documentation of tumor response (date of first PR or better response) to the date of disease progression as determined by the investigator using iwCLL guidelines, Lugano guidelines, Waldenstrom guidelines or death due to any cause., Up to 24 cycles, 4 weeks each|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from first dose until progression as assessed by the investigator using iwCLL guidelines, Lugano guidelines or death due to any cause., Up to 24 cycles, 4 weeks each|Time to next treatment (TTNT), TTNT is defined as time from first dose to the initiation of alternative treatment other than ZE50-0134 for CLL or death., Up to 24 cycles, 4 weeks each|ZE50-0134 blood plasma concentration, ZE50-0134 blood plasma concentration, 2 cycles, 4 weeks each
Caspase 3 activation level, Measuring caspase 3 activation in CLL and lymphoma cells, 3 cycles, 4 weeks each|Immune cells count, Serial immune CD8 T-cells, NK cells, and normal B-cells during ZE50-0134 therapy, 3 cycles, 4 weeks each|Rate of undetectable Measurable residual disease (uMRD) response in bone marrow and blood, Rate of uMRD is defined as the proportion of evaluable subjects with MRD undetectable in bone marrow and blood, 12 cycles, 4 weeks each
A Phase 1, Open-label, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion, Multicenter Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Preliminary Efficacy of ZE50-0134 in Relapsed and Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, and Select Low-grad Lymphomas. The study is an open-label, with 2 parts.

Part 1 will utilize a 3+3 design. Eligible patients will be sequentially enrolled into each of 5 planned dose level cohorts. The purpose of Part 1 dose escalation is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ZE50-0134.

IPart 2 is a dose expansion of ZE50-0134 and will include two distinct doses who are venetoclax na√Øve treated at either the Biologically Effective Dose or Maximum Tolerated Dose and one dose lower. The purpose of Part 2 is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary antitumor activity of ZE50-0134 in subjects with CLL/SLL.
