SILibinin in NSCLC and BC Patients With Single Brain METastasis (SILMET)
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of silibinin in preventing recurrence in the brain after complete resection of a brain metastasis (BM) from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer (BC).
Brain Metastases, Adult|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Breast Cancer
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Silibinin|OTHER: Placebo
intracranial local recurrence, to investigate whether silibinin delay the intracranial local recurrence in comparison to placebo, up to 12-24 months
intracranial distant recurrence, to investigate whether silibinin delay or avoid the intracranial distant recurrence in comparison to placebo, up to 12-24 months|Intracranial progression-free survival, intracranial local plus distant recurrence, up to 12-24 months|Overall progression-free survival, intracranial plus systemic PFS, up to 12-24 months|Overall survival, to investigate whether silibinin improve the overall survival in comparison to placebo, up to 24 months|Assessment of the quality of life of brain metastasis patients, EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BN20, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 24 weeks, 32 weeks, 40 weeks, 48 weeks, 56 weeks, thereafter every 24 weeks|to determine incidence of adverse events, up to 12-24 months
This is the first placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy of silibinin as STAT3 inhibitor in preventing recurrence in the brain after gross-total resection of a brain metastasis (BM) from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or breast cancer (BC).

Participants will be randomized 1:1 to silibinin 1 g/day taken orally in comparison with oral placebo 1 g/day. A contrast-enhanced brain MRI will be performed every 8 weeks to evaluate intracranial local and distance recurrence
