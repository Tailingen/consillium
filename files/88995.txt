A Study of Napabucasin (BBI-608) Plus Weekly Paclitaxel Versus Weekly Paclitaxel Alone in Patients With Advanced, Previously Treated, Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is an international, multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial of the cancer stemness inhibitor napabucasin administered with weekly paclitaxel versus weekly paclitaxel alone in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who have disease progression following systemic treatment with a platinum-based combination regimen in the metastatic setting, who have received treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor if a candidate, additional approved therapies, and for whom weekly paclitaxel is an acceptable treatment option.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Napabucasin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Overall Survival, To assess the effect of napabucasin plus weekly paclitaxel versus weekly paclitaxel on the Overall Survival of patients with previously treated advanced, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer., 36 months
Overall Survival in Biomarker Positive Patients, To assess the effect of napabucasin plus weekly paclitaxel versus weekly paclitaxel on the Overall Survival of patients with previously treated advanced, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in biomarker positive patients. This biomarker-positive sub-population is defined as those patients with phospho-STAT3 based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue., 36 months|Progression Free Survival, To assess the effect of napabucasin plus weekly paclitaxel versus weekly paclitaxel on the Progression Free Survival (PFS) of patients with previously treated advanced, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause., 36 months|Progression Free Survival in Biomarker Positive Patients, To assess the effect of napabucasin plus weekly paclitaxel versus weekly paclitaxel on the Progression Free Survival (PFS) of patients with previously treated advanced, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in biomarker positive patients. PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first objective documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. This biomarker-positive sub-population is defined as those patients with phospho-STAT3 based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue., 36 months|Disease Control Rate in Biomarker Positive Patients, To assess the effect of napabucasin plus weekly paclitaxel versus weekly paclitaxel on the Disease Control Rate (DCR) of patients with previously treated advanced, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 1.1. This biomarker-positive sub-population is defined as those patients with phospho-STAT3 based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue., 36 months|Quality of Life (QoL), QoL will be measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) in patients with previously treated advanced, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with napabucasin plus weekly paclitaxel versus weekly paclitaxel., 36 months|Disease Control Rate, To assess the effect of napabucasin plus weekly paclitaxel versus weekly paclitaxel on the Disease Control Rate (DCR) of patients with previously treated advanced, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 1.1., 36 months|Number of Patients With Adverse Events, All patients who have received at least one dose of napabucasin will be included in the safety analysis according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.0. The incidence of adverse events will be summarized by type of adverse event and severity., 36 months
