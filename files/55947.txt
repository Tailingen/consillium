Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Metastatic
DRUG: NANT-008|DRUG: Fluorouracil Injectable Product|DRUG: Avastin Injectable Product|DRUG: Leucovorin Calcium Injection|DRUG: Eloxatin Injectable Product
Phase 1b Primary Endpoint, Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of NANT-008 and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of NANT-008, 12 weeks|Phase 2 Primary Endpoint, Evaluate the efficacy of the tested regimen as assessed by the 1 year survival rate, 1 year
Phase 1b is designed to evaluate the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of NANT-008 and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of NANT-008 in combination with metronomic 5-FU, bevacizumab, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin in subjects with advanced metastatic pancreatic carcinoma. In phase 2, subjects will receive the combination of RP2D of NANT-008 from phase 1b in combination with metronomic 5-FU, bevacizumab, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Phase 2 is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the tested regimen as assessed by 1-year survival rate in subjects with advanced metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
