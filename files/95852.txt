This study is an open-label, Phase 1b study evaluating TRK-950 in combination with 1) FOLFIRI or 2) Gemcitabine / Cisplatin or 3) Gemcitabine / Carboplatin or 4) Ramucirumab/Paclitaxel or 5) PD1 inhibitors (Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab) or 6) Imiquimod Cream for subcutaneous lesions 7) Bevacizumab 8) Gemcitabine / Carboplatin / Bevacizumab, 9)PLD, 10) Carboplatin / PLD / Bevacizumab or 11) Paclitaxel in Patients with Selected Advanced Solid Tumors. The objectives of this study are to determine the safety, tolerability, MTD, recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), PK, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of TRK-950 when used in combination with other treatment regimens.
