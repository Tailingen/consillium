Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With Recurrent Gliomas
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to determine the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody in treating patients with recurrent gliomas.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
RADIATION: iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 81C6
OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the toxic effects of intracystic administration of iodine-131-labeled anti-tenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6. II. Identify any objective therapeutic responses to this treatment in patients with recurrent cystic anaplastic gliomas.

OUTLINE: Radioimmunotherapy. Iodine-131-Labeled Anti-Tenascin Monoclonal Antibody 81C6, 131I-81C6.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Three to six patients will be entered at each dose studied.
