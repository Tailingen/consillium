Stimulation With Bethanechol in Combination With Gemcitabine and Nab-paclitaxel in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
The primary objective of this study is to assess the impact of bethanechol therapy on R0 resection rates. The safety objective will be assessment of the safety and tolerability of bethanechol in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The exploratory objective will be to evaluate genomic biomarkers associated with parasympathetic stimulation in pancreatic cancer, and the ability to reduce tumor growth rate.
Pancreas Cancer
DRUG: Bethanechol|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: nab-paclitaxel
R0 resection rate, This rate will be analyzed in patients treated with bethanechol in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel compared to historical R0 resection rates., 36 months
Ki-67 expression in tumor cells, This is to measure cell proliferation by Ki-67 expression in tumor cells, to quantify the change in tumor growth and alterations in inflammatory cytokines and immune profiles., 36 months
The purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug, bethanechol, could potentially be used in combination with chemotherapy regimen gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel and surgery to decrease the chance of the cancer coming back after it is removed. Animal models have shown that treatment with bethanechol can inhibit cancer growth and spread. The chemotherapy regimen nab-paclitaxel for use in combination with gemcitabine to treat patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer is FDA approved. Although bethanechol is FDA approved, in this study its use is experimental. The aim of the study is to show that the medication is easy to tolerate and that it shows signs of slowing cancer cell growth. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with bethanechol will alter nerve conduction within tumors by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system and reduce tumor proliferation, decrease CD44+ expression in cancer cells, decrease tumor growth rate resulting in an improved R0 resection rate.
