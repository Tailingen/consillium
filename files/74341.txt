A Study of Chemoradiation Associated with Nimotuzumab As the Treatment of Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer, comparing it to that of the conventional treatment with radiation and chemotherapy.

The secondary objective of this study is to assess the health-related quality of life for the nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimen, compared to the standard chemoradiation regimen in the treatment of inoperable locally advanced esophageal cancer.
Esophageal Cancer|Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Nimotuzumab|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Fluorouracil|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Overall survival and assessment of the complete endoscopic response, The primary endpoint of this study is the overall survival at the end of Phase II. At the end of Phase II, the assessment of the complete endoscopic response, and the regimen safety will be used to decide if the study will continue to Phase III., 2 years
Complete clinical response rate, * Time to tumor progression (TTP);
* Complete clinical response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with absence of visible disease in the high endoscopy and in the chest and abdomen computerized tomography, in the population assessable for response;
* Complete endoscopic response rate, defined as the absence of visible disease in the high endoscopy;
* Resectability rate;
* Safety:
* Quality of life, according to the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) questionnaire;
* Relationship between efficacy and safety and the tumor characteristics., 2 years
This will be a phase II, randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, and two-arm study. The study will be conducted in Brazil and has the purpose of determining the activity and safety of nimotuzumab in terms of overall survival, TTP, clinical and endoscopic response rates, resectability rate, toxicity profile, and quality of life. All participating patients will sign a consent form before they undergo any study-related procedure. The eligible patients will have locally advanced esophageal cancer, and they will be randomized to one of two treatment groups. Randomization will be centrally coordinated by the sponsor and performed by means of the electronic CRF itself.
