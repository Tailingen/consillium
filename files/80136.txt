A Study of Surufatinib Combined With Serplulimab in the Treatment of Advanced Solid Tumors With Neuroendocrine Differentiation That Failed Standard Therapy
Enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation who had failed standard therapy (including those with initial advanced solid tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation and those with newly developed neuroendocrine differentiation after treatment failure) received the combination of serplulimab and surufatinib and continued to be administered until the patient developed disease progression or met other protocol criteria for discontinuation of study therapy. A total of 39 patients were enrolled.
