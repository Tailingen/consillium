Study to Assess the Tolerability, Safety and Efficacy of an Adapted Gut Cleansing Solution in Routine Colon Cleansing Prior to Colonoscopies
It is particularly important that thorough gut cleansing is achieved prior to the colonoscopy for the procedure to be successful. Polyethylene glycol plus electrolyte (PEG+E) solutions are well established as safe and effective agents for gut cleansing and Norgine has successfully developed a low volume (2 litre) PEG+E gut lavage solution. The efficacy and safety of this solution is similar to the standard 4 litre PEG+E, but with improved patient acceptance.

Tolerance, acceptability and satisfaction with the cleansing agent plays an important role in subjects' compliance with gut preparation procedure. The study medication NRL0706 is identical to the PEG+E-containing gut lavage solution commonly used in clinical practice, with the exception that the flavour has been modified from lemon to orange. This study is to investigate the tolerability, acceptability, safety and efficacy of a single dose of NRL0706 (MOVIPREP Orange) in subjects without gastrointestinal symptoms undergoing colonoscopy for colon cancer screening.
