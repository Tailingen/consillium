A Study of Ruxolitinib and Duvelisib in People With Lymphoma
This study will test the safety of ruxolitinib, given at one dose that does not change, and duvelisib, given at different doses, to find out what effects, if any, the study treatment has on people with relapsed or refractory NK-cell or T-cell lymphoma.

Assessment for MTD/optimal dose, 3 subjects will be enrolled and followed for eight weeks of safety assessments. If no DLT is observed after all three subjects have been observed for eight weeks, a second cohort of 3 subjects will be enrolled at the next highest dose level. Cohorts will continue to be enrolled and observed until one subject experiences a DLT or the maximum dose level is reached with 0 or 1/6 DLTs., 1 year

This study will test the safety of ruxolitinib, given at one dose that does not change, and duvelisib, given at different doses, to find out what effects, if any, the study treatment has on people with relapsed or refractory NK-cell or T-cell lymphoma.

This study has three parts: dose escalation (Part 1), dose expansion (Part 2), and TFH/T-PLL cohort expansion (Part 3).
