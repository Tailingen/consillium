Study of Osimertinib + SRS vs Osimertinib Alone for Brain Metastases in EGFR Positive Patients With NSCLC
This open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II study will evaluate the usage of osimertinib alone for brain metastases compared to SRS and osimertinib in patients with newly diagnosed, treatment naiive EGFR positive lung cancer.
