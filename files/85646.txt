Effectiveness of Intensive Smoking Cessation Interventions in Patients With Cancer
Smoking accounts for approximately 30% of total cancer deaths each year. Even though former studies show that persons with a cancer diagnosis are less likely to smoke than the general population up to 50% of people who smoke and have lung cancer do not stop smoking after their diagnosis or frequently relapse after smoking cessation. Continued smoking leads to increased all-cause mortality, increased cancer-specific mortality, and decreased quality of life. It is well-known that cancer patients are interested in smoking cessation therefore smoking cessation interventions play an important role in the management of people with cancer.

This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive smoking cessation interventions on cancer patients in real life. The project provides new knowledge about smokers diagnosed with cancer.
