Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of Bosutinib Plus Atezolizumab in Newly Diagnosed Chronic Leukemia Adult Patients
The combination of bosutinib plus atezolizumab in first line treatment in newly diagnosis chronic-phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients could potentially increase molecular responses and therefore treatment discontinuation probabilities in these patients. We propose an Open-Label Phase Ib/II Study of Bosutinib in Combination with Atezolizumab for the Treatment of New Diagnosis Chronic Phase-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients.
Chronic Phase-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Bosutinib 400 MG Monotherapy|DRUG: Bosutinib 400 MG + Atezolizumab 840 MG in 14 ML Injection
Safety Profile of Bosutinib 400 mg Daily in Combination With Atezolizumab in Participants With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia as First Line Treatments, All Adverse Events, despite their severity or causal relationship with the study medication, will be reported, graded according CTCAE v5.0 and analyzed., through study completion, up to 7 months

4. Predictive markers of CML relapse: T regs (CD4+ CD25int-hi CD127low), CD8+ T cells (PD-1/PD-L1) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD86+)., 7 months
The combination of bosutinib and atezolizumab in first line treatment in newly diagnosis chronic-phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients could potentially increase molecular responses and consequently treatment discontinuation probabilities in these patients. We would like to propose an Open-Label Phase Ib/II Study of Bosutinib in Combination with Atezolizumab for the Treatment of New Diagnosis Chronic Phase-Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients.
