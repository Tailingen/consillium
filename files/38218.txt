Impact of Fas/FasL in Chemotherapy Response in Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma
Ovarian carcinoma has poor prognosis and new therapeutic strategies are required. Many patients with ovarian carcinoma showed resistance to chemotherapy. Cleaved FasL is known for induced atypical response when is binding to Fas such as avoiding apoptosis and inducing cell motility.

Correlation between cleaved FasL level ans neoadjuvant chemotherapy tumor response, Main outcome is cleaved FasL level and correlation with neoadjuvant chemotherapy tumor response, evaluated during surgery., surgery
Identification of tumoral T cells, Identification of tumoral T cells with FACS analysis of dissociated tumor. Different T cells will be studies: Treg/Th17/Th1/Th2 using antibodies against: CD45/CD3/CD4/CD25/FOXP3 (Treg), CD45/CD3/CD4/IL17A (Th17), CD45/CD3/CD4/CD8/IL4/INF (TCD8 and LTCD4 Th1 et Th2)., surgery|Disease Free Survival rate, 18 months after surgery|Overall survival rate, 18 months after surgery
