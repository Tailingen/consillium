Combination of Recombinant Human IL-21 (rIL-21) and Sunitinib in Stage IV Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients
This phase 1/2a trial is conducted in Europe. The first part of the trial is a dose escalation safety trial determining the maximum tolerated dose of rIL-21 when administered in combination with sunitinib.

The second part, scheduled to start in September 2008, is a randomised 2-arm trial comparing the anti-tumour effect of rIL-21 plus sunitinib with sunitinib alone.
