Association of Genetic Polymorphisms With Capecitabine-based Chemotherapy Toxicities in Chinese Solid Tumor Patients
Capecitabine is one of the most active agents in the treatment of many kinds of solid tumors. However, variability in toxicity and response remains a major problem for patients receiving capecitabine. It is general that there are many factors for individual differences of drugs in clinical application, of which genetic factors accounted for more than 20%. Toxicities of capecitabine, such as diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome or anemia, were evaluated for possible relationship with pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in several pharmacogenomics studies. Due to the levels of evidence of those studies are low and lack of sufficient research data of Chinese, it has the important significance in studying individual differences of capecitabine in toxicities, through the pharmacogenomics research.

The aim of this study is to evaluating the association genetic polymorphisms with capecitabine-based chemotherapy toxicities in chinese solid tumor patients. By detecting the gene polymorphism, investigators intend to study the pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenomics (PK-PG) correlation of capecitabine and provide scientific basis for precise medication guide for people to use capecitabine.

Incidence of severe diarrhea toxicity, The toxicity induced by capecitabine-based chemotherapy during observation time will be estimated on the basis of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.03. Patients with grade 3-4 adverse events will be considered as having severe toxicity. At the end of each cycle (each cycle is 21 days) the grade will be scored. And the severest grade will be recorded and used for analysis., At 1 year|Incidence of severe hand-foot syndrome toxicity, The toxicity induced by capecitabine-based chemotherapy during observation time will be estimated on the basis of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.03. Patients with grade 3-4 adverse events will be considered as having severe toxicity. At the end of each cycle (each cycle is 21 days) the grade will be scored. And the severest grade will be recorded and used for analysis., At 1 year
Incidence of other severe toxicities, The other toxicities induced by capecitabine-based chemotherapy during observation time, including gastrointestinal toxicity, neurotoxicity, hematological toxicity etc., will be estimated on the basis of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 4.03. Toxicities with grade 3-4 will be considered as severe toxicity, except for severe neurotoxicity (grade 2-3). At the end of each cycle (each cycle is 21 days) the grade will be scored. And the severest grade will be recorded and used for analysis., At 1 year|Genotyping, Collect blood specimen, then detect genotype by next generation sequencing., Before chemotherapy|The kinds of the metabolites, Determine the metabolic profiles of capecitabine. This outcome is not applicable to patients retrospectively collected., Pre-dose and 3 hours after the last administration in the first cycle|Area under the curve [AUC], Determine the AUC of capecitabine and its metabolites. This outcome is not applicable to patients retrospectively collected., Pre-dose and 3 hours after the last administration in the first cycle
