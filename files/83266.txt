Asian Multicenter Prospective Study of ctDNA Sequencing
This study is a genetic analysis of aberrations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients in Asian countries. This study protocol is divided into parts describing several subanalyses that differ in terms of cancer types, analytical methods, participating countries, and participating institutions.
Cervical Cancer|Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma|Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Ovarian Cancer|Endometrial Cancer|Triple Negative Breast Cancer
GENETIC: NGS analysis of ctDNA
Percentage of patients with one or more genetic abnormalities among all examination cases, DNA may be extracted from blood or tumor tissue samples, and germline gene abnormality may be analyzed using techniques such as PCR, NGS, and Sanger sequencing., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Percentage of patients with each genetic abnormality among all examination cases, DNA may be extracted from blood or tumor tissue samples, and germline gene abnormality may be analyzed using techniques such as PCR, NGS, and Sanger sequencing., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Genomic abnormalities of ctDNA and tumor tissue will be combined to report the concordance rate, Concordance rate is defined by the sum of concordance on positives with the denominator as the total number of genes in which a genomic alteration is detected, i.e., genes in which alterations are not detected by one of assays are excluded from both the numerator and denominator., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
NGS analysis will be performed on cfDNA extracted from peripheral blood samples of target patients to determine the types and incidences of genetic abnormalities. Patient information and gene abnormality data will be integrated, and the types and incidences of gene abnormalities by cancer type will be analyzed.
