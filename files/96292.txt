Time to Initiated Antitumor Therapy for Tumor Patients With COVID19 Infection
The goal of this observational study is to study the safety of initiation of antitumor therapy early after nucleic acid test turn negativity in tumor patients infected with COVID-19. The main questions aims to answer are:

* Whether initiation of antitumor therapy early after nucleic acid test turn negativity in tumor patients infected with COVID-19 increases adverse events related to antitumor therapy.
* Whether initiation of antitumor therapy early after nucleic acid test turn negativity in tumor patients infected with COVID-19 increases risk of re-infection of COVID-19.
* How initiation of antitumor therapy early after nucleic acid test turn negativity in tumor patients infected with COVID-19 affects QoL of tumor patients

Participants will be asked to answer the question about:

* the severity and duration of COVID-19 symptoms
* the date of diagnosis of COVID-19
* the date of negative nucleic acid test
* the QoL of life before infection with COVID-19, during infection of COVID-19, after nucleic acid test negativity and receiving antitumor therapy
Tumor|COVID-19
Incidence of adverse events after antitumor therapy, Incidence of adverse events after antitumor therapy, including hematologic toxicity,gastrointestinal adverse event, hepatobiliary adverse events, etc., 28 days after antitumor therapy|Re-infection of COVID-19, Antigen testing or nucleic acid testing positive for COVID-19, 28 days after antitumor therapy
Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in tumor patients, Symptoms and lab abnormality of COVID-19 in tumor patients, Until nucleic acid testing turn negative
