Study of Gefitinib Retreatment in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
A single arm, open label, prospective, phase II trial of Gefitinib retreatment for the advanced or metastatic (IIIb and IV) NSCLC patients who previously responded to gefitinib And progressive disease should be observed with at least one prior regimen following previous gefitinib failure.

Primary endpoint

* to assess Disease Control Rate (Remission + Stable disease)

Secondary endpoints

* to assess the progression free survival
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Gefitinib retreatment
Disease Control(DC) Rate of Gefitinib Retreatment Per RECIST Criteria (V1.1) and Assessed by CT, Evaluation of treatment response by computed tomography (CT) was performed after the first 4 weeks according to version 1.1 of the guidelines set out by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee. Disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the percentage sum of best tumor response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD)., 8 weeks
Progression - Free Survival of Patients Retreated With Gefitinib, Progression is defined, using RECIST (V1.1), as a measurable increase in the smallest dimension of any target or non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, since baseline using CT scan every 8 weeks., two year|Overall Survival, 2 years
