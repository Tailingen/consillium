Dose Escalation of Bevacizumab With Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring in Patients With Advanced Non-squamous NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to see if higher dose of bevacizumab can be taken safely by some patients and if changes in the dose of bevacizumab have any effect on blood pressure.
Advanced Non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pemetrexed|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg|DRUG: Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg
Change in 24 Hour Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), The change for each patient was calculated as mean 24 hour DBP during cycle 2 - mean 24 hour DBP during cycle 1, 2 cycles
Response Rate, Percentage of patients with a complete or partial response. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., 2 years|Change in Tumor Size From Baseline, 2 years|Progression Free Survival, Time to progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first, 2 years
Carboplatin and pemetrexed are FDA approved chemotherapy agents for patients with advanced non squamous non small cell lung cancer. Bevacizumab is also FDA approved in lung cancer , and the combination of all three drugs is promising. The doctors directing this research want to learn how to better personalize drug dosing of bevacizumab by identifying people who could safely take a higher dose of the drug.
