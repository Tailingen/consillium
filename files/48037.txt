The Purpose of This Study is to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of D-MNA in Adult Patients With Nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma
The goal of the study is to learn about the safety and how effective two different strengths of D-MNA compared to a placebo (a look-alike substance that contains no drug) in the treatment of nodular basal cell skin cancer
Nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: D-MNA 200 mcg|DRUG: D-MNA 100 mcg|OTHER: Placebo
Histological Clearance of Target Lesion, Proportion of subjects with complete histological clearance of the Target Lesion at Visit 5/EV, 29 to 34 days from enrollment into the study
Clinical Clearance of Target Lesion, Proportion of subjects with complete clinical clearance of the Target Lesion at Visit 5/EV., 29 to 34 days from enrollment into the study
A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of D-MNA which is administered as an intradermal injection in subjects with nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma (nBCC).

About 60 subjects will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will be randomly allocated to receive D-MNA or placebo injection on the identified target lesion once weekly for 3 weeks.

After two weeks, the target lesion will be excised.

An Interim Analysis will be done after 26-30 subjects would have completed Visit 5/ Excision Visit.
