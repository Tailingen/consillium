A Phase I Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Efficacy of BPI-21668
This study is an open-label, single arm, dose escalation and dose expansion phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of BPI-21668 in solid tumor patients. In dose escalation phase, biomarker status is not required, but in dose expansion phase patients are required to harbor PIK3CA mutation.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: BPI-21668
The adverse events (AEs), Safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring frequency, duration and severity of adverse events (AEs)., Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months|Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD will be based on DLT., Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months|Determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D), The RP2D will be based on DLT., Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months
Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BPI-21668, Based on blood plasma concentration, Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months|Determination of anti-tumor activity of BPI-21668, Efficacy assessments (tumor evaluation) will be performed per RECIST1.1, Through the Phase I, approximately 24 months
