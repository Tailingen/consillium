Standard of Care Chemotherapy Plus Pembrolizumab for Breast Cancer
The goal of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when administered in combination with either of two chemotherapy regimens (weekly paclitaxel or capecitabine) in unresectable/metastatic triple negative breast cancer (MTNBC) patients.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Capecitabine
Treatment-Associated Adverse Events Requiring Discontinuation, The count of participants who experienced serious adverse events and grade III/IV treatment-associated adverse events requiring discontinuation of pembrolizumab., 6 weeks|Number of Patients Who Complete Chemotherapy Without a Dose Delay of More Than 21 Days., The number of patients who complete 6 weeks of chemotherapy without requiring a dose delay of more than 21 days., 6 weeks
Overall Response Rate, Patients will have a computerized tomography (CT) scan (preferred) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at 12 weeks to measure the size of target lesions. The percentage of patients whose tumors respond to treatment at 12 weeks will be compared to historical controls. Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.", 12 weeks
In the pilot phase, patients will be enrolled to one of two experimental arms, which will be selected by the treating investigator (arm A: pembrolizumab + weekly paclitaxel; arm B: pembrolizumab + capecitabine).

Subjects will receive pembrolizumab via intravenous (IV) infusion at 200mg every three weeks (Q3W), and continue treatment Q3W until progression of disease, initiation of alternative cancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons to discontinue treatment occur, up to 24 months.

Paclitaxel will be administered intervenously on a weekly schedule at a dose of 80mg/m2.

Oral capecitabine will be administered at total daily dose of 4,000 mg (2,000 mg two times each day (abbreviated BID)). Capecitabine will be administered as intermittent therapy given on days 1-7 in 14-day cycles.
