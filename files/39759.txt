Cold Snare Polypectomy of Non-pedunculated Colorectal Adenomas
A prospective randomised controlled trial of cold vs hot snare polypectomy of non-pedunculated colorectal adenomas.
Colorectal Polyp
PROCEDURE: Cold snare polypectomy|PROCEDURE: Hot snare polypectomy
R0 resection rate, 14 days|Complete resection rate, 1 day
Incidence of local recurrence, 6 months|The immediate bleeding or immediate perforation rate after polypectomy, 1 day|Complication rate, 14 days|Use of submucosal injection, 1 day|Polyp retrieval rate, 1 day|The procedure time, 1 day
Diagnostic colonoscopy will be performed in all patients. If a polyp, appropriate for inclusion criteria, is identified, an endoscopic polypectomy will be assigned. All eligible polyps will be randomly assigned (1:1) to endoscopic polypectomy with either the cold snare resection or hot snare resection (control group). Randomization will be stratified using random numbers. After resection, the marginal mucosa will be carefully observed with used of magnification and image enhancement (near focus imaging or narrow band imaging) for determine residual tissue. The time period when the snare will be entered in the bowel lumen and until a polyp will be retrieved will be recorded by a stopwatch.

All polyps will be retrieved for morphological examination to estimate R0/R1resetion. After polypectomy all patients will be observed for 3-4 days in-hospital to diagnose and eliminate complications (delayed bleeding and perforations). All patients will have a control colonoscopy 6 months after polypectomy to investigate long-term results.
