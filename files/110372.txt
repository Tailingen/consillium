Phase 2 Study of ABT-869 in Combination With Paclitaxel Versus Paclitaxel Alone to Treat Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of ABT-869 plus paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone on disease progression in metastatic breast cancer.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: ABT-869|DRUG: paclitaxel|DRUG: Placebo for ABT-869
Progression-free survival, Radiographic evaluation every 3 months, clincial evaluation monthly
Overall survival, Subject death
Only the open-label lead-in portion of the study was enrolled (n=10). The randomized portion was not initiated. N = approximately 102 (90 randomized in a 1:1 ratio in Phase 2, approximately 6-12 enrolled in open-label lead-in to assess the tolerability of the combination) Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center study of the efficacy and tolerability of the ABT-869 + paclitaxel versus placebo for ABT-869 + paclitaxel in subjects with documented metastatic breast cancer in the first line metastatic therapy setting. An initial open-label, lead-in cohort of six subjects will be monitored for 2 cycles (8 weeks) to assess the PK interactions and the safety of the combination of 0.20 mg/kg QD ABT-869 and paclitaxel (90 mg/m2). Enrollment into the randomized portion will begin after a cohort has completed two cycles (8 weeks) of therapy and no toxicities prohibit the cohort from continuing on to Cycle 3. Alternative doses may be explored based on the tolerability of the combination.
