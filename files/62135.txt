Estimation of Economic Consequences Linked With Different Care Management Pathways of Differentiated Thyroid Cancers
The incidence of Thyroid Cancer (TC) has increased over the last thirty years, in France and worldwide. This increase is mainly due to good prognosis microPapillary TC (mPTC). Sixty percent of diagnosed cancers are considered as over-diagnosed, leading to an over-treatment of these cases. The increase of diagnosis of mPTC and its treatment inevitably leads to an increase of medical resources consumption and corresponding costs.

The primary aim of this study is to estimate the cost related to different care management pathway of TC patient during a lifetime period using a multi-state Markov model.

This is a retrospective, observational population based cohort study, using data from a cohort study of TC patients implemented by the ONCOMIP network which initially aimed to perform an audit of clinical practices for the management of TC, and from database of the French social health insurance of Midi-Pyrenees region to calculate observed costs of TC management during 24 months.
