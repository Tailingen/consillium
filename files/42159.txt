Pazopanib + Vinorelbine in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of Vinorelbine and Pazopanib that can be given together without causing severe side effects. Also, this study will evaluate what effects (good and bad) that the treatment has on patients and their cancer.
Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer|Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pazopanib|DRUG: Vinorelbine
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase II dose to be used in patients with metastatic NSCLC and breast cancer., at study completion (estimated at 2 years)
To determine the response rate, progression free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic NSCLC and metastatic breast cancer treated with pazopanib in combination with vinorelbine., imaging done every 6 weeks|To characterize dose limiting toxicities (DLT)., labs drawn weekly|To determine the pharmacokinetic effect of pazopanib on vinorelbine., labs drawn on days 1 and 22
This study involves an investigational drug called pazopanib in combination with the chemotherapy drug vinorelbine. An investigational drug is a drug that has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. Vinorelbine has been FDA approved to treat patients with NSCLC and breast cancer. Pazopanib is a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor, which means it may prevent the tumor from growing its own blood vessels thereby interfering with the growth of the tumor. Participants in this study will be assigned to one of three groups with each group receiving a higher dose of vinorelbine and pazopanib than the previous group. Vinorelbine will be given through a needle in the vein on days 1 and 8 of each 21 day study treatment cycle. Pazopanib is a pill which will be taken by mouth every day during the 21 day study treatment cycle.
