A Study of the Safety and Effects of EMD 72000 in Subjects With Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
EMD 72000 is an experimental, biological drug. Studies in animals indicate that EMD 72000 blocks a factor found on the surface of many cancer cells. The factor is called epidermal growth factor receptor or EGFR. One type of cancer which frequently contains EGFR is ovarian cancer. This study will test the safety and effects of EMD 72000 in subjects with EGFR-positive recurrent ovarian cancer following standard treatment that has failed.
