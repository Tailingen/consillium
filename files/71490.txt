Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) Guided Ethanol With Paclitaxel Ablation for Pancreatic Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm
Pancreatic cysts are becoming diagnosed more frequently due to the increased use and sensitivity of imaging. A subset of these cysts are pre-cancerous, therefore suggested treatment is surgery for removal. However, surgery involves significant risks and emerging opinion suggests that not all cysts need to be surgically removed. An alternative therapy would be ideal, in particular for those where surgical risk outweighs the benefits of resection. Ethanol and paclitaxel ablation of pancreatic cysts may be a viable alternative to surgical resection.

Our hypothesis is that ethanol with paclitaxel ablation is a safe and effective method for treatment in those with per-cancerous, mucinous pancreatic cysts.
