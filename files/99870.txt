Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III, Stage IV, or Relapsed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated With First-Line Chemotherapy
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill non-small cell lung cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the effects of gp96-Ig vaccine therapy in treating patients with stage III, stage IV, or relapsed non-small cell lung cancer treated with first-line chemotherapy.
Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Ad100-gp96Ig-HLA A1
Safety, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months post enrollment
Immunologic response: CD8, CD4 and NK response, Baseline, Day 1 Week1, Day 1 Week 13, Day 1 Week 19
Overall Goals:

- to evaluate the safety and induction of anti-tumor immunity by administration of an immunogenic human tumor cell vaccine, and assess immune response in relation to clinical outcome.

Primary Aim:

- to evaluate the safety of administering a heat shock protein gp96-Ig-secreting allogeneic tumor cell-vaccine (gp96-Ig vaccine) in patients with advanced NSCLC.

Secondary Aims:

* to study the immune response to vaccination,
* to monitor clinical responses and
* to recommend a dose-schedule combination for further testing in an initial Phase II trial of vaccine efficacy.
