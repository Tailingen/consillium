LLETZ With Videocolposcopy Versus LLETZ With Binocular Colposcopy
To assess the benefits of performing large Loop excision of the transformation Zone (LLETZ) using videocolposcopy compared to binocular colposcopy.
Uterine Cervical Dysplasia
DEVICE: LLETZ with videocolposcope|DEVICE: LLETZ with binocular colposcope
the resected cone mass, the resected cone mass will be quantified by weighing the removed tissue with a precision scale located in the operating room, 10 minutes
Margin status, Resection margin is judge as "R0" if abnormal cells are not found in the margin of the biopsy or "R1" if abnormal cells remain in the margin of the biopsy. The histopathological examination will be done by an Independent pathologist, 2 Days after conization|Operation time, the time from the beginning of the Operation (start of the electrosurgical method) until the end of the operation (the end of hemostatic interventions) will be measured in minutes, 20 minutes|Operative complications, Operative complications defined as necessity to intervene therapeutically up to 14 days postoperatively, 14 days|number of fragments of the surgical specimen, surgeons will count the number of the surgical specimen (1 vs. \>1), 10 minutes|The circumference of the surgical specimens, The circumference of the surgical specimens will be measured in cm, 2 Days after conization|the length of the surgical specimens, The length of The surgical specimens will be measured in cm, 2 Days after conization|the thickness of the surgical specimens, The thickness of The surgical specimens will be measured in cm, 2 Days after conization|handling of the device, surgeons will score their preference regarding the surgical method using an 11-step visual analogue scale (VAS) for ,(ranging from 0 (,very easy') to 10 (,very difficult'), 30 minutes|satisfaction with the device, surgeons will score their preference regarding the surgical method using an 11-step visual analogue scale (VAS) for ,satisfaction with the device' (ranging from 0 (,very satisfied') to 10 (,absolutely not satisfied'), 30 minutes|Time to complete intraoperative hemostasis, the time until complete hemostasis as judged by the surgeon has been achieved, will be measured in seconds, 120 seconds|Intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative blood loss will be measured using the difference in serum hemoglobin one day prior to surgery and within 5 hours postoperatively, 5 hours
