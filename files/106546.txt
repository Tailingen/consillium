HA-1H TCR T Cell for Relapsed/Persistent Hematologic Malignancies After Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation
This is a non-randomised, open-label phase I study of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) consisting of a HLA-A\*02:01 restricted HA-1H T cell receptor transduced T cell (MDG1021) immunotherapy for relapsed or persistent hematologic malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The aim of the study is to determine the recommended phase II dose of MDG1021.

Feasibility of manufacturing HA-1H TCR transducer T cells: proportion of patients for whom leukapheresis was feasible, Feasibility is determined by the proportion of patients for whom leukapheresis was feasible, for whom manufacturing MDG1021 was feasible, and whom received MDG1021 by intravenous infusion, Up to Day 0 after T cell infusion|Persistence and expansion of HA-1H transduced T cells in peripheral blood, To evaluate the persistence (flow cytometry with tetramers evaluating the % HA-1H transduced T cells among all T cells) and expansion of HA-1H transduced T cells (as % HA-1H transduced T cells among all T cells over time) in peripheral blood, Up to 12 months afterT cell infusion|Function of HA-1H TCR transduced T cells detectable in peripheral blood, To evaluate the function of HA-1H TCR transduced T cells detectable in peripheral blood by ELISA, measuring Interferon gamma production, Up to 12 months afterT cell infusion|Phenotype of HA-1H TCR transduced T cells detectable in peripheral blood, To evaluate the phenotype of HA-1H TCR transduced T cells detectable in peripheral blood by flow cytometry of T cell subtypes expressed in % of all T cells, Up to 12 months afterT cell infusion|Disappearance of recipient hematopoiesis (chimerism analysis) in the blood, To evaluate disappearance of recipient hematopoiesis (chimerism analysis) in the blood, Up to 12 months after T cell infusion|Disappearance of recipient hematopoiesis (chimerism analysis) in the bone marrow, To evaluate disappearance of recipient hematopoiesis (chimerism analysis) in the bone marrow, Up to 3 months after T cell infusion|Other explorative endpoints, To investigate biomarkers and molecular signatures, potentially related to safety, anti-tumor activity, the mode-of-action of MDG1021 and the pathophysiology of disease, Up to 12 months after T infusion
This phase I is designed to assess the safety and feasibility of a HLA-A\*02:01 restricted, HA-1H T cell receptor (TCR) transduced patient-derived T cell (MDG1021) immunotherapy, with secondary endpoints including preliminary efficacy, in patients with relapsed or persistent hematologic malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the dose-escalation part of the study, at least 9 patients will be treated with MDG1021 at 3 different doses to assess the safety and the maximum tolerated dose using a standard 3+3 cohort design. Thereafter, the selected optimal MDG1021 dose will be assessed for safety and preliminary efficacy in 20 additional patients during the dose-expansion part of the study. Manufacturing feasibility will be determined. MDG1021 will be administered by single intravenous infusion.

HA-1H is exclusively expressed on cells of the hematopoietic system. If the patient's blood-cells, and thus lymphoma or leukemic cells, carry the immunogenic version of the HA-1H antigen on their surface and the donor stem cells do not, MDG1021 immunotherapy could eradicate the patient's cancer cells and allow the donor stem cells to repopulate the patient's blood forming system.
