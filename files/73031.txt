Treatment of T1N0 Invasive Breast Carcinoma by Local Excision Implant
The purpose of this study is to evaluate radiation therapy directed to a small region of the breast in women who were recently diagnosed with early stage invasive breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Interstitial Implant Brachytherapy
To determine if interstitial implant brachytherapy to radical radiation doses is feasible following wide local excision of T1N0 breast carcinoma, 3 years
* When participants undergo surgery to remove the tumor (lumpectomy), it will be followed by the placement of small flexible tubes throughout the region surrounding the site of operation. These tubes will remain in place for 7-9 days following the surgery.
* The first 2-3 days, the tubes will not contain radioactivity. This time is used to do all the calculations necessary for treatment and to check the findings in the breast tissue that was removed. After 2-3 days, the tubes will be filled with a radioactive wire which will remain in place for the next 5 days. During this period of time, participants will be required to remain within the hospital. At the end of these 5 days, the radioactive wires and tubes will be removed.
