Phase II, two arm prospective study of efficacy and safety of ELENAGEN in combination with gemcitabine in comparison with gemcitabine alone in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|BIOLOGICAL: ELENAGEN
Progression-free survival (PFS), Median duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression by RESIST 1.1 criterion or death, 2 years since the start of treatment
Safety of Elenagen in combination with Gemcitabine, Frequency of drug-related adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) according to NCI CTCAE version 5.0., 1 year after the start of treatment
The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of ELENAGEN, a novel anticancer therapeutics (plasmid DNA encoding p62/SQSTM1) protein, as an adjuvant to chemotherapy with Gemcitabin (GEM) in patients with advanced platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

This is a prospective randomized multi-center study with two arms. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 days 1,8 every 3 weeks) is administered in both arms: In the Chemo arm (n = 20) Gemcitabine is the only treatment, and in the ELENAGEN arm (n = 20) GEM was supplemented with ELENAGEN (2.5 mg i.m. weekly). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoint is safety.
