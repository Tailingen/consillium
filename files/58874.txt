Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative procedure for patients with hematological malignancies.Donor-recipient human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatibility plays a key role in successful allo-HSCT as HLA-matching has a direct impact on the risk of GvHD, non-relapse mortality (NRM), and survival. Suitable, matched or haploidentical donors are not always available or accessible, even in the era of the international registries.Therefore, there is a need for new strategies that could negate the barrier of HLA-mismatching, allowing allo-HSCT from traditionally prohibitive highly mismatched donors.The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Beijing protocol in malignant haematologic disease patients receiving more than 5/10 HLA-mismatched allo-HSCT.
