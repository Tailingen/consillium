Comparing MRI-Ultrasound Fusion and Cognitive-guided Biopsy for the Detection of csPCa: the PROFUSION Trial
This study is an international multicentre RCT to compare the linically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection of cognitive-guided and MRI-USG guided biopsies in men with suspicious MRI lesion.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: MRI-USG fusion approach|PROCEDURE: Cognitive-guided approach
Proportion of men with clinically significant Prostate cancer(csPCa), ISUP Grade 2 or above prostate cancer diagnosed on biopsy, When histology results available, at an expected average of 30 days post-biopsy
Proportion of men with a diagnosis of csPCa in MRI lesions with maximal size ≤10mm versus >10mm, MRI lesions with maximal size ≤10mm versus \>10mm, When histology results available, at an expected average of 30 days post-biopsy|Proportion of men with a diagnosis of csPCa in prostate size of ≤50ml vs >50m, prostate size of ≤50ml vs \>50ml, When histology results available, at an expected average of 30 days post-biopsy|The proportion of men with a diagnosis of csPCa only in targeted biopsy, ISUP Grade 2 or above prostate cancer diagnosed on biopsy, When histology results available, at an expected average of 30 days post-biopsy|Proportion of men with a diagnosis of csPCa only in systemic biopsy, ISUP Grade 2 or above prostate cancer diagnosed on biopsy, When histology results available, at an expected average of 30 days post-biopsy|Proportion of men with a diagnosis of clinically insignificant PCa,, ISUP grade group 1 Prostate cancer diagnosed on biopsy, When histology results available, at an expected average of 30 days post-biopsy|Procedure time, Total time of procedure, During biopsy procedure|Pain score on a scale of 0-10 taken after biopsy, The higher the score, the more pain, Immediately After biopsy procedure|Proportion of men with post-biopsy adverse events within 30 days after biopsy, The severity of Adverse event is grade by Clavien-Dindo classification, 30 days post biopsy
This study is an international multicentre RCT to compare the csPCa detection of cognitive-guided and MRI-USG guided biopsies in men with suspicious MRI lesion. This is a phase III randomised controlled trial to evaluate the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) by MRI-USG fusion approach (MRUS arm) versus Cognitive-guided approach (COG arm). The study hypothesis is that MRUS arm is superior to COG arm in detecting csPCa. The result of this RCT would impact how MRI-guided prostate biopsies should be done in the future. If the MRI-USG fusion approach is superior to cognitive-guidance in csPCa detection, it should be the standard of practice in the future, and dedicated MRI-USG fusion equipment should be available in centres performing prostate biopsies.
