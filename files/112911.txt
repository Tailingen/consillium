A Study of an Investigational Medication for the Treatment of Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients on Dialysis
This 6 month study will assess an investigational medication for patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. The study will look at the effects on parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphorus levels.
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism|End Stage Renal Disease
DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: AMG 073
To evaluate the efficacy of AMG 073 compared with placebo by determining the proportion of subjects with a mean intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) value <= 250 pg/mL (26.5 pmol/L) during the efficacy assessment phase., Efficacy Assessment phase - final 10 weeks of study
To evaluate the efficacy of AMG 073 compared with placebo by determining: the proportion of subjects with a reduction from baseline in mean iPTH of >= 30% during the efficacy assessment phase, Efficacy Assessment phase - final 10 weeks of study|To evaluate the efficacy of AMG 073 compared with placebo by determining: percentage change from baseline in iPTH during the efficacy assessment phase, Efficacy Assessment phase - final 10 weeks of study|To evaluate the safety of AMG 073 compared with placebo, Entire study - 26 weeks
