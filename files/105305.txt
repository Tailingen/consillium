GV 1001 Immunotherapy in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
To examine the safety and efficacy of telomerase peptide vaccination ( stimulation of the immune system) in patients with NSCLC after having been treated with conventional therapy with radiotherapy and docetaxel as a radiosensitizer.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
BIOLOGICAL: GV 1001 Telomerase peptide
To examine if combined chemoradiotherapy in patients with NSCLC followed by vaccination( immunotherapy) will increase the immunological response compared to previous experience
Number of T cell responders and DTH responders, time to progression of disease
Survival in patients with locally advanced, inoperable NSCLC may be improved if local control can be achieved with concurrent chemo radiotherapy .After completed standard chemo-and radiation therapy; the safety and efficacy of vaccination therapy will be measured as time to progression after treatment with GV1001. Analysis of changes in T-cell subpopulations and cytokines in peripheral blood will be performed.
