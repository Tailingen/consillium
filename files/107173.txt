Locally Advanced NSCLC Treated With Radiochemotherapy: Phase 2 Study on the Value of a Stereotactic Boost
This is a monocentric, non-randomized, open-label, superiority phase II clinical investigation evaluating the efficacy of additional Cyberknife irradiation after a doublet of Platinum Salts-based chemotherapy and concomitant radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), with an interim analysis.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
RADIATION: Cyberknife irradiation
To evaluate progression-free survival at 24 months after additional Cyberknife irradiation following concomitant radio-chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)., Progression-free survival at 24 months will be assessed by calculating the time between the date of inclusion and the date of progression (according to RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death from any cause whichever come first. Patients who have not progressed, died or been lost to follow-up at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last news., 24 months
Evaluate overall survival at 24 months and at 60 months, Overall survival at 24 months and at 60 months will be assessed by calculating the time between the date of inclusion and the date of death from all causes. Patients who have not died or been lost to follow-up at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last news., 60 months|Evaluate specific survival at 24 months and at 60 months, Specific survival at 24 months and at 60 months will be assessed by calculating the time between the inclusion and the date of cancer-related death. Patients who have not died or been lost to follow-up at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last news., 60 months|Evaluate the efficacy of the additional Cyberknife irradiation following concomitant radio-chemotherapy at 24 months, The overall response rate (complete or partial response, stabilization, progression) at 24 months will be defined by RECIST v 1.1 criteria. The objective response rate (CR or PR) will be estimated as the number of patients with a documented complete or partial response, divided by the number of analyzable patients, described for each evaluation. The median duration of response will be given with its 95% confidence interval., 24 months|Evaluate overall tolerability of the additional Cyberknife irradiation following concomitant radio-chemotherapy at 24 months, The overall tolerability of the additional Cyberknife irradiation following concomitant radio-chemotherapy throughout patient participation will be evaluated by clinical and biological means and rated according to the NCI CTCAE V5.0 scale., 24 months|Evaluate overall quality of life before Cyberknife, 1 month post-Cyberknife and 6 months post-Cyberknife, Quality of life will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (items 29-30)., 7 months|Identify 18FDG PET/CT imaging biomarkers, at baseline (such as Total tumor metabolic volume) or on early follow-up scans (such as PERCIST criteria or residual tumor volume), to predict overall survival at 24 months and at 60 months, The performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, area under the ROC curve) of PERCIST criteria ant total Tumor metabolic volume will be evaluated in terms of overall survival at 24 months and at 60 months.

Overall survival at 24 months and at 60 months will be assessed by calculating the time between the date of inclusion and the date of death from all causes. Patients who have not died or been lost to follow-up at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last news., 60 months|Identify 18FDG PET/CT imaging biomarkers, at baseline (such as Total tumor metabolic volume) or on early follow-up scans (such as PERCIST criteria and residual tumor volume), to predict progression-free survival at 24 months and at 60 months, The performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, area under the ROC curve) of PERCIST criteria ant total Tumor metabolic volume will be evaluated in terms progression-free survival at 24 months and at 60 months.

Progression-free survival at 24 months and at 60 months will be assessed by calculating the time between the date of inclusion and the date of progression (according to RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death from any cause whichever come first.
