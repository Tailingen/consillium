The Physical and Psychological Benefits of Yoga and Breast Cancer
Breast Cancer is the most common cancer amongst Canadian women. Studies report that breast cancer patients are the most likely to use complementary medicine within the oncologic population. Yoga has become especially popular with this group as it promises to improve the mind, body and soul holistically. The investigators yoga program specifically focuses on rebuilding physical strength, increasing flexibility and reducing the pain and stress associated with the post-operative period. This study will examine how yoga can help improve the overall quality of life and its effects on the physical well-being of women with breast cancer. With positive statistical results, the investigators hope to implement yoga as part of their rehabilitation services at the Cedars Breast Clinic.

Proposed Intervention:

1-hour hatha yoga classes, once a week for a 12-week period. One class will be offered in French, another in English. The class will begin with approximately 10 minutes of pranayama (breathing exercises) and meditation, followed by 30 minutes of yoga poses and ending with 10 minutes of sivasana (rest period.) The first couple of classes in the 12 week series will begin with restorative postures and will gradually progress to more gentle exercises. If health permits, the last couple of classes will involve some strengthening poses. A small portion of the class will work with the physical body in general and there will be a specific emphasis on the physical difficulties faced by most breast cancer patients, i.e. neck, chest, shoulders arms and hands.
