A Study of Vanucizumab (RO5520985) Alone or in Combination With Atezolizumab in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This multi-center, open-label study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy of vanucizumab as a single agent or in combination with atezolizumab in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Cohorts of participants will receive escalating doses of vanucizumab, fixed dose of vanucizumab (MTD and/or recommended phase two dose \[RP2D\]), and fixed dose of vanucizumab in combination with atezolizumab, intravenously every 2 weeks.
