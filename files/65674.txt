HPV-based Screening Among Women 23-29 Years of Age
The aim of the trial is to determine whether organized screening with primary HPV analysis provide higher cancer protection in the age group 23-29 years compared to primary cytology.

The aim is to investigate whether primary HPV analysis in the organized cell sampling program for women in the age group 23-29 provides higher cancer protection compared to the current method where cell samples are primarily analyzed with cytology. In this study, all women in the age group 23-29 in the Stockholm and Sk√•ne Region of Sweden will participate. Age is defined by year of birth. For 2020, women born 1991-1997 are included. Sampling and collection of samples is the same as for cytology.
