Blood and Tissue Sample Collection for Future Colon Cancer Biomarker Studies in Patients Undergoing Colonoscopy
RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of blood and tissue from patients undergoing colonoscopy to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about colon cancer and identify biomarkers related to colon cancer in the future.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is collecting blood and tissue samples for future colon cancer biomarker studies in patients undergoing colonoscopy.
Colorectal Cancer|Health Status Unknown
OTHER: biologic sample preservation procedure|PROCEDURE: diagnostic colonoscopy
Collection of blood and tissue, Pre-op & during surgery
OBJECTIVES:

* Collect blood and tissue samples (including polyps, abnormal growths, cancer, and normal tissue) from patients undergoing colonoscopy.

OUTLINE: Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection during colonoscopy. Samples are stored for future biomarker proteomic profiling.
