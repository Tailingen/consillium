Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as Monotherapy in Participants With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (MK-3475-224/KEYNOTE-224)
This is a efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) as monotherapy in participants with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two cohorts: participants with advanced HCC and with no curative option after disease progression on sorafenib or intolerance of sorafenib (Cohort 1) or who had not received treatment for systemic disease (Cohort 2). Study participants may receive pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks for up to 35 initial cycles (up to approximately 2 years) and a potential additional 17 cycles in a re-treatment phase (approximately an additional 1 year of treatment) .

The primary objective of this study is to determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab given as monotherapy in participants with HCC.

Effective with Amendment 7: Upon study completion, participants are discontinued and may be enrolled in a pembrolizumab extension study, if available.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a confirmed Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target and non-target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded central imaging vendor. Participants with missing data were considered non-responders. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR or PR per RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to approximately 34 months for Cohort 1 and up to approximately 28 months for Cohort 2
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was determined in participants who demonstrated a confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions) or Partial Response (PR: ≥30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target and non-target lesions) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded central imaging vendor. DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of a CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. Participants who had not progressed, started a new anti-cancer therapy, been lost to follow-up, or died at the time of analysis were censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, OR unequivocal progression for non-target lesions, OR appearance of one or more new lesions. The DOR per RECIST 1.1 for all participants who had a confirmed CR or PR is presented., Up to approximately 34 months for Cohort 1 and up to approximately 28 months for Cohort 2|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a CR (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions), PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target and non-target lesions), or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease \[PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, OR unequivocal progression for non-target lesions, OR appearance of one or more new lesions.\]). CR, PR, and SD were evaluated per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded central imaging vendor. Participants with missing data were considered as participants whose disease was not under control. The percentage of participants who experienced a confirmed CR, PR, or SD is reported., Up to approximately 34 months for Cohort 1 and up to approximately 28 months for Cohort 2|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from the first dose to the first documented disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded central imaging vendor. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, OR unequivocal progression for non-target lesions, OR appearance of one or more new lesions. If there was no documented disease progression, TTP was censored at last tumor assessment date. The TTP was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. TTP per RECIST 1.1 is presented., Up to approximately 34 months for Cohort 1 and up to approximately 28 months for Cohort 2|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the first dose to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as assessed by blinded central imaging vendor. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, OR unequivocal progression for non-target lesions, OR appearance of one or more new lesions. If there was no disease progression or death, participants were censored at the date of their last disease assessment. The PFS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. PFS is presented., Up to approximately 34 months for Cohort 1 and up to approximately 28 months for Cohort 2|Overall Survival (OS), OS was determined for all participants and was defined as the time from the first dose to death due to any cause. Participants were censored at the last known alive date. The OS was analyzed using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data. The OS is presented., Up to approximately 34 months for Cohort 1 and up to approximately 28 months for Cohort 2|Number of Participants Who Experienced At Least One Adverse Event (AE), An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an adverse event. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented. Per protocol, final analysis for this outcome measure was planned to be performed during the first course of therapy only., Up to approximately 34 months for Cohort 1 and up to approximately 28 months for Cohort 2|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product, is also an adverse event. The number of participants who discontinued study treatment due to an AE is presented. Per protocol, final analysis for this outcome measure was planned to be performed during the first course of therapy only., Up to approximately 34 months for Cohort 1 and up to approximately 28 months for Cohort 2
