Levels of Circulating Tumor DNA as a Predictive Marker for Early Switch in Treatment for Patients With Metastatic (Stage IV) Breast Cancer
The majority of patients (pts) with breast cancer have hormone receptor positive (HR+) disease, and this holds true for pts with advanced breast cancer (ABC). Currently frontline therapy for pts with HR+ ABC is antihormonal therapy with an aromatase inhibitor or selective estrogen receptor degrader plus a CDK4/6i. The proposed trial is a randomized study to further evaluate the potential benefit of switching a frontline regimen at the time that a molecular signal, ctDNA, suggests progression prior to detection of clinical progression using standard methods. The purpose of this study is to determine whether switching treatment earlier in the disease process, based on molecular progression, will increase the amount of time that a patient's metastatic breast cancer is controlled compared to patients with metastatic breast cancer who receive treatment later based on diagnostic imaging results or other methods currently used in medical practice.

Progression-Free Survival 1 (PFS1) Among Participants in Step 2, PFS1 is defined as the elapsed time from the date of randomization (at time a rise in ctDNA ratio \> 1 is detected prior to clinical progression) to the date of clinical progression or death as determined by standard clinical methods or death in randomized participants., Up to 36 months
Overall Response Rate (ORR), The overall response rate (ORR) will be defined as the percentage of participants achieving best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to protocol therapy. Response will be assessed by treating physician using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1., Up to 36 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), The clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the percentage of patients with best treatment response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) will be reported. Response will be assessed by treating physician using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1., Up to 36 months|Progression-Free Survival 2 (PFS2) Among Participants in Step 3, PFS in Step 3, which will be called PFS2, and is defined as the elapsed time from the date of documented first clinical progression to date of second clinical progression or death., Up to 36 months|Number of participants in Step 1 with rising ctDNA ratio > 1, The number of participants with rising circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) ratio \> 1 and no synchronous clinical progression in Step 1 will be reported., Up to 36 months|Percentage of participants in Step 1 with rising ctDNA ratio > 1, The percentage of participants with rising ctDNA ratio \> 1 and no synchronous clinical progression in Step 1 will be reported., Up to 36 months|Median time from enrollment to rise in ctDNA ratio > 1 for Participants in Step 1, The median time from enrollment to rise in ctDNA ratio \> 1 in participants in Step1 without synchronous clinical progression will be reported., Up to 36 months
