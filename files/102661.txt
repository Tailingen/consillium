A Study of Trastuzumab Emtansine in Combination With Atezolizumab or Placebo as a Treatment for Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 (HER2)-Positive and Programmed Death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-Positive Locally Advanced (LABC) or Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and patient-reported outcomes of trastuzumab emtansine plus atezolizumab compared with trastuzumab emtansine plus placebo in participants with HER2-positive and PD-L1-positive LABC or MBC.Participants must have progressed either during or after prior trastuzumab- (+/- pertuzumab) and taxane-based therapy for LABC/MBC; or during (or within 6 months after completing) trastuzumab- (+/-pertuzumab) and taxane-based therapy in the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting.
