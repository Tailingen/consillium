RC48-ADC in Adjuvant/Salvage Treatment of HER2 Positive Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous RC48-ADC in adjuvant/salvage treatment of HER2 positive high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
DRUG: RC48-ADC
12-month recurence-free survival rate, The probability of patients remaining free of high-risk NMIBC or worse for at least 12 months after first dose of RC48-ADC adjuvant treatment, From treatment initiation to 12 month|3-month pathological complete response rate, The proportion of patients are negative for urine cytology and cystoscopy at 3 month after first dose of RC48-ADC salvage treatment, From treatment initiation to 3 month|Adverse events, The type, incidence, relatedness, and severity of adverse events, From patient screening to 30 days after end of cycle 6
6-month recurence-free survival rate, The probability of patients remaining free of high-risk NMIBC or worse for at least 6 months after first dose of RC48-ADC adjuvant treatment, From treatment initiation to 6 month|Duration of response, Time from complete response to recurrence of any disease, From time of complete response to up to 60 months|Recurrence-free survival, Time from first dose of RC48-ADC adjuvant treatment to high-risk NMIBC recurrence or worse, From time of first dose of RC48-ADC adjuvant treatment to up to 60 months|Progression-free survival, Time from first dose of RC48-ADC treatment to progression to higher stage or death, From time of first dose of RC48-ADC treatment to up to 60 months|Overall survival, Time from first dose of RC48-ADC treatment to death from any cause, From time of first dose of RC48-ADC treatment to up to 60 months|Quality of life assessed by EQ-5D scale, Assessed by eEuroQoL EQ-5D scale, higher scores mean better outcomes, After every cycle of treatment and 30 days after end of cycle 6
This study is a multicenter phase II study, which aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous RC48-ADC in adjuvant/salvage treatment of HER2 positive high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
