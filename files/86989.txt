Tumor angiogenesis is very important in the occurrence and development of soft tissue sarcoma. The current clinical studies of molecularly targeted drugs are focused on the advanced treatment stage of soft tissue sarcoma. Anti-angiogenic drugs are not yet available in the neoadjuvant treatment stage of soft tissue sarcoma. Strong evidence. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of pegylated doxorubicin liposomes combined with the anti-angiogenic drug Anlotinib for neoadjuvant treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcoma.
