Neoadjuvant Sunitinib With Paclitaxel/Carboplatin in Patients With Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
This trial will examine the combination of sunitinib plus paclitaxel and carboplatin as neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Sunitinib
Phase II: The Number of Subjects Exhibiting Pathologic Complete Response to Neoadjuvant Treatment With Sunitinib/Paclitaxel/Carboplatin, Pathologic complete response (PCR) is defined as no residual invasive breast cancer in final breast or axillary lymph node samples., at weeks 26-30
Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Assessments will be made through analysis of reported incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) at the phase II dose, Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4-week cycle up to 24 weeks during neoadjuvant treatment, and every 4 weeks during maintenance treatment|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Assessed by clinical, radiologic and surgical determinations before and after neoadjuvant therapy. Measurable lesions will be defined by RECIST criteria v1.1., Days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle, minimum of 12 weeks|Disease-free Survival, Defined as the time between day of surgery to first documented disease occurrence or death due to any cause., every 4 weeks from date of surgery until treatment discontinuation or death, expected average 18 months|Overall Survival (OS), Defined as the time between Day 1 Cycle 1 to time of death from any cause., 24 months
This open label, Phase I/II trial is designed to evaluate the combination of sunitinib plus paclitaxel and carboplatin as neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced breast cancer. The Phase I portion of this study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of paclitaxel, sunitinib and carboplatin that can be used together as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. The MTD identified in the Phase I portion of the study will be used in the Phase II portion which will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of neoadjuvant sunitinib/paclitaxel/carboplatin given for 6 cycles in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.
