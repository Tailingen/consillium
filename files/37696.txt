Shared Decision Making and Satisfaction With the Diagnostic-therapeutic Process in the Shared Decision Making and Satisfaction With Colorectal Cancer Screening. The CyDESA Study
A cross sectional multicenter study (3 centers) to know the participation in decision making and the experience and satisfaction of participants with a positive immunological fecal test (FIT) result in relation to the screening process and the diagnostic-therapeutic process of cancer.

We will include 850 participants with a positive FIT result and will classify them by their final diagnosis (false positives of FIT; polyps; colo-rectal cancer).

Outcomes of interest will be measured by auto administered questionnaires:

collaboRATE, SDM-Q-9, OUT-PATSAT35 and a satisfaction questionnaire developed in a previous study.
