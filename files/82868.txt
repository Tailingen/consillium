Quality of life is defined as "an individual's perception of his place in life, in the context of culture and value system in which he lives, in relation to its goals, expectations, standards and concerns "(WHO 1993).

This concept refers to multiple dimensions, both objective and subjective:

* The physical condition of the person, his functional abilities;
* His somatic sensations;
* His psychological health;
* His social status, relational environment.

This concept focuses on perception's basics. Quality of life is a criteria supposed to be objective even though it is subject to subjective interpretation at the highest point. Indeed, if the quality of life varies depending on the discretion of each person, it also changes over time: it refers to a situation at a given moment and not to a stable state.

Therefore in this study, it seemed appropriate to show the concept of "quality of life objective" which is linked to objective data measures recognized criteria for evaluating the elderly. These criteria are repeatable, validated and not dependent operator.

This process completely matches with the actions promoted by the 2009-2013 Cancer Plan (measures 23 and 26) on the basis of an improvement of:

* The quality of consideration of the psychosocial dimension (customization accompaniment, living environment, social, involvement, ..)
* The quality of the integration of physical and psychological dangers inherent to this weakness situation induced by cancer.
