Pilot Study of Model Based Iterative Reconstruction Using 64-Slice
This study is being performed to confirm that the new technique, Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) with reduced radiation dose can deliver equivalent image quality for CT scans compared to current techniques (Filtered Back Projection with Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction (FBP with ASiR) and also to demonstrate that MBIR can improve general image quality characteristics at equivalent radiation dose levels.

Evidence for reduced x-ray radiation exposure for applicable patient indications, Ultra-low radiation dose images reconstructed with MBIR yield similar anatomic and pathologic information compared to routine radiation dose images reconstructed with Filtered Back Projection (FBP) in the central nervous system (CNS), thorax, and abdomen., Side by side comparison once both scans have been performed
