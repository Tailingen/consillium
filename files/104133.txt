A Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetic and Anti-tumor Activity of RO7428731 in Participants With Glioblastoma
This is an open-label, multicenter study to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy of RO7428731 administered as a monotherapy in participants with newly diagnosed or recurrent epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII)-positive glioblastoma (GBM).
