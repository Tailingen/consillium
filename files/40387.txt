This study is a multi-regional, open-label, multiple-dose administration dose-escalation and dose-expansion study, including a Dose-Escalation Phase (Ia) and a Dose-Expansion Phase (Ib).

HF158K1 contains multiple copies of the targeting antibody on liposome surface. It is designed to bind and deliver the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin to tumor cells at even very low HER2 expression levels. The study recruits patients with unresectable or metastatic advanced solid tumors (HER-2 positive (IHC 3+, or IHC 2+ with ISH +) or HER-2 low expression (IHC 2+ with ISH -, or IHC 1+)) who have failed or are intolerant (disease progression, or intolerance to chemotherapy, targeted therapy, etc.) to standard treatment, or currently have no available treatment regimen.

Phase 1a(Dose escalation) will assess the safety，tolerability，pharmacokinetics of HF158K1 in participants to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of HF158K1 through the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

Phase 1b(Dose expansion) will assess safety and preliminary efficacy of HF158K1 in participants with specific tumor types in selected dose groups.
