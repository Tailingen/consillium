Phase I Study of HC-7366 for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
To find a recommended dose of HC-7366 to patients with AML. The safety and effects of this drug combination will also be studied.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: HC-7366
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

- To evaluate safety of HC-7366

Secondary Objectives:

* To estimate rate of CR/CRh/CRi by 4 cycles
* To estimate overall response rate (ORR)
* To estimate rate of MRD negative by 4 cycles
* To estimate overall survival (OS)
* To estimate relapse-free survival (RFS)

Exploratory Objectives

* To determine the plasma concentration and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of HC-7366 when dosed in combination with azole antifungals in AML patients.
* To estimate duration of response (DOR)
* To estimate median time to blood count recovery
* To estimate median time to first response
* To estimate median time to negative MRD
* To study drug-drug interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitor azole antifungals
* Additional response and survival endpoints.
* To explore biomarkers of response, pathway engagement, and resistance
