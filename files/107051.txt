Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Relapsed Prostate Cancer After Surgery
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known which radiation therapy regimen is more effective in treating patients with relapsed prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying the side effects of radiation therapy and comparing two radiation therapy regimens in treating patients with relapsed prostate cancer after surgery.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: radiation therapy
Freedom from biochemical progression, from the day of trial randomization to the day of either first recorded biochemical progression, clinical progression or death due to clinical progression up to 10 years.
Clinical progression-free survival, from the day of randomization to the day of the first record of either local or regional recurrence, distant recurrence, start of hormonal treatment, or death due to any cause up to 10 years.|Time to hormonal treatment, time from trial randomization to start of hormonal treatment up to 10 years.|Prostate cancer-specific survival, time from trial randomization to the date of death due to prostate cancer up to 10 years.|Overall survival, time from trial randomization to the date of death from any cause up to 10 years.|Acute and late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity according to CTCAE v 4.0, occurring during treatment and up to 3 months after completion of treatment. Late toxicity is defined as occurring later than 3 months after end of treatment.
OBJECTIVES:

* To determine the tumor control in patients with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer without macroscopic disease treated with dose-intensive salvage radiotherapy.
* To determine the toxicity in these patients.
* To determine the quality of life of these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to Gleason score (≥ 8 vs 7 vs ≤ 6), pathological tumor classification (pT3b vs others), lymphadenectomy performed (yes \[pN0\] vs no \[cN0\]), persistent PSA after prostatectomy (detectable \[≥ 0.1 ng/mL\] vs undetectable \[\< 0.1 ng/mL\]), PSA at randomization (\> 0.5 ng/mL vs ≤ 0.5 ng/mL), participating center, and radiotherapy technique (3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy \[3D-CRT\] vs intensity-modulated radiation therapy \[IMRT\]/rotational techniques). Patient are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm A: Beginning at least 12 weeks after surgery, patients undergo radiotherapy\* once a day, 5 days a week, for 6.4 weeks for a total dose of 64 Gy (in 32 fractions of 2 Gy over 6.4 weeks).
* Arm B: Patients undergo radiotherapy\* once a day, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks for a total dose of 70 Gy (in 35 fractions of 2 Gy over 7 weeks).

NOTE: \*3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, rotational techniques such as Tomotherapy®, Rapidarc®, or intensity-modulated arc technique and volumetric-modulated arc therapy are all eligible.

Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after completing study therapy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years and then every 12 months for up to 10 years.
