Anti-CLL1 CAR T-cell Therapy in CLL1 Positive Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This is a single center, open-label phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-CLL1 chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cell immunotherapy (CART) in the treatment of CLL1 positive relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: anti-CLL1 CART
Number of Adverse Events, Adverse events are evaluated with CTCAE V5.0, 12 months
Overall response rate (ORR), ORR includes CR, CRi, MLFS and PR. Complete remission (CR)#Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of circulating blasts and blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; absolute neutrophil count \>1.0x 10\^9/L; platelet count \>100x10\^9/L. CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi)#All CR criteria except for residual neutropenia (\<1.0x10\^9/L) or thrombocytopenia (\<100x10\^9/L). Morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS): Bone marrow blasts \<5%; absence of blasts with Auer rods; absence of extramedullary disease; no hematologic recovery required. Partial remission (PR): All hematologic criteria of CR; decrease of bone marrow blast percentage to 5% to 25%; and decrease of pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage by at least 50%., 2 years|overall survival (OS), The date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause, 2 years|Event-free survival (EFS), Time from enrollment to the date of primary refractory disease, or relapse from CR or CRi, or death from any cause, 2 years|Cumulative incidence of relapse(CIR), Time from the date of achievement of a remission to the date of relapse, 2 years
The patients will receive infusion of anti-CLL1 CAR T-cells to confirm the safety and efficacy of anti-CLL1 CAR T-cells in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.
