Rigid Versus Flexible Cystoscopy in Women
The study will help define the best tolerated approach to cystoscopy in women by randomly comparing flexible to rigid cystoscopy. Previous randomized studies evaluated rigid cystoscopy under general anesthesia versus flexible cystoscopy under local anesthesia. As a result of these studies, flexible cystoscopy is performed in the clinic setting generally in males. However, many women have rigid cystoscopy performed in the clinic while the men have flexible cystoscopy. No studies to date have evaluated whether flexible cystoscopy is better tolerated in women compared to rigid cystoscopy in women in the clinic setting.
