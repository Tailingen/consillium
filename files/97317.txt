10-Propargyl-10-Deazaaminopterin Plus Probenecid in Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Probenecid may increase the effectiveness of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin and probenecid in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
DRUG: pralatrexate|DRUG: probenecid
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin and probenecid in patients with advanced solid tumors.
* Determine the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of 10-propargyl-10-deazaaminopterin (PDX) and probenecid.

Patients receive probenecid IV and PDX IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive sequentially escalating doses of probenecid and PDX until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35-40 patients will be accrued for this study.
