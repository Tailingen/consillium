Comparing Detection of Standard Colonoscopy, CAD-EYE and Combined CAD-EYE and G-EYE® Aided Colonoscopy
The purpose of this study is to compare the additional diagnostic yield over Standard Colonoscopy (i.e., the adenoma miss-rate reduction) obtained by performing CADEYE and G-EYE® aided colonoscopy, vs. the additional diagnostic yield over Standard Colonoscopy (i.e., the adenoma miss-rate reduction) obtained by performing CAD-EYE aided colonoscopy.
Colorectal Cancer|Adenoma
DEVICE: Standard Colonoscopy|DEVICE: G-EYE Colonoscopy|DEVICE: CAD-EYE
Additional Adenoma Detection, Additional adenoma detection yield (represented by the miss rate) of CAD-EYE and G-EYE® colonoscopy over standard colonoscopy compared to the additional adenoma detection yield of CAD-EYE aided colonoscopy over standard colonoscopy, Upon histology results (up to 30 days)
The purpose of this study is to compare the additional diagnostic yield over Standard Colonoscopy (i.e., the adenoma miss-rate reduction) obtained by performing CADEYE and G-EYE® aided colonoscopy, vs. the additional diagnostic yield over Standard Colonoscopy (i.e., the adenoma miss-rate reduction) obtained by performing CAD-EYE aided colonoscopy. This is a single-center, four-arm dual-tandem, randomized, open-label study intended to compare the additional detection yield beyond standard colonoscopy obtained by performing combined CAD-EYE and G-EYE® high definition colonoscopy vs. the additional detection yield beyond standard colonoscopy obtained by performing CAD-EYE high definition colonoscopy. Consecutive adult subjects who were referred for elective colonoscopy will be asked to enroll into this randomized clinical study if the candidate meets the study inclusion and exclusion criteria
