Predictive Value of FMISO-PET, FDG-PET-CT, DWI-MRI and DCE-MRI Scans for Patients With Anal Cancer Receiving Radiotherapy +/- Chemotherapy
The purpose of the study is to evaluate the predictive value of 18F-fluoromisonidazol-PET (FMISO-PET), 2-18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glukose-PET-CT (FDG-PET-CT), Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWI-MRI) and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) for patients with anal cancer receiving radiation therapy +/- chemotherapy (Cisplatin and 5-FU).
Anal Cancer
OTHER: FMISO-PET, FDG-PET-CT and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Tumor response, * Primary tumor 18-F-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake before radiation and during week 3 of radiation.
* Primary tumor apparent diffusion coefficient before radiation and during week 3 of radiation and 6-8 weeks post radiation
* Primary tumor perfusion coefficient before radiation and during week 3 of radiation and 6-8 weeks post radiation
* Primary tumor 18-F-Fluoromisonidazol (FMISO) uptake before radiation, 6-8 weeks post radiation
The study involves tree MRI sessions, two FDG-PET-CT sessions and one FMISO-PET session. The FMISO-PET session is presently not carried out because of delivery problems. The production of 18F-fluoromisonidazol at The Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Denmark has not jet been approved by the Danish Medicines Agency.
