Study on Plasmablastic Lymphoma Patients
This is an observational, multicenter, international and retrospective study, that aims to collect data on clinical and pathological characteristics, treatment regimens, outcome, and prognostic factors (clinical, biomarkers and/or radio-metabolic) in patients affected by PBL.

This study is an International, multicenter, observational, retrospective trial on patients affected by PBL. The information collected aim to obtain data from the real-life diagnosis, staging, management and treatment and outcome of PBL patients. A centralized pathological review of pathological samples is planned to define the rate of accurate diagnosis and to define a recommended immunohistochemical diagnostic panel for PBL. In addition, exploratory analysis will be performed to better characterize PBL.
