HPV Prevalence in 16-20 Year Old Males
In Quebec, 18 birth cohorts of girls were vaccinated against HPV (aged 9 to 29 years in 2020). With an observed vaccination coverage of \>80% an important herd effect might be expected. This study aim is to measure the HPV types prevalence in unvaccinated sexually active boys aged 16 to 20 years.
HPV Infection
OTHER: Measurement of HPV types prevalence
Prevalence of HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52 and 58, Unvaccinated sexually active 16-20 year old boys will be tested, Up to 18 months
Prevalence of 31 HPV types, Unvaccinated sexually active 16-20 year old boys will be tested, Up to 18 months
An HPV immunization program is in place in Quebec since 2008. By 2020 18 birth cohorts of girls were eligible for vaccination. Vaccine uptake with at least one dose of vaccine was \>80%. With such a high vaccine uptake an important herd immunity might be expected. The main objective of this study is to measure the prevalence of different HPV types in unvaccinated sexually active boys aged 16 to 20 years. This is a cross sectional study which includes one visit for all participants. Self sampling technic is used. During this phase of the study a total of 681 boys will be recruited. An additional phase of the study will be conducted at the condition that the prevalence of HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52 and 58 in unvaccinated boys will be at least 8.65%. The second phase of the study if conducted will measure the prevalence of the same HPV types in 681 vaccinated boys of the same age.
