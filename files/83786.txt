A Phase Ib/II Study Of JS015 Combination Therapy in Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase Ib/II, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of JS015 combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. The Recommended dose for phase II trial （RP2D） will be determined based on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy.
