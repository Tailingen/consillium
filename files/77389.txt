The below physical examination findings were recorded and reported. GDASC = General disorders and administration site conditions MND = Metabolism and nutrition disorders SSTD= Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders MCTD = Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders IPPC = Injury, poisoning and procedural complications RTMD = Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders NBMU = Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (include cysts and polyps) In the below table., From start of study treatment to 6 weeks after study treatment (i.e., maximum 12 weeks in dose escalation; 30 weeks in the expanded safety cohort)|Number of Subjects With Signs of Long-Term Radiation Toxicity, Long-term radiation toxicity included incidence of potential late toxicity, such as new primary cancers and bone marrow changes (acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and aplastic anemia)., From start of study treatment upto 12 months
Exploratory Efficacy: Weighted Mean Area Under the Curve for Bone Turnover Biomarkers, Weighted mean area under the curve for the below bone turnover biomarkers were evaluated, ICTP = pyridinoline cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide P1NP = N-terminal peptide of procollagen type 1 uCTX-1 = urine C-telopeptide 1, From start of study treatment to 6 weeks after study treatment (maximum 12 weeks in dose escalation; 30 weeks in the expanded safety cohort)|Exploratory Efficacy: Time to Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Serum PSA progression defined as two consecutive increases in PSA over a previous reference value within 6 months of first study treatment, each measurement at least 1 week apart., 12 months|Exploratory Efficacy: Percent Change From Baseline in Circulating Tumor Cells at Day 85, CTCs were measured to follow the evolution of the level of CTCs after treatment., Baseline, Day 85, expanded safety cohort|Exploratory Efficacy: Time to Clinical or Radiographic Progression, Time to first radiologic or clinical progression is determined by one of the following:

* For soft tissue lesions, the determination is based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1.
* For bone disease, the determination is based on Prostate Cancer Working Cohort 2 (PCWG2) definitions, which require the appearance of at least 2 new lesions with a confirmatory bone scan at least 6 or more weeks later. For clinical progression, the investigators followed the recommendations of the PCWG25 and used their clinical judgment to determine clinical progression., From start of study treatment to 12 months, at every 12 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS) End Point, PFS defined as the time from randomization (randomization referred to the date of treatment assignment) to disease progression (radiological or clinical, whichever was earlier) or death (if death occurred before progression was documented). Subjects without progression or death at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation., From start of study treatment to 12 months, at every 12 weeks|Overall Survival Rate, The overall survival (OS) time in days was calculated as number of days since the day of first dose of study medication until the date of death., 12 months|Number of Subjects Who Responded to Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) Pain, The subject completed the full BPI (short form) paper questionnaire, and clinical staff completed the analgesic log. The test consists of 10 questions addressing severity, location, chronicity, and amount of relief. In question 3, subjects with pain are asked to evaluate the severity of pain at worst in the past 24 hours in a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 indicating no pain, and 10 indicating the worst pain., From start of study treatment until 12 months
The trial was initially conducted and submitted by Algeta ASA. After acquiring Algeta, Bayer is now the sponsor.
