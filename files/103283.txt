MRI Screening for Brain Metastases Among Patients With Triple Negative or HER2+ Stage II or III Breast Cancer
The goal of this multi-centre, prospective study is to assess the frequency of asymptomatic brain metastasis in patients with stage II or III Triple Negative or HER2 positive breast cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. What proportion of patients with stage II or III Triple Negative or HER2 positive breast cancer have asymptomatic brain metastases identified on a screening contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (or computed tomography when Magnetic resonance is not possible) of the brain?
2. How do patients feel about undergoing brain imaging to screen for asymptomatic Brain metastasis?
3. What clinical and tissue-based biomarkers are associated with asymptomatic detection of Brain metastasis?

Participants will undergo a brain imaging, collect one blood sample to perform ctDNA analysis, and fill the Testing Morbidities Index (TMI) after imaging is done. Procedures must take place within one year of initial diagnosis, either prior to or after completion of (neo)-adjuvant systemic therapy.
