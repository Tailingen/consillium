SAKK 08/15 - PROMET - Salvage Radiotherapy +/- Metformin for Patients With Prostate Cancer After Prostatectomy
The main objective of the trial is to explore the efficacy of salvage radiotherapy (SRT) plus metformin compared to SRT in the endpoint of time to progression after prostatectomy failure.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Metformin|RADIATION: Salvage Radiotherapy SRT
Time to progression (TTP), The primary endpoint of the trial is time to progression (TTP), defined as time from randomization until one of the following events, whichever comes first:

* Biochemical progression
* Clinical progression
* Death due to clinical progression, within 18 months after randomization
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from randomization until one of the following events, whichever comes first:

* Biochemical progression
* Clinical progression
* Death from any cause, within 18 months after randomization|Undetectable Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) under normal testosterone levels, Undetectable PSA is defined as a serum PSA value of ≤0.05 ng/mL for at least two consecutive measurements after the last radiotherapy fraction and up to 18 months thereafter. To count as undetectable PSA under normal testosterone levels, the testosterone level has to be ≥50 ng/dL (i.e. a non-castrate testosterone level)., up to 18 months after last radiotherapy fraction|50% PSA response, 50% PSA response is defined as a ≥50% PSA decline after radiotherapy compared to the serum PSA level at randomization up to 18 months after last radiotherapy fraction., at randomization up to 18 months after last radiotherapy fraction.|Clinical progression-free survival, Clinical progression-free survival will be calculated as the time from randomization until clinical progression or death due to any cause., week 64 then every 6 months for the first year and every 12 months thereafter up to 10 years from last RT fraction.|Time to further anti-cancer systemic therapy, Time to further anti-cancer systemic therapy (e.g. hormonal treatment) is defined as the time from randomization to the start of any type of salvage systemic treatment., week 64 then every 6 months for the first year and every 12 months thereafter up to 10 years from last RT fraction.|Prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), Prostate cancer-specific survival will be calculated as the time from randomization to the date of death due to prostate cancer., at week 64 then every 6 months for the first year and every 12 months thereafter up to 10 years from last RT fraction.|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival will be calculated as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause., at week 64 then every 6 months for the first year and every 12 months thereafter up to 10 years from last RT fraction.|Adverse Events (AE), AEs will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v4.03., until 56 weeks (specific RT-related AEs : until 10 years)
Although the use of salvage radiotherapy (SRT) is the only potentially curative treatment after prostatectomy failure, it has provided suboptimal results over the years. Metformin may represent an effective and inexpensive means to improve SRT outcomes with a favorable therapeutic ratio. Taken pre-clinical and retrospective clinical data together, there is a compelling rationale for conducting a RCT with SRT and metformin. Herein we propose a multicenter, randomized, open-label, proof-of-concept phase II trial with the hypothesis that the addition of metformin to SRT can delay time to progression compared to the standard-of-care SRT. The study has 1:1 randomization and stratification variables include Gleason score, PSA at SRT, surgical margin status and ADT use.
