Role of Neutralizing Antibodies in the Prediction and Treatment of BK Virus Infection in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Allograft Patients at the Pediatric Oncology-hematology Department of the HUS
The BK virus (BKV) belongs to the Polyomaviridae family. The primary infection, generally asymptomatic, occurs during childhood. The virus then persists in latent form in the body, mainly in the epithelial cells of the kidney and urinary tract. Cellular immunosuppression favors BKV replication. It is responsible for pathologies of the renal-urinary tract such as BKV-associated nephropathy (BKVAN) in kidney transplant recipients, hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) recipients or ureteral stenosis.

To date, there is no specific antiviral treatment against BKV. The management of patients is essentially symptomatic and requires a multidisciplinary approach. It is therefore necessary to identify early prognostic markers for the occurrence of CH and to develop new therapeutic strategies.
BK Virus Infection
Retrospective study of the role of anti-BKV neutralizing antibodies in HSCT patients in the pediatric oncology-hematology department of the HUS, Files analysed retrospectively from January 01, 2015 to December 31, 2019 will be examined
