Fibrosis in Chronic and Delayed Myocardial Infarction
In this study the investigators aim to examine the role that fibrosis plays in heart conditions such as aortic stenosis , chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and carcinoid syndrome . Fibrosis is a common final result following any injury to the heart muscle and the investigators aim to identify this process early and in its active state. This will be examined by using a radiotracer 68Ga-FAPI or 18F-AlF-FAPI and PET-MRI or PET-CT.
Aortic Stenosis|Chemotherapy Induced Systolic Dysfunction|Carcinoid Syndrome
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-AlF-FAPI PET-MR
Fibrosis activity: Standardised uptake values (SUV, SUV, 1-2 years|Fibrosis activity:Tissue-to-Background Ratio, TBR, 1-2 years
The investigators aim to investigate the role of fibrosis activity using 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-AlF-FAPI PET in chronic and delayed valvular, myocardial and endocardial injury states, in particular aortic stenosis, chemotherapy induced cardiotoxicity and carcinoid heart disease. The investigators also aim to analyse serum markers of myocardial injury and fibrosis at different time-points in these patient cohorts.

Research Hypothesis

1. In patients with aortic stenosis, myocardial fibrosis activity will correlate with markers of left ventricular decompensation and aortic valve fibrosis activity, will predict progression in fibrosis burden and will decline following aortic valve replacement.
2. Increased myocardial fibrosis activity will be observed in the early stages of anthracycline- induced cardiotoxicity and will predict later deterioration in cardiac function.
3. In patients with carcinoid syndrome, increased endocardial fibrosis activity will be observed in patients with subclinical and clinically significant valve involvement.
