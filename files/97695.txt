Study of Entecavir for Reducing the Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients
To analyze the incidence of liver cancer after entecavir administration among patients with low viral load and cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B infection.
Chronic Hepatitis B
5-year Cumulative hepatocellular carcinoma incidence, Compare the difference in the 5-year cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis with entecavir and control, 5 years
Overall Survival, Compare the difference in the 5-year incidence overall survival in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis with entecavir and control, 5 years|Incidence of ascites, esophageal, gastric variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy (hepatic coma), Compare the difference in the 5-year incidence of ascites/esophageal/gastric variceal bleeding/hepatic encephalopathy (hepatic coma) in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis with entecavir and control, 5 years|Incidence of virologic response, virologic breakthrough, Compare the difference in the 5-year incidence incidence of virologic response and virologic breakthrough in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis with entecavir and control, 5 years|Incidence of cirrhosis regression, Compare the difference in the 5-year incidence of cirrhosis regression in patients with chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis with entecavir and control, 5 years
To analyze the incidence of liver cancer after entecavir administration among patients with low viral load (HBV DNA titer\<2,000 IU/mL (104 copies/mL)) and cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B infection.
