Electrophysiology of the Human Pituitary Gland
Measurment of electrophysiological properties of the human pituitary gland during removal of a pituitary adenoma. Assessment if these properties are sufficient for intra-operative identification of different tissues.
Pituitary Adenoma|Pituitary Tumor|Diabetes Insipidus Cranial Type|Endocrine; Deficiency
PROCEDURE: Micro-electrode measurement
Electrophysiological properties, Electrophysiological properties of the human pituitary gland, Day 0
Endocrine remission, Occurrence of endocrine remission after surgery, 6 months postoperative|Endocrine deficiencies, Occurrence of endocrine deficiencies after surgery, 6 months postoperative
In this study, patients undergoing a surgical resection of a pituitary adenoma as part of standard care will undergo an extra measurement of the electrophysiological properties of the pituitary gland. A single-unit microlectrode will be introduced and placed in the adenoma tissue, anterior piuitary lobe and posterior pituitary lobe. Apart from this measurement, no other interventions are performed and standard care will continue. Six months after measurements the patients chart will be assessed for the occurrence of remission and endocrine deficiencies.

An assessment will be made if these properties are distinctive enough to allow intra-operative identification of the different tissues and thereby increase chances of maximal tumour removal and decrease chance of endocrine deficiencies.
