Consolidative Metastasis and Primary Directed Therapy (MPDT) for Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)
This is a non-randomized, open-label phase II study designed to estimate 12-month treatment-free survival rate following total consolidative metastasis-and-primary directed therapy (MPDT) among patients with partial response/stable disease after at least 6 months of immune checkpoint blockade-based therapy for metastatic clear cell RCC. The investigators hypothesize that patients who undergo total consolidative MPDT followed by systemic therapy discontinuation will have a 12-month treatment-free survival rate of 32% compared to a null hypothesis of 13%
Renal Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Total consolidative MPDT
Treatment-free survival, Treatment-free survival, defined as the time from discontinuation of anti-cancer therapy until either: 1) the resumption of systemic therapy; 2) the first date of additional focally-directed therapy; or 3) death., From discontinuation of anti-cancer therapy until resumption of systemic therapy, first date of additional focally-directed therapy or death, whichever comes first, assessed up to 60 months.
Recurrence-free survival, Recurrence-free survival, defined as the time from completion of total consolidative MPDT until investigator-assessed disease recurrence., From completion of total consolidative MPDT until investigator-assessed disease recurrence, assessed up to 60 months..|Grade 3 or higher adverse events, Grade 3 or higher adverse events according to the Clavien-Dindo scale (surgery), Society for Interventional Radiology scale (percutaneous cryoablation), or the CTCAE v5.0 (radiotherapy), From completion of total consolidative MPDT until investigator-assessed disease recurrence, assessed up to 60 months.
Identify an immune signature that correlates with treatment free survival, The investigators will broadly interrogate immune cell types from the peripheral blood and tumor tissue, At week 6 and week 12 following systemic therapy initiation, at the time of study enrollment and following total consolidative MPDT, through study completion, estimated to be 36 months.
