There is heterogeneity in desmoplasia between different metastatic sites in pancreatic cancer. The tumor quasi-characteristics of patients with metastatic PDAC at presentation were more obvious than those of epithelial characteristics, and the quasi-and epithelial subtypes showed different responses to chemotherapy regimens, and the epithelial phenotype tumor quasi-phenotype was associated with metastasis-free survival. Therefore, different metastases of pancreatic cancer may respond differently to medical treatment. There were different metastases after postoperative recurrence of pancreatic cancer, 25.2% had only liver metastases, 14.7% had only lung metastases, 14.7% had multiple distant metastases, and about more than half of the patients had postoperative recurrence with only distant metastases and no in situ metastasis. Then whether there is a difference in the efficacy of PD1 drug therapy in patients with different metastases needs to be further verified.
