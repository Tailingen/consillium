A Multi-omics-based Metabolic Typing Study of Gastric Cancer
In the study, the investigators obtained gastric cancer tissues from 480 gastric cancer patients who had undergone surgery at the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital's biospecimen bank between 2012-2019, and obtained relevant clinical information. The gastric cancer tissues were subjected to transcriptomic, metabolomic and other multi-omics testing, and analyzed for the metabolic changes of gastric cancer, and proposed to discover relevant therapeutic targets.

The differences of the metabolism information, The differences of the metabolism information between gastric cancer tissues and non-cancerous gastric cancer tissues. These data included Metabolizing enzyme mRNA expression and metabolite content., through study completion, an average of 6 months
