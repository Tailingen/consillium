Phase II Study Temozolomide for Retinoblastoma Metastatic to the Central Nervous System for Patients From Guatemala
Primary Objectives:

1. To investigate the response rate (complete response plus partial response) of temozolomide for 8 weeks (2 cycles), in patients with retinoblastoma metastatic to the central nervous system (mass only) in two strata:

   * A. Initial diagnosis (mass)
   * B. At relapse (mass)
2. To determine hematologic toxicity: absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelets and hemoglobin count.

Secondary Objectives:

1. To determine the response in other metastatic sites (non target) (orbit, bone marrow, bone, lung, liver and others)
2. To determine the remission rate and time to relapse on temozolomide.
3. To document the response of leptomeningeal metastasis (cerebrospinal fluid) to temozolomide
Retinoblastoma
DRUG: Temozolomide
Response rate, Response rate (complete response plus partial response) of temozolomide for 8 weeks (2 cycles), in patients with retinoblastoma metastatic to the central nervous system (mass only) in two strata:

1. Initial diagnosis (mass)
2. At relapse (mass), 8 weeks|Evaluate the toxicity suffered during each cycle of temozolamide will be evaluated using the CTCAE v3.0, 8 weeks
