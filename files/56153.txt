Study of Encorafenib + Cetuximab Plus or Minus Binimetinib vs. Irinotecan/Cetuximab or Infusional 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)/Folinic Acid (FA)/Irinotecan (FOLFIRI)/Cetuximab With a Safety Lead-in of Encorafenib + Binimetinib + Cetuximab in Patients With BRAF V600E-mutant Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, 3-arm Phase 3 study to evaluate encorafenib + cetuximab plus or minus binimetinib versus Investigator's choice of either irinotecan/cetuximab or FOLFIRI/cetuximab, as controls, in patients with BRAFV600E mCRC whose disease has progressed after 1 or 2 prior regimens in the metastatic setting. The study contains a Safety Lead-in Phase in which the safety and tolerability of encorafenib + binimetinib + cetuximab will be assessed prior to the Phase 3 portion of the study.

The criterion included: heart rate- decrease from baseline \> 25% and to a value \< 50 and increase from baseline \> 25% and to a value \> 100. QT interval- new \> 450 (millisecond) msec, new \> 480 msec, new \> 500 msec, increase from baseline \> 30 msec and increase from baseline \> 60 msec. QTcF- new \> 450 msec, new \> 480 msec, new \> 500 msec, increase from baseline \> 30 msec and increase from baseline \> 60 msec., From start of study treatment until 30 days post last dose of study treatment (for triplet arm: maximum treatment exposure of 277.4 weeks; for doublet arm: maximum treatment exposure of 268 weeks; for Control arm: maximum treatment exposure of 108 weeks)|Phase 3: Number of Participants With Shift in Visual Acuity Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) Score, Visual acuity was measured using the Snellen visual acuity conversion chart. This was determined by establishing the smallest optotypes that could be identified correctly by the participant at a given observation distance. Snellen visual acuity was reported as a Snellen fraction (m/M) in which the numerator (m) indicated the test distance and the denominator (M) indicated the distance at which the gap of the equivalent Landolt ring subtends 1 minute of arc. The LogMAR score was calculated as - log(m/M). The maximum increase in score of \<= 0, 0 to \< 0.1, 0.1 to \< 0.2, 0.2 to \< 0.3 and \>=0.3 relative to baseline in LogMAR were reported in this endpoint., From start of study treatment until 30 days post last dose of study treatment (for triplet arm: maximum treatment exposure of 277.4 weeks; for doublet arm: maximum treatment exposure of 268 weeks; for Control arm: maximum treatment exposure of 108 weeks)|Phase 3: Number of Participants With Shifts in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) From Baseline to Maximum Grade On-treatment, Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) abnormalities were defined according to CTCAE version 4.03 where Grade 0: Non-missing value below Grade 2, Grade 2: LVEF between 40% and 50% or absolute change from baseline between -10% and \< -20%, Grade 3: LVEF between 20% and 39% or absolute change from baseline \<= -20%, Grade 4: LVEF lower than 20%. Categories with at least 1 non-zero data values showing any shift in Grade from baseline to 1 day after dose 1 (post-baseline) were reported. Participants whose grade category was unchanged (e.g. Grade 0 to Grade 0) were not reported., From start of study treatment until 30 days post last dose of study treatment (for triplet arm: maximum treatment exposure of 277.4 weeks; for doublet arm: maximum treatment exposure of 268 weeks; for Control arm: maximum treatment exposure of 108 weeks)
(Phase 3) Overall Survival (OS) of Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm - Final Analysis, OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., From randomization to death due to any cause (maximum treatment exposure of 277.4 weeks for triplet arm and 108 weeks for control arm)
This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, 3-arm Phase 3 study to evaluate encorafenib + cetuximab plus or minus binimetinib versus Investigator's choice of either irinotecan/cetuximab or FOLFIRI/cetuximab, as controls, in patients with BRAFV600E mCRC whose disease has progressed after 1 or 2 prior regimens in the metastatic setting. The study contains a Safety Lead-in Phase in which the safety and tolerability of encorafenib + binimetinib + cetuximab will be assessed prior to the Phase 3 portion of the study.
