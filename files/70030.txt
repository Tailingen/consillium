Prognostic Value of CD4/CD8 Ratio in Patients with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
In our previous retrospective study, we identified circulating immune cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio as significant prognostic markers in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Building on these findings, this study aims to conduct a multi-center prospective observational study to evaluate the prognostic value of the circulating lymphocyte CD4/CD8 ratio in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients prior to treatment.
Histopathological Diagnosis of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Patients with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Without Distant Metastases After AJCC/UACC 8th Edition
Progression Free Survival, The time from the first diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma to the first observation of disease progression or death from any cause, 3 Years
Overall Survival, The time from the first diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma to the occurrence of death from any cause, 3 Years|Distant Metastasis-free Survival, Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was defined as the time from diagnosis to the occurrence of distant metastasis or the date of censoring, whichever came first., 3 years|Locoregional Recurrenc-free Survival, Locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) was defined as the time from diagnosis to the occurrence of locoregional recurrence or the date of censoring, whichever came first., 3 Years
