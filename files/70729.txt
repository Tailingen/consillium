Induction Chemotherapy in Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to compare induction chemotherapy (docetaxel+cisplatin+fluorouracil) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), in order to confirm the value of induction chemotherapy in NPC patients.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil|RADIATION: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy
Failure-free survival, Failure-free survival is calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of treatment failure or death from any cause, whichever is first., 3-year
Overall survival, Overall survival is calculated from randomization to death from any cause., 3-year|Locoregional failure-free survival, The latency (ie, time from randomisation) to the first locoregional failure, 3-year|Distant failure-free survival, The latency (ie, time from randomisation) to the first remote failure, 3-year|The initial response rates after treatments, A week after completion of the last cycle of induction chemotherapy and 16 weeks after completion of radiotherapy|Toxic effects, During and after treatment
Patients presented with non-keratinizing NPC and stage T3-4N1M0/TxN2-3M0 are randomly assigned to receive induction chemotherapy (docetaxel+cisplatin+fluorouracil) plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy (investigational arm) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (control arm). Patients in both arms receive radical radiotherapy, and cisplatin (100mg/m2) every three weeks for three cycles during radiotherapy. Patients in the investigational arm receive docetaxel(60mg/m2 on day 1), cisplatin (60mg/m2 on day 1) and fluorouracil (600mg/m2 on Days 1 to 5) every three weeks for three cycles before the radiotherapy. Patients are stratified according to the treatment centers and stage. The primary end point is failure-free survival (FFS). Secondary end points include overall survival (OS), distant failure-free survival (D-FFS), locoregional failure-free survival (LR-FFS), initial response rates after treatments and toxic effects. All efficacy analyses are conducted in the intention-to-treat population; the safety population include only patients who receive their randomly assigned treatment.
