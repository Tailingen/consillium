Study of JS001 in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
This is a multi-center, open-label, phase Ib study evaluating safety and efficacy of the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors who have failed in previous systemic treatment. 40 patients are enrolled and injected with the humanized anti-PD-1 antibody 3mg/mg every 2 weeks until disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody
Overall response rate (ORR), CT/MRI will be performed every 2 cycles of treatment by RECIST 1.1(each cycle is 21 days)), From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
Duration of response (DOR), Duration of Response by irRC and RECIST 1.1, baseline, every 8 weeks up to 1 year after last patient first treatment|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first documented radiological progression or death due to any cause, baseline, every 8 weeks up to 1 year after last patient first treatment|Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from date of start of treatment to date of death due to any cause, Every 3 months after last visit up to 2 year after last patient first treatment|Immune Response Criteria by irRECIST (immune response duration of response), Immune Response Criteria by irRECIST and as per BIRC (immune response duration of response), baseline, every 8 weeks up to 1 year after last patient first treatment|Immune Response Criteria by irRECIST (immune response overall response rate), Immune Response Criteria by irRECIST and as per BIRC (immune response overall response rate), baseline, every 8 weeks up to 1 year after last patient first treatment|Biochemical response, Changes from baseline in chromogranin-A, baseline, 6th week, 16th week|Correlation analysis of PD-L1/CD8 expression of tumor and ORR, Changes from baseline in PD-L1/CD8 expression, 3 years|Correlation analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and ORR, Changes from baseline of circulating tumor cells (CTC), baseline, 8th week
