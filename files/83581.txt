Interest of Auriculotherapy in the Treatment of Xerostomia
The aim of the study is to show that auriculotherapy is effective in the treatment of xerostomia
Xerostomia
OTHER: Specific auriculotherapy|OTHER: Non-specific auriculotherapy
Number of patients with improvement of salivation after 3 month of treatment (Real Auriculotherapy group compared to Sham Auriculotherapy group), Show that auriculotherapy (treatment of specific points) is effective in the treatment of xerostomia compared to a "sham" treatment (treatment of non-specific points).

The relative variation of salivary secretion "after treatment" compared to "before treatment" will be judged on the weight of 3 compresses left 5 minutes in the mouth: 2 in front of the openings of St√©non's canal and 1 on the buccal floor (orifice of Wharton's canal).

Salivary secretion is measured by the weight in grams of the compresses left in the mouth.

This measurement is performed at inclusion and after 3 months of treatment. The measurement is made with a jeweler-type precision balance., 3 months
Assess the effect of auriculotherapy on the subjective improvement of salivation, Specific xerostomia questionnaire at inclusion and 3 months post-treatment (11 questions with 5 response levels (1 = never / 2 = very rarely / 3 = occasionally / 4 = quite often / 5 = very often) to evaluate Xerostomia symptoms)., 3 months|Assess the effect of auriculotherapy on the subjective improvement of clinical status, Global Patient Change Impression (GPCI) questionnaire at 3 months post-inclusion. This questionnaire evaluates all aspects of patients' health and assesses if there has been an improvement or decline in clinical status., 3 months|Assess the effect of auriculotherapy on the dysgeusia, dysphagia, pain or burning sensations, Simple numerical scales from 0 (best score) to 10 (worst score) at inclusion and at 3 months post-treatment., 3 months|Assess the effect of auriculotherapy on anxiety and depression, Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire at inclusion and 3 months post-treatment. The HADS consists of 14 items, scored from 0 to 3, with seven questions relating to anxiety and seven questions relating to depression, allowing 2 scores to be obtained. The highest scores indicating more severe symptoms: "normal" cases (0-7 points); doubtful case (8-10 points); certain cases (11-21 points)., 3 months|Assess the effect of auriculotherapy on quality of life, EuroQoL five Dimension questionnaire at inclusion and 3 months post-treatment. This questionnaire is designed for the patient to judge the impact of his state of health on his quality of life according to 5 dimensions (mobility, personal autonomy, daily activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression). Each item has 3 response levels (1, 2 and 3) and the combination of the five digits will represent the patient's state of health. It is supplemented by a quality of life thermometer graduated from 0 (worst quality of life) to 100 (best quality of life)., 3 months|Assess the effect of auriculotherapy on the wish to continue treatment, Patient's desire to continue treatment (question to patient - yes/no response), 3 months
The aim of the study is to show that auriculotherapy is effective in the treatment of xerostomia
