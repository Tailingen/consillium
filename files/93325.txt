Study of Mogamulizumab + Nivolumab in Subjects w/Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended fixed dose of the combinations of mogamulizumab and nivolumab in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
Solid Tumor|Cancer|Carcinoma|Hepatocellular Carcinoma|HCC
BIOLOGICAL: Mogamulizumab + Nivolumab
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The MTD was defined as one dose level below the dose level of the cohort where â‰¥ one-third of the subjects experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), From the first dose of study medications until 14 days after the last dose of study medication|Number of Subjects Experiencing Dose-limiting Toxicity, combination of mogamulizumab and nivolumab, From the first dose of study medications until 14 days after the last dose of study medication
Objective Tumor Response Rate According to RECIST, To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of mogamulizumab and nivolumab based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v. 1.1., From baseline to every 12 weeks, until data cut off
This is a multicenter, Phase 1/2 open-label, dose-finding and cohort expansion study of the anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab in combination therapy with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab in adult subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Phase 1 will identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined dose in absence of exceeding the MTD, of the combination regimen of mogamulizumab and nivolumab subjects. Phase 1 will enroll up to 12 subjects. Phase 2 will explore the safety, efficacy and anti-tumor activity of the highest tolerated dose of the combination regimen. Phase 2 will enroll up to 184 subjects.
