OS was defined as the time from first dosage of study drug to the date of death from any cause. Reported data refer to values up to 40 months., Baseline, Months 1-8, 10-12, 14, 16, 22, 28, 34 and 40|OS - Percentage of Participants With an Event, OS was defined as the time from first dosage of study drug to the date of death from any cause., Baseline, Months 1-8, 10-12, 14, 16, 22, 28, 34 and 40.|OS - Time to Event, Overall survival was defined as the time from first dosage of study drug to the date of death from any cause., Baseline, Months 1-8, 10-12, 14, 16, 22, 28, 34 and 40.|Disease-Free Survival (DFS) - Percentage of Participants Estimated to be Disease-Free, DFS data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
