A Study of Tivozanib in Combination With Durvalumab in Subjects With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, DLTs, MTD, and preliminary anti tumor activity of tivozanib in combination with durvalumab in subjects with advanced HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DRUG: Tivozanib|DRUG: Durvalumab
Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), To establish the safety of tivozanib in combination with durvalumab in subjects with untreated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., Approximately 24 months; Through study completion|Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), To establish the safety of tivozanib in combination with durvalumab in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) previously treated with both bevacizumab and atezolizumab or both bevacizumab and atezolizumab in combination with a second immune checkpoint inhibitor in a prior line of therapy., Approximately 24 months; Through study completion
Response Rate (Objective Response Rate), To estimate the response rate of tivozanib in combination with durvalumab in subjects with untreated advanced HCC., Approximately 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) of tivozanib in combination with durvalumab in subjects with untreated advanced HCC., Approximately 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), To estimate the overall survival (OS) of tivozanib in combination with durvalumab in subjects with untreated advanced HCC., Approximately 24 months; Through study completion|Response Rate (Objective Response Rate), To estimate the response rate of tivozanib in combination with durvalumab in subjects with advanced HCC previously treated with both bevacizumab and atezolizumab or both bevacizumab and atezolizumab in combination with a second immune checkpoint inhibitor in a prior line of therapy., Approximately 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) of tivozanib in combination with durvalumab in subjects with advanced HCC previously treated with both bevacizumab and atezolizumab or both bevacizumab and atezolizumab in combination with a second immune checkpoint inhibitor in a prior line of therapy., Approximately 24 months; Through study completion|Overall Survival (OS), To estimate the overall survival (OS) of tivozanib in combination with durvalumab in subjects with advanced HCC previously treated with both bevacizumab and atezolizumab or both bevacizumab and atezolizumab in combination with a second immune checkpoint inhibitor in a prior line of therapy., Approximately 24 months; Through study completion
