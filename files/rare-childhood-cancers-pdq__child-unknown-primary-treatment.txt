Incidence and Clinical Presentation
Go to Patient Version
Cancers of unknown primary sites present as metastatic cancers for which precise primary tumor
sites cannot be determined.[
1
]  As an example, lymph nodes at the base of the
skull may enlarge in relationship to a tumor on the face or scalp that is not evident by physical examination or radiographic imaging. 
Thus, modern imaging techniques may indicate the extent of the disease but not
a primary site.  Tumors such as adenocarcinomas, melanomas, and embryonal tumors, like
rhabdomyosarcomas and neuroblastomas, may present in this way.
Less than 1% of all solid cancers of unknown primary sites occur in children. Because of the age-related incidence of tumor types, embryonal histologies are more common in children.[

Diagnostic Evaluation
For all patients who present with tumors from unknown primary sites,
treatment is directed toward the specific histopathology of the tumor and
is age-appropriate for the general type of cancer suspected, regardless of
the sites involved.[

Studies in adults suggest that positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be helpful in identifying cancers of unknown primary sites, particularly in patients whose tumors arise in the head and neck area.[
2
] A report in adults using fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose  PET-computed tomography identified 42.5% of primary tumors in a group of cancers of unknown primary sites.[

The use of gene expression profiling and next-generation sequencing can enhance the ability to identify the putative tissue of origin and guide the selection of targeted agents for specific variants.[

In a study of 200 adult patients with carcinomas of unknown primary sites, 125 had adenocarcinomas and 75 had carcinomas without features of adenocarcinoma. Genomic alterations were found in 96% of the cases. The most common alterations were
TP53
(55%),
KRAS
(20%),
CDKN2A
(19%), and
MYC
(12%). Clinically relevant and potentially actionable variants included
KRAS
(20%),
CDKN2A
(19%),
MCL1
(10%),
PTEN
(7%),
PIK3CA
(9%),
ERBB2
(8%),
RICTOR
(6%),
BRAF
(6%), and
NF1
(4%). These findings suggest that genomic profiling can help identify potentially actionable targets, which could benefit patients clinically while reducing the complex, costly workup needed to search for a primary tumor site of origin.[

Despite reports of precision medicine studies in pediatric oncology, none of them have described a case of cancer of unknown primary site with a defined or actionable genomic alteration.[

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[

5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as
Cancer of Unknown Primary Treatment

Treatment of Childhood Cancer of Unknown Primary
Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy
may be used to treat childhood cancers of unknown primary sites. The appropriate and relevant treatments, according to the general category of carcinoma or
sarcoma (depending on the histological findings, symptoms, and extent of tumor),
are initiated as early as possible.[
