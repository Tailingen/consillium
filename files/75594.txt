Trident Landmark as a Safe and Easy Method for Facial Nerve Trunk Identification During Superficial Parotidectomy
The parotid has a close relationship with the extra temporal course of the facial nerve. The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and safety of trident landmark during superficial parotidectomy in the identification of the facial nerve trunk.

PROCEDURE: Superficial parotidectomy
Number of cases with successful identification of the facial neve by trident landmark, measuring the rate of success of the trident landmark method in identification of the facial nerve during superficial parotidectomy, 60 min
A prospective study was conducted between January 2018 and January 2020 at Kafr El-Sheikh university hospital (KUH) and Al Fayoum University Hospital (FUH), Egypt, on 60 patients with benign parotid tumors in the superficial lobe. All patients were subjected to superficial parotidectomy. The outcome was evaluated regarding the clinical success of facial nerve identification by trident landmark and early postoperative complications.
