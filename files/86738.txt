A Pilot Study of Thermodox and MR-HIFU for Treatment of Relapsed Solid Tumors
This is a pilot study of LTLD with MR-HIFU hyperthermia followed by ablation in subjects with refractory/relapsed solid tumors.
Solid Tumors|Soft Tissue Sarcoma|Ewing Sarcoma|Malignant Epithelial Neoplasm|Rhabdomyosarcoma|Wilms Tumor|Hepatic Tumor|Germ Cell Tumor|Bone Metastases
DEVICE: Magnetic Resonance-Guided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound|DRUG: Lyso-thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin
Primary objective 1: Response of treated target lesion(s) assessed by CT or MRI, The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) will be used, At the end of every 21-day cycle|Primary objective 2: The number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5, CTCAE v.5 will be used, Up to thirty days after last dose of protocol therapy
Exploratory objective 1: Response of non-target lesion(s) assessed by CT or MRI, Lesions that are evaluable or measurable but not in the treated location(s) will be collected, At the end of every 21-day cycle|Exploratory objective 2: Participant reported target tumor pain intensity assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11), The NRS-11 consists of a 11-point numeric scale to assess pain intensity from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain), At the end of every 21-day cycle|Exploratory objective 3: Participant reported impact of pain on daily activities assessed using the PROMIS Pain Interference Scale (PROMIS-PI), The PROMIS-PI consists of 8 questions on pain. Each question will be rated from 0 (never), 1 (almost never), 2 (sometimes), 3 (often), and 4 (almost always), At the end of every 21-day cycle|Exploratory objective 4: Blood samples taken to see adaptive immune response and immune suppression, To determine changes in pharmacodynamics of immune markers, At 1 day and 1 week after MR-HIFU treatment on first 21-day cycle
LTLD is a heat-activated formulation of liposomal doxorubicin that releases the drug when exposed to hyperthermic conditions (40-45°C). This novel agent has been well tolerated in adults with similar toxicity profile to doxorubicin. MR-HIFU offers a non-invasive and non-ionizing ability to selectively heat large tissue volumes. Thus, MR-HIFU is a promising technology for triggering doxorubicin release from LTLD. The investigator's approach involves continuous maintenance of the target at mild hyperthermia with MR-HIFU following LTLD infusion. Following hyperthermia, the investigators will deliver ablation therapy (\>55°C) to targeted areas of tumor where feasible and safe. Addition of this ablation therapy after mild-hyperthermia-triggered drug delivery with LTLD has the potential to significantly potentiate chemotherapy with minimal additional adverse effects to improve local control and drug delivery without increasing toxicity.
