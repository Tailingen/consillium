A Trial to Evaluate Safety and Tolerability of SHR-1316 in Cancer Patients
In many types of human tumors, PD-L1 is highly expressed. Such high expression has often been associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. SHR-1316 is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to human PD-L1.

This is a two-part, open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose escalation, Phase I study of repeated doses of SHR-1316 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors who have failed current standard anti-tumor therapies.
