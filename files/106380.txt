Cryoablation as a Minimally Invasive Alternative to Surgery for Managing Ductal Carcinoma In Situ
Cryoablation or tumor freezing is a percutaneous, office-based procedure that is emerging as a minimally invasive, cost-effective alternative to surgery that is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for the management of for early-stage invasive breast cancer. The investigator will also evaluate the potential of cryoablation as a minimally invasive alternative to surgery for small areas of DCIS by examining its ability to achieve complete ablation of DCIS within the targeted cryoablation zone of necrosis.
Ductal Carcinoma in Situ
PROCEDURE: Cryoablation
Ability of cryoablation to achieve complete ablation of DCIS, Number of participants to achieve completeness of ablation by measuring the percentage of subjects with no residual DCIS or invasive cancer within the zero of necrosis assessed in the post-cryoablation core biopsy obtained 6 months post-cryoablation., 6 months
Recurrence rate, Number of participants at the 5-year rate of invasive breast cancer recurrence after cryoablation of DCIS measuring \</= 2cm., 5 years
