Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Single Ascending Dose of ZSP1603 in Healthy Adults
The Primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ZSP1603 and the Secondary objective is to estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters after orally administered once daily of ZSP1603.

Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) following oral doses of ZSP1603 and placebo,separately., Number of participants with TEAEs as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., At Day 6 post-dose.
AUClast（AUC0-t）of ZSP1603, AUClast is defined as the concentration of drug from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration., Up to 6 days post-dose|AUC0-24 of ZSP1603, AUC0-24 is defined as the concentration of drug from zero(0) hrs to 24h (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from zero(0) hrs to 24h)., Up to 6 days post-dose|Cmax of ZSP1603, Cmax is defined as the maximum observed concentration of drug in plasma., Up to 6 days post-dose|Tmax of ZSP1603, Tmax is defined as the time to maximum concentration., Up to 6 days post-dose|t1/2 of ZSP1603, t1/2 is defined as the time to half of the drug concentration in plasma., Up to 6 days post-dose|CL/F of ZSP1603, CL/F is defined as the ratio of total clearance(CL) to bioavailability(F)., Up to 6 days post-dose|λz of ZSP1603, λz is defined as the ratio between the elimination of compound per unit time and the total amount of compound., Up to 6 days post-dose|VD/F of ZSP1603, VD/F is defined as apparent volume of distribution, Up to 6 days post-dose|MRT of ZSP1603, MRT is defined as mean residence time, Up to 6 days post-dose
This is a Phase 1, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single center study aimed at investigating the safety, tolerability and the pharmacokinetics of ZSP1603 on fasted condition.Up to 4 cohorts of 32 eligible participants totally are planned to be enrolled. This is a two-arm clinical trial that ZSP1603 and matching placebo will be orally administered once daily. Two subjects in the first cohort will be assigned in a opened fashion to receive 7.5mg of ZSP1603 while another three cohorts of volunteers will be randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to receive either a single dose of ZSP1603 or matching placebo in an ascending dose fashion. To monitor AEs,record abnormalities (Holter, 12-lead ECG, Vital signs, Physical examination, Clinical Laboratory), and detect the pharmacokinetics of ZSP1603.
