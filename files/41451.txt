Dose-Escalation, Safety, Pharmacokinetics Study of Cabazitaxel With Gemcitabine In Patients With Solid Tumor
Primary Objectives:

* Study part 1: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of cabazitaxel administered as a 1-hour infusion in combination with gemcitabine, every 3 weeks in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
* Study part 2: To determine the antitumor activity of cabazitaxel in combination with gemcitabine, in an additional extended cohort of 15 patients with advanced solid malignancies treated with the defined MTD, as assessed by objective response rate (ORR) according to the revised guideline for Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1 criteria).

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the safety profile of the combination regimen of cabazitaxel with gemcitabine.
* To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of cabazitaxel, gemcitabine and its metabolite 2',2' difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU) when given in combination.
* To determine Time to Progression (TTP), Objective Response Rate (ORR), and Duration of Response (DR), in the extended cohort of patients treated at the MTD in Part 2 of the study and the patients who received the MTD in Part 1 component.

For study part 1, dose levels were to be escalated according to predefined dose escalation decision rules. The Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) was reached at the dose level when at least 2 patients developed a DLT during the first 3 weeks of treatment. There was no further dose escalation when this dose was achieved. The MTD was defined as the highest dose at which 0 or 1 of 3 to 6 patients, respectively, experienced DLT during the first 3 weeks of treatment.

DRUG: cabazitaxel|DRUG: gemcitabine
Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities During Dose Escalation, Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) were defined as clinical adverse events (AE) or laboratory abnormalities considered drug-related as assessed by the Investigator or Sponsor, and achieving a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) severity rating of severe (3) or life-threatening (4)., Day 1 to Day 21 of the first treatment cycle|Objective Response Rate With MTD, Objective response was defined as a confirmed complete response (CR) or a confirmed partial response (PR) during the treatment period, based on RECIST 1.1, as assessed by the Investigator.

CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, all non-target lesions, and no new lesion. Any pathological lymph nodes must have had reduction in the short axis to \<10 mm.

PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, no progression in non-target lesion, and no new lesion.

The objective response rate (ORR) was to be calculated as the proportion of participants with confirmed objective response relative to the total number of participants in the analysis population. Due to the inability to determine MTD during the study part 1, the analysis was not performed., Fron Day 1 up to a maximum of 12 months

The cut-off date for study part 1 was when last participant completed the first treatment cycle and the subsequent 30 days follow-up.

The cut off date for study part 2 was when all participants experienced disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal or the last participant had completed 26 weeks or 6 cycles on study treatment, whichever came first.

Participants could continue to be treated on study as long as they were benefiting from study treatment and had not met study withdrawal criteria. After withdrawal from study treatment, further treatment, if any, was at the discretion of the Investigator.
