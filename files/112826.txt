Window of Opportunity Trial, PARP Inhibitor Rucaparib Affect on PD-L1 Expression in Triple Negative Breast Tumors
This is a single arm window of opportunity trial conducted in patients with early stage triple negative breast tumors to evaluate if treatment with a Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor will increase expression of programmed cell death-1 with ligand (PD-L1) in triple negative breast tumors.

This is a single arm window of opportunity trial conducted in patients with early stage triple negative breast tumors. Patients who are planning to undergo surgery as part of their initial treatment will be eligible for this study. They will be treated with single agent rucaparib for 3 weeks and then proceed to surgery. Core-biopsies obtained at the time of diagnosis and tumor from the surgical resection will be assessed for change in expression of PD-L1 by Immunohistochemical assay (IHC).
