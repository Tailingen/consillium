This is a 3-arm cluster randomized controlled study that compares a trained lay provided weight loss program vs. the same program plus community-based weight management strategies vs. general cancer prevention education on weight loss and other clinical outcomes (primary outcomes) and healthy behaviors, and psychosocial functioning (secondary outcomes).
