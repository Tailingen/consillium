Radiation-associated Carotid Artery Disease in Patients With Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
Radiation-associated carotid vasculopathy is a common late sequelae in patients with head and neck cancer, which correlates with the incidence of stroke. Currently, little is known about the incidence of radiation-associated carotid vasculopahty in the context of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).

The aim of this study is to determine whether IMRT will increase the incidence of carotid vasculopathy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma|Carotid Artery Diseases
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Measurement of intima media thickness of carotid artery|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Detection and measurement of carotid plaques|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Carotid Color Flow Duplex Testing|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Montreal Cognitive Assessment|OTHER: Medical history of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases
intima media thickness of carotid artery, the intima media thickness of common carotid artery, internal carotid artery of the left or right side, This is a cross-sectional study. So the time frame is within one week of a patient-visit to the clinics.
the incidence of carotid stenosis, Carotid stenosis is defined as the axial diameter of the carotid lumina decreases more than 50%., This is a cross-sectional study. So the time frame is within one week of a patient-visit to the clinics.|the number of carotid plaques, Carotid plaque is defined as a focal structure that encroaches into the arterial lumen of at least 0.5 mm or 50% of the surrounding IMT value or demonstrates a thickness \>1.5 mm as measured from the media-adventitia interface to the intima- lumen interface., This is a cross-sectional study. So the time frame is within one week of a patient-visit to the clinics.|total number of Montreal Cognitive Score (range: 0-30), the higher the number, the better the cognitive function, This is a cross-sectional study. So the time frame is within one week of a patient-visit to the clinics.
