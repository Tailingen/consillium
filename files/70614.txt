Postoperative Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Early-stage Cervical Cancer That Not Meet Criteria of Adjuvant Therapeutic According to NCCN Guideline
This is a prospective, phase 3 randomized controlled clinical trial. Cervical cancer patients who undergo radical surgery but do not meet criteria of adjuvant therapy according to NCCN guideline are enrolled to receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 3 year. The secondary endpoints were 5-year DFS, overall survival (OS) and safety.

DRUG: Paclitaxel or docetaxel + Cisplatin or carboplatin
Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time interval between the date of random assignment and the date of the first documented evidence of relapse at any site or death related to cancer (including toxicity), whichever occurred first., 3 year
Overall survival （OS）, OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death of any cause., 3 year|5-year DFS/OS, DFS is defined as the time interval between the date of random assignment and the date of the first documented evidence of relapse at any site or death related to cancer (including toxicity), whichever occurred first. OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until death of any cause., 5 years|Incidence of Toxicity, The toxicity induced by chemotherapy during observation time will be estimated on the basis of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 5.0., 2 years
