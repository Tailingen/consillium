Multi-omics Study of Tongue Coating in Malignant Tumors of Digestive Tract
This is a prospective, multi-center, observational cohort study and seeks to enroll 20000 patients with one malignant tumor of digestive tract or healthy individual.

This study collected tongue coating samples non-invasively and analyzed the tongue coating metaproteomics, metagenomics and metabolomics profiles of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.

The performance characteristics(sensitivity and specificity) of tongue coating morphology, metaproteomics, metagenomics and metabolomics tests for detection of gastrointestinal malignancies are evaluated in comparison to pathology.
