Zoledronic Acid as Adjuvant Treatment of Triple-negative Breast Cancer
Triple-negative breast cancer is a special type of breast cancer with poor prgnosis and limited choices. Chemotherapy is the only choice of adjuvant systemic treatment options. Previous study suggested that zoledronic acid might have anti-tumor effect by eliminating the number of DTCs(Disseminated Tumor Cell )and had been proved to be effective as adjvant therapy in postmenopausal women whose breast cancer was Homonal receptor positive and who were receiving aromatase inhibitors. So it might be able to improve the survival of triple negative breast cancer patients.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Zoledronic acid
disease free survival, the time from randomization to the time of disease progression or relapse or death, 3 years after last patient was enrolled
overall survival, the time from randomization to the time of death, 5 years after last patient was enrolled|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, up to 28 days after last medication
Triple negative breast cancer patients with high risk factor will be randomized to receive either zoledronic acid or observation after the completion of standard chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Recurrence status will be followed and Disease free survival will be compared. Overall survival is the secondary endpoint.
