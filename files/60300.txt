Signatures of Response and Resistance to Mosunetuzomab in Follicular Lymphomas (FL)
Mosunetuzumab is a T-cell bispecific antibody targeting CD20 and CD3 aiming to redirect T cells to engage and eliminate malignant B cells. Bispecific antibodies (BsAb) are a promising treatment option which can induce long-term responses in refractory and relapsed B cell lymphoma patients. However, the factors determining the quality and duration of responses are poorly understood.
Follicular Lymphoma
Capacity of sampling, number of samples collected, 2 years
the objective is to produce a collection of great scientific interest for lymphoma research from CELESTIMO's clinical trial patients' samples to increase knowledge of treatment with mosunetuzumab's for patients with follicular lymphoma (FL).

study population involves patients participating to CELESTIMO study in France. 10 sites are expected in this biobanking protocol study

Biological samples will collected as part of routine care (tissue and blood already sampled in routine and/or CELESTIMO study) at screening, at C4, at C12 or at progressive disease/relapse.
