Safety and Efficacy of Isatuximab in Lymphoblastic Leukemia
Primary Objective:

To evaluate the efficacy of isatuximab.

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the safety profile of isatuximab.
* To evaluate the duration of response (DOR).
* To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
* To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of isatuximab in participants with T-ALL or T-LBL.
* To evaluate immunogenicity of isatuximab in participants with T-ALL or T-LBL.
* To assess minimal residual disease (MRD) and correlate it with clinical outcome.
T-cell Type Acute Leukemia-Precursor|T-lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukaemia
DRUG: Isatuximab SAR650984|DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: acetaminophen|DRUG: ranitidine|DRUG: diphenhydramine
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Objective response was defined as percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or with complete response with incomplete peripheral recovery (CRi) as per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. CR was defined as no circulating blasts or extramedullary disease, no lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, skin/gum infiltration/testicular mass/central nervous system involvement, trilineage hematopoiesis and less than 5 percentage blasts, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 1000 per micro liter, platelets less than 100 000 per micro liter, no recurrence for 4 weeks. CRi meet all criteria for complete response except platelet count and/or ANC., Baseline until disease progression or death (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)
Duration of Response (DOR), DOR defined as time (in days) from date of first response until date of first documented progressive disease (PD) or death (from any cause), whichever came first. Progressive disease as per NCCN guidelines was defined as increase of at least 25 percentage (%) in the absolute number of circulating or bone marrow blasts or development of extramedullary disease., Baseline until disease progression or death (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time interval (in days) from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first observation of PD or death due to any cause, whichever came first. PD as per NCCN guidelines was defined as increase of at least 25% in the absolute number of circulating or bone marrow blasts or development of extramedullary disease., Baseline until disease progression or death (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival was defined as the time interval from the date of first study drug administration to the date of death due to any cause., Baseline until death (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)|Number of Participants With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD), Presence of MRD was measured by sequencing and/or flow cytometry in participants achieving CR and CRi. CR was defined as no circulating blasts or extramedullary disease, no lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, skin/gum infiltration/testicular mass/central nervous system involvement, trilineage hematopoiesis and less than 5 percentage blasts, ANC greater than 1000 per micro liter, platelets less than 100 000 per micro liter, no recurrence for 4 weeks. Complete response with incomplete blood count recovery meet all criteria for complete response except platelet count and/or ANC., Baseline until death or study cut-off (maximum duration: 12.1 weeks)
The study duration per participant included a 3-week screening period, an approximately 1 year of treatment period or until disease progression or discontinuation for any other reason, and a follow-up period of at least 30 days after the last investigational medicinal product administration.
