Two-Arm Study of a DNA Vaccine Encoding Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP) in Patients With Non-Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The investigators are trying to find new methods to treat prostate cancer. The approach is to try to enhance patients' own immune response against the cancer. In this study, the investigators will be testing the safety of a vaccine that may be able to help the body fight prostate cancer.

The vaccine, called pTVG-HP, is a piece of DNA genetic material that contains genetic code for a protein that is made by the prostate gland, called prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). The vaccine will be given together with a substance called an adjuvant. Adjuvants are typically given with vaccines and can improve the effect of the vaccine. The adjuvant that will be used in this study is called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

The main purpose of this study is to find out whether the vaccine generates long-lived immune responses, and whether a better schedule of vaccination can be found by doing frequent laboratory testing for immune responses. The investigators also want to see if the vaccine stimulates any immune reaction against cancer cells.

Number of Participants With > = Grade 2 Autoimmune Events or >=Toxicities at Least Possibly Related to pTVG-HP With GM-CSF Study Treatment., The number and severity of toxicity incidents occurring between the pre-treatment and the final off-study evaluation will be collected and assigned an attribution. The toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of types and severities by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria version 3 for each study arm. The number of subjects experiencing grade 2 or higher autoimmune events or grade 3 or higher toxicities felt to be at least possibly related to pTVG-HP with GM-CSF study treatment will be compared between the two arms., From the time the patient begins treatment until 30 days after the last treatment with pTVG-HP vaccine, up to a maximum of 2 years|Number of Participants Who Experience at Least a 3-fold Higher PAP-specific T-cell Frequency or Proliferation Index at One Year Compared to Baseline., The number of patients with a T-cell immune response will be determined for each study arm. An immune response will be defined as a PAP-specific T-cell frequency or proliferation index at 1 year that is at least 3-fold higher than the baseline T-cell frequency or proliferation index., Baseline and 1 year.
The Number of Participants Who Experience at Least a Two-fold Increase in the PSA Doubling Time During the Treatment Period., The number of subjects who experience at least a two-fold increase in the PSA doubling time will be documented for each study arm. The PSA doubling time will be calculated using all PSA values obtained starting on Treatment Day 0 and continuing to end of treatment period and compared to the PSA doubling time collected at study entry prior to beginning study treatment., Starting at Treatment Day 0 and continuing every 4-6 weeks until end of treatment period, an average of 2 years|The Number of Participants Who Are Metastasis-free at One Year., The number of subjects who are metastatic-free at one year after starting study treatment will be tabulated for each arm. CT Scans and Bone Scans will be obtained at one year to determine whether metastatic disease is present., one year from study entry
