Personalized Management of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Using Patient-Derived Tumoroids
This study is designed to prospectively investigate the feasibility of establishing patient-derived tumoroids (PDT) as a platform for a personalized approach for response prediction and guide optimal neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant approach. PDT will be investigated to determine drug sensitivity, predict the response to chemotherapy agents and radiation therapy, and validate this response in treated patients, and to establish the feasibility of PDT as a platform for a personalized approach to guide multimodality treatment.
Pancreas Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: Treatment prediction PDT platform
Rate of the successful establishment of pancreatic patient-derived tumoroids (PDT), 2 years
Drug sensitivity and response prediction of chemotherapy agents in PDT, the PDT response to the treatment with conventional regimens for treatment of (pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and other approved treatments based on pharmacogenomic analysis. Treatment response will be assessed with viability assays., 2 years|Drug sensitivity and response prediction of radiation therapy in PDT, the PDT response to the treatment with radiation with or without radiosensitizers. Treatment response will be assessed with viability assays., 2 years|PDT validation with a comparative analysis of patients' response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, Response evaluation according to imaging based on RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria, biochemical response in CA19-9 and pathologic response in the surgical specimen vs. PTD response in the corresponding neoadjuvant regimen., 2 years
