Short-term Outcomes of ERAS Protocol in RAME for Esophageal Cancer
This single-center, retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the short-term outcomes of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol in perioperative robotic-assisted McKeown esophagectomy (RAME) among esophageal cancer patients.
