A Study of Tumor Imaging With Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography
Participants in this study will have Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography/MSOT imaging of both breasts immediately before their ultrasound-guided breast biopsy procedure begins. After the MSO imaging is completed, participation in the study will end.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography Imaging
Number of participants where tumors were visualized, The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of MSOT for breast cancer and melanoma detection. Feasibility is defined as the ability of the method to visualize tumors that have been identified with standard methods (ultrasound, mammography, MRI), and the ability to obtain oxygenation maps of benign and malignant breast and melanoma tumors. MSOT will be considered feasible if it is able to visualize tumors and obtain oxygenation maps in at least 14 patients out of 20, 1 year
