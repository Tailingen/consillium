Efficacy Assessment of Lenvatinib Associated with Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Endometrial Cancer: a French Multicentric Retrospective Early Access Program-based Study
LARENA is a multicentric retrospective study (secondary use of data) of consecutive patients prospectively registered in the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab French early access program (Temporary Authorisation for Use). The source of data will be the patient's medical file. We will manually review all files of the participating centers.
