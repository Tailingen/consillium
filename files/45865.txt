Entinostat in Chinese Postmenopausal Women Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerance of entinostat administered orally as a single agent in a weekly dosing schedule. Additionally, this study will characterize the pharmacokinetics parameters in Chinese postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. And to define the profile of adverse events, including laboratory parameters in these subjects
