Efficacy and Safety of Decitabine Plus CHOP vs CHOP in Patients With Untreated Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma
Primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of decitabine plus CHOP (D-CHOP) versus CHOP alone in patients with previously untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Decitabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Prednisone
Progression Free Survival, from date of inclusion to date of progression, relapse, or death from any cause, 3 years
Overall Survival, from the date of inclusion to date of death, irrespective of cause, 3 years|Response rate, complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates, using the standard response criteria (Cheson and al.), 3 years|Adverse Events, any unfavorable and unintended sign , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure, 3 years
This is a randomized, multi-center, open-label study to compare efficacy and safety of D-CHOP with standard CHOP regimen in patients with previously untreated PTCL. Study subjects are patients with histologically proven PTCL. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive either cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) administered in 3 week cycles for 6 cycles or decitabine plus CHOP (D-CHOP) administered in 4 week cycles for 6 cycles. In the D-CHOP arm, decitabine will be administered at a dose of 10 mg/mÂ² IV on day 1-5 every 3 weeks. This study is divided into three phases: screening phase, treatment phase and follow-up phase. Patients will receive study drug(s) for up to 6 cycles, or until unacceptable toxicity will develop or progression or voluntary withdrawal.Adverse event of every treatment cycle will be recorded.Therapy efficacy will be evaluated after finishing 3 cycles and finishing 6 cycles therapy. Patients will be followed until disease progression, died or 2 years from the last patient randomized.
