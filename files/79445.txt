Autologous T Cells Expressing MET scFv CAR (RNA CART-cMET)
This is a pilot study to evaluate feasibility, safety, and preliminary evidence of efficacy for intravenously administered, RNA electroporated autologous T cells expressing MET chimeric antigen receptors with tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ /4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred to as "RNA CART-cMET") in patients with advanced melanoma or breast carcinoma.
Malignant Melanoma|Breast Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: T cells modified with RNA anti -cMET CAR
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03 in melanoma and breast cancer subjects, from day 0 - month 4
Objective overall response rate by clinical exam for visible cutaneous tumors, day 25 and month 4|Objective overall response rate by radiologic imaging using RECIST 1.1, day 25 and month 4|Estimate the activity of RNA CART-cMET in subjects who receive at least 1 dose of cells by objective response rate using RECIST 1.1 criteria, day -7 and day 11|Estimate the activity of RNA CART-cMET in subjects who receive at least 1 dose of cells by objective response rate using pathological evaluation of resected or biopsied tissue, day -7 and day 11
This is a pilot study to evaluate feasibility, safety, and preliminary evidence of efficacy for intravenously administered, RNA electroporated autologous T cells expressing MET chimeric antigen receptors with tandem TCRζ and 4-1BB (TCRζ /4-1BB) co-stimulatory domains (referred to as "RNA CART-cMET") in patients with advanced melanoma or breast carcinoma. Subjects will be treated with IV administration of the RNA transduced anti-cMET CAR T cells for a total of up to six doses over a 2 week period.

Each dose is 1x108 total T cells modified with RNA anti-cMET CAR. All subjects in both the melanoma and breast carcinoma arms will receive up to 6 doses of RNA CART-cMET cells, with no lymphodepleting chemotherapy administered prior to cell infusion Cell numbers are based on total cells with a portion of them having CAR expression depending on transduction efficiency and determined by flow cytometry Based on the product release criteria, at least 20% of the total cells will express the anti-cMET CAR. Treatment limiting toxicity (TLT). Adverse event reporting will begin at the start of the first dose of RNA CART-cMET and will continue until 4 months after the first infusion, or until another alternative therapy is initiated, whichever occurs earlier. Subjects will be continually reassessed for evidence of acute and cumulative toxicity.
