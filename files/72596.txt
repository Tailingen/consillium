Vemurafenib and Cobimetinib Combination in BRAF Mutated Melanoma With Brain Metastasis
The purpose of this study is to determine wether cobimetinib + vemurafenib combination treatment is effective in the treatment of BRAFV600-mutated melanoma patients with brain metastasis
Malignant Melanoma
DRUG: Cobimetinib + Vemurafenib combination treatment
Complete or partial intracranial response rate in cohort A on the evaluation of each patient's best tumor response by the centralized review committee according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria., From baseline up to 36 months
Complete or partial intracranial response rates in cohorts B and C based on the evaluation of each patient's best tumor response by the centralized review committee according to modified RECIST 1.1 criteria., Up to 36 months|Intracranial duration of response (DR) in cohorts A, B and C., Up to 36 months|Overall response rate of cohorts A, B and C, Up to 36 months|Overall survival in cohorts A, B and C, Up to 36 months|Frequency of Adverse events, Up to 36 months|Overall duration of response (DR) in cohorts A, B and C., Up to 36 months|Patient free survival in cohorts A, B and C, Up to 36 months
Ratio between cerebrospinal fluid concentration and plasmatic exposure of vemurafenib and cobimetinib, At Day15 Cycle 1|BRAF mutation rate in circulating DNA tumor, From baseline up to treatment stop or progression. An average of 8 cycles of treatment is expected.
Patients will be enrolled into 3 cohorts:

* Cohort A : Neurologically asymptomatic patients who have not received prior local treatment ;
* Cohort B. Neurologically asymptomatic patients who have received prior local treatment;
* Cohort C. Neurologically symptomatic patients who have or have not received prior local treatment Every patients will be treated with Vemurafenib 960 mg PO, twice daily from D1 to D28, continuously

Cobimetinib 60 mg PO, once daily, from D1 to D21 - 1 cycle = 28 days

Treatment will be administered until progression (intracranial or extracranial), unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, death or decision of the treating investigator.

Patients who develop intracranial or extracranial progression and who, in the opinion of the treating investigator, could benefit from continuing treatment may continue treatment with vemurafenib and cobimetinib after approval from the principal investigator.

Patients who discontinue the study treatment will undergo an end-of-treatment visit 30 days after the last dose of vemurafenib and/or cobimetinib.

Patients who discontinue the study treatment for any reason other than progression (e.g. toxicity) must be followed up every 8 weeks unless they withdraw their consent.
