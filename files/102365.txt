A Study of ARRY-334543 and Capecitabine in Patients With Advanced Cancer
This is a Phase 1 study during which patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors will receive investigational study drug ARRY-334543 and capecitabine. Patients will receive increasing doses of study drug in combination with capecitabine in order to achieve the highest dose of study drug possible that will not cause unacceptable side effects. Patients will be followed to see what side effects the combination causes and what effectiveness the combination has, if any, in treating the cancer. Approximately 30 patients from the US and Canada will be enrolled in this study.
