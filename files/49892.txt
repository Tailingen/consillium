Clinical Study of Atezolizumab (Anti-PD-L1) and Sipuleucel-T in Patients With Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of the study is to compare the safety and tolerability of sequential atezolizumab followed by sipuleucel-T (Arm 1) vs. sipuleucel-T followed by atezolizumab (Arm 2) in patients who have asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic CRPC, not previously treated with docetaxel or cabazitaxel.
