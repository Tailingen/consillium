Autologous HuCART19 T Cells Manufactured Using the CliniMACS Prodigy Platform for Pediatric B-ALL (huCART19 Prodigy)
This study will determine the safety and efficacy of moving to a second-generation manufacturing process using the CliniMACS Prodigy platform to manufacture huCART19 cells for patients with B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL).

BIOLOGICAL: Autologous Humanized CD19-Directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells (huCART19)
Safety of huCART19 Administration, The safety of the administering Humanized Cd19-Directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells (huCART9) will be measured by the monitoring the frequency and severity of adverse events in patients with advanced or refractory CD19+ hematologic malignancies, including those previously treated with cell therapy., 5 years|Efficacy of huCART19 Administration, The efficacy of huCART9 will be measured by the evaluating the overall response rate in patients with advanced or refractory CD19+ hematologic malignancies, including those previously treated with cell therapy., 5 years
Manufacturing Feasibility, Manufacturing feasibility will be measured by the percentage of manufactured products that do not meet release criteria for vector transduction efficiency, T cell product purity, viability, sterility, or due to tumor contamination., 5 years|Safety of huCART19 as measured by ≥ Grade 3 toxicity rate, Safety of huCART19 as measured by ≥ Grade 3 toxicity rate (toxicity that is possibly attributed to huCART19) that is unmanageable, unexpected, and unrelated to chemotherapy., 5 years|Anti-tumor response due to huCART19 cell infusions, For subjects with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to huCART19 cell infusions, as defined by the presence of medullary (morphologic or Minimal Residual Disease (MRD-level disease) and/or extramedullary disease at 1-month post-infusion., 5 years|Remission Rate, Overall remission rate will be measured by the proportion of treated subjects who achieve complete morphologic remission at Day 28 post huCART19 infusion., 5 years|huCART19 cell persistence, huCART 19 cell persistence will be measured by PCR (or flow) analysis of whole blood to detect and quantify survival of huCART19 cells over time., 5 years|Event Free Survival, 1-year Event-Free Survival (EFS) in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-ALL (Cohort A) and in subjects with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy (Cohort B)., 5 years|Relapse-Free Survival, 1-year Relapse-Free Survival (RFS) in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-ALL (Cohort A) and in subjects with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy (Cohort B)., 5 years|Overall Survival, 1-year Overall Survival (OS) in subjects with relapsed/refractory B-ALL (Cohort A) and in subjects with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy (Cohort B)., 5 years
Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cells (CAR T) cell therapy has shifted the treatment landscape for pediatric and young adult patients with multiply relapsed and refractory B-ALL (B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia), however, the manufacturing process remains in its first generation: laborious, time-intensive, and not automated. The time and significant personnel resources in this process can result in patient safety issues - with patients growing sicker, with harder to control leukemias - in the waiting period between T cell collection and completed CAR T cell product manufacture. Use of the CliniMACS Prodigy platform, that allows for semi-automated clinical-scale processing of huCART19 cell products in a functionally closed, sterile system, rapidly, without many of the logistical burdens encountered in the first-generation manufacturing method, can help to surmount these issues. This study will determine the safety and efficacy of moving to a second-generation manufacturing process using the CliniMACS Prodigy platform to manufacture huCART19 cells.
