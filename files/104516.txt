Radiation Therapy Followed by Carmustine in Treating Patients Who Have Supratentorial Glioblastoma Multiforme
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy followed by carmustine in treating patients who have supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
DRUG: carmustine|RADIATION: radiation therapy|RADIATION: stereotactic radiosurgery
Overall Survival, From registration to date of death or last follow-up. Analysis occurs after all patients have been potentially followed for 18 months.
Progression-free Survival, From registration to date of progression, death or last follow-up. Analysis occurs at the same time as the primary outcome analysis.
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the overall and progression-free survival in patients with supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme treated with accelerated radiotherapy and conformal stereotactic radiotherapy boost followed by carmustine.
* Determine the short and long-term toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the feasibility of this regimen in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive daily accelerated radiotherapy 5 days a week on weeks 1-2. On weeks 3-6, patients receive accelerated radiotherapy 4 days a week (3 days a week on week 6) and conformal stereotactic radiotherapy boost once weekly. Patients then receive carmustine IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 every 8 weeks for 6 courses beginning within 1 month after the completion of radiotherapy.

Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 76 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.
