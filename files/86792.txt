Percentage of Participants With a Hematologic Response Using International Working Group (IWG) Criteria for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Assessed by Investigator, Hematologic Response according to the 2000 International Working Group (IWG) response criteria for MDS was based on the Investigators determination and defined as:

* Complete Response (CR): repeat bone marrow (BM) shows \<5% myeloblasts, and peripheral blood values lasting ≥ 2 months of hemoglobin (hgb) (\>110 g/L), neutrophils (≥1.5x10\^9/L), platelets (≥100x10\^9/L), blasts (0%) and no dysplasia
* Partial Response (PR): same as CR for peripheral blood: BM shows blasts decrease by ≥ 50% or a less advanced FAB classification from pretreatment
* Stable disease (SD): failure to achieve a PR, no evidence of progression for at least 2 months.
* Failure: death during treatment or disease progression
* Relapse After CR or PR: return to pretreatment BM blast percent or decrement of ≥ 50% from remission/response levels in granulocytes or platelets; or reduction in hgb by ≥20 g/L or transfusion dependence
* Disease Progression: change in blast levels
* Disease Transformation to AML, Response assessed at end of cycle 6; through week 24; End of study|Percentage of Participants Showing Hematologic Improvement Using International Working Group (IWG Criteria for Hematologic Improvement Cheson 2000) Criteria for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Assessed by Sponsor, Hematologic improvements (HI) have 4 categories:

1. Erythroid response (HI-E): Major \>20g/L increase or transfusion independent. Minor- 10-20g/L increase or ≥50% decrease in transfusion requirements.
2. Platelet response (HI-P): Major absolute increase of ≥30x10\^9/L or platelet transfusion independence. Minor-≥50% increase.
3. Neutrophil response (HI-N): Major 100% increase or an absolute increase of \>0.5x10\^9/L. Minor-≥100% increase and absolute increase of \<0.5x10\^9/L
4. Progression or relapse after HI

Overall hematological improvement (HI) was defined as any type (major or minor) of improvement of HI-E, HI-P, or HI-N. Criteria: Pretreatment=hemoglobin \<100g/L or RBC transfusion-dependent, platelet count \<100x10\^9/L or platelet transfusion dependent, absolute neutrophil count \<1.5x10\^9/L. Sponsor's determination was derived using clinically relevant data.

Number of Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusions by Cycle, The number of transfusions received 56 days prior to treatment and during study were standardized per 28 days and summarized by cycle for RBCs. The formula for standardizing per 28 days was: \[(# of transfusions in the measurement period / length of the measurement period (days)) x 28\], where the measurement period was either baseline or the relevant cycle length. For each participant the overall post-baseline average was calculated as the average of # of RBC transfusions per cycle., Up to week 24;The on-treatment period was considered the period from the date of the first dose to the last treatment study visit.|Number of Platelet Transfusions by Cycle, The number of transfusions received 56 days prior to treatment and during study was standardized per 28 days and summarized by cycle for platelets.

Participants' Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion Status for Participants Who Were Transfusion Dependent at Baseline, A participant was considered transfusion dependent at baseline if the participant had one or more Red Blood Cell transfusions during the 56 days prior to first dose. During the study, a participant was considered transfusion independent during the on-treatment period if the participant had no transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more (e.g., Day 1 through 56, Day 2 through 57, etc). Otherwise, they were considered transfusion dependent.

The study has 3 phases which include the Screening Phase, the Treatment Phase, and the Post-Treatment Phase and outlined as follows:

Screening Phase:

Subjects will provide informed consent prior to undergoing any study-related procedures. Screening procedures are to take place within 28 days prior to the initiation of azacitidine treatment (Day 1, Cycle 1). Subject eligibility will be based on central pathology review. Bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy will be collected at screening and sent for morphological assessment by a central pathology reviewer prior to the subject receiving IP. The central pathology reviewer will document the MDS classification according to the FAB and WHO criteria (Appendix A and B, respectively).

A standard cytogenetic metaphase preparation will be prepared from the bone marrow aspirate and sent to the local or central laboratory (for sites without local analysis capability) for the cytogenetic analysis prior to receiving IP.

The IPSS score will be calculated using the central reviewer's pathology report for bone marrow blast percentage, local cytogenetic assessment for karyotype, and central laboratory report for number of cytopenias (Appendix D).

Treatment Phase:

The first dose of azacitidine for each subject begins on Day 1 of Cycle 1. All subjects will receive azacitidine 75 mg/m2/day SC for 7 days every 28 days for up to 6 cycles, unless they are discontinued from treatment. Visits during the treatment phase are to be scheduled weekly for the first 2 cycles, then every other week for all subsequent cycles throughout the rest of the study. Safety and efficacy measures are to be performed weekly, every other week, every 4 weeks, or at 24 weeks, depending on the procedure.

Post-Treatment Phase:

All discontinued subjects, regardless of reason for discontinuation, should undergo end-of-study procedures at the time of study discontinuation. Subjects will have a follow-up visit for the collection of adverse events up to 28 days after last IP dose.
