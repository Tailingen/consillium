Robot-Assisted Neurovascular Intervention
Patients scheduled for neurovascular interventions may be eligible to have their procedure done robotically.
Stroke|Meningioma|Neurovascular Disorder
PROCEDURE: cerebral angiography, arterial embolization, thrombectomy|DEVICE: Cerebral angiogram using robotic device|DEVICE: Meningioma embolization using robotic device.|DEVICE: Mechanical thrombectomy for stroke using a robotic device.
Success rate of target vessel access, Measurement Parameters: The primary outcome assesses whether the Vasco Robotic system navigates catheter or other procedural devices successfully to the target vessel., From enrollment through end of procedure.
Patients scheduled for manual neurovascular interventions, such as diagnostic cerebral angiography for cerebrovascular diseases, arterial embolization for meningioma treatment, and thrombectomy for thrombotic arterial occlusion-induced cerebral ischemia, may be considered to participate in this study.
