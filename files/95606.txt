Biomarkers of Angiogenesis and Disease in Patients With Unresectable Malignant Mesothelioma Treated on Clinical Trial CALGB-30107
RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of blood from patients with cancer to study in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about cancer and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is looking at biomarkers of angiogenesis and disease in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma treated on clinical trial CALGB-30107.
Malignant Mesothelioma
OTHER: immunoenzyme technique|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Level of biomarkers, including thrombospondin I, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and mesothelin (high vs low), baseline
Effect of biomarker expression level on overall survival, Up to 10 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine if elevated levels of thrombospondin I serum levels, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and mesothelin portend a poor prognosis in patients with unresectable malignant mesothelioma treated with vatalanib on protocol CALGB-30107.
* Determine if elevated levels of thrombospondin I serum levels, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and mesothelin correlate with response or stable disease in these patients.

OUTLINE: Serum samples previously obtained from patients on protocol CALGB-30107 are tested for levels of thrombospondin I serum, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor I, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor, and mesothelin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 specimens will be accrued for this study.
