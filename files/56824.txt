A Study of Neoadjuvant Paclitaxel in Combination With Bavituximab in Early- Stage Triple- Negative Breast Cancer
The primary purpose of this research study is to see whether adding bavituximab (an investigational drug) to the standard chemotherapy drug taxane, will improve the results of the treatment for early- stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer followed by Standard- of- Care surgery

BIOLOGICAL: Bavituximab|DRUG: Taxane
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant paclitaxel in combination with bavituximab in patients with early- stage triple- negative breast cancer (TNBC), Approximately 24 months
Safety Measures - Adverse Events and Laboratory Evaluations, approximately 24 months
This is an open-label randomized trial in patients with early- stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Patients will be treated with either paciltaxel alone or paclitaxel with bavituximab. Paclitaxel will be given weekly, and bavituximab will be given weekly. All therapy will continue for up to twelve doses of treatment followed by standard of care definitive surgical resection.
