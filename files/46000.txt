Validation of a Kinetic Model of Erlotinib
Several arguments are in favor of a therapeutic monitoring for the erlotinib, therefore, a pharmacokinetic (PK) has been prepared using data from the literature. This model must be validated at concentrations achieved in practice. This is a preliminary study before the implementation of a randomized trial confirming the therapeutic monitoring of erlotinib through this model.
Lung Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: group of patients
Difference between plasma concentrations of erlotinib concentrations observed and predictive model, 1 year
Correlation of Blood levels outsized with severe side effects or compromising the vital prognosis (treatment response, adherence (assessed by the test Morisky Green), Evaluation of interest to assay the active metabolite OSI-420 Observation between incidence of clinical problems (ineffectiveness, toxicity, adherence) and blood concentrations of erlotinib outsized.
