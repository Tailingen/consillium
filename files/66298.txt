Phase 2 Study of Inhaled Lipid Cisplatin in Pulmonary Recurrent Osteosarcoma
To establish whether treatment with Inhaled Lipid Cisplatin (ILC) is effective in delaying/preventing pulmonary relapse in osteosarcoma patients in complete surgical remission following one or two prior pulmonary relapses.
Pulmonary Relapse of Osteosarcoma
DRUG: Inhaled Lipid Cisplatin (ILC)
Observed Relapse Free Interval (RFI), Observed relapse free interval (RFI) will be compared to historical controls. Relapse free interval is defined as the time of diagnosis of the previous relapse to time of diagnosis of the new relapse., At relapse, estimated at 6-12 months average.
Median, 1, 2 and 5 year Overall Survival (OS), The percentage of patients alive at 1, 2 and 5 years and the median overall survival., 1, 2 and 5 Years|Median, 1, 2 and 5 year Event Free Survival (EFS), The percentage of patients surviving without disease relapse at 1, 2 and 5 years and the median event free survival., 1, 2 and 5 years
ILC is a novel formulation of cisplatin, designed for inhalation by nebulization. The anticipated pulmonary benefits of ILC over systemic cisplatin therapy are threefold:

* Increased local cisplatin concentrations
* Sustained release of cisplatin in the lungs
* Minimal systemic exposure to cisplatin

In this study, patients currently in surgical complete remission (CR) following one or two prior relapses of osteosarcoma involving pulmonary disease will be treated with ILC every two weeks for up to one year. ILC will be administered via nebulization.
