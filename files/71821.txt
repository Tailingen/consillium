Observatory of the Quality of Surgical Procedures for Digestive Cancers
Surgery for digestive cancers is managed according to quality standards, validated by the scientific community. Despite the diffusion of these standards through the benchmarks of good practice, the results of the surgery remain disparate.

In many countries, this "inequality of opportunity" has justified the establishment of quality assurance systems to measure the results of surgery for one or more localizations of digestive cancer.

These surgical audit experiments have shown a positive, rapid and cost-effective impact on complication rates, recurrence rates and overall survival even in the absence of interventional measures. The data collected also helped to improve the management of subgroups of patients usually excluded from clinical trials.

In Morocco, the National Cancer Prevention and Control Plan provides for the establishment of a quality assurance system with the introduction of a system for monitoring and evaluating the care of patients. This pilot project is part of this framework, for the group of patients who are candidates for surgery for digestive cancers.
