Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the best dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
RADIATION: hypofractionated radiation therapy|RADIATION: intensity-modulated radiation therapy
Late RTOG radiotherapy toxicity as assessed at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and then annually thereafter
Overall survival|Local control|PSA control|Acute side effects as assessed weekly by the RTOG scoring system|Quality of life|Patterns of recurrence
OBJECTIVES:

* To test the feasibility of delivering hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the prostate and pelvic nodes of patients with prostate cancer.
* To determine the optimal dose level of this treatment regimen to be used in future studies.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to small bowel total volume (low small bowel volume \< 450 cc vs high small bowel volume â‰¥ 450 cc).

Patients undergo hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the prostate and pelvis for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.
