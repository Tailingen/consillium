Assess Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Preliminary Efficacy of BAT8009
Primary objectives:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of BAT8009 in patients with advanced solid tumours.
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for Phase 2 (RP2D).
Locally Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumours
DRUG: BAT8009 for Injection
Dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), A DLT is defined as a toxicity occurring during the DLT observation period, A minimum of 21 days after first dose of BAT8009
Cmax (Maximum serum concentration), Maximum observed plasma or serum concentration, 126 days after first dosing|Immunogenicity, Presence of ADAs / neutralizing antibodies (NAbs)., 126 days after first dosing|AUC0-inf after Cycle 1 administration and AUC0- λ after Cycle 6 administration, area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity and to time λ, 126 days after first dosing
This is a first-in-human (FIH), multicentre, open-label, Phase 1 dose escalation and dose expansion study of BAT8009 (a B7H3-targeting antibody-drug conjugate) in patients with advanced solid tumours.
