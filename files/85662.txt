A Prospective Study of the Relevance of the HLA-G Immune Checkpoint in Cancer Immunotherapy
Therapeutic targeting of immune checkpoints PD-1/PD-L1 and/or CTLA-4 is efficient in several solid cancer subtypes, however only some patients do experience clinical benefit from these treatments. One explanation could be that multiple redundant checkpoints are present within the tumor, simultaneously keeping in check the patient's immune response. The immune checkpoint HLA-G is neo-expressed in over 50% of cases in some cancer subtypes and associated with more dismal prognosis. The immunosuppressive effects of HLA-G may result in resistance to current immunotherapy drugs.

The GEIA study explores the impact of HLA-G tumor expression on the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in solid cancer patients.
