Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT): A 15-year Experience From a Tertiary Care Cancer Center in Upper Egypt
The aim of this study is to identify demographic \& disease characteristics in pediatric oncology patients diagnosed with Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) \& treatment outcomes in these patients.

Ewing sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), Both entities that currently comprise the same spectrum of neoplastic diseases known as the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (EFT), were originally described as distinct clinicopathologic entities. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) first described in 1918 by Stout as a malignant tumor arising from major nerve. Later, in 1921, ES was described as an undifferentiated tumor involving the diaphysis of long bones. It was also reported to arise in soft tissue (extraosseous ES). EFT is aggressive malignant small round cell tumors of bone and soft-tissue that predominantly affecting children and young adults.
