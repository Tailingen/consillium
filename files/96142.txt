Diagnostic Performance for the detection of urothelial carcinoma, The efficacy of the urine DNA methylation/somatic mutation profiling assay for the detection of urothelial carcinoma comparing with pathologic diagnosis, including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (+LR), negative likelihood ratio (-LR) and accuracy., 1 Years
Sensitivity and Specificity in different pathological stages and histologic grades of urothelial carcinoma, Sensitivity and specificity of urine DNA methylation/somatic mutation profiling assay in different pathological stages and histologic grades of urothelial carcinoma., 1 Years
This is a prospective study that involves 11 centers in China and 1200 participants. The assay analyzes the DNA methylation/somatic mutation profiles of bladder cancer-specific biomarkers non-invasively using urine specimens collected before invasive diagnosis/treatment. The performance characteristics(sensitivity and specificity) of the assay for detection of urothelial carcinoma is evaluated in comparison to pathology or cystoscopy.
