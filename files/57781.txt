Tumor Necrosis Factors (TNF)-α Blockade for Psoriatic Arthritis
The purpose of this study is:

* To elucidate the immunomodulating properties of anti-TNF-α therapy in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
* To ascertain whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive tool in measuring early response after therapy with anti-TNF-α in the PsA wrist using the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) guidelines for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
* To assess whether the lipid and other cardiovascular risk profiles would improve after anti-TNF-α therapy in patients with PsA.
Psoriatic Arthritis
DRUG: Infliximab|DRUG: Etanercept
Changes in the degree of inflammation as reflected by the MRI score, cytokines and chemokine levels, week 52|Changes in the cardiovascular risk factor levels which are directly mediated by TNF-α, week 52
Number of patients who can achieve ACR 20, week 52|Correlation of clinical parameter, inflammatory markers and MRI findings, week 52
The study was a 12-week, open-label trial of anti-TNF therapy in 20 consecutive patients (Group 1). Another 20 consecutive patients with active disease whom have met the exclusion criteria, or were unwilling to start anti-TNF therapy for fear of toxicity would be recruited as control patients (Group 2). 20 healthy controls were recruited for comparison of the metabolic risk factors (Group 3). Study visits for groups 1 and 2 were conducted at baseline, weeks 2 and 6, and then week 12.
