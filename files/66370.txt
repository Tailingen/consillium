BEHAVIORAL: Yoga lessons
Change of physiological distress, Evaluation of the efficacy of yoga on reduction of physiological distress after the end of radiotherapy, measured via Short Form 36 (SF-36), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Quality of life questionnaire Core30 (QLQ-C30) questionnaire, and physiological functions (cortisol, blood sampling with proinflammatory markers evaluation) in stage 0-III breast cancer patients, up to 32 months
Evaluation of quality of life with yoga during and after radiotherapy, Assess whether yoga helps on increase Quality of Life (QOL) and decreasing fatigue via questionnaire Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)., up to 6 months
The study aims to assess QoL, fatigue and physiological distress (cortisol and proinflammatory markers) with blood sampling on day 1,15 and last of radiotherapy, at 1-3-6 months after the end of radiotherapy.
