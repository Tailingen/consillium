A Study of Perfusion of Colorectal Anastomosis Using FLuorescence AnGiography (FLAG-trial)
This is a randomized, controlled, parallel study to determine the difference in post-operative anastomotic leak rate of colorectal anastomosis where colon and rectal tissue perfusion is evaluated using fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green and without this method.
Rectal Cancer|Sigmoid Cancer
DEVICE: Fluorescence angiography with indocianyne green
Anastomotic Leak Rate, 0 to 30 days
The design involves random allocation of eligible patients to operation with colorectal anastomosis and intraoperative fluorescence angiography with indocyanine green and operation alone. After surgery on 7-8 POD patients are examined to two sides X-Ray proctography performed by introducing 100 ml of water-soluble liquid contrast material through the anus over the anastomotic line by a Foley catheter for diagnosis of anastomotic leakage.
