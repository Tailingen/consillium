The Use of Samsung Health and ECG M-Trace Base II Applications in the Secondary Prevention After Stroke
The aim of the present study was to quantitatively assess the risk factors that may affect the re-occurrence of a CVD event and the use of a commercially available mobile application Samsung Health for the assessment of parameters of exercise tolerance and the ECG M-Trace Base II application for the assessment of cardiological parameters.

In the post-stroke group and in the control group, SMWT (Six Minute Walk Test) and SCT( Stair Climb Test) were preceded by a 10-minute rest in sitting position. The time of test performance, the walked distance and steps made as well as the mean and maximum gait velocity and the calories burned were assessed using the above-mentioned Samsung Health application . ECG results were assessed with the use of ECG M-Trace Base II application described above. In addition, cardiological parameters such as: systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR) and arterial blood saturation were assessed. The measurements were performed at rest and directly after SCMT and SCT. Additionally, after the tests, the level of dyspnoea and fatigue was assessed according to the modified Borg scale (score 0-10).
