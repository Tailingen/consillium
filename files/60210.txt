Prevention of Locally Advanced NSCLC Radiotherapy Pneumonia by Inhaling Beclomethasone Propionate
Radical radiotherapy is the main treatment of locally advanced lung cancer, and radiation pneumonia is the main toxic effects of radiotherapy. Among them, the fatality rate of severe radiation pneumonia can reach 50%, which is very harmful to tumor patients. At present, the treatment mode of radiation pneumonia is very few, and the therapeutic effect is poor. The prevention of radiation pneumonitis may be the best way to reduce the number of patients with Post-radiotherapy pneumonia. Previous small clinical studies have shown that the incidence of radiation pneumonia in inhaled beclomethasone group (2 /28) was significantly lower than that in oral prednisone group (8 /29) during radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy between the therapeutic group (inhaled beclomethasone during radiotherapy) and the control radiotherapy group (patients received radiotherapy only), especially the incidence of radiation-induced pneumonia within half a year.
Locally Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Beclomethasone propionate
Incidence of radiation pneumonia between two groups of patients, To evaluate the incidence of radiation pneumonia in 36weeks since thoracic irradiation between two groups of patients, Chest CT assessment every 6 weeks since thoracic irradiation, up to 36 weeks.
Objective Response Rate between two groups of patients, To evaluate Objective response rate every 6weeks since thoracic irradiation., tumor assessment every 6 weeks since thoracic irradiation , up to 36 weeks.|Side effects between two groups of patients, To evaluated in the 36 weeks since the thoracic irradiation began according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0, 36 weeks .
Quality of life between two groups of patients, evaluated every 6 weeks since the thoracic irradiation began according to the EORTC Quality-of-Life Questionnarire-Lung Cancer 13 Module(EORTC OLO-LC13), 36 weeks
To compare the incidence of radiation pneumonia, effect and side effects of radiotherapy in lung between beclomethasone inhalation therapeutic group and control radiotherapy group in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) during radiotherapy.
