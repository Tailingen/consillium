Study of Liposomal Curcumin in Combination With RT and TMZ in Patients With Newly Diagnosed High-Grade Gliomas
The objective of this study is to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of Liposomal Curcumin (LC) in combination with radiotherapy (RT) and Temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with newly diagnosed High-Grade Gliomas (HGG).

The number of observed Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs), The MTD/RP2D of LC in combination with XRT and TMZ and adjuvant TMZ in newly diagnosed HGG will be determined by recording the number of observed dose limiting toxicities (DLTs). DLTs, as defined in this study occur if in the first three patients entered at a dose-level, more than one of these 3 experiences a serious adverse event, as defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5. If one of the first three patients entered at the level experiences an SAE (as defined by NCI CTCAE Version 5), then three additional patients are entered at that same dose level. If one of the additional three patients experiences an SAE (as defined by NCI CTCAE Version 5), the dose is not advanced beyond that level., 10 weeks|The number of observed Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLTs), The safety and tolerability of LC infused IV over 3 hours will be assessed by recording the number of observed DLTs. DLTs, as defined in this study occur if in the first three patients entered at a dose-level, more than one of these 3 experiences a serious adverse event, as defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 5. If one of the first three patients entered at the level experiences an SAE (as defined by NCI CTCAE Version 5), then three additional patients are entered at that same dose level. If one of the additional three patients experiences an SAE (as defined by NCI CTCAE Version 5), the dose is not advanced beyond that level., The duration of treatment for each patient, minimum of 34 weeks
The incidence of Adverse Events, The safety and tolerability of LC in combination with standard XRT/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ will be assessed by recording the incidence of Adverse Events (AEs) using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 5.0.

Subjects will undergo medical history evaluations, physical and neurological examinations, brain MRI, functional assessment using the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) Index, vital sign measurements, weight, adverse event assessments, concomitant medication assessments, and laboratory testing including but not limited to blood sample collection for hematology and chemistry, urinalysis, coagulation, lipid panel, electrocardiogram, and pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential., The duration of treatment for each patient, minimum of 34 weeks|The proportion of patients at each dose level who receive at least 80% of the planned infusions of LC, 80% of XRT, and 60% of TMZ during the first 10 weeks of treatment, The feasibility of weekly LC infusion will be assessed by recording the proportion of patients at each dose level who are able to complete at least 80% of the planned infusions of LC, 80% of XRT, and 60% of TMZ during the first 10 weeks of treatment., 10 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), The efficacy of weekly LC infusion will be assessed by recording overall survival (OS) at each dose level, defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment with LC to time of death., The duration of treatment for each patient, minimum of 34 weeks; OS is time from beginning of therapy to time of death.|Progression free survival (PFS), The efficacy of weekly LC infusion will be assessed by recording progression free survival (PFS) based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria at each dose level, defined as defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment with LC to time of progression or death., The duration of treatment for each patient, minimum of 34 weeks; PFS is time from the start of therapy until the date when tumor progression is documented
This study is a Phase Ib-IIa, single-center, single-institution, open-label, dose-escalation study in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade malignant gliomas. Dose finding will be performed using a time-to-event Bayesian optimal interval (TITE-BOIN) rule-based schema.

The primary objectives of the study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose /recommended phase 2 dose of Liposomal Curcumin (LC) in combination with radiotherapy (XRT), and TMZ and adjuvant TMZ in newly diagnosed High-Grade Gliomas.

The secondary objectives are to estimate the safety and tolerability of LC in combination with standard XRT and TMZ and adjuvant TMZ, to determine the feasibility of treatment during first 10 week.

This study is an unblinded, sequential treatment intervention employing 3 dose levels.

Approximately 50 patients will be screened to achieve up to 30 patients assigned to study intervention: up to 24 in Study Part 1 and up to 6 in Study Part 2.

All patients will be treated with open-label intravenous (IV) LC on a weekly basis for a minimum of 34 infusions which begins following healing of glioma resection and at the approximate time of the initiation of SOC XRT and TMZ therapy. Patients will have LC therapy discontinued when there is either evidence of a) disease progression, b) safety concerns leading to discontinuation, or c) the patient requests to terminate LC therapy. LC weekly treatment will be continued following 34 weeks of treatment depending on patient's desires. Regular phone (or clinic) follow-up follows cessation of LC treatment (if stopped) to capture patient data on OS and PFS.
