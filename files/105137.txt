A Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of Adavosertib for Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
The purpose of this study is to allow continued adavosertib treatment of patients with advanced solid tumours participating in the adavosertib clinical pharmacology studies and to assess the continued safety and tolerability of adavosertib for patients enrolled in adavosertib clinical pharmacology studies (hereafter referred to as the 'parent studies') who continue to use the therapy
Advanced Solid Tumours
DRUG: Adavosertib
Number of patients with serious and non-serious adverse events, Assessment of the safety and tolerability of adavosertib following oral dosing of the capsule formulation in patients with advanced solid tumours, From screening to safety follow-up (30 days after last dose)
Patients will be screened within 14 days of Day 1 of the treatment period. During screening, patients will undergo an appropriate washout period after the last dose of adavosertib in the parent clinical pharmacology study before receiving the first dose of adavosertib in this study.

Patients will continue to receive adavosertib as long as they are benefiting from treatment in the investigator's opinion and do not meet any other discontinuation criteria.

The number of patients who enroll is dependent on the number of patients who complete the parent studies, and who tolerate adavosertib in the parent study.

The anticipated total duration of the study is approximately 3 years.
