Ultrasound Guided Port-A-Cath Isertion in Cancer Patients
Port-A-Cath is a totally implanted central venous access system and one of the most frequently used systems for administration of chemotherapies in oncological patients .

The currently used techniques for placement of totally implantable venous access devices involve the open insertion by cut down technique, or percutaneous puncture of the central vein either by anatomical landmarks or image guided approach by using ultrasound guidance which is increasingly being preferred over the traditional anatomical landmark due to its low complication rate and high technical success rate; as this technique enables the direct visualization of needle entrance and advancement into the target vein
