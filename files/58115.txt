Exercise Training for the Improvement of Immune Activity and Treatment Outcomes During Immunotherapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, BOOST Trial
This clinical trial studies how well exercise training works in improving immune activity and treatment tolerance and response in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are receiving immunotherapy. Immunotherapy may help the body's immune system attack the cancer and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The use of immunotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC has been rapidly increasing. Although immunotherapy have shown great potential in cancer therapy, not all patients benefit from this therapy and resistance to it can occur. This could be due to poor immune activity. It has been shown that exercise can enhance systemic immune activity in various ways. The exercise training used in this study is aerobic interval training. Aerobic interval training increases the heart rate and the body's use of oxygen and alternates short periods of intense aerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods. This may cause biological changes which may improve immune activity and treatment response in patients with NSCLC who are receiving immunotherapy.

VO2peak is defined as the highest values of oxygen uptake averaged over set intervals (i.e., 30-second) during the test. VO2peak will be reported in both relative and absolute terms., Baseline (Week 1) and post-intervention (Week 26)|Mean difference in timed balance, Balance will be assessed under 3 conditions: a) side-by-side stand with both feet plated on the ground for 10 seconds or when the subject steps out of position; b) semi-tandem stand with the side of the heel of one foot touching the big toe of the other foot for 10 seconds or when the subject steps out of position; c) tandem stand with the heel of one foot touching the big toe of the other foot for 10 seconds or when the subject steps out of position., Baseline (Week 1) and post-intervention (Week 26)|Mean difference in gait speed, Gait speed will be assessed over a 4-meter flat surface distance. The participant will be asked to complete 2 attempts of this test. Time will be recorded using an electronic timing system., Baseline (Week 1) and post-intervention (Week 26)|Mean difference in chair stand, Chair stand will be assessed that subjects will perform a single chair stand and if successful, they will be asked to perform 5 repeated chair stands as quickly as possible; time to completion will be recorded., Baseline (Week 1) and post-intervention (Week 26)|Mean difference in health-related quality of life, Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients complete virtual home-based aerobic interval training sessions with a trained exercise specialist via stationary bike over approximately 60 minutes once a week (QW) during weeks 1-4, twice a week (BIW) during weeks 5-8, and three times a week (TIW) during weeks 9-24 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive a stationary bike, heart rate (HR) monitor, blood pressure (BP) monitor, oxygen saturation (SPO2) monitor, and a general healthy lifestyle guidebook for cancer patients and survivors on study. Patients also undergo blood sample collection, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), pulmonary function test (PFT), physical fitness and function tests, and questionnaires throughout the study.
