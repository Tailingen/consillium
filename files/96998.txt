Personalized Targeted Preparative Regimen Before T-depleted Allogeneic HSCT in Children With Chemoresistent Acute Leukemias
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of personalized targeted therapy in combination with high-dose chemotherapy as part of a preparative regimen before T-depleted allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children with chemoresistant acute leukemias

The outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in a cohort of children with chemorefractory leukemia is poor. The incidence of relapse exceeds 50% and survival varies from 10 to 40%. Additional attempts at remission induction with various combinations of chemotherapy are unlikely to improve the outcome and will contribute to toxicity.

The hypothesis of the study is that personalized targeted therapy combined with high-dose chemotherapy may improve the outcome of allogeneic HSCT in a cohort of pediatric patients with refractory leukemia.

Bcl-2, CD38, CD184 were chosen as potential targets due to frequent expression in pediatric acute leukemias, availability of marketed targeted therapies venetoclax, daratumumab and prelixafor, and expected non-overlapping toxicity profile of these agents and the conditioning regimen.
