Prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) Following Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Oropharynx Treatment by Combined Chemoradiotherapy
The study's aim is to determinate the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome after treatment by combined chemoradiotherapy in a locally advanced stages treated population of oropharyngeal cancer. Indeed, the level of knowledge about the consequences of oropharyngeal cancer treatment on sleep quality remains poor but the few studies published on the subject suggest an increased risk of development of OSAHS for these patients.
Obstructive Sleep Apnea-hypopnea|Oropharyngeal Cancer
Prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome after treatment by combined chemoradiotherapy., Number of patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome after treatment combined chemoradiotherapy., Day 28
Severity of OSAHS as a function of the post-therapeutic delay., Value of the AHI as a function of the post-therapeutic delay which corresponds to the delay compared to the end of the curative treatment carried out for squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. It is obtained after the inclusion visit and the realization of the polygraphy with the IAH score. OSAHS is mild (if IAH ≥ 5 / h and \<15 / h), moderate (if IAH ≥ 15 / h and ≤ 30 / h) or severe (if IAH\> 30 / h), Day 28
