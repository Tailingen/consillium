Impact of Three-dimensional Visualization on Operation Strategy and Complications for Pancreatic Cancer
The aim of the multi-centre study is to evaluate correctly the impact of three dimensional visualization on operation strategy and complications for Pancreatic Cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
Impact on operation strategy of three dimensional visualization technique, Firstly, the operation strategies based on original CT or MRI image data will be made by the team, Secondly, the operation strategies based on three dimensional reconstruction models will be made by the team, then, actually surgical strategies will be recorded. The change of operation strategy will be assessed by comparing the strategy of the 2D model and 3D model. The change rate of operation strategy will be recorded and presented as percentage., 30 days
Impact on complication of three dimensional visualization technique, The early postoperative complication and mortality are defined as the event observed within 30 days after surgerypostoperative bleeding, biliary fistula, ascites, postoperative liver failure, renal dysfunction, pleural effusion, abdominal cavity infection, abdominal abscess, incision infection, the occurrence cases of each complication (number) will be recorded., 30 days|1-year disease free survival rate, 12 months
Because of the complexity of Pancreatic Cancer, the limitations of 2D images of CT/MRI and the uncertainty of surgeons'experience, it is difficult for the surgeons to diagnosis and assess the operation strategy accurately based on traditional 2D imaging(CT/MRI).The aim of the multi-centre study is to evaluate correctly the impact of three-dimensional visualization on operation strategy and complications for Pancreatic Cancer.
