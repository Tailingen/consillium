Phase 1, Dose-Escalation Study of IGN002 in NHL Subjects
A Phase 1, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Multiple Intravenous Doses of IGN002 Administered Weekly to Subjects with Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: IGN002
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of IGN002 administered weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion to subjects with refractory NHL, Adverse Event collection and assessment will be done for all potentially treated subjects to assess the safety, tolerability, and determine the maximum tolerated dose, Weekly for 6 months
To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ascending doses of IGN002 administered weekly, Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as Maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), minimum concentration(Cmin), area under the curve (AUC), half-life (t1/2), clearance (CL), Weekly for 6 months|To assess the anti-tumor activity of IGN002 using the Lugano Classification for NHL, Determine the therapeutic effects, in terms of objective response rate and duration, of the therapeutic agent in NHL patients., Every 8 weeks for 6 months, then at 1, 3 and 6 months
This open-label, non-randomized, first-in-human Phase 1 study involves two stages:

In the Dose-Escalation Stage, ascending dose cohorts will be treated in 2 periods until the maximum tolerated dose is identified. In Period 1, subjects will receive 2 doses of IGN002 administered weekly. In Period 2, subjects will receive up to 24 additional doses of IGN002 administered weekly in three 8-week cycles. Subjects that have not progressed following the treatment period will be followed for another 6 months.

In the Expansion Stage, subjects will receive up to 24 doses of IGN002 at the identified maximum tolerated dose administered weekly in three 8-week cycles. Subjects that have not progressed following the treatment period will be followed for another 6 months.
