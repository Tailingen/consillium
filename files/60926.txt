The Supporting Understanding of PCOS Education and Research (SUPER) Study
This research will test whether a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) or a very low-carbohydrate diet better improves outcomes like blood glucose control and body weight for adults with polycystic ovary syndrome.

Participants will have screening (includes blood draw) and baseline testing with a continuous glucose monitor and a body composition scan (called a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry or DEXA). Once these enrollment steps are completed and the participants will be randomized to one of two 12-month programs.
Polycystic Ovary
BEHAVIORAL: DASH diet|BEHAVIORAL: Very low-carbohydrate diet
Change in HbA1c, percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin, 0 to 12 months
Change in percent body weight loss, percent change, 0-12 months|Change in glycemic variability, This will be measured with an Abbott Libre Pro continuous glucose monitoring device on participants' upper arm and the information on the sensor is blinded to participants.

The monitoring device will record participants' glucose levels in the interstitial fluid by a glucose oxidase method every 15 minutes, continuously for 14 days at each time point.

The glucose variability and the proportion of time spent in the euglycemic (3-7.8 millimoles per litre (mmol/l)) and hyperglycemic (â‰¥ 11.1 mmol/l for at least 15 minutes) states, following previous standards for interstitial glucose concentrations., 0 to 12 months|Change in percent body fat on DEXA, This will be measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, 0 to 12 months|Change in HbA1c, percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin, 0 to 4 months
