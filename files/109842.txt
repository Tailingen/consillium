Decoding the Extracellular Vesicles-driven Communication in the Microenvironment of Hairy Cell Leukemia to Improve Patient Care Management
This is a national multi-centre, experimental, cross-sectional, non-profit study.
Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL)
Extracellular vesicle characterization, Verify whether hairy cell leukemia patients at different status (at diagnosis, in complete remission \> 2 years, or relapsed meeting treatment indications) display specific extracellular vesicle-based signatures., 1 years
Functional effects of extracellular vesicles, Elucidate whether plasma-derived extracellular vesicles of hairy cell leukemia patients and healthy donors and in vitro hairy cell-derived extracellular vesicles may functionally educate the immune microenvironment. Elucidate whether plasma-derived extracellular vesicles of patients and healthy donors may functionally affect the isolated hairy cells. Understand whether plasma-derived extracellular vesicles of patients and healthy donors and in vitro hairy cell-derived extracellular vesicles might shape the stromal microenvironment toward fibrosis., 1 years
Extracellular vesicles are small particles circulating in plasma and documented as key players of intercellular crosstalk thanks to their cargo of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. The driving hypothesis of this study is that in Hairy Cell Leukemia-derived extracellular vesicles contribute to the maintenance of the tumor clone through regulation of selected key cells of the tumor microenvironment including immune cells and stromal cells, likely favoring immune evasion and marrow fibrosis. As a consequence, these circulating particles may be instrumental at identifying a biology-related, disease-specific and extracellular vesicle-based signature associated to outcomes.
