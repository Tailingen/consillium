Endostar Combined With SBRT and Envafolimab in the Treatment of Advanced Gastrointestinal Tumors
This is a single-arm, prospective, exploratory clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endostar combined with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and Envafolimab in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer after multi-line treatment.

This is a single-arm, prospective and exploratory clinical study. Sixteen patients with gastric or colorectal cancer who did not have standard treatment or refused standard treatment/chemotherapy after multi-line treatment were enrolled. The patients were treated with endostar combined with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and Envafolimab to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this regimen. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). The secondary endpoints were safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
