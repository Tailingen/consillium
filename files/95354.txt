Metformin+ Drospirenone/ethinylestradiol30µg and Flow-mediated Dilation in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of ethinylestradiol 30µg-drospirenone combined with metformin and weight loss by means of dietary intervention on the indices of endothelial dysfunction (i.e. flow-mediated dilation and serum endothelin-1), serum hsCRP,lipids,insulin resistance and body composition in young women with PCOS.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) frequently cluster several cardiovascular risk markers and early subclinical atherosclerosis. Because combined oral contraceptives (COCs), the most common treatment of this disease, might adversely influence insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, lipid profile or aggravate chronic inflammation the possibility of worsening the already unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile of PCOS subjects is of concern. On the contrary, the insulin sensitizer metformin has been shown to ameliorate insulin resistance, reduce hyperandrogenism and triglyceride levels and also to improve endothelial structure and function in PCOS. Drospirenone (DRP) is a progestin with antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid activity. However, the studies assessing the effect of the COC containing 30 µg EE+3mg DRP (DRP/EE30µg) on surrogate markers of atherosclerosis are few and inconclusive. Therefore,the purpose of the present study is to assess the effects of the oral contraceptive DRP/EE30µg combined with metformin and weight loss by means of dietary intervention on the indices of endothelial dysfunction, i.e. flow-mediated dilation and serum endothelin-1, serum hsCRP,lipids, and insulin resistance in young women with PCOS.
