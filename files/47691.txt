Phase III Randomized Trial of Thalidomide/Dexamethasone Versus Vincristine+Adriamycin+Dexamethasone (VAD)
Investigators planned to accrue 176 participants, to compare the response rate, overall response rate and survival of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) when randomized to two regimens (thalidomide+Dexamethasone versus Vincristine+Adriamycin+Dexamethasone). Investigators also planned to test if treatment with zoledronate immediately prior to chemotherapy results in an enhanced response to treatment (i.e. increase in complete response rates).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: zoledronic acid|DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: thalidomide|DRUG: vincristine|DRUG: adriamycin
Response Rates of VAD vs. Thalidomide/Dexamethasone, Blade (15) criteria for remission in multiple myeloma was used to assess response. Complete Response (CR)includes: Disappearance of the original monoclonal protein from the blood and urine on at least two determinations for a minimum of 6 weeks by immunofixation studies. Partial Response (PR) includes: At least a 50% reduction in the level of serum monoclonal protein for at least two determinations 6 weeks apart. Minimal Response (MR)includes: At least a 25% to 49% reduction in the level of serum monoclonal protein for at least 2 determinations 2 weeks apart., End of Cycle 4 - 4 Months per Participant
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, by Group, Number of participants with toxicities of Thalidomide/Dexamethasone vs. VAD as induction regimens in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM)., 4 Years, 7 Months|Number of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS), by Treatment Arm, Number of participants with PFS for thalidomide/Dexamethasone vs. VAD with respect to progression free survival in newly diagnosed MM. Progressive Disease (PD): (for patients not in CR) Requires one or more of the following; \> 25% increase in the level of serum monoclonal paraprotein, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 5 g/L and confirmed on a repeat investigation.

\> 25% increase in 24-hour urinary light chain excretion, which must also be an absolute increase of at least 200mg and confirmed on a repeat investigation.

\>25% increase in plasma cells in a bone marrow aspirate, which also must be an absolute increase of at least 10%. Definite increase in the size of existing lytic lesions or plasmacytomas. Development of new bone lesions or plasmacytomas (except compression fractures). Development of hypercalcemia (corrected calcium \> 11.5 mg/dL not attributable to other causes)., 4 Months|Overall Survival (OS), by Treatment Arm, Median OS for thalidomide/Dexamethasone participants vs. VAD participants. Months from On Study to Expired/Last Date Known Alive.

Investigators had planned to accrue 176 participants to calculate median overall survival., Up to 10 Years
Patients Randomized to receive VAD (vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone): All patients received four cycles of VAD repeated every 4 weeks. Chemotherapy was administered by continuous IV Infusion for 96 hours: vincristine at a dose of 0.4 mg/day and doxorubicin at a dose of 9 mg/m\^2/day. Patients were administered dexamethasone 40 mg by mouth (PO) on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of the initial two cycles. Dexamethasone was given only on days 1-4 of all subsequent cycles. Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid IV on either Day 1 or 15 of each cycle. This schedule continued monthly as long as the patient remained on study. The dose was calculated based on the patients' monthly creatinine clearance. Upon initiation of Zometa therapy, the following guidelines were applied: For patients with creatinine clearance \>60 mL/min, the recommended dose remained at 4mg. For patients with reduced creatinine clearance, dosing was calculated to achieve the same area under curve (AUC) as in patients with creatinine clearance of 75 mL/min. Creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.
