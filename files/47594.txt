Trial of Neoadjuvant Ipilimumab Followed by Melphalan Via Isolated Limb Infusion for Patients With Unresectable In-transit Extremity Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to determine safety profile, initial response rates and progression free survival for the combination therapy of neoadjuvant system ipilimumab followed by ILI with melphalan in patients with in transit melanoma.

Hypothesis:

The combination of regional LPAm plus systemic ipilimumab will lead to a larger response rate than either therapy alone.

The combination of regional LPAm plus systemic ipilimumab will cause larger changes in immune cell populations than are seen with either therapy along.

Changes in immune cell populations will predict progression free survival.
Unresectable Melanoma
DRUG: Ipilimumab
Safety and tolerability, The primary objective is to characterize the safety and tolerability of combining IPI and ILI by determining the MTD of IPI when used prior to ILI with LPAM., 2 years
Response Rate, Estimate the complete response rate to ipi plus ILI in the patients who received the MTD of ipi., 3 years|Progression Free Survival, 2 years
