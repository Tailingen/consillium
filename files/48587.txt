Doxepin Solution for Alleviation of Stubborn Breakthrough Pain Induced by Swallowing in Patients Receiving Radiotherapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the effectiveness and adverse reactions of doxepin solution spray for alleviation of stubborn breakthrough pain induced by swallowing in patients receiving radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Swallowing-induced Pain
DRUG: doxepin solution|OTHER: Placebo
Redution of swallowing-induced pain, The redution of swallowing-induced pain was measured by the numerical analogue scale of 0 to 10, with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain in the questionnaires taken at baseline, and 10, 20, 30, 60 minutes after assigned administration., Baseline, and 10, 20, 30, 60 minutes after administration
Total Drowsiness Increase, The total drowsiness increase was measured by the numerical analogue scale of 0 to 10, with 0=no drowsiness and 10=extreme drowsiness in the questionnaires taken at baseline, and 10, 20, 30, 60 minutes after assigned administration., Baseline, and 10, 20, 30, 60 minutes after administration|Total Taste of the Agent, The total taste of the agent was measured by the numerical analogue scale of 0 to 10, with 0=acceptable and 10=terrible in the questionnaires taken at 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes after assigned administration., 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes after administration|Total Stinging or Burning From the Agent, The stinging or burning of the oral cavity/oropharynx was measured by the numerical analogue scale of 0 to 10, with 0=no stinging or burning and 10=worst stinging or burning in the questionnaires taken at 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes after assigned administration., 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes after administration|Difficulty in Swallowing Different Food, The difficulty in swallowing liquids, pureed food and solid food was measured respectively by the numerical analogue scale of 0 to 10, with 0=not at all and 10=very much in the questionnaires taken at 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes after assigned administration., Baseline, and 10, 20, 30, 60 minutes after administration|Patient Preference for Continuing Therapy With the Agent, Patients were asked if they would like to continue treatment with that particular agent at 60 minutes after assigned administration., 60 minutes after administration|Adverse Event Profiles, Adverse events were assessed and record using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5.0., up to one day after administration
Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma receiving radical radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy who developed oral mucositis and had a swallowing-induced pain score ≥ 4 were recruited and randomly assigned 1:1 to the experimental group and the control group.

Patients in the experimental group received a doxepin solution spray to the posterior pharyngeal wall 10 minutes before eating. At least 12 hours later, when the swallowing-induced pain score ≥4, a placebo spray was administered to the posterior pharyngeal wall 10 minutes before eating.

Patients in the control group received a placebo spray to the posterior pharyngeal wall 10 minutes before eating. At least 12 hours later, when the swallowing-induced pain score ≥4, a doxepin solution spray was administered to the posterior pharyngeal wall 10 minutes before eating.

The swallowing-induced pain and incidence of adverse events were assessed at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour after medication using a patient-reported questionnaire, and safety evaluation was conducted 1 day after treatment.
