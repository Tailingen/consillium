Study in Patients With Solid Tumor Regarding Access to Dermo-cosmetics and Aesthetic Solutions
Cancer treatments can trigger cutaneous side-effects, as well as nail and hair toxicities. When related to drug treatment, this iatrogeny depends on the type of drug, its dosage and individual susceptibility. Although these dermatological adverse events are rarely serious, they can significantly alter patients' quality of life, and may even necessitate the introduction of curative treatment.

The impact of these side effects can be mitigated by the use of dermo-cosmetic products and aesthetic solutions. However, most of this supportive care is not reimbursed by the health insurance system, representing a source of inequalities in access to healthcare for cancer patients.
