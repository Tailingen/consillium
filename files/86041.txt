Clinical Trial of TQB2825 Injection Combined Immunochemotherapy in Subjects With Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
To explore the efficacy and safety of TQB2825 injection combined immunochemotherapy in subjects with untreated or R/R DLBCL.

The efficacy evaluation indicators are objective response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CR rate),progression free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR) and overall survival(OS).

The safety evaluation indicators are dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) , maximum tolerated dose (MTD)and recommended phase II dose (RP2D).
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: TQB2825 injection +R-CHOP regimen|DRUG: TQB2825 injection + GemOx
Dose Limited Toxicity, The occurrence of one or more unacceptable toxicities after administration, which prevents the increase of dosage or the extension of the dosing interval., Baseline to up to two years|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), If dose limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs in 2 or more subjects in a given dose group, the dose level in the previous dose group is considered MTD., Baseline to up to two years
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR: According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune RECIST (iRECIST), the proportion of subjects whose tumors are evaluated as complete response(CR) and partial response(PR) by subcenter imaging evaluation. It is recorded from the first use of the drug to disease progression or initiation of a new anticancer treatment., Baseline to up to two years|Complete response (CR), The percentage of subjects achieving complete response (CR) according to the Lugano classification criteria of 2014., Baseline to up to two years|Progression-free survival (PFS), The period from the first use of the drug to disease progression or death (whichever occurs first)., Baseline to up to two years|Duration of Remission (DOR), The period from firstly-recorded objective tumor response (CR or PR) to firstly-recorded objective tumor progression or death due to any cause (whichever occurs first) ., Baseline to up to two years|Overall survival (OS), From randomization to the time of death from any cause., Baseline to up to five years|Incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), All adverse medical events that occur after the subject receives the investigational drug may be manifested as symptoms, signs, disease, or laboratory abnormalities, but are not necessarily causally related to the investigational drug.The nature and severity of adverse events were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) standard for common toxicity criteria (CTC) version 5.0 reactions., Baseline to up to two years|Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), It refers to adverse medical events such as death, life-threatening, permanent or serious disability or loss of function, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, and congenital abnormalities or birth defects after the subject receives the experimental drug., Baseline to up to two years
