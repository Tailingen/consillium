Pevonedistat, Azacitidine, Fludarabine Phosphate, and Cytarabine in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This phase I trial studies the side effects and how well pevonedistat, azacitidine, fludarabine phosphate, and cytarabine work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that has come back (relapsed) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Pevonedistat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as azacitidine, fludarabine phosphate, and cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and pevonedistat may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To describe the effect of MLN4924 (pevonedistat) administered on this schedule on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcript levels of genes known to be induced by MLN4924 (pevonedistat) mediated NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE) inhibition.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally on day 0 at least 24 hours prior to the start of each cycle. Patients then receive azacitidine intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes once daily (QD) on days 1-5, pevonedistat IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5, and fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes QD and cytarabine IV over 1-3 hours QD on days 6-10. Patients with central nervous system (CNS)2 or CNS3 receive cytarabine intrathecally or methotrexate intrathecally, hydrocortisone intrathecally, and cytarabine intrathecally on days 8 and 11-34. Cycles continue for 35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or greater with non-hematologic toxicities probably or definitely related to pevonedistat may receive an additional cycle of treatment.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
