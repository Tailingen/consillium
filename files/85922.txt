A Two-arm (Phase 2) Exploratory Study of Nivolumab Monotherapy or in Combination With Nab-paclitaxel and Carboplatin in Early Stage NSCLC in China
Nivolumab (BMS-936558) is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isotype mAb that binds PD-1 on activated immune cells and disrupts engagement of the receptor with its ligands PD-L1 (B7 H1/CD274) and PD-L2 (B7-DC/CD273), thereby abrogating inhibitory signals and augmenting the host antitumor response. In early clinical trials, nivolumab has demonstrated activity in several tumor types, including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Nivolumab is in clinical development for the treatment of patients with NSCLC, RCC, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and other tumors (eg, glioblastoma multiforme, mesothelioma, small cell lung cancer, gastric).

Nivolumab is approved in the United States (US), European Union, and other countries for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced NSCLC with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy, advanced RCC whose disease progressed on an antiangiogenic therapy, classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has relapsed or progressed after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and post-transplantation brentuximab vedotin treatment, and recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with disease progression on or after a platinum-based therapy.

The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative administration of Nivolumab or Nivolumab combined with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin in neoadjuvant setting and administration of Nivolumab in adjuvant setting in patients with high-risk resectable NSCLC, and will facilitate a comprehensive exploratory characterization of the tumor immune microenvironment and circulating immune cells in these patients. Data obtained in this study will provide valuable information for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies in NSCLC, both in the peri-operative and advanced disease setting. Ultimately, it is highly desirable to discover prospective biomarkers of response and toxicity to allow patients with NSCLC who are most likely to derive benefit to receive anti-PD-1 treatment, and conversely to minimize the risk of toxicity and ineffective treatment for patients who are unlikely to benefit.

MPR rate, MPR rate, defined as number participants with \<10% residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes, divided by the number of treated participants for each arm Viable tumors in situ carcinoma should not be included in MPR calculation., The patients considered to be technically resectable will undergo resection，an expected average of 13 weeks
