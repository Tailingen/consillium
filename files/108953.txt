Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Fluzoparib|DRUG: Enzalutamide OR abiraterone acetate With Prednisone Acetate Tablets|DRUG: Fluzoparib Combined With Apatinib
Comprehensive response rate, Comprehensive remission rate means the proportion of objective remission or PSA remission evaluated by the investigator based on the RECIST v1.1 standard and the PCWG3 standard, up to 2 years
Radiological progression-free survival (rPFS), The time from randomisation until the date of objective radiological disease progression (by RECIST 1.1 and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PGWG-3)) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from randomised therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression., up to 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is the percentage of patients with at least one visit response of Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR), in their soft tissue disease assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), in the absence of progression on bone scan assessed by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3))., At the time point of every 8 weeks，up to 2 years|PSA response rate, PSA response rate was Defined as the proportion of subjects whose serum PSA level decreased by ≥50% from baseline after treatment., At the time point of every 4 weeks，up to 2 years|Time to PSA progression (PSA-TTP), PSA-TTP was defined as the time from random (cohort 1 and 4) or first medication (cohort 2 and 3) to the first progression of PSA; PSA progression is determined according to the PCWG3 standard, and changes in PSA levels within the 12 weeks before treatment (that is, before C4D1) are not included in this Evaluation., At the time point of every 4 weeks，up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), Number of Participants with Overall Survival (OS), At the time point of every 2 months，up to 2 years
