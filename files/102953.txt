Abdominal Pain|Abdominal Cancer
PROCEDURE: TEA+DEX|PROCEDURE: TEA
Change in pain scores (dynamic VAS), dynamic visual analogue scale (0-10) 0=no pain 10=worst imaginable pain, at 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours post operative.
Change in post operative MAP, Mean arterial pressure, at 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours post operative.
The aim of modern anaesthetic practice is to insure the rapid recovery of patients with fewer complications and earlier hospital discharge.

Thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) has been established as a cornerstone in the perioperative care after thoracic and major abdominal surgery providing most effective analgesia. beyond its analgesic properties, TEA's effects on the postoperative neurohumoural stress response, cardiovascular Pathophysiology, and intestinal dysfunction have been in the focus of both clinical and experimental investigations for years.
