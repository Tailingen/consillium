Post Operative Adjuvant Therapy De-intensification Trial for Human Papillomavirus-related, p16+ Oropharynx Cancer
This clinical trial studies the intensity of adjuvant ("helper") therapy required in p16 positive oropharynx cancer patients, who have had all known disease removed surgically by a minimally invasive approach, and who have extracapsular spread in their lymph nodes. Patients can consent to participate in either the randomized (physician chooses radiotherapy arm or radiotherapy \& cisplatin arm) or non-randomized (patient chooses radiotherapy arm or radiotherapy \& cisplatin arm) pathways. After the surgery, receive either radiation alone, or radiation and weekly cis-platinum during therapy. Patients are then followed for cancer, functional and quality of life outcomes.
Oropharyngeal Neoplasms
RADIATION: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)|DRUG: Cisplatin
Number of Participants With Disease-free Survival (DFS), 1 year|Locoregional Control, Rate of patients with no recurrence at original oropharyngeal site or in the neck nodal basins., Up to 2 years
Rate of Distant Metastasis, Assessed by biopsy or imaging-detected recurrent disease at sites away from the original primary and cervical zone., Up to 2 years|Disease Specific Survival, 1 year|Number of Complications/Acute Toxicity by Organ Class, -Assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0., Approximately 18 weeks|Change in Quality of Life as Measured by the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory, * Each item is scored on a 5 point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, no opinion, agree, strongly agree). Strongly agree = 1, Disagree = 2, No opinion = 3, Agree = 4, and Strongly Agree = 5
* The lower the score the lower the quality of life, Baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months|Change in Cognitive Function as Measured by Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, * 25 questions to assess the frequency in which participants experience cognitive failures including forgetfulness, distractibility, and false triggering
* Answers range from 0 = never to 4 = very often
* The higher the score the worse the cognitive failures the participant has experienced, Baseline, 1 month, 12 months, and 24 months|Change in Quality of Life as Measured by Neck Dissection Impairment Index (NDII), -The NDII consists of 10 questions; each with a 5 level ordinally scaled response option ranging from "not at all" to "a lot". The response for each item is then scored from 1 to 5, with 5 denoting higher quality of life (Not at all) and 1 being the least (A lot)., Baseline, 12 months, and 24 months|Change in Quality of Life as Measured by University of Michigan Xerostomia Questionnaire, * It contains 8 questions regarding dryness either during feeding or in the unstimulated state. Participants rate each item from 0 to 10, where 10 indicates the maximum dryness or discomfort due to dryness.
* The higher the score the worse the participant's xerostomia, Baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months|Change in Hearing as Measured by Hearing Handicap Inventory - Adult, * 11 item questionnaire to identify issues with hearing
* Answers are yes = 4, sometimes = 2, and no = 0
* The higher the score the more issues the participant has with hearing, Baseline, 1 month, and 12 months|Change in Quality of Life as Measured by Scale of Subjective Total Taste Acuity, * 1 question that asks about taste acuity
* Answers are 0 = same taste acuity as before treatment; 1 = mild loss of taste acuity, but not inconvenient in daily life; moderate loss of taste acuity, and sometimes inconvenient in daily life; severe loss of taste acuity, and frequently inconvenient in daily life; and 4 = almost complete or complete loss of taste acuity
* The higher the score the worse the participant's taste acuity, Baseline, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months|Change in Quality of Life as Measured by Speech Handicap Index, * 31 questions regarding participant's speech and the effects of speech on his/her life
* The answers for the first 30 questions range from 0 = never to 4 = always and the answers for the 31st question ranges from 0 = excellent to bad = 4
* The higher the score the worse the participant's speech is affecting his/her life, Baseline and 12 months|Change in Quality of Life as Measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, * 30 questions designed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients
* The first 28 questions have answers that range from 1=not at all to 4 = very much. The higher score indicates a worse quality of life
* The last 2 questions have answers that range from 1 = very poor to 7 = excellent. The higher score indicates a better quality of life, Baseline, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months
