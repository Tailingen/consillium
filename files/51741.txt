Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Liver Cancer
RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have liver cancer.
Liver Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: AFP
Dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerable dose., 1 year
Generation of AFP specific immunity., 3 years|Progression-free survival., 3 years|clinical response in patients with measurable disease., 3 years
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of alpha-fetoprotein peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in HLA-A\*0201-positive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
* Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the immunological effects of this regimen in these patients.
* Determine the progression-free survival and clinical responses in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

Patients receive alpha-fetoprotein peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells intradermally on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a total of 3 doses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-12 patients receive escalating doses of vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 2 of 12 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

Patients are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 12 and then every 6 months thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
