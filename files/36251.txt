Sophrology Treatment for Patients With Glial Tumours Requiring Speech Therapy
Patients with brain tumours experience a loss of independence, which may occur suddenly or gradually. Communication with the patient may be rapidly impaired, due to impaired alertness, language and/or neurocognitive disorders.

In addition to these clinical symptoms, there is a high level of anxiety and depression in this population due to the severity of the diagnosis, with a major impact on the patients' quality of life. In this study, we are mainly interested in the proportion of this population with communication disorders where speech therapy is important In order to better take into account anxiety, which is often difficult to verbalise due to communication problems, sophrology can be proposed as an alternative to psychological support, which is often too complicated or inappropriate.

After having noted positive feedback from patients after joint speech therapy and sophrology treatment, we wish to evaluate the interest of coupling sophrology treatment for patients with glial tumours requiring speech therapy.

Our hypothesis is that this association would improve the level of anxiety, the quality of life and have a positive impact on the patient's speech therapy.
Glial Tumor
BEHAVIORAL: Sophrology|BEHAVIORAL: Speech therapy
The main objective is to compare the level of anxiety in the experimental arm with the control arm at 6 months., Anxiety levels will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 6 months in both treatment arms. The quality of life scale consists of 14 items scored from 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates that the patient has no anxiety disorder, a score of 21 indicates that the patient has a severe anxiety disorder., 6 months
The secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of the practice of sophrology on the patient's quality of life, Quality of life will be assessed by quality of life questionnaires at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatment. These are the QLQ-C30 v3 questionnaire and the brain-specific module EORTC-BN20 ;, 6 months
