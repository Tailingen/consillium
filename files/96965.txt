A Study of 2141-V11 in Combination With Standard Treatments in People With Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see whether combining 2141-V11 with various standard treatments is an effective treatment approach for prostate cancer. 2141-V11 works by activating the immune system to find and kill cancer cells. Researchers will look at whether this treatment approach is able to completely get rid of cancer in participants, and they will check for the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) in participants. MRD is a small number of cancer cells that can be detected in the body after treatment.
