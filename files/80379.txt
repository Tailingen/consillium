Soy Protein/Effexor Hormone Therapy for Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Soy protein/isoflavones and venlafaxine may help relieve hot flashes in patients receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer. It is not yet known whether soy protein/isoflavones are more effective than venlafaxine when given together or with a placebo in treating hot flashes.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying soy protein/isoflavones and venlafaxine to compare how well they work when given together or with a placebo in treating hot flashes in patients receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer.

Hot Flash Symptom Severity Score, The primary objective of this randomized trial is to assess the effect of soy and Venlafaxine on the hot flash symptom severity score in men undergoing hormonal manipulation for treatment of prostate cancer. Hot flash severity will be quantitated using the symptom diary (as the sum of the number of hot flashes (any number greater than or equal to 0) times their severity (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe)). The primary end point is the 12 week hot flash score relative to the baseline value (i.e., 100\*(12 week score)/baseline score). The range is 0 to infinity. Lower values represent a better outcome., 12 weeks
Quality of Life, Quality of life is quantified by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate questionnaire (FACT-P). The FACT-P consists of four general subscales (functional, emotional, social, and physical) consisting of a total of 27 questions as well as a Prostate specific subscale consisting of 12 questions. Each question is answered on a 0 to 4 scale. The FACT-P score ranges from 0 to 156; higher scores denote better quality of life., 12 weeks
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Assess the effect of soy protein/isoflavones and venlafaxine on the hot flash symptom severity score in patients undergoing hormonal manipulation for treatment of prostate cancer.

Secondary

* Assess the effect of soy protein/isoflavones and venlafaxine on quality of life of these patients.
* Monitor and assess the participant drop out rate.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to severity of disease (metastatic vs nonmetastatic) and baseline severity of hot flashes. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo pill and oral soy protein/isoflavones powder once daily.
* Arm II: Patients receive oral venlafaxine and oral placebo powder once daily.
* Arm III: Patients receive oral venlafaxine and oral soy protein/isoflavones powder once daily.
* Arm IV: Patients receive oral placebo pill and oral placebo powder once daily. Treatment in all arms continues for 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 12 weeks of treatment, patients in arms I and III receive a tapered dose of oral venlafaxine once daily for 1 week.

Patients complete a vasomotor symptom diary once daily beginning 7 days before the initiation of study treatment and continuing until the completion of study treatment. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at week 12.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 176 patients will be accrued for this study.
