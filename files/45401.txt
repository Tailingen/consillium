GliaSite 1-3 Mets Study
This study has been designed to compile information on the efficacy of the GliaSite RTS combined with radiosurgery in the treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic brain tumors.
Brain Metastases
DEVICE: GliaSite Radiation Therapy System
The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the 6 month and 1 year local control rate for 1-3 brain metastases treated with intracavitary radiation therapy., Data collected at the time of implant, within 72 hours of implant, pre-brachytherapy, brachytherapy, radiosurgery, 1 and 3 months post brachytherapy and every 3 months thereafter
Overall survival, distant brain recurrence, toxicity and quality of life., Survival
Data relevant to the evaluation the effectiveness of the GliaSite RTS for a resected dominant brain metastases will be collected. The GliaSite RTS is a radionuclide applicator and liquid radionuclide (Iotrex) designed to deliver intracavitary radiation therapy for resected brain tumors. In this case, it will irradiate the resected margins. Brain metastases not surgically removed will be then treated with radiosurgery
