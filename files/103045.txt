Evaluation of Thioldisulfide Balance in Cervical Preinvasive Lesions
The purpose of this study is to investigate Thiol-disulfide balance in patients with cervical preinvasive lesions
Oxidative Stress|Low Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion|High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Disulphide(μmol/L)|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Total Oxidant Capacity(μmolH2O2Equiv/L)
serum native thiol level, serum native thiol level in μmol/L, baseline (preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers)|serum disulphide level, serum disulphide level in μmol/L, baseline (preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers)|serum total thiol level, serum total thiol level in μmol/L, baseline (preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers)|the disulphide/native thiol ratio, the disulphide/native thiol ratio X (100 ), baseline (preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers)|disulphide/total thiol ratio, disulphide/total thiol ratio X (100 ), baseline (preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers)|native thiol/total thiol ratio, native thiol/total thiol ratio X (100 ), baseline (preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers)
total antioxidant capacity (TAC), TAC in mmol trolox equivalent/L, baseline (preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers)|total oxidant capacity (TOC), TOC in mmol H2O2 equivalent/L, baseline (preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers)|Oxidative stress index (OSI), OSI in mmol trolox/L., baseline (preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers)
To date various oxidative stress paramaters were studied in patients with cervical preinvasive lesions, however dynamic thiol disulfide hemostasis has not been previously investigated. The thiol-disulfide balance in the circulation will be measured by the automated system created by Erel \& Neselioglu(1).
