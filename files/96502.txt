Validity of Blood Pool SUV Ratio in Identification of Malignancy in Case of Diseased Liver
RADIATION: F18 FDG
-Validity of blood pool suv ratio in identification of malignancy in case of diseased liver., PET/CT is the functional imaging tool that can measure increased glucose metabolism in cancer tissues by using flourine 18 FDG which is FDA approved and used routinely in identification of malignant lesions , staging and restaging of many maligancy like lymphoma, breast cancer, lung cancer and cancer colon.

In clinical routine, SUV is often used to determine the glucose metabolism in tumours by 18F-FDG PET/CT. And can be further normalised to SUVs in reference regions resulting in a SUV ratio (SUV ratio).in routine work SUV of the lesion is normalised to SUV of the liver , but this not used if the liver is diseased like as liver cirrhosis or liver metastases , so SUV ratio of lesion to mediastinal blood pool and SUV ratio of the lesion to liver will be measured in correlation to pathology to assess validity of SUV of mediastinal blood pool., One year
