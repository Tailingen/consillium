Envafolimab Combined With Chemoradiotherapy and Recombinant Human Endostatin for LA-NPC.
This is a multicenter, prospective, single-arm, phase II clinical study, to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of envafolimab combined with chemoradiotherapy and recombinant human endostatin in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Envafolimab and recombinant human endostatin combined with chemoradiotherapy
Progress-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time interval from randomization to tumor progression or death due to any cause. The appearance of new lesions was used as a criterion for progression, and the landmark time point of progression was the date when measurable new lesions were first observed., 3 years
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is measured from randomization until death due to any cause or the latest known date alive., 3 years|Recurrence-free survival(RFS), Defined as the time from randomization to documented disease recurrence (distant metastasis or local disease recurrence) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., 3 years|Locoregional Relapse-Free Survival (LRFS), Defined as the time interval from randomization to the first occurrence of recurrence, or to the last follow-up time if there was no recurrence., 3 years|Distant metastases-Free survival (DMFS), Defined as the time interval from randomization to the occurrence of distant metastasis after treatment, or the time to the last follow-up or death due to other causes if there was no distant metastasis., 3 years|Incidence rate of adverse events (AEs), Analysis of adverse events (AEs) are based on treatment-related AEs (trAEs) and immune-related AEs (irAEs), and all-grade AEs and grade 3-4 AEs, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0., 3 years|Compliance, Refers to patients taking the drug according to the prescribed dose and course of treatment, as well as the degree of compliance with the study protocol during the implementation by the investigator., 3 years
This is a multicenter, prospective, single-arm phase II clinical study. Patients with high-risk locally advanced stage III-IVA (8th AJCC/UICC staging) primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma, i.e., T4N+ or N2-3, or pretreatment EBV-DNA â‰¥4000 copies/ml, or lymph node extra-envelope invasion grade 3 (invasion of muscle skin, etc.) are enrolled. After being screened to meet the enrolment criteria and signing the informed consent form, they will receive 3 cycles of induction therapy with envafolimab combined with recombinant human vascular endothelial inhibitor and gemcitabine and cisplatin, followed by cisplatin-concomitant radiotherapy, and 8 cycles of adjuvant therapy with envafolimab after radiotherapy.
