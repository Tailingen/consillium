Efficacy and Safety of a Triptorelin 6-month Formulation in Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer
Efficacy and safety of a triptorelin 6-month formulation in patients with advanced prostate cancer. It was assumed that during the study treatment \>90% of the patients would achieve and maintain castrate levels of serum testosterone.
Prostatic Neoplasm
DRUG: triptorelin embonate (INN)
Achievement of Castration and Maintenance of Castration, Percentage of patients achieving castrate testosterone levels (≤1.735 nmol/L) by Day 29 (28 days after study drug injection) and percentage of patients maintaining castrate testosterone levels from Month 2 to end of Month 12 (Week 48)., at Day 29
LH Increase, % of patients showing ≤1.0 IU/L increase in s-LH from 0 to 2 h after 1st \& 2nd injection.% changes in PSA throughout treatment.% of 60 pts with s-testosterone levels \>1.735 nmol/L after 2nd injection.Testosterone PD and triptorelin PK metrics in 15 pts, day 1 and day 169
Efficacy of triptorelin treatment on gonadotropin (LH) stimulation from hypophysis, as well as on the PSA (prostate specific antigen) levels and safety laboratory parameters. The triptorelin pharmacokinetics and testosterone pharmacodynamics were assessed in a subset of 15 patients.
