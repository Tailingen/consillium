Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) to Predict Peritoneal Chemotherapy
SPECT was performed in 51 patients after cytoreductive surgery in combination with intraperitoneal chemotherapy. The detected volume was compared to the number of subsequent sequential postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy courses that could be performed without further surgical intervention. SPECT data was found to predict feasibility of sequential postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
