Venetoclax Combining Chidamide and Azacitidine (VCA) in the Treatment of R/R AML
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Venetoclax Combining Chidamide and Azacitidine (VCA) in the Treatment of relapsed and/or refractory AML
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Relapsed Adult AML|Refractory Leukemia
DRUG: venetoclax combining chidamide and azacitidine (VCA)
Complete remission (CR) rate, CR was \<5% marrow blasts by morphology, 2 months
1 year leukemia free survival (LFS), Leukemia-free survival (LFS) is defined as survival without evidence of relapse from treatment initiation, 1 year from treatment initiation|1year overall survival (OS), Overall survival（OS）is defined as the time from treatment initiation to death from any cause., 1 year from treatment initiation|Adverse events, Adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with treatment, 2 months|objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as CR, CRi and PR. Partial remission (PR) is defined as a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5 to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate and the normalization of blood counts., 2 months
Patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML have inferior outcomes. The regimen of Venetoclax and Azacitidine has been widely used in the treatment of RR AML and has proved to achieve CR rate of 30% \~ 40%. However, the median duration of response (DOR) of this regimen is about one year. Chidamide is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and preclinical data showed adding low-dose Chidamide to venetoclax could significantly promoted apoptosis of leukemia cell lines. Meanwhile, the Venetoclax Combining Chidamide and Azacitidine (VCA) regimen was applied to 2 patients with refractory AML. This regimen was well tolerated and both patients achieved CR after one cycle. Thus, we register this clinical trial and evaluate the safety and efficacy of VCA regimen.
