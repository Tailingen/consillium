Improving Understanding of Brain Tumors Through Preservation of Biologically Active Brain Tissue
Recent experiments are giving researchers insight into the changes (mutations) that occur in an individual brain tumor cell compared to a normal cell. Currently, we do not have enough knowledge about how uniform these changes are throughout a single brain tumor and if different regions of a brain tumor have different groupings of changes. By obtaining multiple samples of the tumor from various regions during surgery, it will allow researchers to better understand these changes, with the hope that they will lead to new discoveries in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.
Glioblastoma
DEVICE: NICO Myriad and Tissue Preservation System (TPS)
Feasibility, as measured by percentage of the sample deemed viable by flow cytometry, Flow cytometry will be performed to quantify viable cells in a cell suspension. This will be reported as a percentage of live cells of the population, 1 year
Number of somatic mutations per region, Comparison of mutational burden in each tumor region, with the number of somatic mutations per region compared to one another, 1 year|Gene expression in tumor regions, Comparison of gene expression in each tumor region via RNA-seq, with the readout being heatmaps of gene expression and quantified via differential gene expression, 1 year|DNA methylation status in tumor regions, Comparison of DNA methylation status between tumor regions, with the readout being heatmaps and/or volcano plots of methylation differences to determine activated pathways of gene expression., 1 year
This is a single site, interventional cohort study to assess the feasibility of the NICO Myriad and Tissue Preservation System (TPS) to collect and preserve biologically active tissue in 5 prospectively-enrolled participants with Glioblastoma (GBM) undergoing surgical resection.

The primary objective of this study is to assess the viability of tumor tissue obtained by the NICO Myriad and Tissue Preservation System (TPS) via an automated, standardized methodology in participants undergoing surgery

The exploratory objective of this study is to assess the spatial genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity of GBM tumors in 3 locations via preoperative annotation and stereotactic guidance
