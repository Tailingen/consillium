Study of CHS-114 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human, dose-escalation and expansion study of CHS-114, a monoclonal antibody that targets CCR8, as a monotherapy in patients with solid tumors.

This is a Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human, dose-escalation and expansion study of CHS-114, a monoclonal antibody that targets CCR8, as a monotherapy in participants with advanced solid tumors, that will be conducted in 3 parts:

* Arm 1a: CHS-114 monotherapy dose-escalation portion of the study will enroll approximately 25 participants with advanced solid tumors.
* Arm 1b: CHS-114 monotherapy expansion cohort(s) will evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CHS-114 in indication specific cohort(s). Up to approximately 10 participants will be enrolled.
* Arm 2: CHS-114 + toripalimab combination dose-escalation portion of the study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CHS-114 in combination with toripalimab in indication specific cohort(s). Up to approximately 6-12 participants will be enrolled.
* Arm 3: CHS-114 + toripalimab combination dose-expansion portion of the study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CHS-114 in combination with toripalimab in indication specific cohort(s). Up to approximately 40 participants will be randomized to two dosing arms.
