CD19/CD22 Bispecific CAR-T Cell Therapy for Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Lymphoma or Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD19 has been shown to be effective in heavily-pretreated B-cell ALL or NHL, but relapses post-CAR-T are common, and CD19 antigen loss is one of the reasons. Thus, we supposed that CD19/CD22 bispecific CAR-T cell therapy would be more effective and less relapses would occur in B-ALL or NHL. In this prospective phase 2 clinical trial, we aim to explore the efficacy and safety of CD19/CD22 bispecific CAR-T cell therapy in relapsed/refractory B-ALL or Large B cell lymphoma.
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|B-cell Lymphoma|Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: CD19/CD22-bispecific CAR-T cells
Best ORR, Overall response rate means sum of complete response rate and partial response rate, From the day of CAR-T cells infusion to 3 months post-CAR-T cells infusion
Best CR rate, CR was defined as complete remission evaluated using PET-CT scan or BM test, From the day of CAR-T cells infusion to 3 months post-CAR-T cells infusion|Progression free survival (PFS), PFS was defined from the date of CAR-T infusion to the date fo confirmed disease progression or death of any reason, From the day of CAR-T cells infusion to 12 months post-CAR-T cells infusion|overall survival (OS), OS was defined from the date of CAR-T infusion to the date fo death, From the day of CAR-T cells infusion to 12 months post-CAR-T cells infusion
