Primary Cytoreductive Surgery With or Without Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC)
stage III epithelial ovarian cancer randomizing between primary cytoreductive surgery with or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: cisplatin

recurrence-free survival, 1 year after last patient last visit|adverse events, toxicity of extra treatment compared standaard treatment, 30 days after end of treatment|cost evaluation, cost evaluation based measured by quality adjusted life year, 1 year after lplv
The objective of this study is to prove that treatment with primary cytoreductive surgery in combination with HIPEC (treatment arm) improves outcome compared to primary cytoreductive surgery without HIPEC (standard arm) with acceptable morbidity, in patients with FIGO stage III epithelial ovarian cancer who are eligible for primary cytoreductive surgery with no residual disease, or residual disease up to 2.5 mm.
