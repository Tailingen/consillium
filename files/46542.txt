Phase II Study of Atezolizumab and Tiragolumab With ctDNA for HPV-positive SCC
A single-arm, phase II study for patients with detectable HPV CtDNA at 12 weeks or longer after completion of definitive therapy for non-metastatic, HPV+ squamous cell carcinoma.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Talazoparib
Safety and Adverse Events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective:

To estimate the 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) for patients treated with atezolizumab plus tiragolumab for detectable HPV ctDNA following definitive therapy for HPV+ squamous cell carcinoma.

Secondary Objectives:

To describe local recurrence at 1 year for patients treated with atezolizumab plus tiragolumab for detectable HPV ctDNA after following definitive therapy for HPV+ squamous cell carcinoma.

To describe rate of distant metastatic disease occurrence for patients treated with atezolizumab plus tiragolumab for detectable HPV ctDNA after following definitive therapy for HPV+ squamous cell carcinoma.

To estimate 1-year overall survival for patients treated with atezolizumab plus tiragolumab for detectable HPV ctDNA after following definitve therapy for HPV+ squamous cell carcinoma.

To summarize safety and toxicity (CTCAE v5) for patients treated with atezolizumab plus tiragolumab for detectable HPV ctDNA ater following definitve therapy for HPV+ squamous cell carcinoma.

To determine HPV ctDNA clearance rates for patients treated with atezolizumab plus tiragolumab for detectable HPV ctDNA after following definitive therapy for HPV+ squamous cell carcinoma.
