Assessing 11C-Choline (11C-CH) PET to Distinguish True Tumor Progression From Pseudoprogression in High-grade Gliomas
This is a pilot study. The purpose of this study is to test if an imaging tracer, not approved by the FDA, called 11C-Choline (11C-CH) is useful for evaluating your type of cancer. This tracer is used to perform PET scans. The researchers want to see if the 11C-CH PET scan, using the study tracer 11C-CH, can improve upon the usual scans at diagnosing or monitoring your type of cancer.

In patients with high-grade gliomas, changes on standard MRI of the brain may reflect true tumor growth or inflammatory changes in response to treatment, called pseudo-progression. It is important to distinguish true tumor growth from inflammation since inflammation indicates the tumor is responding to treatment. With standard MRI, it is difficult to determine if changes following treatment are due to tumor growth or inflammation early on. Researchers hope to learn if the investigational tracer, 11C-CH, will be able to distinguish true tumor growth from inflammation more accurately than standard MRI or 18F-FDG PET scans.
Brain Cancer
DEVICE: PET scan|RADIATION: C-Choline
SUV Measures, from 11C-CH PET with evolving changes on brain MRI in high-grade glioma after radiotherapy. In a small subgroup of patients required surgery, tissue will be analyzed for histopathologic correlate. The data gathered will not be considered definitive, but rather will be used to as preliminary data in support of a larger, definitive study., 1 year
