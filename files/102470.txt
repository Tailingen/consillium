The Predictive Value of Coexisting TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Fusion and PTEN Deletion in Prostate Cancer Patients with Biochemical Failure Status Post Salvage or Radical Radiation Therapy
The objective of the study is to evaluate the predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and PTEN in patients with high risk prostate cancer treated with first line LHRH agonist after biochemical failure.
Prostate Cancer
Number of patients with biochemical failure showing coexistence of PTEN and TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion., Biopsy samples of patients treated for high risk prostate cancer with radical radiation and hormonal therapy (LHRH) who have either clinical progression or 3-year hormonal refractory free survival will be tested to evaluate the predictive value of the coexistence of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and the PTEN deletion. The results between the two groups will be compared to see if either DNA changes are an indicator of LHRH refractoriness, recruitment over 4 years
The objective of the study is to evaluate the predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and PTEN in patients with high risk prostate cancer treated with first line LHRH agonist after biochemical failure.

Patients in this study will be treated with standard hormonal treatment. Patients will remain on treatment regardless of rising PSA. PSA, other systemic therapy maybe added and the patients with oligometastasis could be treated with radiation therapy; this would be at the discretion of the treating oncologist.

The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and PTEN in hormonal refractory free survival and clinical progression rate in three years. The secondary endpoints are to evaluate the relation between Gleason score and TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and PTEN independently and together, the relation between T stage and TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and PTEN independently and together, and to determine the association of these markers with overall survival.
