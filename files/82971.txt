Immunotherapy With CD19 CAR T-cells for B-Cell Leukemia
This study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) redirected autologous T-cells in patients with high risk, relapsed CD19+ haematological malignancies.
Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Anti-CD19-CAR
Adverse events of each patient, Determine the toxicity profile of the CD19 targeted CAR T cells with Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) version 4.0., 3 years|Survival time of Anti-CD19 CAR T cells in vivo, To evaluate the presence of circulating CAR T cells with flow cytometry and real time PCR in patient blood., 3 years|Antitumor Effects, Tumor load will be quantified with radiology, bone marrow and/or blood samples dependent on diagnosis., Every 3 months post treatment up to 24 months|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CD19 targeted CAR T cells., Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CD19 targeted CAR T cells., 4 weeks
This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells (CD19 CAR T-cells) in patients with high risk, relapsed CD19+ Leukemia. Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the CD19 CAR Tcells.

Patients will receive the CD19CAR T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD19 CAR T-cells in patients with high risk relapsed CD19+ Leukemia
