Phase I Trial to Determine the Dose and Evaluate the PK of Lutetium Lu 177 Edotreotide Therapy in Pediatric Participants With SSTR-positive Tumors
The purpose of the study is to determine the appropriate pediatric dosage and evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of Lutetium Lu 177 Edotreotide Targeted Radiopharmaceutical Therapy (RPT) as a monotherapy or following standard of care (SoC) in participants ≥2 to \<18 years of age with somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positive tumors.
NET|Lymphoma|Solid Tumor, Childhood|Somatostatin Receptor Positive|CNS Tumor
DRUG: Lutetium Lu 177-Edotreotide|OTHER: Amino Acid Solution
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-Free Survival is monitored by anatomical/functional imaging., Morphological/functional imaging (9 ± 3 weeks of 1st RPT,repeated 9 ± 3 weeks up to 2 years after End of Last Treatment Visit, or disease progression. Progression-Free Survival Follow Up is discontinued, then simple Follow-up for five years.
Objective Response Rate, Assess preliminary anti-tumor activity by tumor type, At the end of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days)
Rate of adverse events, Safety evaluation of Lutetium Lu 177 edotreotide targeted RPT as monotherapy or following standard of care, From treatment start until 4 weeks after End of Last Treatment.|Overall Survival, Progression-Free Survival and Duration of Response, Additional preliminary efficacy evaluation of lutetium Lu 177 Edotreotide targeted RPT as monotherapy or following SoC, Every 9 ± 3 weeks from enrollment until disease progression or for up to two years, whichever came first.
Determine the dose, pharmacokinetics and safety of Lutetium Lu 177 Edotreotide as monotherapy or following sequential standard of care in pediatric participants with recurrent, progressive or refractory NET, CNS, lymphoma and other solid tumors that express SSTRs by immunohistochemistry and demonstrate uptake by somatostatin receptor imaging. Lutetium Lu 177 Edotreotide will be given intravenously once every 8 weeks for a total of up to 6 doses over an average of 48 weeks in participants aged 2-18 years.
