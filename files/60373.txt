A Study of R1507 in Participants With Recurrent or Refractory Sarcoma
The study was primarily designed to determine objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and the safety and tolerability of R1507 in participants with recurrent or refractory Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and other sarcomas including alveolar soft part sarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, and myxoid liposarcoma.
Sarcoma
DRUG: RG1507
Percentage of Participants With Complete or Partial Response, According to World Health Organization (WHO) Criteria in Cohorts 2 to 8, Complete response is the disappearance of all known disease, determined by two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart. Partial response is \>=50% decrease in the total tumor load of the lesions that have been measured to determine the effect of therapy not less than four weeks apart. The observations must be consecutive., Baseline up to 6 years (assessed at baseline, every 6 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks until disease progression)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate According to WHO Response Criteria at 18 Weeks From Start of R2607 Treatment in Cohort 1, The PFS survival rate is a landmark analysis of progression-free survival at 18 weeks from start of treatment. Progression-free survival rate at 18 weeks is a dichotomous endpoint, with a patient categorized as alive (with either stable disease or objective response) at 18 weeks from start of treatment., Baseline up to 18 weeks (assessed at baseline, every 6 weeks until disease progression)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) in Cohort 1 and 2, Baseline up to 6 years

Progression-free survival rate at 18 weeks is a dichotomous endpoint, with a patient categorized as alive (with either stable disease or objective response at 18 weeks) from start of treatment., Baseline, every 6 weeks until disease progression (up to 18 weeks)|Percentage of Participants With AEs in Cohorts 3-8, Baseline up to 6 years|Duration of Response (DOR) According to WHO Response Criteria in Cohorts 1 to 8, The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. Complete response is the disappearance of all known disease, determined by two consecutive observations not less than 4 weeks apart. Partial response is \>=50% decrease in the total tumor load of the lesions that have been measured to determine the effect of therapy not less than four weeks apart. The observations must be consecutive., Baseline, every 6 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks until disease progression (up to 6 years)|Time to Progression (TTP) According to WHO Response Criteria in Cohorts 1 to 8, TTP is defined as the time from date of randomization until objective tumor progression. According to the WHO Response Criteria, objective tumor progression is \> 25% increase in the area of one or more measurable lesions or the appearance of new lesions., Baseline, every 6 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks until disease progression (up to 6 years)|Failure-Free Survival (FFS) According to WHO Response Criteria in Cohorts 1 to 8, FFS was measured from the date of treatment start to the date of documented disease progression, relapse, or death from any cause., Baseline, every 6 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks until disease progression (up to 6 years)|Overall Survival (OS) in Cohorts 1 to 8, OS was measured from the time of study registration to the date of death or was censored at the date of last contact., Baseline until death (up to 6 years)|PFS According to WHO Response Criteria in Cohorts 1 to 8, PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of objective progression or death., Baseline, every 6 weeks for 24 weeks, then every 12 weeks until disease progression (up to 6 years)|Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) of R1507, Predose (0 hours [h]), end of 60-90 minutes infusion (EOI), postdose (2, 24, 72-96 h) in Week 1; predose (0 h) and EOI in Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9; predose (0 h), EOI, postdose (48 h) in Week 12; predose (0 h) in Week 13, at final visit (up to 6 years)|Pharmacokinetics: Clearance (CL) of R1507, Predose (0 h), EOI (infusion over 60-90 minutes), postdose (2, 24, 72-96 h) in Week 1; predose (0 h) and EOI in Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9; predose (0 h), EOI, postdose (48 h) in Week 12; predose (0 h) in Week 13, at final visit (up to 6 years)
