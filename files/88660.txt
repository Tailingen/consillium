Study of Cabozantinib and Nivolumab in Refractory Metastatic Microsatellite Stable (MSS) Colorectal Cancer
Data from a prior phase II study of single agent cabozantinib in metastatic, refractory colorectal cancer (NCT03542877) combined with the compelling preclinical data in colorectal mouse models utilizing cabozantinib combined with nivolumab have led to this concept for a clinical trial to combine cabozantinib and nivolumab in patients with metastatic MSS CRC in the third line setting and beyond.

Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined using the RECIST 1.1 criteria as the proportion of subjects who have achieved confirmed complete response (CR), confirmed partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at 16-weeks., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined using the RECIST 1.1 criteria as the proportion of subjects with a confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR)., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS will be defined as the time from administration of the initial dose of study treatment to evidence of radiographic progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria or death from any cause without evidence of disease progression, whichever occurs first., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be defined as the time from administration of the initial dose of study treatment until death from any cause., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Safety and Tolerability, Safety and tolerability analysis of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab summarized by dose and severity as assessed by the CTCAE version 5.0 and relationship to study drugs., Study start date to study end date, or death, whichever comes first, up to 24 months|Exploratory Biomarker analysis - Whole Blood, Exploratory analysis of predictive and pharmacodynamic markers by obtaining pre- and on-treatment whole blood samples pretreatment and +/- 5 days of Cycle 2 Day 1 of treatment for each patient and archived for future studies and analysis., Study start date to study end date, up to 24 months|Exploratory Biomarker analysis - Tumor tissue, Exploratory analysis of predictive and pharmacodynamic markers by obtaining pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies pre-treatment and +/- 5 days of Cycle 2 day 1 of treatment for a cohort of 20 patients for VECTRA analysis to evaluate for immune cell infiltration. Tissue will be archived for future studies., Study start date to study end date, up to 24 months
This is an open-label, single-arm, 2-stage, phase II study of cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with refractory metastatic CRC. Up to 46 evaluable patients will be treated with cabozantinib 40 mg orally daily in combination with nivolumab 480 mg IV every 28 days. One cycle is defined as 28 days.
