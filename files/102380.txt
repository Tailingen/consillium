Pembrolizumab Plus CA-4948 for the Treatment of Patients With Progressive Metastatic Urothelial Cancer Despite Prior Immunotherapy
This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, best dose, and effectiveness of emavusertib (CA-4948) in combination with pembrolizumab in treating patients with urothelial cancer that has spread from where it first started to other places in the body (metastatic) and that has a resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. CA-4948, a kinase inhibitor, may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving CA-4948 in combination with pembrolizumab may be safe, tolerable and/or effective in treating patients with metastatic urothelial cancer that is resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors.

OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CA-4948 in combination with pembrolizumab followed by a dose-expansion study.

Patients receive CA-4948 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo blood sample collection, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET) throughout the study. Additionally, patients may undergo a tumor biopsy on study.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
