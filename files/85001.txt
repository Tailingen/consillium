Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Advanced Ovarian Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients with recurrent or progressive advanced epithelial ovarian cancer following previous paclitaxel.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: paclitaxel
OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the activity of paclitaxel when administered on a weekly schedule to patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have failed paclitaxel on a 3 or 24 hour infusion schedule. II. Evaluate the toxic effects of paclitaxel when administered on a weekly schedule in this patient population. III. Correlate response with quality of life outcomes, including symptom distress, performance status, and global quality of life.

OUTLINE: This is a single center, open label study. Paclitaxel is administered intravenously every week as a 1 hour infusion. Patients receive prophylactic anti-allergy premedication prior to paclitaxel.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 25-30 patients accrued per year.
