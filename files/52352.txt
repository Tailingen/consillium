Long-term Safety Study of Arsenic Trioxide in Newly Diagnosed, Low-to-intermediate Risk Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
The therapeutic advantage of the association of ATRA + Arsenic Trioxide is more favorable and manageable as compared to ATRA + chemotherapy. Nevertheless, at present, there is not enough information on the incidence of long-term side effects.

This study, as well as other similar studies conducted around Europe, will focus on following patients treated with this therapy on a long-term basis.

Once all studies in Europe will be concluded, all data will be analyzed together.
Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Arsenic Trioxide
Number of grade III/IV (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03) adverse events of special interest (AESI)., AESI are, among others: differentiation syndrome, creatinine, bilirubin, neurotoxicity, aspartate amino transferase/alanine amino transferase (ASAT/ALAT) ratio, haemorrhage, sepsis, QTc prolongation, cardiac events including congestive heart failure (CHF)., At a maximum of 5 years from study entry
Number of unexpected serious adverse events (SAEs)., Including grading and relationship as documented in the study., At a maximum of 5 years from study entry|Number of patients developing secondary malignancies., At a maximum of 5 years from study entry|Number of patients developing therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (tMDS)., At a maximum of 5 years from study entry|Number of patients developing acute myeloid leukemia (tAML)., At a maximum of 5 years from study entry|Number of patients who die., At a maximum of 5 years from study entry
Considering the clear therapeutic advantage associated with ATRA+ATO combination therapy and the more favorable and overall manageable safety profile compared to ATRA+chemotherapy, the benefits of the combination in the first-line indication do appear to overweigh the risks.

However, no information regarding the actual adverse event (AE) incidence and the long-term toxicity of ATRA+ATO is available at present and therefore, as a postmarketing commitment, TEVA (the Company holding the Marketing Authorisation of TrisenoxÂ® (Arsenic trioxide)) is setting up a long-term safety cohort study of Trisenox in newly diagnosed low- to intermediate-risk APL patients retrospectively analyzing data from APL disease registries all around Europe.

As a result, this observational study is part of the retrospective PASS Study (A Post-Authorisation Long-Term Retrospective Safety Cohort Study of Arsenic Trioxide in First Line Low-to Intermediate-Risk Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia Patients) that will use data from multinational APL disease registries in Europe. The present study will focus on Italian patients.
