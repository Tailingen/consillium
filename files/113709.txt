DS-3201b for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) or Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)
This research study tests an investigational drug called DS-3201b. An investigational drug is a medication that is still being studied and has not yet been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA allows DS-3201b to be used only in research. It is not known if DS-3201b will work or not.

This study consists of two parts. The first part (Part 1) is a dose escalation that will enroll subjects with AML or ALL that did not respond or no longer respond to previous standard therapy. The purpose of Part 1 of this research study is to determine the highest dose a patient can tolerate or recommended dose of DS-3201b that can be given to subjects with AML or ALL. Once the highest tolerable dose is determined, additional subjects will be enrolled at that dose into Part 2 of the study.

DRUG: DS-3201b
Number of Participants With Any Grade Treatment-emergent Adverse Event Classified as Dose-limiting Toxicities (Dose Escalation), Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as a clinically significant non-hematologic treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or abnormal clinical laboratory value that is clearly not related to disease progression, intercurrent illness, and occurring during the first cycle (28 days) on study that meets any of the following criteria: National Cancer Institute (NCI) - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4 Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT), or bilirubin for â‰¥7 days; NCI-CTCAE Grade 4 AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) of any duration; All Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicities of any duration; Any Grade 5 toxicity, unless proven to be clearly and incontrovertibly related to disease progression or intercurrent illness will constitute a DLT; All other clinically significant, non-hematological NCI-CTCAE Grade 3/4 AEs. AEs were coded using the MedDRA dictionary, Version 23.0., Baseline up to Day 28|Number of Participants Who Experienced Any Grade Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (Dose Escalation), A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event (AE) that occurs, having been absent before the first dose of study drug or has worsened after initiating the study drug until 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. AEs were coded using the MedDRA dictionary, Version 23.0., Baseline up to 30 days after last study dose, up to approximately 4 years
Pharmacokinetic Parameter Maximum (Peak) Observed Concentration (Cmax) of DS-3201b, Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed using noncompartmental methods., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8 predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours and Cycle 1 Day 15 postdose (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Time to Maximum Observed Concentration (Tmax) of DS-3201b, Blood samples were collected for PK analysis. PK parameters were assessed using noncompartmental methods., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8 predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours and Cycle 1 Day 15 postdose (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Area Under Plasma Concentration-Time Curve of DS-3201b, Blood samples were collected for PK analysis. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve up to 24 hours (AUC24h) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve up to the last measurable concentration (AUClast) were assessed using noncompartmental methods., Cycle 1 Days 1 and 8 predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours and Cycle 1 Day 15 postdose (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetic Parameter Trough Plasma Concentration (Ctrough) of DS-3201b, Blood samples were collected for PK analysis. PK parameters were assessed using noncompartmental methods., Cycle 1 Day 2 postdose (each cycle is 28 days)
