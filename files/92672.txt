POEM STUDY: A Phase IIa Trial in Endometrial Carcinoma With Temsirolimus
Type of Application: Clinical trial of new indication.

Experimental drug: The study dose of temsirolimus will be 25 mg administered intravenously, infused over a 30- to 60-minute period once weekly for 28 days (Total doses: 4 doses). Temsirolimus is a selective inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Pharmacotherapeutic group: Protein Kinase Inhibitors; ATC code: L01X E09.

Primary Objective:

* To identify in tumor samples future biomarkers associated with a short term exposure to temsirolimus.
* This is an exploratory clinical study. No efficacy objectives are included in this clinical trial.

Secondary Objectives:

* To estimate the tolerability for all temsirolimus-treated patients throughout the study and up to 28 days after the last dose of temsirolimus.
* To correlate observed changes with the different type of endometrial carcinoma (type I and type II), with regard to proteins related to mTOR (p4EBP1, pS6K1, c-MYC, cyclin D, p27, BAD, p53, Bcl-2 PTEN, pAKT, mTOR),
* To estimate the potential predictive value of some biomarkers (immunostaining for PTEN, pAKT, mTOR), relevant mutations in PTEN, PI3KCA, k-RAS, CTNNB1, and microsatellite instability status.
* To estimate the prognostic value of Ki67 expression after short-term presurgical therapy exposure
* To collect data about the differences in expression profile, assessed by RNA microarrays
Carcinoma, Endometrioid|mTOR Protein
DRUG: Temsirolimus
To evaluate the mTOR inhibitor effects of temsirolimus directly on endometrial tumor tissue after four weeks of therapy., To evaluate the mTOR inhibitor effects, assessed by level 4EBP1 and S6K1, of temsirolimus directly on endometrial tumor tissue after four weeks of therapy., 1 month after last dose of the last patient
To evaluate if mTOR inhibition is associated with changes in tumor-tissue, To evaluate if mTOR inhibition is associated with changes in tumor-tissue:

* Signal transduction: AKT and PTEN
* c-MYC, cyclin D activity
* Proliferation index analysis: p53, p27, BAD, Bcl-2 and ki-67, 1 month after the surgery of the last patient
