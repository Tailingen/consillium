Trial of Robotic Versus Laparoscopic-assisted Radical Resection for Rectal Cancer
This study compared robot-assisted total mesorectal excision (RTME) and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) with regard to urinary function, sexual function and sphincter- preservation outcomes for low rectal cancer.
Rectal Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: robot-assisted total mesorectal excision|PROCEDURE: laparoscopic total mesorectal excision
Incidence of sexual and urinary dysfunction, One years after surgery
disease-free survival(DFS ), DFS was defined as from the date of randomization to the date of tumor recurrence or death from any cause, 3 years disease-free survival|Anus preservation rate, One years after surgery
Urinary and sexual dysfunction are recognized complications of rectal cancer surgery in men. This study compared robot-assisted total mesorectal excision (RTME) and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision(LTME) with regard to these functional outcomes.Sphincter- preservation outcomes for low rectal cancer was observed as well.
