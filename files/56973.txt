A Single-arm Safety Study of Transplantation Using Umbilical Cord Blood and Human Placental-derived Stem Cells From Partially Matched Related Donors in Persons With Certain Malignant Blood Diseases and Non-malignant Disorders
To investigate the safety of partially matched related human placental-derived stem cells (HPDSC) administered in conjunction with umbilical cord blood (UCB) stem cells from the same donor in subjects with various malignant or nonmalignant disorders potentially curable with stem cell transplantation and to assess potential restoration of normal hematopoiesis and immune function in subjects with these disorders
Hematologic Malignancies
PROCEDURE: UCB and HPDSC
Incidence of GVHD, time to engraftment and survival, 2 years
