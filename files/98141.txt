Improving Colon Cancer Screening for Diverse Populations
This study is a multi-site randomized, controlled trial testing the effect of a combined intervention that includes a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decision aid plus patient navigation in a diverse, primary care patient population in clinical sites in North Carolina and New Mexico.

Our primary aim is to determine the effect of the intervention on CRC screening completion six months after the index visit among all enrolled participants and among Latinos. Secondarily, we will determine how this intervention affects screening-related knowledge, self-efficacy, intent, and clinical communication, and examine whether these factors mediate the effect of the intervention on screening test completion. Lastly, we will explore whether insurance status, ethnicity, and patient language preference moderate the effect of the intervention on screening.
Colorectal Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Decision aid and navigation
Colorectal cancer screening completion, A blinded medical record review will be used to determine the primary outcome of 6 month Colorectal cancer screening status. To ensure optimal capturing of screening test completion, we will ask participants whose medical record does not contain evidence of screening to verify non-completion during the 6 month phone survey., 6 months
Colorectal cancer screening knowledge, Following the provider encounter, we will administer the post-encounter survey to measure intermediate screening related knowledge., Post-encounter measure|Colorectal cancer screening related self-efficacy, The Colorectal cancer screening self-efficacy will be measured by the post-encounter survey., 6 months|Colorectal cancer screening related intent, The post-encounter survey will be used to measure the Colorectal cancer screening related intent., 6 months
