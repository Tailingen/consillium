ML Decision Model for G-NEC Adjuvant Therapy
Gastric neuroendocrine carcinoma (G-NEC) is a rare and aggressive tumor originating from neuroendocrine cells in the stomach lining. It is characterized by a high propensity for recurrence and a generally poor prognosis. Due to its rarity, there is limited data and no established consensus on the optimal postoperative adjuvant therapy, making treatment decisions challenging for healthcare providers.

This study is a retrospective analysis focusing on evaluating survival rates, identifying prognostic factors, and formulating treatment recommendations for patients with G-NEC. By analyzing real-world clinical data, we aim to better understand the factors that influence patient outcomes and to develop evidence-based strategies for improving survival. Our goal is to provide clinicians with valuable insights and tools to make more informed treatment decisions, ultimately enhancing the quality of care and outcomes for patients with this challenging disease.

Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Disease-free survival is defined as the time from the date of surgery to disease recurrence, death from any cause, or last follow-up, whichever occurs first. The machine learning model's performance in predicting DFS and recommending optimal adjuvant therapy will be evaluated., From date of surgery up to 5 years
