Controlled Study of Rigosertib Versus Physician's Choice of Treatment in MDS Patients After Failure of an HMA
The study's primary objective \[in a population of patients with MDS after failure of treatment with azacitidine (AZA) or decitabine (DAC)\], is to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients in the rigosertib group vs the Physician's Choice group, in all patients and in a subgroup of patients with IPSS-R very high risk.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome|MDS|Refractory Anemia With Excess Blasts|RAEB
DRUG: rigosertib|DRUG: Any approved or standard-of-care therapy|DRUG: best supportive care (BSC)|DRUG: best supportive care (BSC)
Overall survival of all randomized patients and overall survival of patients scored as IPSS-R very high risk., The overall survival (OS) of all randomized patients (ITT population), and the overall survival of patients scored as IPSS-R very high risk., Up to 30 Months
Overall survival of patients with monosomy 7 chromosomal aberrations., Evaluate OS of patients with monosomy 7 chromosomal aberrations in the rigosertib vs PC group. Overall survival is the time (months) from date of randomization to date of death or date last known to be alive at the time of date cut-off., Up to 30 Months|Overall survival of patients with trisomy 8 chromosomal aberrations., Evaluate OS of patients with trisomy 8 chromosomal aberrations in the rigosertib vs PC group. Overall survival is the time (months) from date of randomization to date of death or date last known to be alive at the time of date cut-off., Up to 30 Months|Percent of patients with response according to 2006 IWG criteria., Responses of complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), mCR, SD, failure, and PD will be determined by 2006 IWG criteria. The number and percent of patients with CR, PR, mCR, SD, Failure, or PD will be summarized by treatment group., Up to 30 Months|Scores of Quality of Life Questionnaire., Compare rigosertib vs PC in regard to the the scores of the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire. The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L Questionnaire includes five levels of severity in each of the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and a visual analogue scale., At Baseline, at Week 4, Every 4 Weeks thereafter, and at the End-of-treatment.|Percent of patients with bone marrow blast response rate according to 2006 IWG criteria., Compare rigosertib vs PC in regard to the bone marrow blast responses of marrow complete response (mCR ≥ 50% decrease of BMBL vs pretreatment values to a value ≤ 5%), marrow partial response (mPR, ≥ 50% decrease of BMBL vs pretreatment values to a value \> 5%), stable disease (SD, no mCR or mPR, but no progressive disease (PD), and PD (≥ 50% BMBL increase relative to baseline or nadir) will be assessed. The number and percent of patients with mCR, mPR, SD, or PD will be summarized by treatment group. Responses of complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), mCR, SD, failure, and PD will be determined by 2006 International Working Group (IWG) criteria., Up to 30 Months|Percent of patients with hematologic improvement (HI) (erythroid, platelet and neutrophil responses) according to 2006 IWG criteria., Compare rigosertib vs PC in regard to the number and percent of patients who meet the 2006 IWG criteria., Up to 30 Months
Exploratory Objective: Bone Marrow Genomic Mutational Status, Bone marrow genomic mutational status., At screening, every 8 week during study treatment, and at the end of study treatment|Exploratory Objective: Transition to Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), Transformation time to AML (defined as a bone marrow or peripheral blood blast percentage \>30%)., Through study completion, an average of 8 months|Safety Objective: Number of Patients with AEs., Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4, grouped by MedDRA preferred term, and summarized by worst grade of severity per patient by treatment group., Monthly, through study completion|Safety Objective: Rigosertib population pharmacokinetics (PK)., Blood samples for population PK analysis will be taken in rigosertib patients, At Cycle 1 (Week 1) and Cycle 2 (Week 3), on Day 1 of the infusion, 1 hr after its start and on Day 2 of the infusion, 6 hr after its start
This is a Phase III, open-label, randomized, controlled, international study. Approximately 360 patients \< 82 years of age with MDS classified as RAEB-1, RAEB-2, or RAEB-t who received AZA or DAC for ≤ 9 months and/or ≤ 9 cycles over 12 months and had their last dose of AZA or DAC within 6 months prior to screening will be stratified by:

* Very high risk (VHR) vs non-VHR per IPSS-R, and
* Geographic region (North America vs Europe vs Asia; because approved products and standard of care may vary by region), and randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following 2 treatment groups:
* Rigosertib 1800 mg/24 hr administered as a 72 hr CIV infusion on Days 1, 2, and 3 of a 2 week cycle for the first 8 cycles, and on Days 1, 2, and 3 of a 4-week cycle thereafter (N = approximately 240 patients);
* Physician's Choice of alternative treatment, which may include any approved or standard-of-care therapy that the patient has not shown to be hypersensitive to, based on frequently used treatment for MDS, as per institutional guidelines, after receipt of HMAs (N = approximately 120 patients). The drugs used in the Physician's Choice arm should be used according to the recommendations, if clinically appropriate, provided in the corresponding Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Prescribing Information of these drugs. Experimental therapies are not allowed on the PC arm.

Patients will be treated until 2006 IWG progression criteria are met (ie, 50% increase of BM blasts or worsening of cytopenias) or until an unacceptable toxicity or intolerance.

For all randomized patients who discontinue study treatment, subsequent therapies with their start and end dates, as well as survival time after treatment discontinuation, will be documented at least monthly until death.

Patients in the PC group who progress will not be allowed to cross over to rigosertib.

All patients in both treatment groups will be allowed, as medically justified, access to RBC and platelet transfusions and to growth factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin).
