Myeloproliferative Disorders
Event free survival, 3 years
Patients with a diagnosis of MPN and a mutation of IDH1/2, SRSF2 or SF3B1 will be included. Clinical and biological characterisation at diagnosis, as well as evlution will be recorded. Event free survival will be assessed in each group (event = thrombosis, transformation to mylofibrosis/acute leukemia, death).
