STARLITE for Unresectable High-Grade Gliomas
The purpose of this study is to determine whether newly diagnosed high-grade glioma(s) that cannot be removed surgically change as a result of the study treatment; and to identify and evaluate the potential side effects (good and bad) of the study treatment in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma(s) that cannot be removed surgically.
High Grade Glioma
PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance (MR)-guided Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT)|DRUG: Abacavir|DRUG: Lamivudine|DRUG: Ritonavir|DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Focal Radiotherapy
Number of Participants Experiencing Dose-Limiting Toxicity, The number of participants experiencing dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 28 days of antiretroviral therapy (ART) will be reported. Toxicity will be assessed by the treating physician and assigned severity and attribution using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 6.0 (NCI CTCAE v6.0)., Up to 28 days|Number of Participants Experiencing Serious Adverse Events and Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events, The number of participants experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs) and Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) will be reported. SAEs and AEs will be assessed by the treating physician and assigned severity and attribution using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 6.0 (NCI CTCAE v6.0)., Up to 12 months
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as percentage of participants without disease progression at time of study discontinuation., Up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival is defined as the percentage of participants who are still living at the time of study discontinuation., Up to 24 months
