The study was an open-label, dose escalation and expansion clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of fruquintinib in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study consisted of two phases:

* A dose escalation phase - Two dose cohorts were evaluated including 3 mg orally QD 3 weeks on/1 week off and 5 mg orally QD 3 weeks on/1 week off. A 3+3 design was used for this portion of the study.
* A dose expansion phase - Five cohorts were evaluated in Dose Expansion phase. Cohort A evaluated the MTD/RP2D in patients with advanced solid tumors of any type. Cohort B and Cohort C evaluated the MTD/RP2D in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Cohort D and Cohort E evaluated the MTD/RP2D in metastatic breast cancer patients.

Study was conducted at 9 sites in the United States.
