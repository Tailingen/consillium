Hydrotherapy Against Menopausal Symptoms in Breast Cancer Survivors
Breast cancer survivors often suffer from climacteric symptoms caused by treatment or diagnosis of their disease.

Hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated and other pharmacological options may also include the risk of stimulating hormone receptors. Hydrotherapy following the guidelines of naturopathy by S. Kneipp is a non-pharmacological treatment option which may influence climacteric symptoms by affecting the regulation of body temperature. In this study, the regular self application of hydrotherapy after initial training by a professional will be evaluated for its efficacy, practicability, and compatibility.
