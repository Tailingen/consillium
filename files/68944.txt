BettER: Biomarker Driven Early Therapeutic Selection in Patients With HR+ HER2- Metastatic or Unresectable Breast Cancer
This is a prospective study to assess the impact of biomarker driven, early therapeutic switching and delayed imaging with the incorporation of DiviTum® serum TK1 activity ("DiviTum® TKa") in patients with HR positive, HER-2 negative metastatic or unresectable breast cancer. Patients will receive first-line treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) and endocrine therapy. All patients will have blood drawn for thymidine kinase activity (TKa) testing at baseline and at C1D15. Patients who are found to have a lack of TKa suppression at C1D15 will be recommended to switch to an alternative therapy. Patients with suppressed C1D15 TKa levels will continue on CDK4/6i and endocrine therapy until clinical progression. Patients with TKa which remains suppressed will be recommended to delay restaging scans from 24 weeks to 36 weeks.

The investigators hypothesize that a patient's TKa level at C1D15 is prognostic for progression-free survival (PFS) on a CDK4/6 inhibitor and early therapeutic switching in patients with a lack of C1D15 TKa suppression will be associated with prolonged PFS.

Progression-free survival (PFS) in patients who remain on CKD4/6i (patients with suppressed TKa levels at cycle 1 day 15), . PFS in patients with suppressed TKa levels is defined as from the start date of receiving CDK4/6i to the end date of CDK4/6i or last date on CDK4/6i if the treatment on CDK4/6i is still ongoing or date of death if death occurs on treatment., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 7 years)|Clinical benefit rate (CBR) in patients who remain on CDK4/6i, CBR is defined as total number (or percentage) of patients who achieved a complete response, partial response, or had stable disease for 6 months or more., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 7 years)|Progression-free survival (PFS) in patients who switch to an alternate therapy (patients with unsuppressed TKa levels at cycle 1 day 15), PFS in patients with unsuppressed TKa levels is defined as from the start date of receiving CDK4/6i to the end date of next-line therapy or last date on next-line if the treatment on next-line therapy is still ongoing or date of death if death occurs on treatment., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 7 years)
