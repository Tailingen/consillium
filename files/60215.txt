Can We Miss Pigmented Lesions in Psoriasis Patients?
In psoriasis patients, thick psoriatic plaques can obscure these lesions, and clinicians rely heavily on visual inspection to recognize suspicious or atypical pigmented lesions. However, successful systemic treatment and subsequent clearing of psoriatic plaques may allow clinicians to better evaluate pigmented lesions, thereby increasing the likelihood of early identification and treatment of suspicious lesions such as nonmelanoma skin cancer and malignant melanoma.
