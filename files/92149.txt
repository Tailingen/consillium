Phase 3 Study to Treat Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcomas
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of aldoxorubicin in subjects with metastatic, locally advanced, or unresectable soft tissue sarcomas.
Metastatic, Locally Advanced or Unresectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma
DRUG: Aldoxorubicin|DRUG: Investigator's Choice Treatment (Darcabazine, Pazopanib, Gemcitabine + Docetaxel, Doxorubicin, Ifosfamide)
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression, according to RECIST 1.1 Criteria, or to death due to any cause in the absence of previous documentation of objective tumor progression. For subjects without documentation of objective tumor progression, who started other anti-tumor treatment, or lost to follow up/withdrew consent prior to confirmed progression, PFS is censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.

PFS is defined as the interval from the date of randomization to the earliest date of documented evidence of recurrent or progressive disease, or the date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

PD is defined as: 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions from the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since the treatment started; the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of 1 new lesion is also considered PD., 24 months
