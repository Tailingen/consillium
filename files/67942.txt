Anti-BCMA CAR-NK Cell Therapy for the Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to infuse BCMA CAR-NK cells（Umbilical \& Cord Blood (CB) Derived CAR-Engineered NK Cells） to the patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM), to assess the safety and feasibility of this strategy. The CAR enables the NK cells to recognize and kill the MM cells by targeting of BCMA, a protein expressed of the surface of the malignant plasma cells in MM patients.
