Risk Assessment of Febrile Neutropenia and Grade 3-4 Neutropenia in Patients With Non-hematological Cancer Treated With Conventional Chemotherapy
The purpose of this study is to identify prognostic factors and to develop predictive models of risk of febrile neutropenia and neutropenia grade 3/4 in patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy with schemas that have an inherent risk of febrile neutropenia of 10-20%.
Non-hematologic Cancer
Identify predictive models about the risk of febrile neutropenia and neutropenia grade 3/4 in patients with non-hematologic cancer, 6 months
Occurrence of serious adverse events, 6 months|Analyze costs to treat febrile neutropenia and neutropenia grade 3/4, 6 months|Analyze the risk of mortality due to febrile neutropenia and neutropenia grade 3/4 during the chemotherapy treatment, A Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to evaluate the risk of mortality due to febrile neutropenia and neutropenia grade 3/4 during chemotherapy treatment., 6 months|Evaluate impact of febrile neutropenia and neutropenia grade 3/4 in treatment compliance, The impact of febrile neutropenia and neutropenia grade 3/4 in treatment compliance (yes/no) will be evaluated using a chi-square test., 6 months
