A Study Evaluating Enzalutamide Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics, and Related Changes After Drug Switch
This is a study for evaluating enzalutamide pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and related changes after drug switch in Chinese patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The study primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of enzalutamide in Chinese patients with mCRPC.
