Changes in QoL and Symptoms in Patients With Polycythemia Vera Receiving Ruxo in a Routine Clinical Practice
The purpose of this multicenter observational prospective cohort study is to examine changes in QoL and symptoms in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) during treatment with ruxolitinib (Ruxo), and to evaluate efficacy and safety of Ruxo in a real-world setting
Polycythemia Vera
DRUG: Ruxolitinib
Change From Baseline in QoL as per SF-36 questionnaire domains at 3 and 9 months of Ruxo treatment, The difference in QoL means of SF-36 domains at 3 and 9 months as compared to their Baseline will be analyzed, Baseline, 3 and 9 months of Ruxo treatment
Change From Baseline in MPN10 Total score over time, The difference in MPN10 Total Symptom Score means by MPN10 at different time-points of Ruxo treatment as compared to their Baseline will be analyzed. Also the percentage of patients with the lowest symptom burden, corresponding to MPN10 Total scores of 0 - 7 (quartile 1), at different treatment time-points (Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months) will be calculated, Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of Ruxo treatment|Change From Baseline in severity of each symptom by MPN10 over time, The difference in MPN10 symptom score means at different time-points of Ruxo treatment as compared to their Baseline will be analyzed, Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of Ruxo treatment|Percentage of patients achieving a ≥ 50% improvement from Baseline in MPN10 Total Symptom Score over time, The number of patients with MPN10 Total Symptom Score decrease ≥ 50% at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of Ruxo treatment as compared to its' Baseline will be calculated, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of Ruxo treatment|Change From Baseline in QoL as per SF-36 questionnaire domains over 12 months of Ruxo treatment, The difference in QoL means of SF-36 domains at different time-points of Ruxo treatment as compared to their Baseline will be analyzed, Baseline, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of Ruxo treatment|The percentage of patients who achieved overall clinicohematologic response at 9 months of treatment with Ruxo, Overall clinicohematologic response will be defined as any participant who achieved a complete or partial clinicohematologic response per the National criteria for response in polycythemia vera (2021) and European LeukNet recommendations (2013). A complete response (CR) will be defined as: hematocrit control (\<45%) with the absence of phlebotomy eligibility ≥12 weeks, spleen volume reduction at least 35% from baseline, platelet count less than or equal to 400 x 109/L, and white blood cell count less than or equal to 10 x 109/L, and symptom regress during ≥12 weeks as well as histological remission. A Partial Response (PR) will be defined as all the above criteria excluding histological remission, 9 months|The Percentage of patients who achieved hematocrit (Hct) control at 9 months of treatment with Ruxo, Hematocrit control is Ht \<45% with the absence of phlebotomy eligibility beginning at 3 months visit and continuing through 9 months, 9 months|The percentage of patients with positive changes of wellbeing during Ruxo treatment, The number of patients who reported improvement as per Patient Global Impression of Changes scale at different time-points of treatment will be analyzed, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of Ruxo treatment|The percentage of patients satisfied/dissatisfied with Ruxo treatment over time, The number of patients satisfied/dissatisfied with treatment according to Patient' Treatment Satisfaction Checklist at different time-points of treatment will be analyzed, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of Ruxo treatment
