In Vivo PARP-1 Expression With 18F-FTT PET/CT in Pancreatic Cancer
The investigators plan to enroll 30 evaluable patients with (1) a histological diagnosis of advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who have demonstrated at least stable disease following ≥16 weeks of treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy and (2) who have signed consent to participate in a clinical trial that contains PARP inhibitor therapy and are anticipated to receive this treatment or (3) will receive PARP inhibitor therapy as part of their clinical care.

A pre-treatment 18F-FluorThanatrace (\[18F\]FTT) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan will be done prior to the start of treatment with a PARP inhibitor.

PET/CT imaging will be used to evaluate PARP-1 expression in sites of pancreatic cancer using the investigational radiotracer \[18F\]FTT. This is an observational study in that \[18F\]FTT PET/CT will not be used to direct treatment decisions. While patients and referring physicians will not be blinded to the \[18F\]FTT PET/CT results, treatment decisions will be made by the treating physicians based upon clinical criteria.

Patients will undergo approximately 60 minutes of dynamic scanning starting at the time of injection of \[18F\]FTT. This procedure will be followed by a skull base to mid-thigh scan, starting at approximately 60 minutes post injection. PET/CT imaging sessions will include an injection of approximately 10 mCi (approximate range for most studies is anticipated to be 8-12 mCi) of \[18F\]FTT. Data will be collected to evaluate uptake of \[18F\]FTT in sites of pancreatic cancer, which will be compared with PARP-1 expression in tissue, when available.

All 30 evaluable patients are expected to start PARP inhibitor therapy following the \[18F\]FTT PET/CT scan. It is expected that due to patient preference and time considerations, approximately 24 patients (80%) will also undergo a second (optional) scan that will be performed approximately 3 weeks (± 1 week) after therapy has started. The second scan is obtained to evaluate whether the PARP inhibitor therapy decreases \[18F\]FTT uptake, which would suggest PARP blocking by the therapy.
