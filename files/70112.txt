A Trial of HRS-1358 Tablets in Metastatic or Local Advanced Breast Cancer
The study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HRS-1358 monotherapy or combination with Dalpiciclib Isethionate Tablets in patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer in order to estimate the Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and select the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).
