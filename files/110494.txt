RWE About QOL and Compliance of Patients With OFS in China
The purpose of this study is to assess the patient's feedback from using GnRHa depot formulation in postoperative, premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.
Breast Cancer|Quality of Life|Hormone Receptor-positive Breast Cancer
DRUG: 3M GnRHa|DRUG: 1M GnRHa
Quality of life (QOL), QOL of participant will be measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Breast (FACT-B) questionnaires, a 37-item instrument designed to measure five domains of QOL in breast cancer patients. Score range: 0-148. The score includes forward items (the higher score means the better of quality of life) and the reverse items (the higher score means the worse quality of life)., Change will be assessed over two time points (baseline and 3 months)|Treatment compliance, Treatment compliance will be measured by self-administered questionnaire. Scale score range: 0-40. The score includes forward items (the higher score means the better adherence) and the reverse items (the higher score means the worse adherence)., Change will be assessed over two time points (baseline and 3 months)
This was a real world, observational study of adjuvant therapy with GnRHa for OFS in postoperative, premenopausal women with endocrine responsive breast cancer. This trial is designed to compare patients' QOL and treatment compliance measured by FACT-B and self-administered questionnaires during OFS treatment period. Total score of FACT-B and self-administered questionaries, and change from baseline will be calculated and summarized descriptively. Change from baseline will be compared between GnRHa 3-month and GnRHa 1-month using ANCOVA model with baseline value as a covariate.The number depends on the patients who received questionnaire during 18 months recruitment in planned 10 sites. This analytical plan assumes homogeneity across 10 sites so that strata is not considered.
