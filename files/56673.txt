Predictors of Ovarian Response During Clomiphene Citrate Ovulation Induction in Patients With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Visceral fat area and other criteria assessed during initial screening could predict the response to ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate (CC) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Anovulation
DRUG: clomiphen citrate
ovulation, 3 months ( cycles)
The study was carried out on 150 patients with PCOS. Initial CC doses were 50 mg daily for 5 days starting on cycle day 3. In the case of an absent response, doses were increased to 100 and 150 mg daily in subsequent cycles. First ovulation with CC was used as the end point.Statistical methods Distribution of characteristics in patients is presented as the mean Â± SD. We used the Mann-Whitney U test for exploratory comparison of initial parameters between responders and nonresponders. The univariate and multivariate relation with response to CC was assessed using logistic regression analysis. Backward stepwise elimination was used for the multivariate logistic analysis of prediction of patients being CRA, and P \< 0.10 was used as a cut-off level for elimination of non-significant predictors from the prognostic model. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to assess the discriminative ability of the logistic models. SPSS with statistical package version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and MedCalc Software version 12.4, (Ostend, Belgium) were employed for data analysis.
