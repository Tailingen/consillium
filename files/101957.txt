Analysis of miRNA Expression in Endometrial Cancer
The TCGA project identified four distinct prognostic groups of endometrial carcinoma (EC) based on molecular alterations: (i) the ultramutated subtype that encompasses POLE mutated (POLE) cases; (ii) the hypermutated subtype, characterized by MisMatch Repair deficiency (MMRd); (iii) the copy-number high subtype, with p53 abnormal/mutated features (p53abn); (iv) the copy-number low subtype, known as No Specific Molecular Profile (NSMP). Although the prognostic value of TCGA molecular classification, NSMP carcinomas present a wide variability in molecular alterations and biological aggressiveness. Given that the study aims to evaluate the miRNA expression profile to identify novel potential biomarkers to better stratify the EC patients, taking into account the molecular status
