Prediction for pCR After Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Combined With Chemotherapy Using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing in Patients With Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Esophagus Cancer
DRUG: Tislelizumab|DRUG: Paclitaxel-albumin|DRUG: Carboplatin
Pathological complete response, Total tumor regression rate under pathologyPrimary tumor or lymph node surgery specimen pathological examination without residual tumor cell, 4 weeks after surgery
Major pathological response, Total/moderate tumor regression rate under pathologyPrimary tumor or lymph node surgery specimen pathological examination without residual tumor cell, 4 weeks after surgery|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate Determine the tumor shrinkage rate, tumor boundary and the adhesion of tumor, At the end of Cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)
