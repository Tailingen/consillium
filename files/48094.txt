Intensified Treatments for Patients With Locally Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma With Detectable EBV DNA After One Cycle GP Regime Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
The goal of this multicenter randomized non-inferior study is to compare the additon of camrelizumab or nimotuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients whose EBV DNA remained detectable after one cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy using GP regimen. The main question it aims to answer is: whether the addition of carrilizumab or nituzumab improve the treatment outcomes in the relatively poor prognostic patients identified by the response of EBV DNA. Participants will be randomized to the combination of carrilizumab and standard treatment , the combination of nituzumab and standard treatment or the standard treatment alone if their EBV DNA didn't decrease to undetectable level post first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Nimotuzumab|DRUG: neoadjuvant chemotherapy and CCRT
Progression-free survival, Defined from date of randomization to date of first documentation of progression or death due to any cause, 3 years
Overall survival, Defined from date of randomization to date of first documentation of death from any cause or censored at the date of the last follow-up., 3 years|Toxicities, Analysis of acute and late adverse events (AEs) are evaluated. Numbers of patients of treatment-related adverse events(acute toxicity) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0.Numbers of patients of late radiation toxicities were assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring scheme., 3 years
