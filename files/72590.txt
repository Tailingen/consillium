A Phase II Trial of Camrelizumab in Combination With Apatinib for Neoadjuvant Treatment of Early-stage TNBC With a High Proportion of TILs
This is a phase II, open-labeled, multi-centered, single-arm, investigator-initiated clinical trial of camrelizumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) in combination with apatinib (a VEGFR2 TKI) for neoadjuvant treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer and \>10% tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in baseline breast tumors. We will enroll 58 subjects (Simon's two stage design). The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with apatinib in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC with a high proportion of TILs.
Breast Cancer|Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody|DRUG: VEGFR2 Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor
Pathological Complete Remission (pCR) rate, pCR rate (ypT0/Tis ypN0) is defined as the percentage of participants without residual invasive cancer on hematoxylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery., After neoadjuvant study treatment and surgery, up to approximately 24-26 weeks
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The propotion of subjects with CR or PR according to RECIST v1.1., After neoadjuvant study treatment and surgery, up to approximately 24-26 weeks|Breast Conservation Rate, The percentage of patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery after neo-adjuvant therapy., Up to approximately 24-26 weeks|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Adverse events/serious adverse events., From the first drug administration to within 90 days for the last dose|Event-Free Survival (EFS), Event-free survival (EFS) defined as the time from recruitment until documented disease recurrence, progression, or death from any cause in all participants. EFS events covered under "disease recurrence" will include local, regional, or distant recurrence and contralateral breast cancer. Ipsilateral or contralateral in situ disease and second primary non-breast cancers will not be counted as EFS events., Up to approximately 8 years|Overall Survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 8 years|Frequencies of Biomarkers, Biomarkers (including tumor/stromal PD-L1, stromal PD-1, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor-infiltrating B cells, eg)., Up to approximately 24-26 weeks
This a phase II, open-labeled, multi-centered, single-arm, investigator-initiated clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combination with apatinib in female patients age of 18 to 70 with TNBC, and baseline tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes \> 10%. The number of patients to be included is 58 patients (Simon's two stage design). The primary objective is to assess the pCR. All enrolled patients will be treated with camrelizumab 200mg (iv. 3mg/kg for patient whose weight is below 50kg) on day 1 of each 21-day cycle, and apatinib 250mg daily (po, d1-d21).
