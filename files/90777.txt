Antibody-mediated NMDA Receptor Encephalitis: Symptoms, Biomarkers, and Mechanisms of the Prolonged Recovery Stage
The encephalitis mediated by antibodies against the NMDA receptor (NMDARe) predominantly affects young adults and children resulting in severe neurologic and psychiatric deficits. After overcoming the acute stage, patients are left with long-lasting behavioral, cognitive, and psychiatric alterations with important socio-family-economical implications. Here investigators postulate that a better knowledge of this stage will improve treatment decisions and outcome.

In Aim 1, the post-acute stage will be clinically characterized, tools to remotely follow cognitive, behavioral and psychiatric deficits will be provided, and the impact of cognitive rehabilitation will be assessed.

In Aim 2, biomarkers (autoimmune, inflammatory, neuronal injury) will be identified as signatures of the acute and post-acute stages.

In Aim 3, a mouse model of NMDARe will be used to determine the underlying mechanisms and treatment of the postacute stage.

The encephalitis mediated by antibodies against the NMDA receptor (NMDARe) predominantly affects young adults and children resulting in severe neurologic and psychiatric deficits. After overcoming the acute stage, patients are left with long-lasting behavioral, cognitive, and psychiatric alterations with important socio-family-economical implications. Here investigators postulate that a better knowledge of this stage will improve treatment decisions and outcome.

In Aim 1, the post-acute stage will be clinically characterized, tools to remotely follow cognitive, behavioral and psychiatric deficits will be provided, and the impact of cognitive rehabilitation will be assessed.

In Aim 2, biomarkers (autoimmune, inflammatory, neuronal injury) will be identified as signatures of the acute and post-acute stages.

In Aim 3, a mouse model of NMDARe will be used to determine the underlying mechanisms and treatment of the postacute stage.
