A Study Of Sunitinib Compared To Placebo For Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Islet Cell Tumors
This study randomized patients with advanced pancreatic islet cell tumors to receive either sunitinib or placebo. Patients who were randomized to sunitinib received 37.5 mg of sunitinib daily, those randomized to placebo received a tablet that looked similar but had no active drug. Neither the patient or the doctor knew whether the patient was receiving sunitinib or placebo. Patients were followed to determine the status and size of their tumors, survival, quality of life and safety of the drug.

The study was designed to detect a 50% improvement in median PFS\[Progression Free Survival\] with 90% power and was to enroll 340 subjects. An interim analysis was planned when 130 events had occurred, and the final analysis was to be conducted when 260 events had occurred.

Study A6181111 was stopped early during the enrollment period because of a clear and clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy for the sunitinib treatment arm as recommended by the DMC \[Data Monitoring Committee\]. The actual number of subjects enrolled was 171 and the actual number of PFS events recorded was 81 PFS events. The decision to terminate the study was not based on safety concerns related to sunitinib administration.

DRUG: sunitinib malate|DRUG: Placebo
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from randomization to first progression of disease (PD) or death for any reason in the absence of documented PD. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus first randomization date +1) divided by 30.4., From time of randomization through Day 1 of Week 5, Week 9, and then every 8 weeks thereafter until disease progression or death
Number of Subjects With Objective Response, Objective response = subjects with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for at least 4 weeks, confirmed by repeat tumor assessments. A CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. A PR was defined as a \> = 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions., From time of randomization through Day 1 of Week 5, 9, and every 8 weeks thereafter|Duration of Response (DR), Time in months from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. DR was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 30.4., From start of treatment through Day 1 of Week 5, 9, and every 8 weeks thereafter until disease progression or death due to any cause|Time-to-Tumor Response (TTR), Time from randomization to the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that was subsequently confirmed., From time of randomization through Day 1 of Week 5, 9, and every 8 weeks thereafter|Overall Survival (OS), Time in months from time of randomization to date of death due to any cause. The median number of months is provided; however, the study was terminated early. OS data was not mature by the time of analysis. Median OS time cannot be accurately estimated by Kaplan-Meier method for either treatment arm., From start of study treatment up to 22 months|European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of LifeQuestionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) - Global Quality of Life (QoL) Subscale, EORTC QLQ-C30 scales: global health/QoL, functional domains (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), and symptom scales/items (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea).

The study was terminated on 11 March 2009 because the independent Data Monitoring Committee determined that the study had met its primary endpoint in demonstrating improvement in progression-free survival. The decision to terminate the trial was not based on safety concerns related to sunitinib administration.
