TT-10 (PORT-6) and TT-4 (PORT-7) as Single Agents and in Combination in Subjects With Advanced Selected Solid Tumors
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate TT-10, TT-4 and TT-10 + TT-4, (Dual Blockade) in participants with advanced selected solid tumors, who have failed or are not eligible for standard of care. The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TT-10, TT-4 and TT-10 + TT-4, (Dual Blockade)
2. To determine the maximum tolerated dose or the recommended phase 2 dose of TT-10, TT-4 and TT-10 + TT-4, (Dual Blockade)
3. To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of TT-10, TT-4 and TT-10 + TT-4, (Dual Blockade) in advanced solid tumors.

Number of subjects with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) of TT-10, TT-4 and TT-10 + TT-4 during the dose escalation phase, All toxicities will be graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, 28 Days|Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or phase 2 recommended dose of TT-10, TT-4 and TT-10 + TT-4 during the dose escalation phase, To confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TT-10, TT-4 and TT-10 + TT-4, defined as the highest dose level at which \<2 out of 6 participants experience a dose-limiting toxicity, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Expansion cohort primary objective - safety, Incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in participants treated at the recommended phase 2 dose in the expansion phase, Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is to be reported as the proportion of patients who have a Complete Response or Partial Response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, From study enrollment until participant discontinuation, first occurrence of progressive disease, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (approximately 2 years)|Duration of Response (DoR), Defined as the time from first documented objective response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 to the date of first documented radiographic progression of disease (PD) or death., From study enrollment until participant discontinuation, first occurrence of progressive disease, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (approximately 2 years)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from first dose to the date of the first confirmed documented progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, From study enrollment until participant discontinuation, first occurrence of progressive disease, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (approximately 2 years)|Peak serum concentration (Cmax) of TT-10, PK Parameter, Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours post-dose|Area under the serum concentration versus time curve (AUC) of TT-10, PK Parameter, Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours post-dose|Half-life of TT-10, PK Parameter, Predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 hours post-dose
Multicenter, open-label dose-escalation Phase I/II clinical study, designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, anti-tumor activity, and efficacy of TT-10, TT-4 and TT-10 + TT-4 (Dual Blockade).

The Phase Ia portion of the study study will consist of three dose escalation cohorts, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and tolerability of TT-10, TT-4, TT-10 + TT-4 and will be conducted in participants with the following advanced cancers:

Cohort A (TT-10): Renal cell cancer (RCC), castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN); who have failed or are not eligible for standard of care treatment.

Cohort B (TT-4): Castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), endometrial cancer (EC) and ovarian cancer (OC); who have failed or are not eligible for standard of care treatment.

Cohort C (TT-10 + TT-4): Tumor types from both cohorts will be included and prioritized based on the data observed.
