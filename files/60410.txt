Use of an Ultra-rapid BRCA1/2 Status Screening Test in Diagnostic and Theranostic Indication: Performance and Interest for Patients and Practitioners
The time taken to obtain the results of germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become a major issue in adapting the therapeutic management of patients, particularly those with breast cancer.

The time taken to obtain the results of BRCA1/2 tests in routine laboratories with a view to personalised treatment can range from a few weeks to a few months. The waiting time required to obtain results is likely to cause stress and anxiety in cancer patients. The investigators hypothesise that ultra-rapid testing can reduce anxiety about patients' genetic status and improve their mental well-being.

The main objective of this project is to compare the results obtained with an ultra-fast kit developed by O.N.T with those obtained with the current gold standard, NGS sequencing.

OTHER: Questionnaires|OTHER: Communication of the results of the BRCA1/2 ultra rapid test
Compare the results obtained with an ultra-rapid kit BRCA1/2 with those obtained with the current gold standard, by checking the sensitivity, specificity and the rate of patients correctly classified for BRCA1 and 2 status, The main objective will be to determine the rate of misclassified patients by pooling the 2 arms, false positives and false negatives.

* True positives (VP) : patients presenting a BRCA 1 or 2 mutation with the ultrafast BRCA1/2 test and the gold standard.
* False positives (FP) : patients with a BRCA 1 or 2 mutation using the BRCA1/2 ultrafast test and no BRCA 1 or 2 mutation using the gold standard.
* True negatives (VN) : patients with no BRCA 1 or 2 mutation using the BRCA1/2 ultrafast test and the gold standard.
* False negatives (FN) : patients without a BRCA 1 or 2 mutation using the BRCA1/2 ultrafast test and with a BRCA 1 or 2 mutation using the standard test.

WELL classified = VP + VN, poorly classified= FP+ FN FPs will generate anxiety, and FNs will lead to a loss of chance for patients if the ultrafast BRCA1/2 test (nanopore test) is used exclusively instead of the gold standard. The overall number of misclassified patients must therefore be limited., During 2 months
Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the ultra-rapid BRCA1/2 test, Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the ultra-rapid BRCA1/2 test (nanopore test) compared with the standard BRCA1/2 test (gold standard)., During 2 months|To assess the impact on patients' mental well-being (anxiety or reassurance) using the State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire (STAI-Y), Anxiety will be assessed in each arm using the State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire (STAI-Y) at 4 different time points:

* After the patient has not objected to taking part in the TURBO study at the first consultation (before randomization);
* 1-2 weeks after inclusion. The questionnaire will be e-mailed to patients. The questionnaire must be completed before the results of the BRCA1/2 ultrafast test (nanopore test) are communicated to patients in the experimental group.
* 4 weeks after inclusion. The questionnaire will be sent by email.
* 8 - 12 weeks after inclusion, during the consultation for the communication of test results with the gold standard, before the communication of results., During 2 months|Evaluate clinician satisfaction with satisfaction scale used in genetic counselling, Clinician satisfaction (oncogeneticist and oncologist) and acceptance of the BRCA1/2 ultrafast test (nanopore test) will be evaluated in both arms using a questionnaire to assess clinician satisfaction at 2 different times for each practitioner involved in patient follow-up:

* When the first patient is unopposed;
* At the last patient's discharge., During 2 months|Evaluate patient satisfaction used in genetic counselling, Patient satisfaction will be assessed in both arms using a satisfaction scale used in genetic counselling at two different times:

* After the patient has made no objection to participating in the TURBO study during the first consultation (before randomization);
* 8 - 12 weeks after inclusion, before the consultation for the gold standard test results., During 2 months
