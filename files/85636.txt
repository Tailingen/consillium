A Study of Time-Restricted Eating in Childhood Cancer Survivors
This study will look at whether motivational sessions (including regular calls with a trained health coach) in combination with time-restricted eating (TRE) is an effective way to achieve weight loss and lower cardiometabolic risk in adult survivors of childhood cancer. We will look at how effective this intervention is compared to the usual approach, which is to review educational materials and measure weight once a month. This study will not provide treatment for any disease or cancer.
