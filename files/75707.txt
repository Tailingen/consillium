Genomic Analysis to Identify a Predictive Biomarker for Immunotherapy
This study is designed to identify the predictive biomarker for immunotherapy using patient samples (tumor tissue, blood, fecal material) who treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor.
Lung Cancer
List of biomarkers, Neoantigen, tumor mutation burden, MHC compatibility, T-cell receptor and associated immune gene signature (IFN-r, interferons such as IL-2 and interleukin family), T-cell subset (T cell surface marker such as CD4+, CD7+, CD8+, CD16, CD34+, CD38+, CD56+, etc.), PD-1/PD-L1 expression, etc., Baseline
