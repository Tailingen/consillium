A Study Combining Eribulin Mesylate With Avelumab in Cisplatin Ineligible Metastatic Urothelial Cell Cancer Patients
This is a single arm, open-label phase Ib study of combining eribulin mesylate with avelumab. The initial 9-12 patients (MTD cohort) will be enrolled to determine safety of avelumab in combination with eribulin mesylate. Upon determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 12 additional patients will be enrolled in an expansion cohort (efficacy cohort) to determine ORR at 6 months.
Metastatic Urothelial Cell Cancer
DRUG: Eribulin Mesylate|DRUG: Avelumab
Assess the Adverse Events of Combining Eribulin Mesylate With Avelumab - (MTD Cohort), Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) experienced by subjects while being treated with the combination of eribulin+avelumab, by dose level., 4-weeks|Assess Response Rates (RR) - (Efficacy Cohort), Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR), 12 months
Assess Disease Control Rate (DCR), Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) + Stable Disease (SD), at 3, 6 months|Estimate Progression Free Survival (PFS), probability that a patient remains free of progression of disease by modified RECIST 1.1, 12 months|Estimate Overall Survival (OS), time from start of treatment, Day 1, to the date of death due to any cause, 12 months|Estimate Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), measurement from the date of initiation of avelumab+ eribulin, D1 until the criteria for disease progression is met as defined by modified RECIST 1.1, 12 months|Estimate Median Overall Survival (OS), time from start of treatment, Day 1, that half of the patients in the group with the disease are still alive., 2.5 years|Assess the Duration of Response, the period measured from the time that measurement criteria are met for complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) until the date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented., 2.5 years
Dose Escalation Plan:

A standard "3+3" design will be used to determine the MTD of eribulin with avelumab.

The maximum tolerated dose is the dose of eribulin combined with avelumab with dose limiting toxicity of 0-1 of 6 patients in the first cycle of combination therapy. After the MTD has been determined, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled in an expansion cohort at the MTD to evaluate the efficacy of this combination.

After determination of MTD for eribulin mesylate, an additional 12 patients will be enrolled on the expansion cohort. Subjects on the expansion cohort will be assessed for adverse events but will not be assessed for DLTs.
