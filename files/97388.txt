CD34+ Transplants for Leukemia and Lymphoma
This study will evaluate whether processing blood stem cell transplants using an investigational device (the CliniMACS system) results in less complications for patients undergoing transplant for treatment of a blood malignancy (cancer) or blood disorder.

Incidence rate of graft versus host disease (GvHD), Incidence of acute and chronic GvHD, Two years|Severity of disease, Severity of the adverse events will be reported based on the CTCAE Version 5., Two years|Incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM), TRM includes fatal complications resulting from the allogeneic transplant and/ or treatment regimens such as graft failure, GvHD, hemorrhages, and infections., Two years|Change in overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from transplant to death or last follow-up., Six months, one year, two years|Change in disease free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the minimum time interval of times to relapse/recurrence, to death or to the last follow- up, from the time of transplant., Six months, one year, two years
Proportion of patients optimal and suboptimal doses, The proportion of patients receiving optimal cell doses (CD34+: \>5x 10\^6/kg and CD3+: \< 5 x10\^4/kg) and suboptimal doses (CD34+: \<3 x 10\^6/kg and CD3+: \>5 x 10\^4/kg)., Two years
