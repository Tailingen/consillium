Sunitinib in Certain Subtypes of Soft Tissue Sarcomas
The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients with metastatic, locally advanced, or locally recurrent vascular soft tissue sarcoma treated with sunitinib.
Sarcoma, Soft Tissue
DRUG: Sunitinib
Number of Subjects With Stable Disease at First Assessment of Response, CT or MRI to monitor response: CT or MRI to assess tumor measurement based on the RECIST criteria, Up to 84 days
Soft tissue sarcomas are rare tumors that arise from mesenchymal tissue from anywhere in the body. While surgical intervention can offer a cure for localized soft tissue sarcoma, treatment of unresectable and metastatic disease is particularly challenging. New treatment options are needed for patients with unresectable or metastatic disease if they progress or cannot tolerate conventional chemotherapy. This study will investigate sunitinib - a novel orally-administered multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-tumor and antiangiogenic activities.
