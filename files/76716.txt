Thalidomide Maintenance Treatment in DLBCL
This is a randomized, multi-center,phase III study to evaluate the ability of thalidomide maintenance therapy to prolong relapse-free survival in diffuse large B cell lymphoma(DLBCL).
Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse
DRUG: Thalidomide|OTHER: Observation
Relapse-free survival, RFS was defined as the time between randomization and any documentation of relapse, death by any cause or last follow up., 5 years
Overall survival, OS was defined as the interval from randomization to death or the last follow-up for surviving patients., 5 years|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, Adverse events were classified as defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2. Safety evaluations were focused especially on neurological symptoms and the development of deep venous thrombosis (DVT)., 5 years
This is a randomized, phase III study to evaluate the ability of thalidomide maintenance therapy to prolong relapse-free survival(RFS), in diffuse large B cell lymphoma(DLBCL).Patients will be enrolled after successful standard induction therapy (CR or CRu following standard R-CHOP-like therapy with 8 infusions of rituximab plus CHOP-like chemotherapy (4-8 cycles). Patients will be followed until an event occurs as defined in the protocol. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of thalidomide maintenance therapy as compared to observation in patients with DLBCL who have achieved a complete remission after appropriate first-line therapy, measured by RFS, 226 patients with DLCBL will be recruited.
