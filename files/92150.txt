Phase 1 Trial of ZM008 as Single Agent and in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1 dose escalation trial of ZM008, an anti-LLT1 antibody as a single agent followed by combination with Pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors who have exhausted all standard therapy available or are intolerant of the same.
