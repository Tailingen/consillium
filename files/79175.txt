Effect of a Commonly Used Antibiotic, Doxycycline, in Women With Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome
The purpose of this study is to study the effect of a commonly used antibiotic, doxycycline, on the production of ovarian hormones and menstrual cycles in women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS).

DRUG: doxycycline|OTHER: Sugar Pill
Total Serum Testosterone, We will determine total serum testosterone levels in all participating subjects at week 24., 24 weeks|Total Serum Testosterone, We will determine total serum testosterone levels in all participating subjects at week 12., week 12
Serum Progesterone Levels in Blood, Serum progesterone levels will be obtained on a weekly basis to assess ovulation. We will then perform statistical analysis on this data to determine the effectiveness of doxycycline in this study population., 24 weeks|Free Testosterone in Serum, week 12|Free Testosterone in Serum, week 24|Serum Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), week 12|Serum Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), week 24|Total Number of Ovulations, The total number of ovulations per group. Ovulation was defined as elevation of serum progesterone and or urinary pregnanediol glucuronide followed by documented menstrual bleeding within 2 weeks of elevation., week 24
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the leading causes of female infertility, affecting 5-10% of reproductive-age women . This heterogeneous disorder is characterized by anovulatory infertility, androgen excess, an increase in the ratio of LH to FSH, and morphologic polycystic changes to the ovaries. Obesity and insulin resistance are also metabolic factors associated with PCOS that further increase the morbidity in these patients. Inducing fertility in patients with PCOS can be a challenge, as it most often involves ovulation induction that can lead to ovarian enlargement, hyperstimulation, and multiple-birth pregnancies. This study is designed to determine novel effective strategies to promote normal cycling in this patient population.
