Reducing Symptom Burden Through Physical Exercise in Melanoma Patients
The aim of the clinical trial is to determine whether regular exercise can reduce fatigue in adult patients with stage IIb-IV melanoma undergoing immunotherapy or targeted therapy. Additionally, we will investigate whether a supervised exercise program improves patients' quality of life, cognitive skills, and physical fitness compared to a control group without structured exercise. We will also examine other health outcomes and various blood parameters, such as interleukins and metabolites, to understand how regular activity can affect metabolism and immune function.

After the initial assessment at the clinic, patients will be randomly assigned to two groups. Those in the intervention group will participate in a 12-week exercise program, which includes a 60-minute personalized and supervised online training session twice a week. In weeks 3, 6, and 9, one training session will be held at the clinic. Furthermore, patients in the intervention group are encouraged to complete a self-administered 20-minute exercise session once a week. The control group will not receive a supervised exercise program. Following the 12-week intervention period, another assessment will be conducted at the clinic. All patients will then enter a 6-week follow-up phase, during which neither group will receive supervised exercise training. After this follow-up phase, a final assessment of all outcomes will take place at the clinic.

BEHAVIORAL: Supervised 12-week Resistance and Endurance Exercise Program
Fatigue, Fatigue will be assessed with the validated 40-item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F, version 4). It includes four multi-item functional scales (physical, social, emotional and functional well-being) and a multi-item symptom scale (fatigue)., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks
Fatigue, Fatigue will be assessed with the validated 40-item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F, version 4). It includes four multi-item functional scales (physical, social, emotional and functional well-being) and a multi-item symptom scale (fatigue)., From the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Quality of life of melanoma patients, Quality of Life (QoL) will be assessed with the validated 51-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Melanoma (FACT-M, version 3). It includes four multi-item functional scales (physical, social, emotional and functional well-being) and a multi-item disease-specific subscale., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Physical Activity Behaviour, Physical Activity (PA) behaviour in the domains of activity at work, during leisure time, and exercise activity will be assessed via a standardized and validated questionnaire, the Physical activity and Sports activity Questionnaire (Bewegungs- und SportAktivitätsfragebogen (BSA, version 3.0))., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Strength of large muscle groups, Muscle strength will be assessed via 5-repetition-maximum strength test for large muscle groups. The protocol includes leg press, bench press, and lat pulldown, From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Cardiopulmonary fitness, Cardiopulmonary fitness will be measured by assessing maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) via a cycling test with a protocol starting at 20 watts and increasing by 10 watts every minute until the patient reaches volitional exhaustion. To control for test validity, gas exchange will be measured using a breath-by-breath gas analysis system which will be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions before each test. Patients' safety will be monitored. Blood pressure will be measured prior, during and after testing. The criteria for exhaustion will be fulfilled if two out of five of the following criteria are valid: (1) Borg scale \> 16; (2) peak heart rate ± 10% of age-appropriate reference value; (3) oxygen saturation \<88%; (4) patient is not able to maintain 60rpm and/or (5) respiratory exchange ratio (RER) \> 1.1. Exercise will be terminated prematurely in the case of severe dyspnea or excessive blood pressure increase (≥250 mmHg systolic and/or ≥110 mmHg diastolic)., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Cognitive Performance, The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA, version 8.3) is a validated, highly sensitive tool for early detection of mild cognitive impairment. It generates a total score and six domain-specified index scores: (1) Memory, (2) Executive Functioning, (3) Attention, (4) Language, (5) Visuospatial, (6) Orientation., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Body composition, Body composition will be assessed via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Body composition analysis includes (1) fat mass (FM); (2) fat-free mass (FFM); (3) body cell mass (BCM); (4) relative amount of external cell water (ECW%); (5) total body water (TBW); (6) intra cellular water (ICW); (7) appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM) and (8) appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI). It also includes measurement of patients' weight and height, and the corresponding BMI., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Weight, Weight will be assessed in kilograms., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Height, Height will be assessed in meters., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|BMI, Weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m²., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Blood pressure at rest, Assessment of blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) at rest will be conducted prior to exercise testing, From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Resting heart rate, Assessment of resting heart rate will be conducted prior to exercise testing., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Side effects/ symptoms, Evaluation of side effects or symptoms will be done via patient reported outcomes using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO- CTCAE). Therefore, a standardized questionnaire containing 10 items covering most common therapy related symptoms such as (1) nausea; (2) vomiting; (3) diarrhea; (4) shortness of breath; (5) cough; (6) rash; (7) itching; (8) joint pain; (9) muscle pain; (10) decreased libido will be completed., From baseline assessment to the end of treatment at 12 weeks, from the end of treatment to follow-up assessment at 18 weeks|Response to therapy, Blood samples will be collected at all assessment time points in the clinic.
