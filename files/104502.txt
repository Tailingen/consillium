Modulation Of The Tumour Microenvironment Using Either Vascular Disrupting Agents or STAT3 Inhibition in Order to Synergise With PD1 Inhibition in Microsatellite Stable, Refractory Colorectal Cancer
This Phase II research project will test the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an experimental drug combination: either nivolumab and BBI608 or nivolumab and BNC105 in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously failed standard of care treatment.
Colorectal Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Nivolumab 10 MG/ML|DRUG: BNC 105|DRUG: BBI608
Objective response per iRECIST, From start of treatment up to the date when the last patient has their 6 months follow-up assessment
Objective response per RECIST1.1, From start of treatment up to the date when the last patient has their 6 months follow-up assessment|Progression free survival (PFS)., From start of treatment until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to the date when the last patient has their 6 months follow-up assessment|Adverse event assessed using CTCAE version 5.0, Through treatment completion, maximum of 2 years|Overall survival, From start of treatment until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to the date when the last patient has their 6 months follow-up assessment
This is an open-label, multicentre, parallel phase II study designed to assess the efficacy of the combination of nivolumab and BNC105 and the combination of nivolumab and BBI-608. Patients with microsatellite stable adenocarcinoma of colorectal origin that is not resectable are eligible and will be randomised in the ratio of 1:1 using permuted block randomisation with stratification by screening ECOG performance status (0 or 1) to receive either nivolumab and BNC105 or nivolumab and BBI-608.

The expected sample size is 90 patients over a 24 month recruitment period.
