Atezolizumab in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer With Rare Histologies (CHANCE Trial)
This study is aimed to explore the antitumor activity and the safety profile of atezolizumab in pretreated advanced NSCLC patients with rare histological subtypes.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Proportion of patients presenting Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) based on the Investigator's assessment according to standard RECIST criteria v.1.1., From the start of treatment (baseline) to the progression of disease (PD) or trial discontinuation whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months.
Treatment Safety based on Adverse Events Frequency and Safety, Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events, the latter measured by each Investigator according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03, From the treatment start to 90 days after the administration of the last treatment dose. The outcome is assessed up to a maximum of 27 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Proportion of patients presenting Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) based on Investigator's assessment according to standard RECIST criteria v.1.1., From the start of treatment (baseline) to the progression or stability of disease assessed up to 24 months.|Overall Survival (OS), Time from enrollment until death from any cause, From the date of enrollment to the date of death from any cause. The survival follow-up will continue until 6 months after the last subject receives the last dose of atezolizumab|Time To Progression (Time To Progression), Time from enrollment until objective tumor progression assessed by the Investigators according to standard RECIST criteria v.1.1., From the date of enrollment to the date of objective tumor progression assessed up to 24 months.|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time from enrollment until objective tumor progression or death from any cause or the last date the patient was known-to be progression free or alive, From the date of enrollment to the date of objective disease progression or death assessed up to 24 months.
Duration of Response (DoR), Time from documentation of tumor response (CR or PR) to tumor progression assessed by the Investigators according to standard RECIST 1.1 criteria, From the time of documentation of tumor response to the time of disease progression assessed up to 24 months after baseline|Time to Response, Time from the baseline to a documented tumor response (CR or PR) assessed by the Investigators according to standard RECIST criteria v.1.1., The occurrence of a response will be assessed from baseline up to 24 months|Tumor shrinkage in target lesions, Tumor shrinkage will be determined based on the change in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions at each time point, Up to 36 months from the treatment start|PD-L1 marker expression on tumor tissue, Archival tumor tissue (FFPE tumor block or 7-10 unstained slides) will be assessed for determination of PD-L1 status on tumor cells by using both SP-142 and SP-263 antibody assays, Up to 48 months from the treatment start|Predictable value of PD-L1 tumor expression on tumor response, Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the role of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells as predictive biomarker of tumor response, Up to 48 months from the treatment start|PD-L1 marker expression on Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs), Archival tumor tissue (FFPE tumor block or 7-10 unstained slides) will be assessed for determination of PD-L1 status on immune cells by using both SP-142 and SP-263 antibody assays, Up to 48 months from the treatment start|Predictable value of PD-L1 TILs expression on tumor response, Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the role of PD-L1 expression on immune cells as predictive biomarker of tumor response, Up to 48 months from the treatment start|Correlation between PD-L1 expression both on tumor cells and on immune cells, Correlation analysis will be performed with the aim to evaluate PD-L1 expression on both tumor cells and immune cells, Up to 48 months from the treatment start|Accuracy of antibody assays SP-142 and SP-263, It will be evaluated the accuracy of both antibody assays and statistical analysis will be performed to investigate their predictive value of response, Up to 48 months from the treatment start
