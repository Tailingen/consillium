Wholebody MRI In Lung Cancer StagiNg
Magnetic Resonnace Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can be both used in detection of nodes in patients with cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

However, the cardiorespiratory synchronization in the MRI, allowing acquisition of synchronous images with breathing and heart movements should increase the sensitivity of detection of pathologic mediastinal lymph nodes.

Given its high sensitivity, whole-body MRI with diffusion could possibly be at least as informative as PET, while being less expensive, not radiant.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of whole-body MRI with diffusion with cardiorespiratory synchronization, on the detection of mediastinal nodes (which are known to be less well detected by MRI) compared to PET.
