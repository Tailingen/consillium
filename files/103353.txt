Patients with a diagnosis of high risk prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 8 or greater are eligible for this trial. The study will enroll 20 subjects in 3 years. This is a single arm study and the primary objectives is to assess if a patient can undergo a radical prostatectomy after SBRT without a post-operative grade 3 or higher toxicity (according to Clavien-Dindo Classification) at 30 days. Secondary objectives are to assess acute toxicity and quality of life scores. Exploratory objectives will include analysis of tumor and normal biopsied and resected tissue and serum markers and interpretation of interfraction and intrafraction MRIs.
