Laparoscopy for Primary Cytoreductive Surgery in Advanced Ovarian Cancer
To assess the feasibility, Residual Tumor, complication rate and survival of totally laparoscopic primary cytoreduction in carefully selected patients with Advanced Ovarian Cancer, compared with abdominal primary cytoreduction in a single-Institution, single-surgeon prospective series.

PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic primary cytoreduction

All patients with presumed stage III-IV ovarian cancer and clinical conditions allowing aggressive surgery were candidate to possible primary cytoreduction with the aim of achieving residual tumor=0. A definite protocol was adopted: after radiological preoperative evaluation with PET-CT scan, all patients underwent laparoscopic evaluation with the Fagotti score. Once considered suitable for primary debulking surgery, the possibility of attempting laparoscopic cytoreduction was carefully evaluated using strict selection criteria; patients were divided in two groups, based on the type of surgical approach. At the end of laparoscopic primary cytoreduction, a ultra-low pubic minilaparotomy was performed to extract surgical specimens and to perform laparoscopic hand-assisted exploration of the abdominal organs, in order to ensure complete excision of the disease. Surgical data, optimal cytoreduction (defined as residual tumor=0) rates and survival outcomes were investigated.
