A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event.

The drug being tested in this study is called ixazomib. Ixazomib was tested to slow disease progression and improve overall survival in participants who have newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). This study looked at the safety, tolerability and response in participants when administered in combination with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone.

The study enrolled 64 patients. Participants were assigned to one of the 3 treatment groups:

* Phase 1 Ixazomib 3 mg
* Phase 1 Ixazomib 3.7 mg
* Phase 2 Ixazomib 3 mg

All participants were administered with Ixazomib capsules, orally, twice-weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 along with lenalidomide capsules, orally, once daily on Days 1-14 and dexamethasone, capsules, orally, once daily on Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 for up to 16 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity as induction therapy during Phase 1. Participants with stable or responding disease continued receiving ixazomib capsules, orally, twice weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 in 21-day treatment cycles as maintenance therapy until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

This multi-center trial conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was 2037 days. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and a final visit after 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
