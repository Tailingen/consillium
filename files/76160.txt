Study to Assess Effectiveness of Giving Combination of Standard Chemotherapy Drugs Versus Combination of Standard Chemotherapy and New Drug Ixabepilone When Given Before Surgical Removal of Early Stage Breast Cancer
The study will evaluate the effectiveness of ixabepilone when given after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) compared to standard treatment of paclitaxel given after doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide in patients with early stage breast cancer. In addition the study will verify predefined biomarkers as well as discover new biomarkers that could identify patients who are more likely to respond to ixabepilone than standard paclitaxel based therapy.

Percentage of Participants Achieving Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), The pCR was defined as no histologic evidence of residual invasive adenocarcinoma in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, with or without the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the breast., at surgery (performed 4-6 weeks after the last dose of 12 weeks of therapy)|Percentage of Participants Achieving Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) in Biomarker-Defined Populations, Beta III tubulin positivity determined by cross-validation method. Optimal cutoff: ≥46% tumor cells staining at 2 plus or 3 plus intensity (corresponding Beta III tubulin positivity=39.4%). Pre-specified cutoff of Beta III tubulin positivity: ≥50% 2plus or 3plus cells (corresponding prevalence=38.5%). Optimal cutoffs for TACC3 and CAPG positivity determined by cross-validation method: 6.889 and 6.844 \[log2 normalized intensity units\], respectively (corresponding to prevalence rates of 43.3% and 44.3%)., pCR evaluated at time of surgery (4-6 weeks after the last dose of therapy); mandatory tumor tissue biopsy obtained prior to treatment.|Percentage of Participants Achieving Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) in 20- and 26-Gene Model Subgroups, For each of the 2 biomarker sets (20-gene or 26-gene), a multi-gene model was built using penalized logistic regression on all pharmacogenomic evaluable subjects for each treatment arm separately. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plots for separate arm using 5 fold cross validation were generated. ROC for separate arms using cross over were also added. Further analysis on the multiple gene models (as mentioned in the SAP) was planned only based on the initial findings from the 2 ROC plots. For 20- and 26-gene models, ROC curves generated for each study arm did not indicate that these multi-gene models differentially predicted for pCR between the treatment arms, so further analyses to estimate the optimal cut-off and the pCR rates were not conducted., pCR evaluated at time of surgery (4-6 weeks after the last dose of therapy); mandatory tumor tissue biopsy obtained prior to treatment.
Percentage of Participants Achieving Clinical Objective Response, Clinical response was defined as the number of participants who achieved modified World Health Organization's tumor response criteria of clinical complete response (complete disappearance of all clinically palpable detectable malignant disease and/or disappearance of radiological evidence of tumor in the breast and ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes) or clinical partial response (clinical evidence of a reduction in total tumor size of \>= 50% in the overall sum of the products of diameters of breast and axillary lesions), divided by the number of randomized participants in that arm., after the last dose of either ixabepilone or paclitaxel (at 12 weeks) but before surgery (4-6 weeks after the last dose of 12 weeks of therapy)|Percentage of Participants Requiring Breast Conservation Surgery, Number of randomized participants requiring breast conservation surgery following study treatment., at surgery (performed 4-6 weeks after the last dose of 12 weeks of therapy)|Percentage of Participants Achieving Combined pCR and Minimal Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) 1, Combined pCR and RCB-1 was defined as participants with no histologic evidence of residual invasive adenocarcinoma in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, with or without the presence of DCIS in the breast plus subjects with RCB-1 following the RCB calculation based on data entered by the investigator sites in each arm., at surgery (performed 4-6 weeks after the last dose of 12 weeks of therapy)|Randomized Participants With Non-missing pCR & Biomarker Expression (GENE [Probe Set]), to Explore Whether Gene Expression Patterns for GTSE1, Isoforms of β-tubulin, Kallikreins 5, 6, 10 Are Differentially Predictive of pCR, Relevance of biomarker in differentiation between ixabepilone \& paclitaxel evaluated by logistic regression with pCR as response.
