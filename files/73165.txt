Influence of Intermittent Fasting on Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Patients
Breast cancer is the most common cancer type among women in Egypt and world. Preclinical studies show fasting reduces growth factors and modulates nutrient sensing systems, protecting normal cells against chemotherapy. However, cancer cells are not protected due to Differential Stress Resistance (DSR), making them more vulnerable to chemotherapeutics. This study aims to evaluate intermittent fasting impact on neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer patients.
