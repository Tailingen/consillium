Single-fraction APBI for Early-stage Breast Cancer With Favorable Histological Subtypes (Breast-1F)
This is a prospective, randomized, monocentric, non-inferiority interventional clinical study comparing an Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) for the surgical bed of early-stage breast cancer patients with favorable histological subtypes, using stereotactic radiotherapy in a single dose of 15.5 Gy with Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) to 21 Gy (study treatment, delivered in a single fraction) versus multifractionated radiotherapy of 30 Gy in 5 fractions (standard treatment, delivered in 5 fractions).

The project refers to a study on patients with early-stage breast cancer with pathological Tumor stage (pT) from in situ (pTis) to pT2 up to 3 cm in diameter, and pathological/clinical nodal stage p/cN0, and favorable histology (Luminal A and Luminal B human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative subtypes), comparing an APBI treatment delivered with stereotactic radiotherapy to the Planning Target Volume (PTV) of the tumor bed of the breast with a total dose (TD) of 15.5 Gy in one fraction, with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to a TD of 21 Gy to the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) represented by tumor bed, versus 30 Gy in 5 consecutive fractions to the PTV of the tumor bed, according to the standard APBI protocol of the department (Florence protocol).
