Refractory Neuroblastoma|Soft Tissue Cancer
DRUG: HITS|DRUG: Naxitamab + GM-CSF cycles|DRUG: NICE
Number of Participants with Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events, The safety and tolerability of the treatment will be determined by means of type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness, and relatedness of reported AEs, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Toxicity will be graded and tabulated by the NCI CTCA E v 5 .0, 14 months after ICF signature|Best Overall Response (at the end of HITS treatment), Best Overall Response is defined as the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment, From first day of treatment with HITS until completion of HITS (39 days).|Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) (at the end of HITS treatment), The number and proportion of patients with CR as Best Overall Response at the end of HITS treatment, From first day of treatment with HITS until completion of HITS(39 days).|Objective Response Rate (at the end of HITS treatment), Objective Response Rate is defined as the proportion of patients with Best Overall Response of CR (complete response) or PR (partial response)., From first day of treatment with HITS until completion of HITS (39 days).|Clinical Benefit Rate (at the end of HITS treatment), Clinical Benefit Rate is defined as the proportion of patients with Best Overall Response of CR (complete response) or PR (partial response) or SD (stable disease) ≥ 24 w, From first day of treatment with HITS until completion of HITS (39 days).|Best Overall Response (at the end of NICE treatment), Best Overall Response is defined as the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment, From first day of treatment with NICE until completion of NICE (39 days).|Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR) (at the end of NICE treatment), The number and proportion of patients with CR as Best Overall Response at the end of NICE treatment, From first day of treatment with NICE until completion of NICE (39 days).|Objective Response Rate (at the end of NICE treatment), Objective Response Rate is defined as the proportion of patients with Best Overall Response of CR (complete response) or PR (partial response)., From first day of treatment with NICE until completion of NICE (39 days).|Clinical Benefit Rate (at the end of NICE treatment), Clinical Benefit Rate is defined as the proportion of patients with Best Overall Response of CR (complete response) or PR (partial response) or SD (stable disease) ≥ 24 w, From first day of treatment with NICE until completion of NICE (39 days).

The anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody Naxitamab (also known as hu3F8) in combination with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is currently under pivotal phase 3 investigation for the treatment of High-Risk Neuroblastoma Patients with Primary or Secondary Refractory Osteomedullary Disease.

A subset of patients with high-risk, resistant disease, i.e., relapsed or refractory Neuroblastoma with soft tissue involvement as measured by 123I-Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), 18F-FDG avid or measurable computed tomography (CT)/ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tumors outside of the bone marrow, or disease refractory to Naxitamab in combination with GM-CSF has shown significant response rates to a chemoimmunotherapy combination of Naxitamab, GM-CSF, irinotecan and temozolomide (HITS- Hu3F8, irinotecan, temozolomide and sargramostim) (NCT03189706). Treatment is administered on an outpatient basis and toxicities include those expected from I/T (myelosuppression and diarrhea) as well as pain and hypertension expected with Naxitamab. No other greater than grade 2 related toxicities occurred in this study (n=46). Early responses, assessed after 2 cycles, were documented in 18 (39%) patients and here complete (n = 9), partial (n = 8), and mixed (n = 1) and 13 patients had stable disease. Responses were achieved in refractory (3/7;43%) and progressive disease (15/39;38%) subgroups, in patients who had previously received I/T (12/34;35%) and/or anti-GD2 MoAb (14/36;39%), and in soft tissue (6/22; 27%) MIBG-avid skeletal sites (20/36;56%) and on bone marrow histology (9/12;75%). While encouraging, new strategies are warranted to further treat resistant disease.

A high-dose combination of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) has activity against Neuroblastoma without cross-resistance to widely used chemotherapy regimens.

Through compassionate use, 4 patients with progression of disease or refractory disease after HITS therapy, have been further treated with two cycles of a combination of naxitamab, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) and ifosfamide/Carboplatin/Etoposide (NICE). The first patient showed a complete response.

Toxicity included G2 prolonged aplasia and G3 hypertension, both expected from the chemotherapy agents and hu3F8. One patient progressed after the 2 cycles and the other 2 showed stable disease, according to the revised (2017) International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (INRC).

In this formal trial, the investigators will investigate whether the combination of Naxitamab and GM-CSF with ifosfamide/Carboplatin/Etoposide (ICE) has a synergistic treatment effect in relapsed or refractory disease. The safety and efficacy of NICE (Naxitamab, Ifosfamide/Carboplatin/Etoposide) in patients that have not achieved complete remission with HITS chemo-immunotherapy will be assessed.
