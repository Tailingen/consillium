Study of Axitinib and Temsirolimus in Solid Tumors
This study is being done to determine the highest safe dose of the combination of temsirolimus and axitinib; to learn the side effects when these drugs are given together; and to determine how the patient's disease responds to treatment.

The combination of the drugs temsirolimus and axitinib has not been studied before so it is unknown whether this treatment will have any benefit in the patient's cancer.

Temsirolimus is commercially available and approved for treatment of some types of kidney cancer.

Axitinib has been tested in several diseases but it is not yet commercially available for the treatment of any cancer in the United States.

The combination of temsirolimus and axitinib is not approved for treatment of any cancer outside of a clinical trial.
Cancer
DRUG: Axitinib|DRUG: Temsirolimus
Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for evaluation., Complete Response: Disappearance of all target lesions.Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions.Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).

Stable Disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD., Approximately re-evaluated every 8 weeks
