Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 Criteria, Best overall response rate was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR), and partial response (PR), as assessed by the RECIST v1.1 criteria. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non target) must have reduction in the short axis to less than (\<) 10 millimeter (mm). PR was defined as At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter (LD)., From the date of first documented response until the date of documented progression or last disease assessment (up to 39 months)|Duration of Stable Disease as Per RECIST v1.1 Criteria, Duration of at least stable disease was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to first documented radiologic evidence of disease recurrence or progression as per RECIST v1.1 Criteria. Participants without evidence of progression were censored at time of last disease assessment. Progressive Disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of measured lesions taking as references the smallest sum of diameters recorded since the treatment started. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Appearance of one or more new lesions also constituted progressive disease., From the date of first dose of study treatment to first documented radiologic evidence of disease recurrence or progression, censored date (up to 39 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Per RECIST v1.1 Criteria, PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first date of Independent Review Committee (IRC)-confirmed PD per RECIST v1.1, or death due to any cause. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (SLD), taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter (SLD) recorded from baseline or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Participants who were last known to be alive and without evidence of progression were censored at time of last disease assessment. If date of progression or death occurred after more than 1 missed disease assessment interval, or 30 days after end of treatment, participants were censored at the time of last evaluable disease assessment prior to the missed assessment., From first dose of study treatment to time of disease progression or death, censored date (up to 39 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from date first dose of study treatment to the date of death. Participants who were still alive prior to the data cutoff for final efficacy analysis, or who dropped out prior to study end, were censored at the day they were last known to be alive., From first dose of study treatment to death, censored date (up to 39 months)|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP was defined as the time from date of first dose of study treatment to first documented evidence of disease recurrence or progression, or death due to disease progression, whichever occurred first. Participants without evidence of progression were censored at time of last evaluable disease assessment., From first dose of study treatment to first documented evidence of disease recurrence or progression, or death, censored date (up to 39 months)|Number of Participants With Growth Modulation Index (GMI) Less Than or Equal to (<=) 1.33 and Greater Than (>) 1.33, GMI was defined as the ratio between the TTP with selinexor and the TTP with the most recent prior treatment. GMI was calculated, using a previously described threshold of 1.3 or greater as a sign of potential drug activity and improved overall survival., Up to 39 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product during the course of a study and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. SAE defined as any AE, occurring at any dose (including after the informed consent form was signed and prior to dosing) that and regardless of causality that: results in death, is life-threatening (participant was at immediate risk of death from event as it occurred), requires in-patient hospitalization (formal admission to a hospital for medical reasons) or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAE was defined as any AE with onset or worsening of a pre-existing condition on or after the first administration of study treatment through 30 days following last dose or any event considered drug-related by the investigator through the end of the study., From screening up to 30 days post last study drug dose (up to 39 months)|Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) by Severity, AE was defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition that occur after participant's signed informed consent obtained. TEAE was defined as any AE with onset or worsening of a pre-existing condition on or after the first administration of study treatment through 28 days following last dose or any event considered drug-related by the investigator through the end of the study. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1: mild, Grade 2: moderate, Grade 3: severe, Grade 4: life-threatening, and Grade 5: death., From screening up to 30 days post last study drug dose (up to 39 months)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities, Number of participants with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities including clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis. Number of participants with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities which were deemed clinically significant by the investigator were reported., From screening up to 30 days post last study drug dose (up to 39 months)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Vital Signs, Vital signs included blood pressure (systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure). Measurements were made after the participant had been resting supine for a minimum of 5 minutes. Clinically significant findings were defined as such in the opinion of the investigator occurring at any time on treatment from normal pre-dose based on the condition met (Yes/No). Number of participants with clinically significant changes in vital signs with condition (Yes) were only reported., From screening up to 30 days post last study drug dose (up to 39 months)|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in Electrocardiogram (ECGs), Twelve lead ECGs were obtained after the participant has rested in a supine position for at least 5 minutes. Clinically significant findings were defined as such in the opinion of the investigator or designated physician occurring at any time on treatment from normal pre-dose., From screening up to 30 days post last study drug dose
