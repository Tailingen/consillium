Safety and Toxicity Study of Vaccination for Advanced Metastatic Melanoma Patients
In this phase I study, the investigators want to vaccine with THERAVAC® (an inactivated toxin coupled to melanoma antigen) some patients with advanced metastatic melanoma disease.

The primary objective is to analyze the safety of the inreasing doses of vaccine.

The secondary objective is to document whether this vaccine can induce tumor regression in immunized patients.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Theravac
To analyze the safety and toxicity of increasing doses of Theravac® in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, The toxicity will be assess after the treatment (3 months) for the first three patients of each group., the first 3 months of treatment|To determine whether these immunizations result in a detectable immune response, PBMC will be obtained from the buffy-coat of 500 ml of venous blood or from 100 ml of venous blood collected before and after immunization., Up to 24 weeks
To document whether this vaccine can induce tumor regression in immunized patients., The NEW RECIST criteria when applicable. For patients with only non-measurable lesion(s) at study entry, tumor response will be assessed descriptively., at week 12
There are three treatment cohorts and the inclusion of patients in governed by the dose-limiting toxicities in the previous cohort.

* the first three patients will receive a dose of 50 µg of Theravac®
* second cohort of three patients will receive a dose of 150 µg Theravac®
* the third cohort of three patients will receive a dose of 250 µg Theravac® and eventually a total of 14 patients will complete the step with the highest dose.

All the patients will receive four immunizations every three weeks in two intradermal sites and in two subcutaneous sites.
