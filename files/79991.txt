Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of NKTR-102 in Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced Ovarian Cancer
This is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm, 2-stage, Phase 2 study of NKTR-102 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

Approximately 70 patients will be randomized 1:1 into one of two treatment arms. NKTR-102 will be administered at a dose level of 145 mg/m\^2 in both arms. In Arm A, NKTR-102 will be given on a q14d schedule. In Arm B, NKTR-102 will be given on a q21d schedule. After the initial 70 patients have been enrolled, Arm B will enroll approximately 110 additional patients.

Primary: Objective Response Rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): Primary Efficacy Population, The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) per RECIST 1.0 based upon the best response as assessed by the Investigator. CR was defined by RECIST 1.1 as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have had reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR was defined by RECIST 1.1 as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD. The analysis was performed for patients in the Primary Efficacy Population., Every 6 weeks (± 5 days) from Cycle 1, Day 1 until documented disease progression, start of new therapy for cancer, death, or end of study (approximately 3 years and 11 months)
Secondary: Best Overall Response by Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Criteria: MITT Population, Best overall response was defined as the proportion of patients with a CR or a PR as assessed per GCIG criteria. The GCIG proposed the following definition for the date of progression which used both the RECIST and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) criteria. "A response according to CA-125 has occurred if there is ≥ 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from a pretreatment sample. The response had to be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days. Patients can be evaluated according to CA-125 only if they had a pretreatment sample that was at least twice the upper limit of normal (ULN) and within 2 weeks prior to starting treatment."
