Carboplatin, Temozolomide, and Filgrastim in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed or Recurrent High-Grade Glioma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining carboplatin, temozolomide, and filgrastim in treating patients who have newly diagnosed or recurrent high-grade glioma.
Brain and Central Nervous System Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: temozolomide
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the response rate in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade glioma treated with temozolomide, carboplatin, and filgrastim (G-CSF).
* Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.
* Determine the rate of tumor progression in patients treated with this regimen.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease category (glioblastoma multiforme vs anaplastic astrocytoma vs several other high-grade mixed gliomas).

Patients receive carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1-2; oral temozolomide every 12 hours on days 1-5; and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV daily starting no earlier than day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 102-222 (17-37 per each of 6 strata) will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
