A Phase 1, Dose-escalation Study of [225Ac]-FPI-2068 in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, non-randomized, multicenter, open-label clinical study designed to investigate the safety, tolerability, dosimetry, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of \[225Ac\]-FPI-2068, \[111In\]-FPI-2107, and FPI-2053 in metastatic and/or recurrent solid tumors (HNSCC, NSCLC, mCRC, PDAC).
Advanced Solid Tumor|Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: FPI-2053|DRUG: [111In]-FPI-2107|DRUG: [225Ac]-FPI-2068
Evaluate safety and tolerability of [111In]-FPI-2107, FPI-2053, and [225Ac]-FPI-2068, • Incidence of Adverse Events and evaluation of dosimetry, Approximately 4 years post final administration|Radiation dose of [111In]-FPI-2107 and [225Ac]-FPI-2068 to whole body, organs, and selected regions of interest., * For Part A, evaluate the impact of pre-dose administration of FPI-2053 on the radiation dosimetry of \[111In\]-FPI-2107 (whole body, organs, and selected regions of interest)
* Estimate the effect of pre-dose administration of FPI-2053 on the radiation dosimetry of \[225Ac\]-FPI-2068 (whole body, organs, and selected regions of interest), Within 56 days of administration|Maximum tolerated dose of [225Ac]-FPI-2068 and FPI-2053, Determine the RP2D of \[225Ac\]-FPI-2068, given with or without FPI-2053, 56 days post administration
Assess preliminary anti-tumor activity of [225Ac]-FPI-2068, • Tumour assessments will be based on RECIST v1.1 (Eisenhauer et al, 2009) and will be performed approximately every 8 weeks (± 1 week) after the first \[225Ac\]-FPI-2068 dose, or as clinically indicated., Approximately 4 years post final administration|Tumor uptake of [111In]-FPI-2107, • Tumor uptake of \[111In\]-FPI-2107 in selected regions of interest on SPECT/CT and/or planar images, Approximately 56 days of final administration|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of [111In]-FPI-2107, and [225Ac]-FPI-2068, by measuring changes in clearance, AUC, Cmax, and half-life., • Determine the plasma concentrations and PK parameters of \[111In\]-FPI-2107, and \[225Ac\]-FPI-2068 and the effect of pre-dose administration of FPI-2053 on the plasma concentrations and PK parameters of \[111In\]-FPI-2107., Approximately 56 days of final administration|To assess the immunogenicity of [111In]-FPI-2107, [225Ac]-FPI-2068, and FPI-2053, • Presence of ADA for \[111In\]-FPI-2107, \[225Ac\]-FPI-2068, and FPI-2053, Approximately 56 days of final administration
The study will be conducted in 2 parts:

Part A: optimization of the FPI-2053 dose (treatment with dose level 1 of \[225Ac\]-FPI-2068 - fixed dose).

Part B: dose escalation of \[225Ac\]-FPI-2068 with optimal FPI-2053. Part B will commence once the optimal dose of FPI-2053 is determined in Part A. The RP2D will be determined from Part B based on all available safety, efficacy, PK, and dosimetry information.
