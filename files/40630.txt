A "Window Trial" on Boswellia for Breast Cancer Primary Tumors
The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral administration of Boswellia causes biological changes in primary tumors of breast cancer patients.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Boswellia
Change in tumor proliferation rate, Change in tumor proliferation rate will be based on Ki67, CD31 and TUNEL assays in biopsies pre and post treatment with boswellia, up to 56 days
Number of adverse events reported, Safety data will be tabulated by type and grade of adverse event and will use CTCAE v. 4.0, up to 84 days|Changes in tumors analyzed through immunohistochemistry, Additional changes in tumors as a result of boswellia intake will be analyzed through immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tumors., up to 56 days
To determine whether oral administration of Boswellia serrata causes biological changes related to angiogenesis (CD31), apoptosis (DNA fragmentation), and cell proliferation (Ki67) in primary tumors of breast cancer patients.
