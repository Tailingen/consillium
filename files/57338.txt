Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of a PARP Inhibitor for the Treatment of BRCA-positive Advanced Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of the study is to see if the drug KU 0059436 is effective and well tolerated in treating patients with measurable BRCA1- or BRCA2-positive advanced ovarian cancer and for whom no curative therapeutic option exists.
Ovarian Neoplasm
DRUG: KU-0059436 (AZD2281)(PARP inhibitor)|DRUG: KU-0059436 (AZD2281)(PARP inhibitor)
Confirmed Objective Tumour Response (According to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease from baseline in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., Baseline, every 8 also at study termination or initiation of confounding anti-cancer therapy.
Clinical Benefit (CB), Clinical Benefit (CB) is defined as the percentage of patients with a RECIST tumour response of confirmed complete response, partial response or stable disease for â‰¥8 weeks), End of study|Duration of Response, Duration of response to olaparib, End of study|Best Percentage Change in Tumour Size, The best % change (reduction) from baseline in tumour size (defined as the sum of the longest diameters as measured among all target lesions)., End of study|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from first dose to the earlier date of radiologic progression (as per RECIST criteria) or death by any cause in the absence of objective progression., End of study
