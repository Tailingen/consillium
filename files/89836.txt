A Study of Poziotinib in Patients With Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) or Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) Activating Mutations in Advanced Malignancies
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study whose principal objectives are to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of poziotinib in five cohorts of 30 previously-treated patients each.
Breast Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Solid Tumor|Glioblastome Multiforme
DRUG: Poziotinib Hydrochloride|DRUG: Loperamide
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) as assessed by the investigator using local radiology evaluation according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have a reduction in the short axis to \<10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR., Up to 168 days
Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of response was defined as the time from the date that measurement criteria are first met for CR or PR until the first subsequent date that progressive disease or death is documented. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have a reduction in the short axis to \<10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. Disease progression (PD) is defined as â‰¥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, unequivocal progression in non-target lesions, and/or appearance of new lesions., Up to 168 days|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as percentage of participants with best response of CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) from the first dose of poziotinib to the end of study. CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter (LD) since the treatment started., Up to 168 days|Percentage of Participants With AE, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product., Up to 30 days after last dose of study drug (Up to 199 days)
The Screening period (Day -30 to Day 1) begins 30 days prior to poziotinib treatment on Day 1 of Cycle 1. Patients must meet all Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria and provide informed written consent prior to study procedures.

The duration of each treatment cycle is 28 days. There will be five patient cohorts. Eligible patients will be enrolled into cohorts concurrently based on EGFR or HER2 exon 20 mutation status.

* Cohort 1: HER2-positive or HER2-negative breast cancer (BC) with a HER2 activating mutation.
* Cohort 2: Colorectal cancer (CRC) with a HER2 activating mutation.
* Cohort 3: Any solid cancer, except non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BC, or CRC with a HER2 activating mutation.
* Cohort 4: Glioblastome multiforma (GBM) with an EGFR activating mutation.
* Cohort 5: Any solid cancer, except NSCLC or GBM with an EGFR activating mutation.

All patients will be treated daily for up to 24 months unless there is disease progression, death, intolerable adverse events (AEs), or another protocol-specified reason for patient withdrawal. After treatment discontinuation, patients will be contacted every 3 months for up to 2 years after the first dose of poziotinib to assess survival.
