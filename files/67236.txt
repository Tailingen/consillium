Identification of the Pathogenetic Mechanisms Underlying Squamous Cell Carcinomas
This is a multicentric, retrospective, and prospective biomarker study.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck|Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Anus
OTHER: Multiparameter analysis of each sample
Primary Endpoint, Identify shared molecular profiles in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the mucosa of the anogenital tract and head-neck region, dependent on the presence of somatic mutations (e.g., TERT promoter mutations and viral HPV sequences)., 30 months
Secondary Endpoint, Inhibition of growth in organoids obtained from tumor cells mutated in the TERT promoter or expressing viral oncogenes and SIRT1., 30 months
This is a multicentric, retrospective, and prospective biomarker study, involving a total of 170 patients with SCC (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) of the mucosa of the anogenital tract and head-neck region, recruited from INT-NA (n=50), UPO (n=40), AOUP (n=40), and ITB (n=40). Specifically, retrospective and prospective samples will be collected and analyzed for the study of molecular and viral biomarkers. Simultaneously, fibroblastic tumor-associated cells (CAFs) will be isolated from prospective samples. Through co-cultivation with immortalized cell lines derived from anogenital and head-neck SCCs, these CAFs will enable the production of 3D organoids for use in experiments assessing the response to telomerase and deacetylase SIRT1 inhibitors, both in vitro and in preclinical models.
