Clinical and Multiomics Study of First-line Chemotherapy for Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The early symptoms of pancreatic cancer are not obvious, and the early diagnosis rate is low. For most patients with pancreatic cancer,palliative chemotherapy is the only choice .At present, The guidance of NCCN guidelines on the selection of chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is only based on the physical condition(the ECOG score), which is one of the important reasons for the poor efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.Therefore, it is urgent to group pancreatic cancer patients according to tumor molecular typing and heterogeneity of response to chemotherapy drugs accurately,so as to guide the personalized treatment of patients.
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma, PDAC
Accuracy of using the model to predict the therapeutic effect of drugs, The difference of progression free survival (PFS), 1.5 years
Efficacy evaluation of solid tumor, disease control rate (DCR), 1.5 years|the quality of participants'life, According to the European Organization for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) quality of life core scale EORTC QLQ-C30 (V3.0 Chinese version)ï¼Œevaluating the quality of life (QOL), 1.5 years
Based on the limitations of existing studies and the needs of clinical patients, the investigators chose two time points: after the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer (before the first-line chemotherapy), and after chemotherapy evaluation in this study, to obtain in situ samples of pancreatic cancer tissues by EUS-FNA.The samples are detected by dynamic multi-omics study before and after treatment(including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metagenomics, etc.).Combined with the drug reaction and clinical outcome of patients, a comprehensive model is established to predict the clinical outcome of patients with PDAC and the choice of chemotherapy regimens, so as to screen the pancreatic cancer patients who are most likely to benefit from different chemotherapy regimens, and lay the foundation for the development of individual chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer.
