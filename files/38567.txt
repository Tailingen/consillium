Kinetics and Impact on Survival of MRD in AML Patients Receiving Azacitidine and Venetoclax
The goal of this no-profit, multicenter, biological, non-pharmacologic study is to evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients treated with Azacitidine and Venetoclax according to clinical practice.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

1. kinetics of disease response on treatment with Azacitidine and Venetoclax through the evaluation of MRD with both cytofluorimetric and molecular techniques
2. impact of MRD on survival outcomes. To this end, bone marrow samples will be collected at pre-defined time-points during treatment and MRD will be assessed.
AML, Adult|Minimal Residual Disease
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: MRD assessment
Rate of MRD-negative patients within cycle 4, Number of patients without minimal residual disease within cycle 4 on the total of subjects receiving at least one dose of study medication, 4 months
This is a multicentric biological study at evaluating MRD kinetics during treatment with Azacitidine and Venetoclax as well as the impact of MRD on survival outcomes.

Newly diagnosed, previously untreated, patients with AML, including de novo, secondary and therapy-related, receiving front-line therapy with Azacitidine and Venetoclax according to clinical practice will be included.

Response assessment will be performed on BM aspirate according to ELN2022 response criteria. MRD evaluation will be performed on BM at pre-defined time-points during treatment. MRD assessment will be performed centrally in order to harmonize response evaluation.
