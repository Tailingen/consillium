Identification by Transcriptomic Approach of New Prognostic and Predictive Markers in a Cohort of Atypical Meningiomas
Determine by a transcriptomic approach new prognostic and predictive markers in atypical meningiomas (WHO grade II).

Retrospective observational study, on a cohort of 85 atypical meningiomas. Transcriptomic study first, on cryopreserved tumor samples. Then identify, thanks to the transcriptomic study, prognostic and predictive factors (study of the link between the quantity of certain RNA transcripts and progression-free survival). Finally, set up immunohistochemical applications, which can be used routinely by the pathologist.
