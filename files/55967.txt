APL-101 Study of Subjects With NSCLC With c-Met EXON 14 Skip Mutations and c-Met Dysregulation Advanced Solid Tumors
To assess:

* efficacy of APL-101 as monotherapy for the treatment of NSCLC harboring MET Exon 14 skipping mutations, NSCLC harboring MET amplification, solid tumors harboring MET amplification, solid tumors harboring MET fusion, primary CNS tumors harboring MET alterations, solid tumors harboring wild-type MET with overexpression of HGF and MET
* efficacy of APL-101 as an add-on therapy to EGFR inhibitor for the treatment of NSCLC harboring EGFR activating mutations and developed acquired resistance with MET amplification and disease progression after documented CR or PR with 1st line EGFR inhibitors (EGFR-I)

Phase 1 (lead-in stage of this study) enrollment has been completed.

In this Phase 2 study, efficacy, safety, and tolerability will be assessed in the following cohorts:

* Cohort A-1: NSCLC EXON 14 skip mutation, previously untreated, MET inhibitor naive (c-Met naïve, 1L)
* Cohort A-2: NSCLC EXON 14 skip mutation, previously treated with ≤ 3 prior lines in unresectable or metastatic setting, MET inhibitor naive (c-Met naïve, 2/3L)
* Cohort B: NSCLC EXON 14 skip mutation, previously treated with ≤ 3 prior lines in unresectable or metastatic setting, MET inhibitor experienced (c-Met experienced; progressed on prior c-Met inhibitor)
* Cohort C: basket of tumor types (e.g., NSCLC, upper gastrointestinal \[GI\], colorectal, hepatobiliary cancer) harboring MET amplification except for primary CNS tumors, previously treated or previously untreated but refused standard treatment, or if treatment was unavailable or unfeasible (≤ 3 prior lines in unresectable or metastatic setting), MET inhibitor naïve
* Cohort C-1: NSCLC harboring MET amplification and wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), previously treated; or untreated but refused standard treatment, or if treatment was unavailable or unfeasible (≤ 3 prior lines in unresectable or metastatic setting), MET inhibitor naïve
* Cohort C-2: EGFR positive NSCLC harboring MET amplification as an acquired resistance, documented response with first-line EGFR-Inhibitor (PR or CR per RECIST ≥ 12 weeks), radiological documentation of disease progression per RECIST on first-line EGFR inhibitor therapy, MET inhibitor naïve
* Cohort D: basket of tumor types except for primary CNS tumors harboring MET gene fusions (e.g., NSCLC, upper GI, colorectal, hepatobiliary cancer), previously treated; or previously untreated but refused standard treatment, or if treatment was unavailable or unfeasible (≤ 3 prior lines in unresectable or metastatic setting), MET inhibitor naïve
* Cohort E: primary CNS tumors with MET alterations (single or co-occurred MET fusion including PTPRZ1-MET \[ZM\] fusion, MET Exon 14 skipping mutation, or MET amplification), previously treated or previously untreated but refused standard treatment, or if treatment was unavailable or unfeasible (≤ 3 prior lines), MET inhibitor naïve
* Cohort F: basket of tumor types harboring wild-type MET with over-expression of HGF and MET (e.g., NSCLC, upper GI, colorectal, hepatobiliary cancer or primary CNS tumors), previously treated; or previously untreated but refused standard treatment, or if treatment was unavailable or unfeasible (≤ 3 prior lines in unresectable or metastatic setting), MET inhibitor naïve
