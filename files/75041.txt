Study to Assess the Long-term Safety and Efficacy of Tirabrutinib in Adults With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies
The primary objective of this study is to determine the long-term safety and tolerability of tirabrutinib in adults with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancy who have tolerated and achieved stable disease or improved with tirabrutinib treatment while enrolled in a prior (parent study) tirabrutinib study (NCT01659255). The dosing regimen will be based on the prior dosing regimen from the parent study.
Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies
DRUG: Tirabrutinib
Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs), Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as one or both of the following:

* Any AEs with an onset date on or after the study drug start date of parent study and no later than 30 days after permanent discontinuation of study drug in this rollover study;
* Any AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug., First dose of tirabrutinib up to 36 months in the parent study and up to 61 months in the rollover study|Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Treatment-Emergent Marked Laboratory Abnormalities, Treatment-emergent marked laboratory abnormalities were defined as values that increase from baseline by at least 3 toxicity grades at any postbaseline time point, up to and including the date of the last dose of study drug plus 30. If the relevant baseline laboratory value is missing, any Grade 3 or 4 values observed within the timeframe specified above will be considered treatment-emergent marked abnormalities. Laboratory assessments included tests for Chemistry, Hematology, Coagulation and Urinalysis., First dose of tirabrutinib up to 36 months in the parent study and up to 61 months in the rollover study
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined per Modified International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 2008 criteria for CLL and Cheson, 2007 criteria for NHL as percentage of participants who achieve partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) in either parent or roll-over study. CLL:CR: lymphocytes (Ly) \<4\*10\^9/L, no lymphadenopathy,normal spleen and liver size,absence of disease, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>1.5\*10\^9/L,platelets ≥100\*10\^9/L, hemoglobin (Hb) \>110 g/L,bone marrow at least normocellular for age; PR: ≥2 of these: ≥50% decrease in Ly, lymphadenopathy,size of liver and spleen, bone marrow infiltrates;and ≥1 of these: ANC \>1500/μL, platelets ≥100,000/µL, Hb \>11g/dL. NHL:CR: complete resolution of all disease-related radiological abnormalities; PR: ≥50% reduction in sum of products (SPD) of the longest diameters (LD) of all index lesions,no new lesions;no increase in size of liver or spleen;persistence of bone marrow involvement in participant who meets other criteria for CR., Up to 39 months in parent study and up to 60 months in rollover study|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR was defined per IWCLL 2008 criteria for CLL and Cheson, 2007 criteria for NHL as the interval from first documentation of CR or PR to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression as assessed by the investigator, or death from any cause in subjects who achieve a response. CLL:CR: Ly \<4\*10\^9/L, no lymphadenopathy, normal spleen and liver size, absence of disease, ANC \>1.5\*10\^9/L, platelets ≥100\*10\^9/L, Hb \>110 g/L, bone marrow at least normocellular for age; PR: ≥2 of these: ≥50% decrease in Ly, lymphadenopathy, size of liver and spleen, bone marrow infiltrates; and ≥1 of these: ANC \>1500/μL, platelets ≥100,000/µL, Hb \>11 g/dL. NHL:CR: complete resolution of all disease-related radiological abnormalities; PR: ≥50% reduction in SPD of the LD of all index lesions, no new lesions; no increase in size of liver or spleen; persistence of bone marrow involvement in participant who meets other criteria for CR., From first documentation of CR or PR to the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause up to 39 months in parent study and up to 60 months in the rollover study|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined per IWCLL 2008 criteria for CLL and Cheson 2007 criteria for NHL as the interval from date of the first dose of tirabrutinib on the parent study to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression as assessed by the investigator, or death from any cause.

Progressive disease (PD) in CLL: Lymphadenopathy, or appearance of any new lesion/organomegaly, \> 50% increase in the size of the liver and/or spleen, Decrease in platelet count or hemoglobin attributable to CLL per IWCLL, Transformation to a more aggressive histology (eg, Richter syndrome).

PD in NHL: Cheson, 2007: Appearance of new lesion or increase by \>50% of previously involved sites from nadir, Transformation to a more aggressive NHL histology., From first dose of tirabrutinib in the parent study (NCT01659255) to the first documentation of disease progression or death from any cause up to 99 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval from date of the first dose of tirabrutinib on the parent study until death from any cause., From first dose of tirabrutinib in the parent study (NCT01659255) until death from any cause up to 99 months
