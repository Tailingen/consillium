DRUG: sintilimab+metronomic PLOF
Percentage of participants with no residual surviving tumor cells in resection specimens and lymph nodes, Pathological complete response rate (pCR), defined as the proportion of participants with no residual viable tumor cells on microscopy and negative lymph nodes as a percentage of all participants. We will evaluate pathological complete response rate of primary tumor and locally metastatic lymph nodes after 6 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy., up to 6 weeks after first dosing|Percentage of participants with ≤10% tumor cell survival in resection specimens, Major pathologic response (MPR) rate, defined as the proportion of participants with ≤10% surviving tumor cells in the resection specimen as a percentage of all participants. We will evaluate major pathological response rate of primary tumor and locally metastatic lymph nodes after 6 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy., up to 6 weeks after first dosing
Percentage of participants achieving complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) after treatment, Objective remission rate (ORR), the percentage of participants whose tumors shrink by a certain amount and remain there for a certain period of time, including complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR). CR (Complete remission): Complete disappearance of the target lesion, with no new lesions produced, and lasting for more than 4 weeks. PR (Partial remission): the sum of the largest diameters of the target lesions is reduced by more than 30%, and lasts for more than 4 weeks., 2 to 6weeks after the end of treatment|Percentage of participants achieving remission (PR+CR) and lesion stabilization (SD) after treatment, Disease control rate (DCR) is the percentage of participants who achieve remission (PR+CR) and stabilization of lesions (SD) after the treatment. Stable disease (SD) means that the sum of the largest diameters of the tumor lesions has not shrunk to PR, or has not enlarged to PD., 2 to 6weeks after the end of treatment|2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate, Percentage of participants who survived or were free of tumor progression from enrollment to the second year of follow-up., From enrollment to study completion, assessed up to 2 years|3-year overall-survival (OS) rate, Percentage of participants who survived from enrollment to the third year of follow-up., From enrollment to study completion, assessed up to 3 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by NCI-CTC, Toxicity deaths and early withdrawal from treatment due to toxic effects will be described. Toxicity assessment of adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) using the NCI-CTC., From enrollment to study completion, assessed up to 3 years
Number of immune cells in peripheral blood, Peripheral blood will be analyzed for the number of immune cells after applying flow cytometry and mRNA sequencing., From enrollment to study completion, assessed up to 3 years|Proportion of immune cells in peripheral blood, Peripheral blood will be analyzed for the proportion of immune cells after applying flow cytometry and mRNA sequencing., From enrollment to study completion, assessed up to 3 years|Number of immune cells in tumor tissues, Apply mRNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to analyze the number of immune cells in tumor tissues, including CTL, Treg, DC, TAM, MDSC, NK, NKT and so on., From enrollment to study completion, assessed up to 3 years|Distribution of immune cells in tumor tissue, Apply mRNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to analyze the distribution of immune cells in tumor tissues, including CTL, Treg, DC, TAM, MDSC, NK, NKT and so on., From enrollment to study completion, assessed up to 3 years
This is a single-arm clinical study to enroll 50 patients with gastric cancer (cTNM diagnosis of cT3-4aN1-3M0). Each enrolled patient will be assigned a case number. Both this case number and the patient's initials will be entered on each page of the case report form.

Enrolled patients receive a neoadjuvant regimen of POLF in combination with sindilizumab: preoperatively, they receive a POLF regimen (paclitaxel 60 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2, and 5-fluorouracil 425 mg/m2) administered once weekly for a total of 6 doses, and in combination with sindilizumab 200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for a total of 2 doses. Upon completion of the evaluation, patients whose tumors were judged to be resectable underwent radical surgery and received six postoperative doses of the POLF regimen and two doses of Sindilizumab as adjuvant therapy.

Postoperative imaging evaluations will be performed every three months until disease recurrence. Survival follow-up was performed every three months after disease recurrence. Patients will receive neoadjuvant therapy for 6 weeks preoperatively and adjuvant therapy for 6 weeks postoperatively unless intolerable toxicity occurs, the patient refuses to continue treatment, or treatment is delayed beyond 3 weeks. Patients will be under study observation during treatment and 30 days after treatment termination, and will receive long-term follow-up for 5 years postoperatively. Ultimately, pCR and MPR will be the primary study endpoints, and ORR, DCR, 2-year PFS rate, 3-year OS rate and safety will be the secondary study endpoints to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the neoadjuvant regimen of POLF combined with sindilizumab, as well as to explore the immune activation effect and mechanism of the regimen using peripheral blood and tumor tissue samples.
