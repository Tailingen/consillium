This study was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label clinical trial. The study included a screening period (within 21 days after signing the informed consent form to the first treatment), a treatment period (including total neoadjuvant and surgical treatment), and a follow-up period (including safety and survival follow-up).

Total neoadjuvant therapy:

* Short-course radiotherapy followed by 6 cycles of fuquinitinib combined with adbelimumab and CAPOX followed by surgical resection after 1 week of rest;
* A treatment time window of ±3 days was allowed during the study treatment, but within 3 days before each treatment, in addition to the required imaging examinations, participants were required to complete laboratory tests, physical examinations (as needed), ECOG scores and other safety assessments to determine that they could still tolerate the study treatment. The safety of the subjects was continuously assessed during the study.
* Total Mesorectal Excision (TME) is recommended for radical resection of rectal cancer.
