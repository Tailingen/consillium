Treatment of Metastatic Vulvar Carcinoma With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel Chemotherapy
Vulvar cancer is a rare malignancy. Surgery is the treatment of choice, but frequently causes invalidating and chronic postoperative morbidity, especially in patients with high stage disease. Theoretically, downstaging with neo adjuvant chemotherapy could shrink the tumour, making surgical treatment less extensive thereby diminishing the chance for morbidity.
