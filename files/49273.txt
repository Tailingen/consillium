Sutent Following Chemotherapy, Radiation and Surgery For Resectable Esophageal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to see whether or not the combination of cisplatin, irinotecan and radiation, followed by surgery, followed by oral Sutent, is effective and safe for patients with resectable esophageal cancer.

Survival outcomes for resectable esophageal cancer remain poor. Current data strongly support an adjuvant systemic strategy to improve time to progression and survival in this patient population. Adding a well-tolerated oral targeted therapy such as Sutent, after a combined chemo/radiation/surgery approach in this patient population has the potential to impact on the minimal residual disease left behind by relatively effective pre-operative chemoradiation and surgery. This has the potential to improve survival. The primary endpoint is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of adjuvant Sutent therapy (SU11248) after concurrent neoadjuvant therapy with irinotecan, cisplatin, external beam conformal radiotherapy plus surgery for potential resectable esophageal cancer. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that Sutent will have activity in esophageal cancer, as the results of Sutent activity in solid tumors appear to be superior to the results of other antiangiogenic compounds in development for esophageal cancer. Therefore, by extrapolation from promising phase I, II and III Sutent trials we propose to translate the target effects achieved with Sutent to reduce local and systemic therapy failure, and thus metastasis in esophageal cancer.
