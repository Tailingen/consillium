LBH589 (Panobinostat) for the Treatment of Myelofibrosis
LBH589 is an oral drug that targets the myelofibrosis cells in the bone marrow and induces cell death by allowing for the expression of certain suppressed genes that are important in regulating cell survival. Based on laboratory studies, the hypothesis is that this drug will selectively kill the stem cells responsible for causing myelofibrosis and result in reduction in spleen size and ultimately restoration of normal bone marrow function.
