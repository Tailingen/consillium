Chemotherapy Resistance in Osteogenic Sarcoma and Other Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to investigate tumors in the laboratory to determine how and why they respond, or fail to respond to different drug therapies. This study will also investigate why high pressure develops within tumors and how this affects how well drugs work. We will also take blood samples before and/or after your procedure to measure biochemical factors that may help us predict the behavior of osteogenic sarcoma and other solid tumors.
Osteosarcoma
OTHER: Tissue Procurement
To test tumor samples obtained from patients with primary or secondary bone cancer for mechanisms of acquired and intrinsic resistance to methotrexate and to relate these findings to histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy and outcome., 2 years
To attempt to grow these tumor cells in short term culture to test the sensitivity of these cells to chemotherapeutic agents and to correlate cytotoxicity with biochemical and molecular studies., 2 years
When tumor tissue known or presumed to be a primary or secondary bone cancer or solid tumor with known elevated intra-tumoral pressure such as retinoblastoma is being removed or has been removed for diagnostic or therapeutic reasons a small sample of it will be obtained for this study. The tumor samples will be used to study in vitro, determinants of chemotherapy resistance and oncogenesis. These determinants will be correlated with histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy and clinical outcome (event free survival). In addition, blood samples (20ml) may be obtained before or after the procedure.
