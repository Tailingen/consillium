GAPVAC Phase I Trial in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, feasibility and biological activity (immunogenicity) of the actively personalized vaccination (APVAC) concept in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GB) patients.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: APVAC1 vaccine plus Poly-ICLC and GM-CSF|DRUG: APVAC2 vaccine plus Poly-ICLC and GM-CSF
Safety profile of patient-tailored APVAC vaccines when administered with immunomodulators concurrent to maintenance TMZ cycles, Number of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and percentage of patients with AEs and SAEs (listed per grade and MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ) preferred terms) will be reported., Continously for about 40 weeks plus follow-up|Frequency of CD8 T cells specific for vaccinated APVAC peptides as measure of immunological response to and biological activity of the vaccine, To analyze whether vaccinations with APVAC drug products plus poly-ICLC and GM-CSF induce immune responses in the patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be analyzed for the presence and functionality of T cells recognizing the peptides vaccinated within the individualized APVACs.

* Immunogenicity rate: Number of vaccine induced T-cell responses normalized to the number of peptides vaccinated.
* Immune responder rate: Number of patients with at least one vaccine induced T-cell response
* Multi-TUMAP responder rate: Number of patients with at least two vaccine induced T-cell response
* Average number of immune responses per patient, Till 17 weeks of vaccination
Frequency of immune cell populations in the blood and concentrations of a large panel of serum and plasma proteins with immunological relevance as a measure of the immune status of the patient, Putatively predictive for immunological response and/or associated with clinical success or failure. Analyzed biomarkers may include non-cellular parameters measured from tumor, plasma or serum, and cellular parameters measured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), leukapheresis samples or isolated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)., Up to 10 months|Overall survival, Median OS, the survival rate at one and at two years will be reported, 2018 (estimated)|Progression-free survival, Median progression free survival (PFS) and PFS rates at 6 months will be described for patients in the safety and per protocol populations, At 6 months
This is a multicenter, open-label, single arm, first-in-man phase I trial to investigate the safety, feasibility and immunogenicity of the novel APVAC approach in patients with newly diagnosed GB.

Primary Endpoints:

* Safety: Determine the safety and tolerability profile of patient-tailored APVAC vaccines when administered with immunomodulators concurrent to maintenance temozolomide (TMZ) cycles.
* Feasibility: Determine duration and success rates for APVAC1 and APVAC2 processes and for vaccinations with APVAC drug products.
* Biological activity: Descriptive analysis of induced T-cell responses after vaccinations with APVAC1 and APVAC2 drug products plus immunomodulators.

Secondary Study Objectives:

* Identification of biomarkers putatively predictive for immunological response and/or associated with clinical success or failure. Analyzed biomarkers may include non-cellular parameters measured from tumor, plasma or serum, and cellular parameters measured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), leukapheresis samples or isolated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
* Description of potential clinical activity of the APVAC drug products. Descriptive analysis of clinical outcome in patients will be reported including OS and PFS. Correlation analysis of these parameters with immune response data may provide first hints on clinical activity of the vaccine.

After the standard chemoradiotherapy with TMZ has been completed and as soon as the start of the first maintenance TMZ cycle the vaccination phase begins. It starts with the first APVAC1 vaccination, followed by additional APVAC2 vaccinations at a later time point and ends with the Last Endpoint Evaluation Visit (LEEV) of a patient.

Single vaccinations with APVAC vaccines consist of an intradermal (i.d.) injection of the personalized APVAC drug product into the skin of the thigh, shoulder or abdomen followed by subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of 1.5 mg poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®) in close proximity to the vaccination site. The second immunomodulator GM-CSF (75 μg) will be applied i.d. to the APVAC vaccination site 10-30 min before injection of the APVACs.
