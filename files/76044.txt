Brentuximab Vedotin in the Elderly Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients at First Relapse or With Primary Refractory Disease.
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BV as a single agent in elderly patients at first relapse or with primary refractory HL.

BV will be administered as a single IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Measures of anti-cancer activity will be assessed using the revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma (Cheson et al. 2007).

Computed tomography (CT) scans (chest, neck, abdomen, and pelvis) will be performed at baseline and Cycles 4, 8, 12, and 16 and positron emission tomography (PET) scans will be done at baseline and Cycles 4, 8, 12 and 16. Patients will have an End of Treatment (EOT) assessment 30 ± 7 days after receiving their final dose of study drug. Long-term follow-up assessments (including survival and disease status information) will be performed every 12 weeks until either patient death or study closure, whichever occurs first. Patients who discontinue study treatment with stable disease or better will have CT scans done every 12 weeks until disease progression.

Study Objectives

Primary:

• To determine the antitumor efficacy of single-agent brentuximab vedotin (BV) (1.8 mg/kg administered intravenously every 3 weeks) as measured by the overall objective response rate in elderly patients at first relapse or with primary refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

Secondary:

* To assess duration of tumor control, including duration of response and progression-free survival
* To assess survival
* To assess the safety and tolerability of BV

Additional:

• To assess disease-related symptoms Study Population Eligible patients are those with first relapsed or primary refractory elderly HL. Patients must also have histologically-confirmed CD30-positive disease, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid and measurable disease of at least 1.5 cm, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate hematologic, kidney, and liver function. Eligible patients must not previously have been treated with BV, patients must not have congestive heart failure, known cerebral/meningeal disease, or any active viral, bacterial, or fungal infection requiring treatment with antimicrobial therapy within 2 weeks prior to first study dose.
