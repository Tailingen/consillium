Detection in Peripheral Blood of Circulating Tumor Cells in Patient With Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The dissemination of individual tumor cells is a common phenomenon in solid cancers. Detection of tumor cells in peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTC) in nonmetastatic situation is of high prognostic significance.

The objective of our study was to detect circulating tumor cells in two different method in patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma .
Head and Neck Cancer
OTHER: Circulating Tumor Cells
Circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood during head and neck surgery, The number of circulating tumor cells detected per milliliter of peripheral blood will be evaluated on the day before, the day of surgery and 7 days after the surgery., 7 days
Comparison between RT-PCR and CellSearch™ method, The comparison between RT-PCR and CellSearch™ method will be the positivity sample rate, 1 day|Prognostic marker of relapse, Local recurrence, regional or metastatic head and neck cancer in the two years, 2 years
