Nintedanib Plus Docetaxel in Japanese Patients With Adenocarcinoma Subtype Non-small Cell Lung Cancer After Failure of First Line Chemotherapy
To determine the appropriateness of the dose of nintedanib 200 mg b.i.d. plus docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as starting dose by evaluating the safety in Japanese patients with body surface area (BSA) \<1.5 m2 and locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma subtype non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure of first line platinum- based chemotherapy
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Nintedanib|DRUG: Docetaxel
Number of Patients Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in Cycle 1, DLT was defined as any of the following study drug related adverse events (AEs):

* Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade ≥ 3 non-haematological toxicity except transient electrolyte abnormality and isolated increase of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT); gastrointestinal toxicity, despite adequate supportive care
* CTCAE grade 4 haematological toxicity; Neutrophil count decreased or white blood cell count (not associated with fever) for \>7 days despite adequate supportive treatment
* CTCAE grade 4 febrile neutropenia with fever ≥38.5 degrees
* CTCAE grade ≥2 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase in conjunction with CTCAE grade ≥2 total bilirubin increase
* Inability to resume nintedanib dosing within 14 days after stopping Investigators judged clinically as DLT after dose reduction and severity medically notable (CTCAE, version 3). Sponsor with safety review committee was allowed to confirm the adequacy of this judgment., Cycle 1, from first administration of study medication up to 21 days thereafter.
Maximum Measured Concentration (Cmax) of Nintedanib, This outcome measure presents the maximum measured concentration (Cmax) of nintedanib in plasma in cycle 1., At 23:55 hours (h) after the first dose of docetaxel (which is 5 minutes prior to first dose of nintedanib) and at 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 34 and 47:55 h after first drug administration of docetaxel in cycle 1.|Cmax of Docetaxel, This outcome measure presents the Cmax of docetaxel in plasma in cycles 1 and 2., just before administration of docetaxel administration -0:05 hours (h), at the end of infusion (1:00), and at timepoints after the first dose of docetaxel 1:30 h, 2, 3, 4, 7, 23:55, 47:55 h in cycle 1 and 2 (if administered)|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve of Nintedanib Over the Time Interval From 0 to Time of the Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUC0-tz), This outcome measure presents the area under the concentration-time curve of nintedanib over the time interval from 0 to time of the last quantifiable concentration in plasma (AUC0-tz) in cycle 1., At 23:55 hours (h) after the first dose of docetaxel (which is 5 minutes prior to first dose of nintedanib) and at 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 34 and 47:55 after first drug administration of docetaxel in cycle 1.|AUC0-tz of Docetaxel, This outcome measure presents AUC0-tz of docetaxel in plasma in cycles 1 and 2., just before administration of docetaxel administration -0:05 hours (h), at the end of infusion (1:00), and at timepoints after the first dose of docetaxel 1:30 h, 2, 3, 4, 7, 23:55, 47:55 h in cycle 1 and 2 (if administered)|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve of Nintedanib Over the Time Interval From 0 Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-infinity), This outcome measure presents the Area under the concentration-time curve of nintedanib over the time interval from 0 extrapolated to infinity in plasma (AUC0-infinity) in cycle 1., at 23:55 hours (h) after the first dose of docetaxel (which is 5 minutes prior to first dose of nintedanib) and at 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 34 and 47:55 h after first drug administration of docetaxel in cycle 1.|AUC0-infinity of Docetaxel, This outcome measure presents the AUC0-infinity of docetaxel in plasma in cycles 1 and 2., just before administration of docetaxel administration -0:05 hours (h), at the end of infusion (1:00), and at timepoints after the first dose of docetaxel 1:30 h, 2, 3, 4, 7, 23:55, 47:55 h in cycle 1 and 2 (if administered)
