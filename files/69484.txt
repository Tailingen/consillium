Target Therapies Resistance Molecular Profiling in Patients With Neoplastic Disease
The main purpose of this study is to define the molecular profile of selected solid tumors. From each participants will be collected biological materials for molecular analysis, including saliva, blood and vital tumor tissue derived form surgical or biopsy procedures. Whereas possible, vital tumor specimens will be inoculated and propagated in immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice to study the genetic correlations between genetic status and response to target drugs.
Solid Tumors
number of patient correctly sampled, number of patients with biological samples idoneous for molecular profiling testing (nucleic acid extraction, protein) over all recruited patients., through study completion, an average of five years
number of patients with detected genetic alterations that respond to treatments assigned by physician., through study completion, an average of five years
