Bone Marrow and Blood Samples From Patients With Metastatic Choroid Melanoma
RATIONALE: Studying samples of bone marrow and blood from patients with cancer may help doctors find out the extent of disease.

PURPOSE: This research study is collecting bone marrow and blood samples from patients with metastatic choroid melanoma.
Intraocular Melanoma
GENETIC: gene expression analysis|GENETIC: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Detection of micro-metastatic cells in 20 x 10^6 nucleated cells
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Develop and validate a method of detecting tumor cells in the bone marrow and blood in patients with metastatic choroid melanoma.

OUTLINE: While patients are under general anesthesia for standard treatment of their disease, samples of bone marrow from the iliac crest and blood are collected. Samples are analyzed for the expression of tyrosinase and Melan-a via RT-PCR.
