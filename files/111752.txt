Preliminary Longitudinal Validation of Biomarkers Predictive of Barrett's Esophagus
Barrett's esophagus can progress to esophageal cancer, but it doesn't always. Current treatment is frequent surveillance via upper endoscopy with multiple biopsies to look for changes (dysplasia). Pathologists vary dramatically in their interpretation of Barrett's Metaplasia versus dysplasia and consensus is very difficult to achieve. The investigators propose a longitudinal study of subjects with confirmed Barrett's intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia to look for predictive factors for transformation to dysplasia or cancer. Potential biomarkers can be found in serum, plasma, urine, frozen or fixed Barrett's and Normal esophageal mucosa. In addition, the investigators are testing a brushing technique from CDx, Inc. for predictive factors. Subjects must have pathologically confirmed Barrett's intestinal metaplasia without history of dysplasia to be on this longitudinal study.
