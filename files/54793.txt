A Comparison of DOX-SL Versus Adriamycin Plus Bleomycin Plus Vincristine in the Treatment of Severe AIDS-Related Kaposi's Sarcoma
To determine the efficacy of Stealth liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX-SL) in the treatment of severe AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) by comparison with the established therapy ABV: Adriamycin (doxorubicin)/bleomycin/vincristine. To evaluate the safety and tolerance of DOX-SL compared to ABV in a population of AIDS patients with severe KS.
Sarcoma, Kaposi|HIV Infections
DRUG: Doxorubicin hydrochloride (liposomal)|DRUG: Bleomycin sulfate|DRUG: Vincristine sulfate|DRUG: Doxorubicin hydrochloride
Patients are randomized to receive either DOX-SL or the ABV combination. Infusions are given on day 1 and every 2 weeks for a total of six cycles. Kaposi's sarcoma lesions are evaluated prior to every cycle, at the end of the last treatment cycle, and 4 weeks following the end of the last treatment. Patients must agree to have one or more representative KS lesions biopsied.
