A Study of Adding Apalutamide to Radiotherapy and LHRH Agonist in High-Risk Patients With Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer
The main purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of apalutamide to radiotherapy (RT) plus luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa) delays metastatic progression as assessed by prostate specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) or death compared with RT plus LHRHa alone.

Prostate specific Membrane Antigen-Positron Emission Tomography (PSMA-PET) Metastatic Progression-free Survival (ppMPFS), ppMPFS is defined as the appearance of at least one new PSMA-PET-positive distant lesion compared with the previous scan as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) or death., Up to 9 years
Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomization to the date of first documentation of PSA progression. PSA progression is defined as a PSA concentration above the nadir of more than 0.5 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL), confirmed by additional measurement at least 3 Weeks later., Up to 9 years|PSA Response Rate, PSA response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a PSA decrease of \>= 50 percent (%), \>= 90% or undetectable from baseline., Up to 9 years|PSA Levels at Week 26, PSA levels at week 26 will be reported., Week 26|Time to Loco-Regional Progression by PSMA-PET, Time to loco-regional progression by PSMA-PET as assessed by blinded independent central review (BCIR) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first occurrence of PSMA-PET loco-regional progression. Criteria for PSMA-PET loco-regional progression: Appearance of at least one new PSMA-PET-positive loco-regional lesion compared with the previous scan., Up to 9 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization to date of death from any cause., Up to 9 years|Prostate Cancer-Specific Survival, Prostate cancer-specific survival is defined as the time from randomization to date of death due to prostate cancer., Up to 9 years|Number of Participants With Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study vaccine. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An SAE is any AE that results in: death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect and is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product., Up to 9 years
