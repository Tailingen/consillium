An Evaluation of Maintenance Therapy Combination Mirvetuximab Soravtansine and Olaparib
The Principal Investigator hypothesizes the combination of MIRV and Olaparib is an effective, and tolerable, maintenance therapy strategy in platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.
Ovary Cancer|Peritoneal Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer
DRUG: Mirvetuximab Soravtansine|DRUG: Olaparib
To measure progression free survival (PFS) with the use of MIRV combined with Olaparib in women with recurrent platinum sensitive ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube cancer., PFS will be defined as the time from first dose of MIRV and Olaparib until investigator-assessed radiologic PD or death, whichever occurs first, Through study completion, average of 12 months
To evaluate safety and tolerability of MIRV combined with Olaparib by Adverse Events as measured by CTCAE v 5.0, The team will use treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and laboratory test results, physical examination, or vital signs to determine AEs as described by CTCAE v5.0, Through study completion, average of 12 months|Determine Overall Response Rate, Defined by confirmed best response of CR or PR as assessed by the investigator, Through study completion, average of 12 months|Determine Duration of Response, Defined as the time from initial investigator-assessed response (CR or PR) until progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator, Through study completion, average of 12 months|Determine Overall Survival, Defined as the time from first dose of MIRV and Olaparib until death, Up to 5 years
The Principal Investigator hypothesizes the combination of MIRV and Olaparib is an effective, and tolerable, maintenance therapy strategy in platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.
