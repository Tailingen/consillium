Registry Platform Hematologic Malignancies (RUBIN) - Extension of Tumor Registry Lymphatic Neoplasms
The purpose of the project is to set up a national, prospective, longitudinal, multicenter registry platform to document uniform data on characteristics, molecular diagnostics, treatment and course of disease, to collect patient-reported outcomes and to establish a decentralized biobank for patients with hematological malignancies in Germany.

RUBIN is a national, observational, prospective, longitudinal, multicenter registry platform with the purpose to record information on the antineoplastic treatment of hematological malignancies in Germany.

It will identify common therapeutic sequences and changes in the treatment of the disease, and will analyse the impact of novel treatments on the outcome of patients in routine care. Unmet needs and areas with the potential for improvement in routine care are to be identified.

At inclusion, data in patient characteristics, comorbidities, clinical characteristics and previous treatments, if applicable, are collected. During the course of observation data on all systemic treatments, radiotherapies, surgeries, and clinical outcome are documented.

Health-realted quality of life in patients with hematological malignancies will be evaluated for up to one year.
