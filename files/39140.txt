Study to Assess Adverse Events and Change in Disease Activity of Intravenous (IV) Lemzoparlimab With or Without Oral/IV Dexamethasone and in Combination With Oral/IV/Subcutaneous Anti-Myeloma Regimens in Adult Participants With Multiple Myeloma
Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for more than 10% of all blood cancers and 1% of all cancers. The purpose of this study is to assess how safe lemzoparlimab is and how lemzoparlimab moves through the body of adult participants with MM when given with or without dexamethasone, and in combination with other anti-myeloma regimens. Adverse events and change in disease activity will be assessed.

Lemzoparlimab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) MM. Study doctors put the participants in groups called treatment arms. Two different dose levels of lemzoparlimab will be explored. Each treatment arm receives a different treatment combination depending on stage of the study and eligibility. This study will include a dose escalation phase to determine the best dose of lemzoparlimab, followed by a dose expansion phase to confirm the dose. Approximately 163 adult participants with R/R MM will be enrolled in the study in approximately 60 sites worldwide.

In the Dose Escalation arms, participants will receive intravenous (IV) lemzoparlimab with or without dexamethasone (oral/IV) in combination with pomalidomide (oral) or carfilzomib (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) daratumumab in 28-day cycles. In the Dose Expansion arms, participants will receive lemzoparlimab (IV) alone or with dexamethasone (oral/IV) in combination with pomalidomide (oral) or carfilzomib (IV) or daratumumab (SC) in 28-day cycles.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests and side effects.
