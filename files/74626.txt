Deceased Donor Bladder or Combined Kidney-bladder Transplantation: a Phase 0 First-in-human Study
The goal of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the feasibility of bladder transplantation in patients with terminal bladder diseases who would benefit from a new bladder or a combined kidney and bladder transplant. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is human bladder transplantation feasible and safe?
* How will the new bladder function in terms of storage and emptying?

Participants will undergo a bladder-only or combined kidney and bladder transplantation. They will then be followed for two years to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and functionality of the bladder transplant.

PROCEDURE: Bladder Transplantation|PROCEDURE: Combined Kidney and Bladder Transplantation
Demonstrating the technical success of bladder or combined kidney-bladder transplantation, The technical success of bladder transplantation will be evaluated. Technical success is defined as sustained and adequate perfusion to the bladder to maintain viability, as assessed through cystoscopic visual inspection and imaging, including ultrasound and cross-sectional imaging., 2 years
Incidence of adverse events after bladder or combined kidney-bladder transplantation, Adverse events will be evaluated. The endpoint for this outcome will be immediate peri-operative, 30, and 90-day adverse profiles. CTCAE v5 criteria will be used to describe adverse events. Of note a rejection episode managed medically will be defined as a grade 3 adverse event, while rejection requiring allograft explantation will be graded as a CTCAE grade 4 event., 2 years|Incidence of immune rejection after bladder or combined kidney-bladder transplantation, Monitoring for immune or cell-mediated rejection will be monitored for the duration of the study. The endpoint for this outcome will be the incidence of acute (within 7 days) and delayed transplant rejection (up to 30 days) post-transplantation. Rejection will be graded using a modified histological grading system adapted from Banff criteria, similar to that adopted in uterine transplantation. This is adapted from pre-existing grading criteria for vascularized composite allograft rejection. Chronic rejection will be evaluated thereafter, up to 1 year at regular follow-up intervals., 2 years|Evaluate the functionality of the transplanted bladder, The capacity of the bladder will be measured by ultrasound and cystoscopic visualization at 3 month intervals during the first year post-transplant, and as clinically indicated thereafter. The ability of the bladder to empty will be evaluated through using uroflowmetry studies at 3 month intervals and urodynamic evaluations. Successful bladder capacity is defined as a volume exceeding 300 cc, while successful bladder emptying will be defined by a post-void residual of less than 100 cc., 2 years
