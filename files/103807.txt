A Multicenter, Randomized Controlled, Phase II Clinical Study of First-line Chemotherapy and Camrelizumab With or Without Radiotherapy in the Treatment of Oligometastatic Esophageal Cancer
A multi-center, open, randomized controlled, phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficiency and safety of chemotherapy and immunotherapy combined with locol radiotharepy in treatment of patients with oligometastatic esophageal carcinoma.
Esophageal Cancer
RADIATION: Radiotherapy group|DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Chemotherapy
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression., Up to 24 month
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of patients with CR and PR assessed by investigators according to Recist v 1.Subjects evaluated as CR and PR need to be confirmed after 4 weeks (the next curative effect evaluation time specified in the protocol)., Up to 24 month|Overall survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to 24 month|Adverse Events (AEs), Adverse Events Monitor and evaluate the safety of the treatment during the whole course of treatment and 30 days after the end of the last treatment. If severe toxicity occurs, monitor until 90 days after the end of treatment.According to CTCAE 5.0, the toxicity is classified and recorded., Up to 24 month
Disease Control Rate (DCR), The proportion of patients who have achieved CRï¼ŒPR and SD assessed by investigators according to Recist v 1.1., Up to 24 month|Duration of Response (DoR), The duration of overall efficacy refers to the time period from the first evaluation of CR/PR (whichever occurs first) to relapse or PD; the duration of SD refers to the time the subjects were enrolled in this study (The day of enrollment) The time period to PD., Up to 24 month
This is a multi-center, open, randomized controlled, phase II clinical study to evaluate the efficiency and safety of chemotherapy and immunotherapy combined with locol radiotharepy in treatment of patients with oligometastatic esophageal carcinoma.For patients required that recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer, no more than 3 metastatic organs and no more than 5 metastatic lesions. First, all patients receive chemotherapy (the regimen includes paclitaxel and platinum drugs; or cisplatin, pentafluorouracil (5-fluorouracil) ) and other standard first-line chemotherapeutics, combined with Camrelizumab for 4 cycles, and the patients who have not progressed were randomly divided into non-radiotherapy group (control group) and combined radiotherapy group (experimental group) at 1:1 ratio. The experimental group received radiotherapy of the lesion within 8 weeks after the end of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. At least one lesion (both primary and metastatic lesions) was required to be irradiated. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT, 8Gy/time, 3 -5 times, if other segmentation schemes are used, recommend BED10 \>60Gy) or conventional fractional radiotherapy (parts that are not suitable for SBRT, the total dose is more than 30Gy); the primary lesion should be treated with conventional fractional radiotherapy with a dose of 4000cGy or more;The radiotherapy of the primary lesions and metastases focus is carried out at the same time or sequentially, and immunotherapy shall be started within 8 weeks after the end of all radiotherapy. The control group continued Camrelizumab after 3 weeks of the 4 cycles of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. The maintenance immunotherapy of the two groups was: Camrelizumab 200mg Q3W, until PD or toxicity is intolerable or up to 24 months. The endpoint are PFS, OS, ORR and toxicity of the two groups .
