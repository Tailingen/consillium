Dose Escalation Study of Nintedanib (BIBF 1120) in Japanese Patients With Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The aim of the study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK) for Japanese hepatocellular carcinoma which are not amenable to curative surgery or loco regional therapy
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Nintedanib high dose|DRUG: Nintedanib low dose|DRUG: Nintedanib medium dose|DRUG: Nintedanib medium dose|DRUG: Nintedanib high dose
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities to Determine Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Nintedanib, The MTD is based on the incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). A drug-related AE was considered as a DLT if one of the following met: CTCAE grade 4 thrombocytopenia of any duration, CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia lasting for â‰¥8 days, CTCAE grade 4 febrile neutropenia of any duration, CTCAE grade 3 or 4 non-haematologic toxicity (with the following exception: Alopecia, Vomiting, nausea, or diarrhoea with no adequate supportive care, Transient electrolyte abnormality, which resolves spontaneously or can be corrected with appropriate treatment within 3 days, Liver toxicity), Liver enzyme toxicity of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase \[ALP\] elevation \>5x ULN, or total bilirubin \>3x ULN if baseline liver enzymes are within the normal range, or AST, ALT or ALP \> baseline value + 4x ULN if the baseline value is elevated. The MTD was determined to be 200mg bid., up to 28 days
Number of Participants With Objective Tumour Response According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0, Objective response (Complete response (CR) + Partial response (PR), regardless of confirmation) is derived from a patient's best objective response by RECIST. Best objective response is calculated based on the "overall" visit response from each assessment. Best objective response represents the best response a patient has had during their time in the study up until progression, last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression or the start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy. For patients whose progression event is death, best objective response will be calculated based on data up until the last evaluable RECIST assessment prior to death., up to 28 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from start date of the study treatment to PD according to RECIST 1.0, or any death whichever occurs earlier., up to 28 months|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the duration from the start date of the study treatment to PD according to RECIST 1.0., up to 28 months|Number of Participants With Response by Alpha Fetoprotein (AFP), Response by AFP is defined as 20% or more decline in AFP between the baseline value and the AFP value after three courses (12 weeks) of therapy. If patients only receive two courses of therapy the AFP value after two courses (8 weeks) will be used for the analysis., up to 28 months
