Study of Tisagenlecleucel in Chinese Pediatric and Young Adult Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory B-cell ALL
This is a single arm, multi-center, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in Chinese pediatric and young adult subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Tisagenlecleucel
Overall Remission Rate (ORR), Evaluate the efficacy of tisagenlecleucel using overall remission rate (ORR) during the 3 months after tisagenlecleucel administration as assessed by the investigator. The ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with a best overall disease response of Complete Remission (CR) or Complete Remission with Incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), From first dosing (single administration, Day 1) up to Month 3
CR or CRi rate at month 6, Evaluate the percentage of participants who achieve CR or CRi at Month 6 without SCT after tisagenlecleucel infusion, Month 6|CR or CRi rate at Day 28, Evaluate the percentage of participants who achieve CR or CRi at Day 28 after tisagenlecleucel infusion, Day 28|Best Overall Response (BOR) of CR or CRi with a MRD negative bone marrow, Evaluate the percentage of participants who achieve a BOR of CR or CRi with a MRD negative bone marrow during the 3 months after tisagenlecleucel infusion, From first dosing (single administration, Day 1) up to Month 3|Duration of remission (DOR), DOR, i.e. the time from achievement of CR or CRi, whichever occurs first, to relapse or death due to ALL, Average of 60 Months|Relapse free survival (RFS), RFS, i.e. the time from achievement of CR or CRi whichever occurs first to relapse or death due to any cause during CR or CRi, Avarage of 60 Months|Event free survival (EFS), EFS, i.e. the time from date of Tisagenlecleucel infusion to the earliest of death, relapse or treatment failure, Average of 60 Months|Overall survival (OS), OS, i.e. the time from date of tisagenlecleucel infusion to the date of death due to any reason, Average of 60 Months|Number of Participants with On-Treatments Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Deaths, Analysis of absolute and relative frequencies for treatment emergent Adverse Event (AE), Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Deaths by primary System Organ Class (SOC) parameters., From Screening up to Month 60|In vivo cellular PK profile of tisagenlecleucel, qPCR and flow cytometry will be used to measure tisagenlecleucel transgene concentration in blood, bone marrow and other matrices/tissues, Up to Month 60|Serum cytokine, Concentrations of soluble factors (such as IL-10, iFN-y, IL-6) in blood will be summarized by participant and time point, Up to Month 60|Levels of pre-existing and treatment induced humoral immunogenicity, The humoral immunogenicity assay measures the antibody titers specific to tisagenlecleucel prior to and following infusion, Up to Month 60|Tociluzumab PK, Concentrations of tocilizumab, Up to Day 7 after tocilizumab infusion|Levels of prexisting and treatment induced cellular immunogenicity, The cellular immunogenicity assay will assess the presence of T lymphocyte activated by the tisagenlecleucel protein, Up to Month 60
The study will have the following sequential phases for all subjects:

* Screening
* Pre-Treatment (Cell Product Preparation and Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy)
* Treatment and Follow-up Tisagenlecleucel infusion should occur within 16 weeks of informed consent. The total duration of the study is 5 years. After tisagenlecluecel infusion, efficacy will be assessed monthly for the first 6 months, then quarterly up to 2 years and semi-annually afterwards up to 5 years, or until the subject relapses.
