Safety Study of Dinutuximab Combined With Immunotherapy to Treat Neuroblastoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of the triple COG schema with the monoclonal antibody Dinutuximab + cytokines (GM-CSF and IL2) and isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, or RA) in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.
Neuroblastoma|Neoplasm, Residual|Effects of Immunotherapy
DRUG: Dinutuximab. Immunotherapy
Number of Participants with Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events, Type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness, and relatedness; of reported AEs, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Toxicity will be graded and tabulated by the NCI-CTCAE v 4.0., Expected, 7 months from treatment initiation. From IC signature, every day during immunotherapy treatment (Cycles 1 to 5), day 1 of cycle 6. From patient consent signature up to 30 days after administration of the last dose of study drug.
Relapse-free survival, Rate of BM response for patients with detectable minimal residual disease in the BM after the first treatments with Dinutuximab/GM-CSF and relation with relapse-free survival., Anticipated, 2 years from study treatment initiation. From IC signature, every 3 months, up to 2 years (anticipated).
Assess toxicity and safety of subcutaneous GM-CSF and iv IL-2 in enhancing Dinutuximab-mediated ablation of Bone Marrow (BM) disease in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have achieved a Complete Response or Very Good Partial Response of the macroscopic disease in the investigators institution.

Assess response of minimal residual disease (MRD) of the anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody Dinutuximab combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-2 in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (NB). More precisely, to apply real-time quantitative RT-PCR to test the hypothesis that minimal residual disease content of BM after the first treatments with dinutuximab/GM-CSF has significant prognostic impact on relapse-free survival.
