Flexible Colonoscope Assisted Hybrid Transanal Total Mesorectal Resection (taTME)
The investigators propose to use flexible endoscopy combined with transanal total mesorectal resection to further reduce anal injury.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Flexible colonoscope assisted hybrid transanal total mesorectal resection
Success rate of operation, Whether it is necessary to switch to other surgical methods, 1 years after the surgery
Endoscopic technique has become an indispensable part of Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). However, the upper gastrointestinal tract is easy to cause severe leakage complications, which mainly limits the application of endoscopy in rectum. Herein, investigators propose purse suture closing distal rectum and full-layer incision of the rectal wall using flexible endoscopic from anal to assist in hybrid transanal total mesorectal resection (taTME).Further reduce the damage of anus caused by taTME.
