Efficacy and Safety of Chemotherapy Combined With CAR-T Cells in Newly Diagnosed Adult Patients With Ph- B-ALL
In recent years, immunotherapy (eg. blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, CAR-T cells) has demonstrated a high safety and efficacy profile in relapsed/refractory (R/R）B-ALL. The available data suggest that the advancement of immunotherapy from relapsed/refractory (R/R) field to the frontline setting may be an important approach to increase the depth of remission, which ultimately translates into a survival benefit. In this study, the investigators propose a treatment regimen using CAR-T cell therapy as a consolidation method for Ph- B-ALL patients achieving complete remission (CR) with chemotherapy, aiming to reduce the total cycles of chemotherapy and related toxicities, shorten length of hospitalization, and ultimately improve patients' survival and quality of life.

The CAR-T cells were murine-derived second-generation CD19 CAR-T with a co-stimulation domain of 4-1BB, and the infusion dose was 1×10\^6/kg CAR+ cells in a single infusion.
