Multicenter Descriptive Study of the Patient Clinical Profile That Begins With Disseminated Her 2 + Breast Cancer or Develops a Metastasis After or During the Adjuvant Therapy
This is an observational, cross-sectional study that the main objective is to describe the patient clinical profile that begins with disseminated Her 2+ Breast Cancer or develops a metastasis after or during the adjuvant treatment.
Disseminated HER2+ Breast Cancer
The Patient Clinical Profile (General Clinical Data and Breast Cancer Characteristics), General clinical data: age, weigh, height, Perfomance Status (ECOG Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, runs from 0 to 5, with 0 denoting perfect health and 5 death), Breast cancer characteristics: familiar history of breast cancer, initial diagnostic (localized or disseminated), age at diagnostic, TNM (tumor node met치stasis), tumor size, node involvement, primary tumor surgery, HER2 overexpression, histological Classification (grades I, II and III,determines the urgency and aggressiveness of treatment, as the higher grades do tend to correspond to poorer survival rates and prognosis), time from the primary breast cancer to distant relapse, description and localization of metastasis, 1 day (there is no follow-up, it is a cross-sectional study)
Adjuvant Treatment in Primary Breast Cancer: Chemotherapy (Treatment With TAC-Docetaxel, Adriamicine and Cyclophosphamide), Hormonal Therapy Anti-HER Biological Therapy, one day (there is no follow-up, it is a cross-sectional study)|The Pattern of Treatment in Metastatic Breast Cancer: Chemotherapy, Hormonal Therapy Anti-HER Biological Therapy, one day (there is no follow-up, it si a cross-sectional study)|Adjuvant Treatment and Age, Adjuvant treatment and clinical profile (age)

The patients analysed in this outcome are patients initially diagnosed with localized breast c치ncer (N=66), one day (there is no follow-up, it is a cross-sectional study)|Adjuvant Treatment-Physical Activity, Adjuvant treatment and clinical profile (Physical activity)
