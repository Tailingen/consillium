GEN-001 Plus Pembrolizumab for Patients With Advanced Refractory Biliary Tract Cancer
This is a phase II, multicenter, open-label study with a safety run-in to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GEN-001 in combination with pembrolizumab or in combination with pembrolizumab and mFOLFOX for patients with advanced refractory BTC who have progressed after 1 or 2 prior standard therapy and are not candidates for any other standard therapy. The safety run-in phase will be conducted before the main study phase
