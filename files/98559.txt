QL1706 Combined with Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer
the investigators planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QL1706 in combination with chemotherapy as first-line systemic therapy in approximately 26 patients with newly diagnosed recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer in a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Evaluate the efficacy and safety of QL1706 plus chemotherapy as first-line systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease.

According to the treatment regimen, a total of 26 subjects were enrolled. Eligible subjects received QL1706 (5mg/kg, Q3W, d1) plus carboplatin (AUC=5, Q3W, d1) plus paclitaxel (175mg/m2, Q3W, d1) for six to eight cycles at the investigator's discretion, followed by QL1706 (5mg/kg, Q3W, d1). d1) until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, lack of benefit as judged by the investigator, withdrawal of consent, completion of 2 years of QL1706 treatment, or other reasons specified in the protocol.
Recurrent or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer
DRUG: QL1706 plus carboplatin plus paclitaxel for six to eight cycles at the investigator's discretion, followed by QL1706
ORR, The best overall response (BOR) was defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a confirmed CR or PR (according to RECIST v1.1)., up to 5 months
PFS, It was defined as the time from the first use of a study drug to documentation of disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Subjects who were alive without disease progression at the time of data cutoff for analysis were censored at the last tumor assessment. Subjects who did not undergo postbaseline assessments were censored at the date of the first dose., up to 13months|DoR, It was defined as the time from the first documentation of an objective response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective disease progression (according to RECIST v1.1 criteria) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Subjects who were alive without disease progression at the time of data cutoff for analysis were censored at the date of the last tumor measurement. DoR was evaluated only in subjects who achieved CR or PR in response., up to 5 months|OS, time from first use of a study drug until death from any cause. For those subjects who were alive at the time of data cutoff, censoring will be performed at the last known date of survival. Subjects who did not provide any follow-up information were censored at the date of enrollment., up to 45 months
