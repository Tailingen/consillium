Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Plus Sequential Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) Therapy in Locally Advanced Colon Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus sequential immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in locally advanced colon cancer. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does this neoadjuvant chemotherapy increase the pathologic complete response (pCR) of locally advanced colon cancer?
* Does this neoadjuvant chemotherapy improve the long-term survival of locally advanced colon cancer?

Participants will receive:

* a pre-operative CAPEOX (capecitabine oral + oxaliplatin i.v.)regimen.
* a sequential CAPEOX plus Serplulimab regimen.
* a standard complete mesocolic excision (CME) operation.
