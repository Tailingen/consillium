Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Progression-free Survival (PFS) Based on the Response Assessment by the Independent Review Adjudication Committee (IRAC), PFS was calculated as the time from randomization to the first documented PD or death due to any cause during the study, which ever occurred first based on the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response criteria (IMWG). Those who withdrew for any reason or received another anti-myeloma therapy without documented PD were censored on the date of their last response assessment, prior to receiving any other anti-myeloma therapy. Censoring rules for PFS: - No baseline assessments and no progression or death documented within the 2 scheduled assessments; Death within the lst two assessments without any adequate response assessment; Progression documented between scheduled assessments; Death between adequate assessments; no progression; study discontinuations for reasons other than PD or death; new anti-myeloma started prior to PD; death or PD after an extended lost to follow-up time period (2 or more missed scheduled assessment's)., From date of randomization until the data cut-off date of 24 May 2013.

Scores were averaged, and transformed to a 0-100 scale; for the future perspective scale, a higher score indicates a better perspective of the future., Cycle 1 Day 1 (Baseline), then Months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and Discontinuation visit|Change From Baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Patients With Multiple Myeloma (EORTC QLQ-MY20) Body Image Scale, EORTC QLQ-MY20 is a validated questionnaire to assess the overall quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma. EORTC QLQ-MY20 includes four scales: disease symptoms, treatment side-effects, future perspective, and body image. Questions used a 4-point scale (from 1 'Not at All' to 4 'Very Much'). Scores were averaged, and transformed to a 0-100 scale; for the body image scale, a higher score indicates a better body image., Cycle 1 Day 1 (Baseline), then Months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and Discontinuation visit|Change From Baseline in the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Health Utility Index Score, EQ-5D is a self-administered questionnaire that assesses health-related quality of life. The EQ-5D descriptive health profile comprises five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 3 levels of response: No problem (1), some problems (2), and extreme problems (3). A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining one level from each of the five dimensions into a single utility index score. EQ-5D index values range from -0.59 to 1.00 where higher EQ-5D scores represent better health status. A positive change from baseline score indicates improvement in health status and better health state., Cycle 1 Day 1 (Baseline), then Months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and Discontinuation visit|Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU): Rate of Inpatient Hospitalizations Per Year, HRU was defined as any consumption of healthcare resources directly or indirectly related to the treatment of the patient. HRU Analysis may help in evaluating potential costs and budget impact of new treatments from a payer perspective. The rate of inpatient hospitalizations per patient year was calculated as the total number of hospitalizations divided by the total number of patient-years followed in the study period. Patient-years (PY) were calculated as the duration from baseline to last available HRQL assessment for each patient., Day 1 (randomization) up to last visit completed 25 July 2016|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) During the Active Treatment Phase, A TEAE is any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first treatment of any study drug, and within 30 days after the last dose of the last study drug. Severity grades according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) on a 1-5 scale: Grade 1= Mild AE, Grade 2= Moderate AE, Grade 3= Severe AE, Grade 4= Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5=Death related to AE. A serious AE is any AE occurring at any dose that: • Results in death; • Is life-threatening; • Requires or prolongs existing inpatient hospitalization; • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; • Constitutes an important medical event., From first dose of study drug through 28 days following the discontinuation visit from active treatment phase; median duration of treatment was 80.2 weeks in the Rd arm; 72 weeks in the Rd18 arm and 67.1 weeks in the MPT arm|Shift From Baseline to Most Extreme Postbaseline Value in Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) During the Active Treatment Phase, Renal function was assessed for participants from baseline to the most extreme value in creatinine clearance calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault estimation., Randomization to end of treatment or the data cut off of 24 May 2013; median duration of treatment was 80.2 weeks in the Rd arm; 72 weeks in the Rd18 arm and 67.1 weeks in the MPT arm|Shift From Baseline to Most Extreme Postbaseline Value in Absolute Neutrophil Count During the Active Treatment Phase, Neutrophil counts was assessed for participants from baseline grade to most extreme severity grade using the NCI CTCAE v 3.0 grading scale., Randomization to end of treatment or the data cut off of 24 May 2013; median duration of treatment was 80.2 weeks in the Rd arm; 72 weeks in the Rd18 arm and 67.1 weeks in the MPT arm|Shift From Baseline to Most Extreme Postbaseline Value in Hemoglobin During the Active Treatment Phase, Hemoglobin was assessed for participants from baseline grade to most extreme severity grade using the NCI CTCAE v 3.0 grading scale., Randomization to end of treatment or the data cut off of 24 May 2013; median duration of treatment was 80.2 weeks in the Rd arm; 72 weeks in the Rd18 arm and 67.1 weeks in the MPT arm|Shift From Baseline to Most Extreme Postbaseline Value in Platelet Count During the Active Treatment Phase., Improvement in platelets was assessed for participants from baseline grade to most extreme severity grade using the NCI CTCAE v 3.0 grading scale., Randomization to end of treatment or the data cut off of 24 May 2013; median duration of treatment was 80.2 weeks in the Rd arm; 72 weeks in the Rd18 arm and 67.1 weeks in the MPT arm|Improvement of Infection Rate by Observing the Historical Data Compared to the Clinical Data Base, Improvement of infection rate by observing historical data compared to the data within clinical database as not analyzed., From randomization to 24 May 2013
CC-5013-MM020/IFM 07-01 is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, open-label, 3-arm study that will compare the efficacy and safety of two Lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone regimens given for two different durations of time (i.e., until progressive disease \[PD\] or for up to a maximum of 18 four-week cycles) to that of MPT given for a maximum of 12 six-week cycles.
