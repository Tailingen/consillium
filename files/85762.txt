Temsirolimus in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well temsirolimus works in treating patients with breast cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

OTHER: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis|DRUG: Temsirolimus
Clinical Benefit Rate (Complete Response, Partial Response, or Stable Disease), Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0 was used for response evaluation. Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of subjects experiencing a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks.

Evaluation of target lesions: Complete Response (CR)-- Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)-- At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; Stable Disease (SD)-- Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started;

Evaluation of non-target lesions: Complete Response (CR)-- Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; Incomplete Response/ Stable Disease (SD)-- Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, Up to 24 months
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the overall activity (as defined by complete response \[CR\] + partial response \[PR\] + stable disease \[SD\] for \>= 24 weeks) of a weekly 25 mg intravenous dose of temsirolimus in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

II. To compare the activity of temsirolimus in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose primary tumors have mutations in the PIK3CA or PTEN gene with those whose tumors do not have a mutation in the PIK3CA gene.

III. To examine correlations between antitumor activity of temsirolimus and alterations in expression of genes in the PI3K pathway in primary tumor biopsy specimens.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
