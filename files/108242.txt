PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine in treating elderly women who have metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine hydrochloride
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Investigators planned to determine efficacy (objective response rate \[ORR\] by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors \[RECIST\])., 2 years
Number of Participants with Adverse Events, Investigators planned to review adverse events utilizing Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) V3., 2 years
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and efficacy of gemcitabine in the treatment of elderly women with metastatic breast cancer. II. Evaluate the quality of life in these patients.

OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 1 hour weekly for 7 consecutive weeks in an 8 week course. Treatment then continues weekly for 3 consecutive weeks in 4 week courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed prior to treatment and then every 12 weeks. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months until year 5, and then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
