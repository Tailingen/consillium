BELotaxel(Docetaxel) and bellOXa(Oxaliplatin) in Advanced NSCLC
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Korea as well as in other countries. About 80% of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC). The majority of patients with NSCLC require cytotoxic chemotherapy in the course of their illness. Combination chemotherapy using third generation anticancer drugs (paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine) with platinums(cisplatin or carboplatin) reached a plateau in their efficacy. Oxaliplatin, another platinum being used for colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancer has lower adverse effects such as nausea and nephrotoxicity. In this phase II trial, we will observe efficacy and safety of docetaxel and oxaliplatin for patients with NSCLC.
