Accuracy of Coplanar Template Assisted Seed Implantation for Abdominal and Pelvic Cancer
In recent years, template guidance has been applied and developed in the field of puncture related operations, such as template-assisted radioactive seed implantation. With the guidance of template, needle pathway of seed implantation, biopsy and fiducial marker implantation can be precisely planned actual operation, which is conducive to the accurate proceeding. Templates can be divided into coplanar templates and non-coplanar templates. The digital coplanar template coordinate puncture system has been developed in China and has been applied in clinical practice.

In previous studies, coplanar template assisted CT-guided radioactive seed implantation has good clinical feasibility for head and neck cancer. However, the accuracy of Coplanar Template Assisted Seed Implantation for Abdominal and Pelvic cancer are lacking in prospective studies. The study aims to prospectively observe the accuracy and safety of Coplanar Template Assisted Seed Implantation for Abdominal and Pelvic cancer.

Dosimetry (D90) between pre-plan and post-plan, Dose covering 90% of target volume between pre-plan and post-plan, From the starting to the ending of the seed implantation (generally within 1 week).
Success rate of seed implantation, Success rate of seed implantation, From the starting to the ending of the seed implantation (generally within 1 day).|Adverse event, Such as pneumoperitoneum, subcutaneous emphysema, hemorrhage, infection, etc., Acute adverse event is defined as 1 month after seed implantation and beyond 1 month for chronic adverse event.|Operating duration, Operating duration from the starting to the ending, From the starting to the ending of the seed implantation (generally within 2 hours)|Local progression-free survival, Local progression-free survival:Duration of the seed implantation to local tumor progression, From date of seed implantation until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years
