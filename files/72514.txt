Pazopanib in Molecularly Selected Patients With Advanced NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate how participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have certain abnormalities in the pazopanib target genes respond to pazopanib treatment.
Carcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung|Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer|Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pazopanib
Response Rate, * Participants should be re-evaluated for response 8 weeks after initiation of pazopanib and then every 8 weeks thereafter. In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response.
* Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) \[Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009\].
* Response rate is the percentage of participants with a complete or partial response
* Complete response=Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (\<10 mm short axis).
* Partial response=At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters, Until the end of treatment (median length of treatment=85.5 days (full range 25-334 days)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), * Progression-free survival is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. There is no limit on following for progression-free survival besides death of the participant.
* Progressive disease=At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions)., Until progressive disease or death (median follow-up 174 days, full range 41 days-545 days)
Outcomes Associated With Specific Mutations, * Participants are followed until death.
* All participants will undergo next generation sequencing prior to enrollment into the study.
* Initial predictors are the mutations in VEGFR or PDGFR, but sequencing will be used to evaluate for other predictors as well., Until time of death (an expected average of 8 months)|Mutational Predictors for Extreme Responders, -Whole exome and transcriptome sequencing will be performed in 10 participants, including 4 to 6 responders and 4 to 6 non-responders in order to identify the predictors for benefit., Until end of treatment (an expected average of 8 months)|Mechanisms of Secondary Resistance., -Participants will also undergo next generation sequencing at the time of progression in an attempt to identify the mechanisms for secondary resistance., Until the time of progressive disease (an expected average of 8 months)
There has been a limited benefit from anti-angiogenesis drugs in patients with NSCLC. Bevacizumab provides a modest survival improvement when added to chemotherapy and VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been associated with minimal efficacy as single agents and increased toxicity when combined with chemotherapy. We postulate that the response rates and survival may be improved with a better selection of patients based on abnormalities of the targets for the drugs. According to the preliminary data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), the targets of pazopanib are altered in 28% of patients with adenocarcinoma and 24% of patients with squamous cell lung cancer. Since, despite the molecular selection prior to treatment, only a small percentage of patients will benefit from the treatment, we plan to further investigate those patients with whole exome sequencing in both the pre-treatment samples to identify the predictors for response and at the time of progression, with repeated biopsy, in an attempt to identify the predictors for secondary resistance. By identifying more reliable predictors for response to pazopanib, our study may help to establish its role in the treatment of NSCLC.
