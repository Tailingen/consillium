An Exploratory Clinical Study of RD133 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory MSLN-Positive Solid Tumors
This study is a single-center exploratory clinical trial. It is estimated that 9-24 subjects will be enrolled. The "3+3" dose escalation design is adopted. The main purpose is to evaluate the safety of RD133 in the treatment of subjects with relapsed or refractory MSLN-positive solid tumors and explore the Recommend phase II dose of RD133 in the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory MSLN-positive solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: RD133
Type and incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) by dose group, The number and percentage of DLT in each dose group, 2 years post infusion|Type and incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) by dose group, Calculate type and incidence of adverse events (AE), serious adverse event (SAE), including those happened after lymphodepletion and after infusion, those related to study drug and lymphodepletion, or those that led to withdrawal from the study. They will also be aggregated by systematic organ classification (SOC), preferred term (PT), and severity., 2 years post infusion
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product, 2 years post infusion|Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of subjects who have achieved best response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) according to the RECIST V1.1 evaluation criteria 3 months after RD133 cell infusion., 2 years post infusion|Duration of response (DoR), The time from the date of initial documentation of CR/PR after RD133 cell infusion to the date of progressive disease or death due to the disease studied, 2 years post infusion|Time to response (TTR), The time from the date of RD133 cell infusion to the first efficacy evaluation of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), 2 years post infusion|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of subjects with best efficacy assessment of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD), 2 years post infusion|Progression-free survival (PFS), The time from the date of RD133 cell infusion to the date of initial documentation of progressive disease/relapse or death from any cause, 2 years post infusion|Overall survival (OS), The time from the date of RD133 cell infusion to the date of death, 2 years post infusion|Transgene Levels of RD133, Changes of virus vector copy number (VCN) in peripheral blood and tumor tissue (if any) after RD133 infusion, 2 years post infusion|Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) Positive Cell Concentration, Changes of CAR T cell concentration in peripheral blood and tumor tissue (if any) after RD133 infusion, 2 years post infusion
Concentrations of TGF-β, Measurement of TGF-β level in peripheral blood, 2 years post infusion|Expression of biomarker in tumor tissue, The expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, CD163, MSLN, and PDL1 in tumor tissue after RD133 cell infusion, 2 years post infusion|Immunogenicity of RD133, The positive rate and antibody level of human anti-RD133 antibodies after RD133 cell infusion, 2 years post infusion|replication competent lentivirus (RCL), The positive rate and change in replication competent lentivirus (RCL), 2 years post infusion|Exploratory analysis of MSLN level in peripheral blood, The correlation between MSLN level in peripheral blood before and after RD133 cell infusion, 2 years post infusion|Exploratory analysis of MSLN level in tumor tissues and efficacy, The correlation between the expression level of MSLN in tumor tissues and clinical efficacy, 2 years post infusion|T/B/NK cell ratio in peripheral blood, T/B/NK cell ratio in peripheral blood will be measured using flow cytometry after RD133 cell infusion, 2 years post infusion|Systemic Cytokine Concentrations, Changes in the levels of inflammatory factors in peripheral blood after RD133 cell infusion, 2 years post infusion
Leukapheresis procedure will be performed to manufacture RD133 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells. Bridging therapy is allowed between PBMC collection and lymphodepletion. Lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was performed for three consecutive days. After 1-day rest, subjects will receive a single dose infusion of RD133 at 1.0, 3.0, or 6.0x 10\^6 CAR+ T cells/Kg. Subjects will be followed in the study for a minimum of 2 years after RD133 infusion. Long-term follow-up for lentiviral vector safety will be followed for up to 15 years after RD133 infusion.
