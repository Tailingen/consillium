A Prospective Clinical Study of CD3-CD20 Bisspecific Antibody Based Therapy Combined With CD19-CAR T Cells in the Treatment of Relapsed Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and efficacy of CD3-CD20 bispecific antibody-based therapy in combination with CD19-CAR-T cells for the treatment of relapsed and refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's （B-NHL） lymphoma.

The main questions it aims to answer：

1. The safety of CD3-CD20 bispecific antibody-based therapy in combination with CD19-CAR-T cells in B-NHL;
2. The effect of different doses of bispecific antibody maintenance therapy on CAR-T cell expansion.
B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Bispecific antibody-based combined with CAR-T cell therapy
Incidence rate and severity of adverse events (AE) of patients treated with bispecific antibody combined with CD19-CAR-T cells in B-NHL.（Assessed by CTCAE criteria v5 and ASTCT 2019 criteria for CRS/ICANS adverse events.）, Assess the safety and toxicity of CD3-CD20 bispecific antibody-based therapy in combination with CD19-CAR-T cells in B-NHL. Assessed in all patients given at least one dose of study treatment and infused., Up to 30 days after last treatment.From registration and during the bridging treatment, until end of post-treatment safety reporting window (up to six months after last dose of glofitamab)
Complete Response (CR) Rate, Up to 12 months after last treatment|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Up to 12 months after last treatment
The study was divided into two phases:

In the previous phase Ib clinical study, the bispecific antibody was used for bridging therapy to reduce the Neoplasm load, followed by CART cell therapy. After CART cell therapy, low-dose bispecific antibody was used for maintenance, in order to explore the safe resistance of bispecific antibody combined with CAR-T cell therapy and further explore the effect of bispecific antibody combined with CAR-T cell therapy on CART cell expansion; Phase II study will expand the sample study to further clarify whether bispecific antibody combined with CAR-T cell therapy can further deepen the efficacy of CAR-T.
