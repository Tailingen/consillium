The Effectiveness of Electroacupuncture and Standard Therapy Compared to Standard Therapy in Gynecological Cancer Pain
Gynecological cancer is cancer that starts in the female reproductive organs. Pain in gynecological cancer can be caused by an underlying malignancy or surgical procedure as well as chronic pain associated with malignancy and sequelae of the therapy given. Gynecological cancer patients often experience moderate to severe pain and use higher levels of opioids than patients diagnosed with other cancers. More than two thirds of patients with advanced cancer experience severe pain and up to half of these patients report that their pain is not well controlled. This study aims to analyze the effectiveness of electroacupuncture plus standard therapy on pain intensity (VAS score), changes in analgesic dose, and quality of life (QLQ C-30 EORTC score) in patients with gynecological cancer pain compared to standard therapy alone.

This study was conducted using single blinded randomized control clinical trial, design in 58 patients diagnosed with gynecological cancer, aged 18 to 65 years, who experienced cancer pain, with VAS â‰¥ 4, pain caused by a tumor, before or while undergoing a therapeutic process (radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or post surgery), side effects or due to the toxicity of cancer treatment, willing to take part in this study and sign informed consent who were randomized into 2 groups, namely group I electroacupuncture with standard therapy and group 2 standard therapy, the acupuncture points used were LI4, PC6, ST36, SP6 and LR3, after the acupuncture needle was inserted, the needle was connected to the electrosimulator. The outputs assessed were pain intensity using the VAS, changes in analgesic dose, and quality of life with the EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire, which was assessed on the day before starting therapy, the first day, the second day, the third day, the fifth day and the seventh day.
