Daratumumab, Pomalidomide, and Dexamethasone (DPd) in Relapsed/Refractory Light Chain Amyloidosis Patients Previously Exposed to Daratumumab
This study will test the hypothesis that in patients with previous daratumumab exposure, combination therapy of daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd) will yield higher complete remission (CR) rates in relapsed/refractory amyloidosis than historical pomalidomide/dexamethasone treatment.
Amyloid|AL Amyloidosis|Refractory AL Amyloidosis
DRUG: Daratumumab SC|DRUG: Pomalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Percentage of Participants With Overall Complete Hematologic Response, Overall complete hematologic response rate will be defined as percentage of participants who achieve Complete Hematologic Response, Follow-up for up to 1 year
Duration of Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or better hematologic response rates, Duration of hematologic VGPR or better response is defined as the time between the date of initial documentation of hematologic VGPR or better response to the date of first documented evidence of hematologic progressive disease., Follow-up for up to 5 years|Low-dFLC Partial Response Rate (applicable to low-dFLC pt group), Percentage of participants who achieve a low-dFLC partial hematologic response rate and met criteria at screening for low-dFLC response assessment, Follow-up for up to 1 year|Percentage of participants with an Organ Response, Organ response rate (OrRR) for kidney and cardiac is defined as the proportion of baseline organ involved participants who achieve organ response in each corresponding organ. Organ response defined for cardiac: N-terminal brain pronatriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) response (\> 30% and \> 300 nanogram per liter \[ng/L\] decrease in participants with baseline NT-proBNP \>= 650 ng/L) or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class response (\>= 2 class decrease in participants with baseline NYHA class 3 or 4)Í¾ for kidney: decrease in proteinuria by \>=30% or below 0.5 grams /24 hours without renal progression., Follow-up for up to 3 years|Median estimate of months that participants have Progression Free Survival, Median estimate calculated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology, Follow-up for up to 5 years|Median number of months of participant's Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is measured from the date of enrollment to the date of the participant's death, Follow-up for up to 5 years|Time to Complete Hematologic Response, Measured in months between the date of enrollment and the first efficacy evaluation at which the participant has met the criteria for hematologic complete response., Follow-up for up to 1 year|Time to Hematologic Progression, Measured in months between the date of enrollment and the first efficacy evaluation at which the participant has met the criteria for hematologic progression, Follow-up for up to 5 years|Time until Next Treatment Therapy, Measured in months from the date of enrollment to the start date of subsequent treatment for AL amyloidosis, Follow-up for up to 5 years
