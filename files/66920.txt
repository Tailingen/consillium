Peer Support Group for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients
Allogeneic Haemopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (Allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative option for patients with both malignant and non-malignant hematological disorders. There appears to be unique experiences that adolescents and young adults (AYA) face when undergoing transplant. There is literature to suggest that peer support for young adults is associated with improvements in mental health including greater happiness, self-esteem and effective coping, as well as reductions in depression, loneliness and anxiety.

Our primary objective is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of an AYA peer support program for patients undergoing Allo-HSCT. Our secondary objective is to explore the impact of the AYA peer support program on sense of support/connectivity, anxiety, and depression.

BEHAVIORAL: Peer Support
Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM), The Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM) revised to evaluated the AYA peer support program comprises 4-items regarding the respondent's perceptions of the feasibility of the intervention. Responses range from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Scale value is computed by averaging responses and ranges from 1-5. Higher values indicate greater feasibility of the intervention., at 6 months|Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), The Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) revised to evaluated the AYA peer support program comprises 4-items regarding the respondent's perceptions of the acceptability of the intervention. Responses range from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Scale value is computed by averaging responses and ranges from 1-5. Higher values indicate greater acceptability of the intervention., at 6 months|Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), The Intervention Appropriate Measure (IAM) revised to evaluated the AYA peer support program comprises 4-items regarding the respondent's perceptions of the appropriateness of the intervention. Responses range from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). Scale value is computed by averaging responses and ranges from 1-5. Higher values indicate greater appropriateness of the intervention., at 6 months|Post-intervention Qualitative interviews, Post-intervention qualitative interviews with participants will also explore their perceptions of the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, including suggestions for improvement of the intervention. These semi-structured interviews will also help explore participant's opinions related to program length, time, usefulness, and delivery., at 6 months|Intervention usage, Intervention usage (i.e. proportion of sessions attended by each participant) will be calculated based on attendance lists for each session collected by the session facilitators. Reasons for non-attendance or early drop-out from a session will be collected, but this is optional for participants., at 6 months
