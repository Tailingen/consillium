Serum Metabolomics Study of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex, heterogeneous disorder, which produces in 5-20% reproductive age women. In this study, a nontargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry will be used to investigate serum metabolic characteristics of PCOS. PCOS women and healthy control will be divided into two distinct groups based on multivariate statistical analysis. The findings of this study will offer a new insight to understand the pathogenesis mechanism, and the discriminating metabolites may provide a prospect for PCOS diagnosis.
