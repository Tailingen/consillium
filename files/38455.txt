A Study to Test Performance of Needle Placements for Neuraxial Procedures Using Tactile Imaging vs Control
This study will compare the VerTouch device to the conventional palpation technique for performing diagnostic and therapeutic neuraxial procedures.

Number of Insertion Attempts, Any forward movement of the needle following puncture of the skin, counted until confirmation of spinal canal access can be assessed., End of procedure, 1 per participant
Incidence of First-insertion Success, A case that does not require any reinsertions, but can include any number of redirections., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Number of Redirections, Any forward movement of the needle in a new direction not preceded by withdrawal from the skin, counted until confirmation of spinal canal access can be assessed., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Number of Passes, Any forward movement of the needle, calculated as the sum of insertions and redirections., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Incidence of First-pass Success, A case that does not require reinsertions or redirections., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Subject Discomfort During Landmarking, Evaluated using a 10-point Numeric Pain Rating Scale, where 1 is equivalent to no pain and 10 is equivalent to the worst possible pain., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Provider Confidence With the Identified Insertion Site, Evaluated using a 1-5 point Numeric Rating Scale where 1 is equivalent to not at all confident and 5 equivalent to completely confident., End of procedure, 1 per subject
Localization Time, Time from first touch of draped patient to identification of an insertion site; for VerTouch, this is the time from VerTouch device placement to movement of the applicator to the identified insertion site., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Insertion Time, Time from retrieval of marker or local-anesthetic assembly until no further needle advancements are made., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Total Procedure Time, From positioning of the patient to removal of the drape from the subject's back., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Bone Contacts, Number of times the needle contacts bone, counted until confirmation of spinal canal access can be assessed., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Incidence of Unintended Dural Puncture, A case that results in puncture of the dura when it is not intended (i.e., in an epidural procedure)., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Incidence of Paresthesia During Needle Insertion, A case in which paresthesia is experienced during needle insertion., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Incidence of Traumatic Tap, A case that results in visible blood aspiration., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Incidence of Referral to Radiology, A case in which the provider cannot perform the procedure at the bedside and refers the subject to radiology for the procedure to be completed under fluoroscopic guidance., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Incidence of Conversion From Spinal to Epidural, A case that the provider opts to complete using epidural anesthesia instead of spinal anesthesia., End of procedure, 1 per subject|Incidence of Post-dural Puncture Headache, A case that results in the patient experiencing one or more headache of any level of severity after the procedure and/or at follow-up., Follow up, 3Â±2 days after procedure, 1 per subject
Neuraxial procedures, in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal through a gap in the vertebrae, are performed at a rate of nearly 13 million per year in the US, across a myriad of diagnostic and therapeutic clinical scenarios.

The standard of care involves manual palpation of the patient's back to detect the spinous processes (SPs) and estimate the location of the interspinous needle insertion site. While providers are trained to perform these procedures with meticulous precision and attention to detail, this technique remains highly inaccurate, often requiring multiple insertion attempts to properly place the needle. These attempts lead to patient pain and complications, such as traumatic taps and post-dural puncture (PDPH) headaches; unpredictable procedure times; and poor facility throughput.

The VerTouch device uses tactile imaging to offer a non-invasive, untethered, non radiation-producing solution for visualizing spinal anatomy in order to identify an ideal location for needle placement in a neuraxial procedure. The device can be used to mark the identified site with a surgical marker, or to begin placement of a needle or introducer at that site.

Study participants will be recruited in two parallel cohorts: the control (palpation) group or the tactile imaging (VerTouch) group, further stratified by procedure setting, including emergency medicine, neurology, and anesthesiology. Once an insertion site is marked with a marker or shallow placement of a needle or introducer, the procedure will continue in the usual manner for subjects in both groups.
