Body Fat Distribution and Its Associated Factors in Chinese Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
To investigate the body fat distribution in chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the association of those distribution with metabolic parameters, microeconomics, hormone profiles and psychological state.
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
OTHER: Clinical data collection
body fat content and ratio, Examined with a body composition analyzer (Tanita Corporation, model MC-180, Japan), Baseline
Body mass index (BMI), Weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, reported in kg/m2, Baseline|Waist circumference(WC), Waist circumference（WC）reported in cm, refers to the horizontal circumference along the midpoint of the connection line of the anterior superior iliac crest through the lower costal margin of the calm breathing state when standing. Recumbent position is the abdominal circumference through the girth of the navel., Baseline|Hip circumference, Hip circumference reported in cm, and when measured, the legs are upright and closed together, the arms are naturally pendulous, and the tape measure is placed horizontally on the pubic symphysis in front and the gluteus maximus in the back., Baseline|Waist-hip ratio (WHR), Waist-to-hip ratio, Baseline|Fat content and ratio of trunk, Examined with a body composition analyzer (Tanita Corporation, model MC-180, Japan), Baseline|Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Examined with the blood sample, Baseline|luteinizing hormone (LH), Examined with the blood sample, Baseline|Progestin (P), Examined with the blood sample, Baseline|Estrogen (E2), Examined with the blood sample, Baseline|Prolactin (PRL), Examined with the blood sample, Baseline|Androgen(T), Examined with the blood sample, Baseline|Androstenedione (A2), Examined with the blood sample, Baseline|Glucose, Examined with the blood sample, Baseline|Insulin, Examined with the blood sample, Baseline|HOMA-IR, calculation of HOMA-IR: \[fasting insulin (μU/mL) × fasting glucose (mmol/L)\] / 22.5), Baseline|HOMA- β, calculation of HOMA-β: 20 × fasting insulin (mU/mL) / (fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) - 3.5) (%), Baseline|total cholesterol, examined with the blood sample, Baseline|triglycerides, examined with the blood sample, Baseline|high density lipoprotein (HDL), examined with the blood sample, Baseline|low density lipoprotein (LDL), examined with the blood sample examined with the blood sample, Baseline|β-endorphin, examined with the blood sample, Baseline|5- hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), examined with the blood sample, Baseline|Dopamine(DA), examined with the blood sample, Baseline|lipometabonomics, examined with the blood sample, Baseline|bile acid, examined with the blood sample (fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) - 3.5) (%), Baseline|FerrimanGallwey (FG )value, To determine changes in women's hairy with FG rating scale (0-36 score), the higher, the worse, Baseline|short form-36 (SF36), determine the health quality of life by the questionnaire of SF36 (0-100 score), the higher, the better, Baseline|Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), determine the anxiety level with the questionnaire of SAS (20-100 score), the higher, the worse., Baseline|Self-Rating Depress Scale (SDS), determine the depress level with the questionnaire of SDS (20-100 score), the higher, the worse, Baseline|Preserved Stress Scale (PSS), determine the stress level with the questionnaire of SDS (14-56 score), the higher, the worse, Baseline
The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine and metabolic disorders in women of reproductive age. It is also one of the leading causes of anovulatory infertility and secondary amenorrhea, which represent major stress factors in the female life. In the previous studies, the investigators found that PCOS patients showed decreased quality-of-life and increased psychological disturbances compared with healthy controls. Body mass index (BMI) was associated with emotional disorders and physical aspects of quality-of-life and negative emotions were negatively correlated with BMI in PCOS patients.These results prompted that PCOS could be separated into at least two subtypes by the fat content. So the investigators expand the epidemiological investigation for comparing the body composition between the PCOS and the normal women, and finding specific biological indicators in different subtypes.
