Oxaliplatin and Paclitaxel in Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining oxaliplatin with paclitaxel in treating patients who have locally recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the objective response rates for the combination of paclitaxel and oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent cervical cancer.

II. To determine the toxicities and recovery from toxicities of patients with cervical cancer receiving paclitaxel and oxaliplatin.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed ever 3 months.
