S 81694 Plus Paclitaxel in Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the associated dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of S 81694 in combination with paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients, and to investigate the antitumour activity of the combination in metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) patients.
