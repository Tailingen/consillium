In this study, an index event is a start of ribociclib+ET treatment. Post-index follow-up period is 24 months or until treatment discontinuation. The recruitment period is planned for 12 months. The interim analyses will be performed after enrollment is complete, and further one year later. Patients will visit the sites in accordance with routine clinical practice. It is assumed according to the clinical practice that visits will be conducted every 3-4 months. Patients will undergo standard procedures and tests according to clinical guidelines and physician's judgement.
