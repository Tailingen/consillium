Therapeutic Effects of Immuno-targeted Therapy Combined With or Without RT for HCC
The objective of this retrospective cohort study is to investigate the therapeutic effects of combined immunotherapy and targeted therapy, with or without radiotherapy, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

The main question it aims to answer is:

Does the addition of radiotherapy to immunotherapy and targeted therapy enhance the therapeutic effect more significantly compared to immunotherapy and targeted therapy alone for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma?
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival is defined as the duration between the date of of initial administration of targeted therapy and immunotherapy to the date of first documented progression or death due to any cause or date of last follow-up, whichever is earlier., Up to 2 years
Overall Survival, Overall survival is defined as the duration between the date of initial administration of targeted therapy and immunotherapy to the date of death due to any cause or the date of last follow-up, whichever is earlier., Up to 2 years|Treatment-related Adverse Effects, At baseline and at subsequent follow up till 2 years based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0, Up to 2 years
A retrospective analysis will be conducted on the clinical data of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent combined immunotherapy and targeted therapy with radiotherapy, as well as those who received immunotherapy and targeted therapy alone, at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2023. The pmary objective is to assess the disparities in treatment efficacy and treatment-related adverse events between the two cohorts.
