Comparative Effectiveness of CTC & OC
The goal of this study is to compare the findings of virtual (CT-colonography) with findings of optical colonoscopies to determine if virtual colonoscopy is suitable for colorectal cancer surveillance.
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Optical colonoscopy|RADIATION: CT-Colonography
Compare the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value) of Computed Tomography colonography (CT-C) in the post Colorectal cancer resection using optical colonoscopy as the reference standard, To evaluate the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value) of CT colonography (CT-C) for detecting colorectal adenomas and cancers in the post-CRC resection surveillance setting, using optical colonoscopy (OC) as the reference standard., One year post colorectal cancer resection
Compare the costs and outcomes of Computed Tomography Colonography versus independent Optical Colonoscopy plus Computed Tomography for post Colorectal Cancer resection surveillance., Compare the costs and outcomes, from third party payor and societal perspectives, of CT-C versus independent OC plus CT for post CRC resection surveillance, using standard methods of cost-effectiveness analysis., One year post colorectral cancer resection
The goal of this study is to compare, both clinically and from a cost-effectiveness perspective, virtual or CT-C (CT-Colonography) to standard CT scan and optical colonoscopy (OC). Virtual colonoscopy is a combination of a radiologic evaluation of the abdomen and pelvis with intra-colonic imaging. Previous research supports the concept that CT-C may be an effective substitute for the current OC and address limited compliance for surveillance for CRC survivors. Post-operative CRC surveillance strategies are effective, but depend upon patient compliance which is less than desired. Improved adherence is linked with greater cost-effectiveness as well as better clinical outcomes. CT-C possesses potential advantages: convenience as a single test, less risk, possibly patient preference and lower total costs. Costs would be reduced through direct (provision of fewer optical colonoscopies) and indirect means (reduction in time lost from work by patient and chaperone, etc.). When extrapolated across the roughly 200,000 OCs performed annually in the US for this indication reduced utilization of even 50% in a high unit cost procedure like OC would yield substantial savings without a reduction in clinical quality.
