Safety and Pharmacokinetic Study of CVM-1118 Extended-Release in Advanced Cancer Patients
CVM-1118 Immediate-release (IR) Capsule and CVM-1118 Extended-release (ER) Capsule are proprietary oncology products developed by TaiRx, Inc. for the treatment of patients suffering from advanced cancer. Due to the short elimination half-life of CVM-1118 IR capsules, the extended release (ER) formulation, containing mini-tablets in hard capsule, has been developed to prolong the drug absorption and longer exposure after oral administration. The designed dose of CVM-1118 ER was 200 mg per capsule to provide a more patient-compliant and safe dosage of CVM-1118. The clinical study CVMEX-001 is therefore designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of CVM-1118 extend release (ER) Capsule (200 mg/capsule) in patients with advanced cancer.

Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of CVM-1118 ER Capsule, Dose escalation will occur until DLT occurs in 2 or more patients within a dose level. In any cohort, if 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be enrolled to that dose level. If 2 or more patients experience a DLT, no further dose escalation will occur., up to 28 days|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CVM-1118 ER Capsule, The MTD will be defined as the dose level at which at most one of six patients experiences a DLT after 28 days of treatment have occurred, with the next higher dose having at least 2/3 or 2/6 patients experiencing a DLT. The Safety Committee may expand the cohort beyond six patients to better define the safety profile of this cohort in the search for the MTD., up to 28 days
Preliminary assessment of anti-tumor activity of CVM-1118 ER Capsule, RECIST 1.1 for solid tumor and Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma, up to 56 days|Measure of plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of CVM-1118 and its metabolite CVM-1125 to include AUC(0-last), AUC(0-last): area under the plasma concentration versus time curve to the time of the last measurable concentration, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15: pre-dose, 2, 3.5, 5, 7, 9, and 12 hours post dose|Measure of plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of CVM-1118 and its metabolite CVM-1125 to include Cmax, Cmax: Maximum plasma concentration, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15: pre-dose, 2, 3.5, 5, 7, 9, and 12 hours post dose|Measure of plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of CVM-1118 and its metabolite CVM-1125 to include Tmax, Tmax: Time to maximum plasma concentration, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15: pre-dose, 2, 3.5, 5, 7, 9, and 12 hours post dose|Measure of plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of CVM-1118 and its metabolite CVM-1125 to include T(1/2), T(1/2): Terminal elimination half-life, Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 15: pre-dose, 2, 3.5, 5, 7, 9, and 12 hours post dose|Time to tumor progression (TTP), Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from the first dose of study drug to the time of progression, up to 112 days
The CVM-1118 ER Capsule will be orally administered BID or TID before meal in 28-day treatment cycles. Patients will receive 400, 600, 800 to 1,200 mg of CVM-1118 ER Capsule in sequential cohort based on safety and dose tolerability. A single-patient cohort per dose level (accelerated titration design) will be applied to the first two cohorts, 400 and 600 mg daily, and followed by the conventional 3+3 dose escalation design from the dose level of 800 mg/day. Within the first two cohorts, if any Grade 2 or greater toxicity at least possibly attributable to CVM-1118 ER capsule is reported in the first patient during first cycle, a single-patient cohort will be converted to conventional 3+3 study design once and expand to a minimum of 3 evaluable patients for assessment of toxicity within the first cycle. Dose escalation will occur until DLT occurs in 2 or more patients within a dose level. In any cohort, if 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be enrolled to that dose level. If 2 or more patients experience a DLT, no further dose escalation will occur. Plasma pharmacokinetics samples will be collected at pre-determined time-points for all patients participating in the dose-escalation study.

This study will be completed and closed once the MTD is determined for CVM-1118 ER capsules. However, at the end of 4 cycles, it is recommended that some patients should continue receiving the clinical benefit from CVM-1118 ER capsules. Thus, patients may be continuously treated at the assigned dose level or next higher dose level provided it has been shown to be safe in a previously treated cohort by safety committee, until the treating physician feels the patient is no longer benefiting from the treatment, or CVM-1118 ER Capsule becomes commercially available, as applicable in the country in which the patient lives. In the event of unacceptable toxicity at a given dose, CVM-1118 can be reduced to the previous dose level or suggested lower dose by PI. If unacceptable toxicity persists despite 2 dose reductions, the patient should be removed from study.
