Characteristics and Clinical Significance of Gut Microbiota in Patients With Monoclonal Gammopathy
This is an observational case-control study, aiming to systematically analyze the gut microbiome characteristics of patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The study will collect blood and stool samples from MGUS patients, non-MGUS patients (with similar diseases), and healthy controls, and perform multi-omics detection including microbiomics, peptidomics, and biochemical immunology. It will comprehensively analyze the abnormal features of the gut microbiome in MGUS patients, which may help provide new biomarkers and potential mechanisms for the diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and treatment strategies of MGUS.

M-protein detection, Plasma samples from all patients will be screened and qualitatively analysed for M proteins using MALDI-TOF MS to determine the presence of patients with monoclonal gammaglobulinemia., 24 months|microbiome, To assess the value of the microbiome in predicting the prognosis of patients with monoclonal gammopathy and in diagnosing co-morbidities. To analyse the microbial composition of patient stool samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics., 24 months|metabonomics, To assess changes in plasma metabolomics in patients with monoclonal gammaglobulinaemia. Metabolomics is a large-scale study of small molecules such as fatty acids, bile acids, and lipid mediators., 24 months
This is a case-control, observational single-center study aiming to investigate the impact of common comorbidities on gut microbiome structure and disease progression in patients with monoclonal gammopathy. We plan to collect samples from 11 disease categories, with each category including two groups (monoclonal gammopathy and non-monoclonal gammopathy), as well as 700 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, for a total of 2,990 samples. At enrollment, we will collect whole blood, plasma, serum, and fecal samples from the study participants, and obtain relevant information such as demographic characteristics, lifestyle, family medical history, and medication use.We will perform metagenomic, proteomic, and serum biochemical and immunological analyses on the samples to directly obtain association data between gut microbiome characteristics (as exposure factors) and clinical outcomes (as endpoints). This study will systematically analyze the dysbiosis characteristics of the gut microbiome in monoclonal gammopathy patients, identify key microbial biomarkers, and compare the microbiome structure and clinical laboratory indices between MGUS patients and different comorbidity subgroups, to explore their impact on the disease diagnostic model.
