Shear Wave Elastography of Prostate Cancer
Evaluation of significant Shear Wave Elastography Parameters for Prostate Biopsy and Prostate Cancer detection.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: Transrectal shear wave elastography of the prostate|PROCEDURE: Transrectal random biopsy of the prostate
Shear wave elastography, transrectal shear wave elastography with detection of prostate tissue pressure \[kilo-Pascal\] in correspondence to biopsy areas, 12 Months
Differentiation of Entity by Elastography, Elasticity and location of benign (normal, benign prostate hyperplasia) or malignant tissue (Prostate Cancer), 12 Months|Differentiation of benign tissue elasticity depending on prostate Location (Basis, Mid, Apex), Differentiation of benign tissue elasticity depending on prostate Location (Basis, Mid, Apex), 12 Months|Differentiation of Prostate cancer malignity by Elastography, Differentiation of low-risk versus intermediate and high-risk Prostate cancer malignity (Gleason score 6 vs. 7-10) by Elastography, 12 Months|Histopathological Analysis, Histopathological Analysis of biopsy specimen: benign prostate hyperplasia, 12 Months
This Study will evaluate the Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) Parameters for Prostate Biopsy and Prostate Cancer detection.
