CMP-001 in Combination With Nivolumab in Subjects With Advanced Melanoma
CMP-001-010 is a Phase 2 study of CMP-001 intratumoral (IT) and nivolumab intravenous (IV) administered to participants with refractory unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

The primary objective of the study is to determine confirmed objective response with CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in subjects with refractory unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

The secondary objectives are to:

* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMP-001 administered by intratumoral (IT) injection in combination with nivolumab in subjects with refractory unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
* To evaluate the efficacy of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in subjects with refractory unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
* To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in subjects with refractory unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
* To assess and describe the immunogenicity of CMP-001 in combination with nivolumab in subjects with refractory unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
