SUrGery With or Without dARolutamide in High-risk and/or Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer
This is a phase II, multicenter, randomized open-label and comparative trial designed to study the effectiveness and the safety of androgen receptor antagonist (darolutamide) combined with surgery in patients with high-risk and/or locally advanced prostate cancer.

In this trial, patients will be assigned in one of the two following treatments arms:

* Arm A (control arm): Surgery alone (radical prostatectomy with lymph node dissection)
* Arm B (experimental arm): Peri-operative darolutamide + surgery (radical prostatectomy with lymph node dissection)

A total of 240 patients will have to be randomized with 120 patients in the control arm and 120 patients in the experimental arm.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Surgery alone|DRUG: Peri-operative darolutamide + surgery.
The non-curable progression-free survival (NC-PFS) defined as the time from randomization to non-curable event., 5 years for each patient
Metastatic-Free Survival (MFS) defined as the time from randomization to the appearance of distant metastasis or death from any cause., 5 years for each patient|PSA-RFS (Recurrence-Free survival) defined as the time from randomization to PSA recurrence according to the European Association of Urology (EAU) criteria or death from any cause., 5 years for each patient|Overall Survival (OS) defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., 5 years for each patient|pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate defined as the number of patients presenting a pathological complete response (i.e., absence of residual tumor found in the surgery specimens) divided by the number of patients in the experimental arm., 5 years for each patient|Safety assessed using the NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0., 3 years for each patient|Quality of life will evaluated using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire., Subscale Domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, Functional Well-Being, Prostate Cancer Subscale.

Responses to questions use a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 ("not at all") to 4 ("very much so")., 1 year for each patient|Quality of life will evaluated using the 5-level EuroQol 5-Dimensional (EQ5D-5L) questionnaire., The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems., 1 year for each patient|Quality of life will evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire., The I-PSS is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms. Each question is assigned points from 0 (never) to 5 (almost always)., 1 year for each patient|Quality of life will evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15) questionnaire., The IIEF is a 15-item questionnaire containing five domains including erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction. Each item is rated from 0 (or 1) (Severe ED/No sexual activity) to 5 (Mild/No ED)., 1 year for each patient
