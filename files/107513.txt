DRUG: sorafenib
To Determine the Efficacy (Best Response) of BAY 43-9006 (Objective Response Rate and Stable Disease) in Patients With Metastatic Thyroid Carcinoma., Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
Median Progression Free Survival in Patients Receiving BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib)., This is the result of the Kaplan Meier analysis of all patients treated with sorafenib, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months
The goal of this study is to determine the activity of sorafenib in patients with advanced (metastatic or recurrent) thyroid cancer.
