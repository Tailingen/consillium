Olanzapine Improves the Chemotherapy Tolerance of Advanced Gastric Cancer
To explore whether adding olanzapine to paclitaxel chemotherapy could improve chemotherapy tolerance and improve patient quality of life and prolong treatment failure time (TTF) in advanced gastric cancer after failure of first-line chemotherapy.

This is a multi-center prospective randomized controlled open clinical study. Patients will formally be enrolled after they had been screened and signed informed consent. Baseline examinations will be started after entry into the group. Those who meet the criteria for inclusion and exclusion were dynamically randomized at 1: 1. The experimental group will receive olanzapine and paclitaxel until treatment failure and the control group will receive paclitaxel until treatment failure.
