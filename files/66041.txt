Evaluating the Safety of Long Term Dosing of Romiplostim (Formerly AMG 531) in Thrombocytopenic Subjects With Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)
This is an open label extension study of romiplostim for treatment of thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤ 50 x 10\^9/L) in MDS subjects. The study is designed to assess the long-term safety of treatment with romiplostim, as measured by incidence of overall adverse events, the incidence of bleeding events, the utilization of platelet transfusions, and the duration of platelet response. The study will further describe the time to disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and survival.

Overall Summary of Adverse Events, During treatment period from first dose of IP to End of Study visit, on Average 56 Weeks .|Incidence of Antibody (AB) Formation, During treatment period from first dose of IP to End of Study visit, on Average 56 Weeks.
Weekly Bleeding Events Per 100 Subject Years, During the time since the first dose of IP to the end of the treatment period. A single bleeding event was defined as each individual bleeding episode that originated from a specific organ system (eg, gastrointestinal system or central nervous system). A bleeding event that continued for more than 7 days was counted as separate events every eighth day., During the treatment period. The average duration of romiplostim exposure is 56 weeks.|Platelet Transfusion Events Per 100 Subject Years, During the time since the first dose of IP to the end of the treatment period. A discrete platelet transfusion event was defined as any number of platelet transfusions administered within a 3-day period. Platelet transfusions administered more than 3 days apart were counted as separate platelet transfusion events., During the treatment period. The average duration of romiplostim exposure is 56 weeks.|Weeks With Platelet Response Per Year, During the time since the first dose of IP to the end of the treatment period. Platelet response was based on the modified IWG 2006 criteria (Cheson et al, 2006) and was defined as, in the absence of platelet transfusion: an absolute increase in platelet count of ≥ 30 x 10\^9/L for a subject starting with a platelet count of ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L; or an increase in platelet count from \< 20 x 10\^9/L to ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L and by at least 100% in a subject that started with a platelet count \< 20 x 10\^9/L., During the treatment period. The average duration of romiplostim exposure is 56 weeks.|Time to First Platelet Response, Time since first dose of IP to the first platelet response. Platelet response was based on the modified IWG 2006 criteria (Cheson et al, 2006) and was defined as, in the absence of platelet transfusion: an absolute increase in platelet count of ≥ 30 x 10\^9/L for a subject starting with a platelet count of ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L; or an increase in platelet count from \< 20 x 10\^9/L to ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L and by at least 100% in a subject that started with a platelet count \< 20 x 10\^9/L., During treatment period. The average duration of romiplostim exposure is 56 weeks.|Duration of Platelet Response, Platelet response was based on the modified IWG 2006 criteria (Cheson et al, 2006) and was defined as, in the absence of platelet transfusion: an absolute increase in platelet count of ≥ 30 x 10\^9/L for a subject starting with a platelet count of ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L; or an increase in platelet count from \< 20 x 10\^9/L to ≥ 20 x 10\^9/L and by at least 100% in a subject that started with a platelet count \< 20 x 10\^9/L., During treatment period.
