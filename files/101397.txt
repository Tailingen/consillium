Mid-Atlantic Research Group Single-Operator Cholangioscopic Assessment of Biliary Strictures
The purpose of this study is to determine if cholangioscopically-directed biopsies provide a higher diagnostic yield for malignancy in the setting of indeterminate biliary strictures when compared to standard means of sampling.
Biliary Tract Neoplasms
DEVICE: SOC-directed biopsies using the SpyGlass System
Number of malignant diagnoses across hree-sample techniques (Spy bite, forceps biopsy, brushings), Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three-sample technique (Spy bite, forceps biopsy, brushings) compared to the two-sample technique (forceps biopsy and brushing) in differentiating malignant from benign biliary strictures, 72 Hours
Number of patients who receive additional diagnostic studies without receiving a cancer diagnosis, Patients who receive a repeat ERCP with sampling, cross-sectional imaging, EUS-FNA, IR-guided biopsies, laparoscopy, 1 year|Endoscopic Satisfaction with SOC-directed biopsy, Endoscopist subjective outcomes using a Likert scale 1-5

* Ease of obtaining the biopsies
* Confidence that the biopsy was taken from the target lesion
* Confidence that an adequate sample was obtained from the biopsy
* Clinical impression of malignant disease, 2 hours|Time from procedure to the initiation of treatment (in cases of malignancy), 1 year
Biliary strictures in the absence of a mass are a clinical challenge, as current accepted means of sampling provide suboptimal accuracy. Both biliary brushings for cytology and fluoroscopically-directed biopsies produce highly-variable results. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration has also been employed with variable results. An additional modality, using a single-operator cholangioscope during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to obtain cholangioscopically-directed biopsies offers promise in increasing the yield of sampling. Initial observational studies have shown an improved diagnostic yield, but the technique has not been tested in a randomized, medical effectiveness study to better characterize its actual clinical impact. We aim to compare the technique of biopsy-on-biopsy derived sampling via single-operator cholangioscopy with standard fluoroscopically-directed biopsies and brushings in a pilot study. We also aim to perform a medical effectiveness study on the early use of single-operator cholangioscopically (SOC) in the evaluation of undiagnosed biliary strictures.
