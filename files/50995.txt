MAGIC AKI: Magnesium for the Prevention of HIOC-Associated AKI
In this research study, investigators will test whether prophylactic high-dose IV Mg administration attenuates the risk of AKI in patients with malignant mesothelioma receiving intraoperative chemotherapy (HIOC) with cisplatin compared to placebo

DRUG: Magnesium sulfate|DRUG: Normal Saline
AUC of SCr measured daily over 7 days in Mg- versus placebo-treated patients, The primary endpoint is the area under the curve (AUC) of SCr measured daily over 7 days in Mg- versus placebo-treated patients, 7 days|Composite Global Rank, As a secondary endpoint, investigators will construct a composite global rank endpoint in which the highest rank is assigned to those who die within 7 days, the second highest rank is assigned to those who survive but require RRT within 7 days, and all others ranked according to their SCr AUC, since RRT and death are important competing risks., 7 days
Incident AKI, Urine output \<0.5 ml/kg/h x consecutive 6 hours in the first 48 hours following surgery with HIOC (this will only be assessed for the first 48 hours, as patients are transferred out of the ICU and/or their foley is removed, which prevents accurate hourly assessment of UOP); An absolute increase in SCr ≥0.3 mg/dl within 48 hours; C) A relative increase in SCr ≥50% compared to the baseline value in the first 7 days; D) Receipt of RRT in the first 7 days, 7 days|Composite outcome of RRT/in-hospital death, Composite outcome, 7 days|Maximum AKI stage, Based on KDIGO staging, 7 days|Renal tubular injury, AUC of uNGAL, uKIM-1, and pKIM-1 at hours +4, +12, and +36 in relation to HIOC administration, 2 days|AUC for platinum concentrations, Using blood and urine collected at various time points, 2 days|Vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS), Assessed every 4 hours for the first 24 hours, and then every 8 hours for the next 24 hours, in relation to the start of the Mg infusion. The VIS is a validated method for integrating all vasoactive medications (i.e., vasopressors and inotropes) and their doses on an hourly basis into a single measure, and has been used in multiple settings, 2 days|Proportion of patients with serum Mg levels in the 3-5 mg/dl range in the treatment group, Between hours +8 and +24 in relation to the start of the Mg infusion, 1 day|New onset of atrial fibrillation, Confirmed on an EKG, 7 days|Myocardial injury, Defined as clinical evidence of myocardial injury and a troponin level above the 99th percentile, 7 days
In this phase 2, open-label randomized, placebo-controlled trial, investigators will test whether prophylactic high-dose IV Mg administration attenuates the risk of HIOC-associated AKI in patients with malignant mesothelioma undergoing surgery with HIOCC. Investigators will randomly assign 130 patients to receive IV Mg versus an equal volume of normal saline (0.9% NS) placebo, of whom it is anticipated 80 will complete the study. Investigators will also collect blood and urine pre- and postoperatively for exploration of secondary outcomes.

Investigators will screen for eligibility at participant's preoperative visit with their thoracic surgeon. Intravenous magnesium will be administered as a continuous infusion, soon after induction and stabilization by anesthesia in the operating room. The magnesium drip will start at 1 g/hour and will be titrated to achieve target levels of 3-5 mg/dl. The total duration of the infusion will be 24 hours.
