Reduced-Intensity Conditioning (RIC) and Myeloablative Conditioning (MAC) for HSCT in AML/MDS
The purpose of this study is to compare safety and efficacy of reduced-intensity conditioning and myeloablative conditioning regimens prior to HSCT in high-risk AML/MDS pediatric and young adult patients. This study investigates the use of two novel conditioning therapies for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The primary focus of both the investigators' myeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens is to reduce overall toxicity so that pediatric and young adult patients with high-risk AML/MDS with significant pretransplant comorbidities who would have been ineligible to proceed to HSCT previously can now receive potentially life-saving treatment.
