Radiofrequency Ablation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Octopus MP Electrodes
This study is to investigate the therapeutic effect and treatment results of radiofrequency ablation using the Octopus MP electrode capable of temperature monitoring and drug injection and a variable-length electrode for treatment of small hepatocellular carcinomas (≤ 3cm).
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Radiofrequency ablation
