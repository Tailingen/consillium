Assessment of QoL and Outcomes With SBRT for RCC
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an emerging radiotherapy technique that precisely delivers high doses of radiation to tumours. It has been investigated as definitive treatment for an increasing variety of primary tumours including lung, liver, prostate, and now renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The principal aims of this study are to prospectively assess quality of life (QoL) and oncologic outcomes in non-surgical patients who receive SBRT for the treatment of RCC.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: SBRT
Patient Quality of Life, To evaluate quality of life scores, Up to 5 years after treatment
Cost-Effectiveness, To assess health utility scores and correlate with QoL, Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Oncologic Outcomes, To evaluate local control, Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Oncologic Outcomes, To evaluate progression-free survival, Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Oncologic Outcomes, To evaluate overall survival, Up to 5 years after completion of treatment|Treatment-Related Toxicity, To report number of participants with treatment-related toxicities as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Up to 5 years after completion of treatment
There is an evolving body of literature that shows high rates of tumour control and minimal associated toxicities with SBRT to treat RCC. However, the majority of published evidence is retrospective in nature, and there is a scarcity of data on the impact on quality of life and cost-effectiveness of kidney SBRT.

The principal aims of this multicentre study are to prospectively assess QoL and oncologic outcomes in non-surgical patients who receive SBRT for the treatment of primary renal cell carcinoma.

The study population will include 30 consecutive patients treated with kidney SBRT on a conventional linear accelerator (35-40 Gy in 5 fractions) at the Odette Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto (OCC) and the Juravinski Cancer Center, Hamilton Health Sciences Centre, McMaster University (JCC).
