Study of Metformin With Carboplatin/Paclitaxel Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer
Molecularly targeted agents which inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and/or circumvent p53 in the induction of apoptosis are exciting potential targets in ovarian cancer. Metformin is a biguanide, widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, that has shown anti-cancer activity in preclinical studies. The main mechanism of metformin's effect is mTOR pathway inhibition and, in addition, it has been shown to circumvent p53-induced apoptosis making it an exciting, potentially effective drug in ovarian cancer.
Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Metformin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Number of participants with Adverse Events as a measure of safety and tolerability, Data will be used to determine recommended phase 2 dose, 1-2 years
Pharmacokinetics (AUC, Tmax,Cmax) of carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapie, 1-2 years
A phase Ib, single-centre, dose-escalation trial with a traditional escalation rule with fixed dose levels ("3 + 3" rule). The recommended phase II dose will be defined as the maximum predefined dose level at which 0 of 3 or â‰¤ 1 of 6 subjects experience a drug-related dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1 and 2 of treatment. An estimated 10-20 patients will be required for this study.
