Immunohistochemical Expression of CXCL5 as a Valuable Prognostic Marker in Urinary Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma
Urothelial carcinoma is common malignant tumor worldwide, it remains a challenge in the oncology field, it is an ideal for research on biomarkers that could identify tumor progression and prognosis. CXCL5 have been implicated in progression of many cancers, but their significance in urinary bladder UC remains unclear.

assess the expression of CXCL5 in urothelial carcinoma, Immunohistochemical study, 1 month
Bladder carcinoma has become a common cancer globally, Incidence rates are highest in Europe, the United States and Egypt. In Egypt, bladder carcinoma was considered the third most common tumor; Egyptian males have the highest mortality rates. UC of the urinary bladder represents about 90% of all bladder cancers.

CXCL5 is a chemokine, belonging to â€—ELR+' subgroup. It plays an important role in angiogenesis and tumor migration. Numerous reports have indicated that CXCL5 plays important roles in cancer progression, including cholangiocarcinoma, prostate cancer, and gastric cancer. Studying the IHC expression of CXCL5 in UC to assess its role in tumor cell proliferation, migration and spread is needed.
