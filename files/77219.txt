Clinical Study of 18F-Alfatide Injection PET/CT
This is a multicenter, open, non-inferiority Phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of 18F-Alfatide Injection PET/CT compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer.

This trial will include 428 patients with non-small cell lung cancer confirmed by imaging, histopathology and/or cytology or highly suspected by investigators, suspected lymph node metastasis and proposed radical surgery and lymph node dissection. Eligible subjects will receive 18F-Alfatide Injection PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans within 1 week. Subjects will undergo relevant security checks before and after each scan. The subjects underwent radical surgery and lymph node dissection within 2 weeks of completing both scans, and the obtained lymph nodes were pathologically examined as the gold standard to compare the diagnostic efficacy of 18F-Alfatide versus 18F-FDG for lymph node metastasis.

DRUG: 18F-Alfatide Injection|DRUG: 18F-FDG Injection
Sensitivity and specificity evaluation of 18F-Alfatide Injection PET/CT compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT, To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-Alfatide Injection PET/CT in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT.All subjects in this study underwent 18F-Alfatide PET-CT and 18F-FDG PET-CT examination within one week, radical surgery and lymph node dissection within two weeks after the completion of the two scanning images, and pathological examination of the obtained lymph nodes was used as the gold standard., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years
Accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value evaluation of 18F-Alfatide Injection PET/CT compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT, To evaluate the accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 18F-Alfatide Injection PET/CT in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT.All subjects in this study underwent 18F-Alfatide PET-CT and 18F-FDG PET-CT examination within one week, radical surgery and lymph node dissection within two weeks after the completion of the two scanning images, and pathological examination of the obtained lymph nodes was used as the gold standard, Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, To evaluate the safety of 18F-Alfatide Injection PET/CT in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT.The safety will be assessed by the number and percentage of patients with adverse events; Adverse events were categorized using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0., Through study completion, assessed up to 2 years
