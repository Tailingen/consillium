SBRT+TACE+Sorafenib Vs Sorafenib in the Treatment of uHCC With PVTT
To evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of SBRT sequential TACE combined with sorafenib versus sorafenib alone in the treatment of unreactable HCC with PVTT.

Progression-free survival (PFS) rate, Progression is defined as progressive disease (PD) by independent radiologic review according to mRECIST criteria, termination of the assigned treatment, or death from any cause, assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test for treatment comparisons with the intention-to-treat principle., at 12 weeks after randomization
Radiologic response rate, Radiologic response rate by independent radiologic review according to mRECIST criteria , assessed by Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate., at 12 weeks after randomization|Overall patient survival rate, The median overall patient survival rate assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test for treatment comparisons., up to 2 years after randomization|Objective response rate, Objective response rate by independent radiologic review according to mRECIST criteria , assessed by Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate., at 12 weeks and up to 2 years after randomization|Disease control rate, Disease control rate by independent radiologic review according to mRECIST criteria , assessed by Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate., at 12 weeks and up to 2 years after randomization
HCC Patients classified as BCLC stage C present with PVTT, and the recommended first-line treatment is systemic therapy with sorafenib according to updated Barcelona Clinical Liver cancer (BCLC) treatment algorithms.However, recent data from observational studies suggest that the combination of TACE and SBRT would be as effective as sorafenib.
