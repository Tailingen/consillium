A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Clinical Activity of JNJ-63723283, an Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody, in Participants With Advanced Cancers
The Primary purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose \[RP2D(s)\] for JNJ-63723283 in Part 1, to assess the anti-tumor activity of JNJ-63723283 at the RP2D(s) in participants with selected advanced cancers including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, renal, bladder, small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), gastric/esophageal cancer, and high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer (CRC) in Part 2, to determine one or more additional RP2Ds in Parts 3 and 4.
