A Study, Combination, Immunologic Study of LTX-315 as Adjunct to GV1001 in Patients Following Curative Surgery for Carcinoma
This study involves testing of the medicine LTX-315 combined with a cancer vaccine (GV1001). This will be tested in patients that have had surgery with curative intent for malignant tumour.

GV1001 is a peptide vaccine in development to treat cancer. An adjuvant, is required to start the immune response in the body to have effect of GV-1001.

LTX-315, also a peptide, in development for cancer treatment. In this study, the investigators wish to find out whether LTX-315 can make GV1001 more effective at stimulating the immune system.
Carcinoma
DRUG: LTX-315
Immunological effects of LTX-315 in combination with GV1001 as measured by DTH skin test reaction and T-cell function in peripheral blood., Patients will return to the site 24 to 48 hours after the LTX-315 and GV1001 injections for DTH assessment and in week 10 for an end of study assessment., 5 injections, treatment period 36 days
To evaluate the safety profile of LTX-315 in combination with GV1001 study, Assessment of adverse events and abnormal laboratory values recorded during the, 5 injections, treatment period 36 days
This clinical study has two main aims which are:

* To measure the immunological effects of LTX-315 in combination with GV1001
* Find out about the side effects of the combination of the two drugs This is an open label, single centre study assessing immunological effects and safety of LTX-315 given as an adjunct to GV1001. The LTX-315 dose will escalate while the GV1001 dose will be fixed.

LTX-315 and GV1001 will be given as intradermal injections on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 36.

Investigational treatment: LTX-315 (0.10 mL) with escalating concentrations will be injected intradermally, followed, 1-2 hours later, by intradermal injection of 0.56 mg GV1001 (0.20 mL, 2.8 mg/mL) in the same site, in one arm.

DTH-test control: 0.10 mg GV1001 (0.10 mL) will be injected intradermally in the contralateral arm without LTX-315, as a DTH skin reactivity test control.
