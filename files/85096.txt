Phase I Evaluating the Combination of Ribociclib+Capecitabine in Locally Advanced/Metastatic Breast Cancer HER2 Negative
The proposed study is a multicenter, open-label phase I trial, conducted in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer HER2 negative patients and divided into 2 parts:

* STEP 1: a dose escalation part (n= up to 30) to evaluate the safety profile and pharmacokinetics and to define the MTD and RP2D to recommend in a phase II.
* STEP 2: an expansion cohort part to confirm the safety and tolerability of ribociclib and capecitabine association on a longer follow-up, and to obtain preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity on two expanded cohorts of HR positive and HR negative patients. Up to 14 patients in each cohort, taking into account patients already included in step one at this DL, may be enrolled, for a total of 28 at the RP2D.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Combination of ribociclib + capecitabine
Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for phase 2 (RP2D) of ribociclib and capecitabine combination, Determination of MTD and RP2D of ribociclib and capecitabine combination, PO in a 21 day schedule (2 weeks on/1 week off), in subjects eligible to a capecitabine treatment, with locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer who failed anthracycline and taxane treatment., From baseline to the end of cycle 1, up to 21 days
Evaluate safety of ribociclib and capecitabine combination, Toxicities are graded according to the CTCAE V4, Toxicities will be assessed during the whole treatment period (6 months expected in average) followed by a 1-year post-treatment follow-up period, and reported during the visits scheduled by the study flow chart|Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ribociclib and capecitabine combination, The objective of the pharmacokinetics is to investigate the interactions between ribociclib and capecitabine, From baseline to the end of cycle 1, up to 21 days|Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of ribociclib and capecitabine combination, Anti-tumor activity of the ribociclib and capecitabine combination will be carried out according to RECIST criteria version 1.1., From baseline to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first, up to 18 months (estimated treatment duration average: 6 months)|Evaluate anti-tumor activity and safety of the ribociclib and capecitabine combination RP2D according to RH status, Anti-tumor activity (At baseline and every 6 weeks) according to RECIST criteria version 1.1. and Toxicities according to the CTCAE V4, From baseline to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first, up to 18 months (estimated treatment duration average: 6 months)|Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of ribociclib and capecitabine depending on Rb status, Anti-tumor activity of the ribociclib and capecitabine combination will be carried out according to RECIST criteria version 1.1., From baseline to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first, up to 18 months (estimated treatment duration average: 6 months)
Patients with HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, eligible to a capecitabine treatment as required by its approved indication, i.e previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes
