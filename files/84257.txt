NT-I7 in Combination With Nivolumab in Advanced Gastric, Gastro-Esophageal Junction or Esophageal Adenocarcinoma
The main purposes of the dose escalation part of this study is to determine the following in participants with gastric or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC):

* Safety and tolerability of NT-I7 in combination with nivolumab
* Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)

The main purposes of Phase 2 of this study is to make a preliminary assessment of the antitumor activity and long-term survival of NT-I7 in combination with nivolumab in participants with gastric or GEJ or EAC.

Note, this trial was intended to be a Phase 1/2 trial (but the trial never moved forward to Phase 2).
