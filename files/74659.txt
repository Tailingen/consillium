CD19/CD22-Dual-STAR-T for Patients With B Cell Acute Leukemia(B-ALL)
This is a single center, single arm, open-lable phase I study to determine the safety and efficacy of CD19/CD22-Dual-STAR-T cells in patients with refractory and relapsed B cell acute leukemia .
Refractory and Relapsed B Cell Acute Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CD19/CD22-Dual-STAR-T
Percentage of participants with adverse events., Percentage of participants with adverse events., 12 months
Objective Remission Rate(ORR), The percentage of participants who achieved complete remission(CR) and CR in over all participants., 12 months|Proliferation ratio of Dual-STAR-T cells, 12 months
Patients with B cell acute leukemia will be enrolled, and Subjects will receive cytoreductive chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine on days -5, -4 and -3 followed by infusion of Dual-STAR-T cells.Dual-STAR-T cells will be intravenously infused with a escalated dose of 6E5、1E6、2E6、3E6 cells/kg.The purpose of current study is to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of CD19/CD22-Dual-STAR-T cells therapy in patients with refractory and relapsed B-ALL.Safety and efficacy of Dual-STAR-T cells therapy will be monitored. The primary endpoint is the safety of Dual-STAR-T cells including the effect ratio of CRS and ICANS, ORR. The secondary endpoint is the Dual-STAR-T cell proliferation ratio and Dual-STAR gene copied number in peripheral blood（PB）， and progression free survival(PFS ), overall-survival(OS) and duration of overall response(DOR).
