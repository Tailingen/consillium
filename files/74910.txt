A Study of Nivolumab and Hydroxychloroquine or Nivolumab/Ipilimumab and Hydroxychloroquine in Advanced Melanoma
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy (objective response rate) of using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab or with nivolumab alone in subjects with advanced/metastatic melanoma.
Melanoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Hydroxychloroquine|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Phase 1: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) - Number of Subjects with Dose-limiting Toxicities, To determine the MTD and preliminary safety of HCQ when administered in conjunction with one of the following treatments in patients with advanced melanoma:

* HCQ administered in combination with nivolumab; or
* HCQ administered in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab followed by maintenance nivolumab, From first dose of protocol treatment to 16 to 32 weeks|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), To assess the ORR as measured by RECIST v1.1. in subjects with advanced melanoma, 12 months
Progression-free survival, The time from protocol treatment start to disease progression, death due to any cause, or last contact alive and progression-free over 24 months, From start of treatment to first progression, death due to any cause or last patient contact alive and progression-free over 24 months|1 year survival rate, Percentage of subjects alive at one year from start of treatment, From start of treatment to one year
There are three parts to this Phase 1/2 study in subjects with advanced melanoma:

Phase 1a will identify the MTD and preliminary safety of combination hydroxychloroquine and nivolumab therapy.

Phase 1b will identify the MTD and preliminary safety of hydroxychloroquine administered in conjunction with nivolumab and ipilimumab therapy

Phase 2 will assess the clinical efficacy of combination hydroxychloroquine and nivolumab therapy.
