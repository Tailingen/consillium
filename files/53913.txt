Pharmacokinetics and Tolerancebility Studies of Gentuximab Injection in the Treatment ofPatients With Late Recurrence of Metastatic Solid Tumors in China
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and, tolerabilitytolerance, pharmacokinetices and immunogenicity of escalating single doses and subsequent multiple dose of Gentuximab Injection in patients with late recurrence of metastatic solid tumors and to determine the maximum tolerated dose（MTD） and dose limiting toxicities（DLT）.with single and subsequent multiple intravenous infusion in patients with late recurrence of metastatic solid tumors and to provide a basis for the protocol design of later clinical trials.

The secondary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity, and tumor response of multiple dose of Gentuximab Injection in patients with late recurrence of metastatic solid tumors.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: Gentuximab Injection
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), Number of Participants With One or More Drug-Related Adverse Events (AEs) or Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). A summary of AEs and SAEs considered by the investigator to be drug-related is located in the Reported Adverse Events module. An AE is summarized if the onset date is on or after the first dose of study drug and within 30 days after the last dose, or it occurred before the first dose of study drug and worsened while on the therapy., Up to 7 weeks|Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) in single dose, Cycle 1(day1-day21)& Cycle 2(day 21-day 49): Predose, 15 minute, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours、day 3, day 4, day 7, day 14 after completion of infusion, Cohort 5 only)|Pharmacokinetics: Cmax in multiple dose, Predose and 15 minutes after completion of Infusion at day 21, day 28, day 42，Predose and 15 minutes, 3 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 96 hours after completion of Infusion at day 35，Predose at day 49（the last follow-up）|Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) in single dose, Cycle 1(day1-day 21)& Cycle 2(day 21-day49): up to day 21（blood collection time are as follows ：Predose, 15 minutes, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, day 3, day 4, day 7, day 14 after completion of infusion, Cohort 5 only)|Pharmacokinetics: AUC in multiple dose, From day 21 up to day 49（blood collection time：Predose and 15 minutes after completion of Infusion at day 21, day 28, day 42，Predose and 15 minutes, 3hours, 8hours, 24hours, 48hours, 96hours after completion of Infusion at day 35，Predose at day 49
Adverse Events, Drug-Related Adverse Events (AEs) or Any Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), 4 weeks after disease progression or 4 weeks after the intolerant toxicity occurs or until the subject begins a new tumor treatment (whichever is shorter)|Anti-drug antibody:Number of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies, A sample will be considered positive for circulating anti-drug antibodies if it exhibits a post-baseline antibody level that exceeds the upper 95% confidence interval of the mean determined from the normal anti-drug level seen in healthy untreated individuals. A participant will be considered to have an anti-drug response if there are 2 consecutive positive samples or if the final sample tested is positive., Cycle 1（day 1-day 21）: Cycle 2:day 21-day 49, cycle 3：day 50-up to study completion, an average of 2 years|Objective response rate: Number of Participants With Objective Response (ORR), Participants achieved disease control if they had a BOR of CR, PR or SD. Progressive Disease (PD) and those participants which were Not Evaluable (NE) were also reported. According to RECIST v1.1, CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to \<10 mm, the disappearance of all nontarget lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the upper limit of normal); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started., Time Between Meeting Response Criteria and Progressive Disease or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 1 year)|Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the time from randomization to the patient tumor progression or death., Time from randomization to the patient tumor progression or death.（up to 1 year）
The safety profile of Gentuximab Injection will be explored together with the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumour response to treatment with Gentuximab Injection to recommend the dosing regimen for further clinical studies. The pharmacokinetic properties of Gentuximab Injection will be evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations at different dose levels.
