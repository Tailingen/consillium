DRUG: L19-IL2 - Ph I|DRUG: L19-IL2 at RD - Ph II|DRUG: Rituximab
Number of patients with adverse events that are related to treatment and classified as DLTs for each administered dosage - phase I study, To assess the dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of L19-IL2 in combination with Rituximab, Up to Day 21 of the Cycle 1 (cycle of 21 days)|The rate of patients with complete response CR after 2 cycles of treatment - phase II study, From Day 38 to Day 42
The overall response rate (ORR) - phase I study, Up to 24 months|Median progression free survival (PFS) - phase I study, Up to 24 months|Median overall survival (OS) - phase I study, Up to 24 months|Pharmacokinetics assessment of L19-IL2 through blood sampling - phase I study, At Day 2 of Cycle 1|Human anti-fusion protein antibodies (HAFA) levels - phase I study, (1) at Day 2, (2) at Day 23, (3) from Day 38 to Day 42, (4) from Day 80 to Day 84|Percentage of Participants With On-Study Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - phase II study, Up to 24 months|Percentage of Participants With Worst On-Study Hematological and Chemistry Abnormalities - phase II study, Up to 24 months|Number of Patients With Abnormal Physical Examinations - phase II study, Up to 24 months|Relative percentage difference in vital signs from baseline - phase II study, Up to 24 months|The overall response rate (ORR) - phase II study, Up to 24 months|Median progression free survival (PFS) - phase II study, Up to 24 months|Median overall survival (OS) - phase II study, Up to 24 months|Human anti-fusion protein antibodies (HAFA) levels - phase II study, (1) at Day 2, (2) at Day 23, (3) from Day 38 to Day 42, (4) from Day 80 to Day 84
Phase I - Dose definition: A prospective, open-label, multi-center Phase I dose escalation study in which cohorts of 3-6 patients will receive escalating doses of L19-IL2 in combination with a fixed dose of Rituximab (375 mg/m2).

Phase II - Activity Evaluation: Open-label, multi-center, prospective study during which 14 enrolled patients will receive a fixed dose of Rituximab (375 mg/m2) in combination with L19-IL2 at the RD defined during the Phase I part of the study.

The study is designed to establish whether L19-IL2, administered in combination with Rituximab is well tolerated and can achieve objective responses and clinical benefit to patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.
