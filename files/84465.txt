Phase 1/2a/3 Evaluation of Adding AL3818 to Standard Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Subjects With Recurrent or Metastatic Endometrial, Ovarian, Fallopian, Primary Peritoneal or Cervical Carcinoma (AL3818-US-002)
This trial is a Phase 1b/2a/3 trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding oral AL3818 (Anlotinib, INN: Catequentinib), a Dual Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, to standard platinum-based chemotherapy concurrently in Subjects with Recurrent or Metastatic Endometrial, Ovarian, Fallopian, Primary Peritoneal or Cervical Carcinoma.

Kaplan-Meier analysis, Duration of time from the start of treatment to the time of documented disease progression or death, whichever comes first, followed for 12 months.|Overall Survival (OS) - Part 2 (Phase 2a), Overall survival is defined as the date the study treatment was initiated to the date of death from any cause. Kaplan-Meier analysis, Cycle 1 Day 1 up to 5 years|Objective Response Rate- Part 3 ( Phase 3), To evaluate the efficacy between the Active Arm and Control Arm as measured by the secondary endpoints of objective response rate (ORR).

Toxicity as assessed by CTCAE (v4.3) - Part 2 (Phase 2a), Incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events reported and their relationship to AL3818 will be assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.3), 12 Months
This trial is a Phase 1b/2a/3 trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding oral AL3818(Anlotinib, INN: Catequentinib) to standard platinum-based chemotherapy concurrently and continued as a maintenance therapy for up to 12 months, in subjects with recurrent or metastatic endometrial, ovarian, fallopian, primary peritoneal, or cervical carcinoma. AL3818 is a novel small molecule dual receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which shows highly selective inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFr) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). Preclinical studies of this agent in mouse models, including various cancer xenografts, have demonstrated that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with AL3818 induces tumor reductions.

Phase 1 \& 2: This study is divided into two parts. The objective of Part 1 is the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of adding oral AL3818 to standard carboplatin plus paclitaxel chemotherapy for a cycle of 21 days to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Phase 1 / Part 1 is now complete. Part 2-The objective of Part 2 is evaluation of preliminary efficacy and the safety of adding oral AL3818 at the RP2D determined in Part 1 to carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy for 6 cycles. Continuous maintenance mono therapy with 14 days on and 7 days off regimen at the RP2D will be conducted up to 12 months and is extendable beyond until disease progression. Phase I is closed and Phase 2 is closed.

Phase 3: This study is currently a Phase III, multi-center, randomized trial with active control designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of AL3818 8 mg plus background treatment (Active Arm) vs background treatment alone (Control Arm), where three background treatments, weekly paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), and topotecan are utilized. Oral AL3818 8 mg may be given concurrently with background treatment or alone if the background treatment must be discontinued due to its toxicity for up to 24 cycles of therapy, in subjects with recurrent or metastatic platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Phase 3 is open.
