Fruquintinib Plus Irinotecan in the Treatment of Advanced Gastric Cancer
This study explores the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with irinotecan in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced gastric cancer, aiming to bring more second-line treatment options for patients with advanced gastric cancer.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Fruquintinib|DRUG: Irinotecan
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from randomization until the date of first occurrence of investigator-assessed radiological disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
Objective remission rate (ORR), Refers to the proportion of patients whose tumors have shrunk to a certain amount and kept for a certain time, including cases of complete remission and partial remission., up to 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The percentage of patients whose tumors shrink or stabilize for a certain amount of time. DCR is the sum of complete, partial response and stable rate, that is, DCR=CR+PR+SD., up to 12 months|Overall survival（OS）, OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. For subjects who were alive or lost to follow-up by the data analysis cut-off date, survival was censored at the subject's last known survival time., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
This study was a single-arm, open-label, single-center phase II study. A total of 47 patients with advanced gastric cancer who had previously failed standard first-line therapy were recruited to receive combined treatment with fruquintinib and irinotecan. The patients' progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS) and safety were evaluated.
