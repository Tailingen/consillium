Phase II Study Evaluating a Combination of Pegylated Liposomal Doxorubicin and Dexamethasone for the Treatment of Immunocompetent Patients With Cerebral Lymphoma Relapsed or Refractory to First-line Chemotherapy With High Dose Methotrexate (MTXHD) and / or High-dose Cytarabine.
The protocol is to assess the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) of treatment with non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin at a dose of 50 mg / m² in combination with dexamethasone in immunocompetent adult patients with primary brain lymphoma large B-cell refractory or relapsed after first-line treatment MTXHD and high-dose cytarabine, excluding strict eye lymphomas.

This is a Phase II, open, prospective, multicenter, non-comparative with direct individual benefit.
