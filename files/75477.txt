This is a multicenter, randomized controlled phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SY-3505 capsule vs. crizotinib capsule in treatment-naive patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.

Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive SY-3505, 600 milligrams (mg) orally once daily (QD), or crizotinib, 250 mg orally twice daily (BID). Participants will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death.
