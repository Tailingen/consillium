A Dose Finding Pharmacokinetic Study of the Tumour-targeting Human L19IL2 Monoclonal Antibody-Cytokine Fusion Protein in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumours
This is a Phase I/II study for patients with solid tumors and renal cell carcinoma (RCC; for the Phase II part). L19-IL2 is a tumor targeted immunocytokine constituted of a single chain Fragment variable (scFv) format directed against the ED-B domain of fibronectin, one of the most important markers for neoangiogenesis, and the human cytokine interleukin-2 (IL2).
Advanced Solid Tumours
DRUG: L19IL2
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of the human L19IL2 fusion-cytokine., 21 days
To determine the pharmacokinetic profile., 5 days|To determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity profile., 21 days|To assess the presence of anti-fusion protein antibodies in treated patients., 18 weeks|To evaluate the safety profile of repeated administrations of L19IL2 in patients treated at the RD., 1 year|To identify early signs of antitumour activity., 1 year
This is an open-label, non-randomised, multicentre, Phase I/II study to assess safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and early signs of activity of L19-IL2 monotherapy.

In the first part of the study, there will be 5 dose escalation steps in sequential cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumours. In the second part of the study, patients with advanced RCC will be given a fixed dose of L19IL2 at the RD.
