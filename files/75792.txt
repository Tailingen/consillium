Safety and Efficacy of Whole Brain LDRT+ICI+Intrathecal Chemotherapy in Refractory Meningeal Metastasis of Lung Cancer
This phase I study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of whole brain low dose radiotherapy (WB-LDRT) combined with ICI and intrathecal chemotherapy for treatment of refractory meningeal metastasis of lung cancer.

Clinical response rate, The RANO proposal for response criteria of leptomeningeal metastasis was used to assess the clinical response in this study., 48 months|Incidence of treatment-related adverse events, The incidence of treatment-related adverse events were measured for determing tolerability and safety. Adverse events (AEs) are evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0). Events of grade 3-5 are defined as moderate and severe adverse events., 48 months
Neurological progression-free survival (NPFS), NPFS was defined as time from the start of treatment until neurological progression or death. The neurological progression was determined based on the RANO proposal evaluation criteria which have been established and published on Neuro Oncol., 48 months|Overall survival, Survival time was recorded since the date of patient enrollment. All patients were followed up until death or the end of the study., 48 months
This exploratory phase I study will be conducted in West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Three cohorts of whole brain low dose radiotherapy (3 patients per cohort) will be enrolled to determine the safety and efficacy of whole brain low dose radiotherapy combined with ICI and intrathecal chemotherapy for treatment of refractory meningeal metastasis of lung cancer.

Subjects who fulfil all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled and receive treatment with WB-LDRT at same dose (4 Gy/2f) with diffent cycles (decried as below), PD-1 inhibitor, pemetrexed chemotherapy, and intrathecal pemetrexed every 3 weeks (Q3w) for 4 cycles.

Patients will receive WB-LDRT at 3 cohorts with increasing dose fractions: 4 Gy/2f of one cycle in group 1; 4 Gy/2f of two cycles in group 2; 4 Gy/2f of four cycles in group 3.
