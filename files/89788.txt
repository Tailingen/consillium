Communication Training for Cancer Patients, Their Caregivers, and Their Doctors
The purpose of this study is to develop and test a new communication intervention, "Values and Options in Cancer Care 2.0" (VOICE 2.0), which involves oncologist training, patient and caregiver coaching, and caregiver support.

The VOICE 2.0 intervention was developed by members of the study team to improve communication among oncologists, patients with cancer, and caregivers. Researchers have found that clear communication about the patient's disease can help with the planning of that patient's future care and improve the well-being of both the patient and his or her caregiver. The long-term goals of developing and testing VOICE 2.0 include improving the care and respecting the wishes of cancer patients, and helping those patients and their caregivers have an improved quality of life during their experience with cancer.
Communication and Illness Understanding
Feasibility will be assessed by rates of accrual, retention, and intervention completion, 10 weeks|Intervention Acceptability, Intervention Acceptability will be assessed with Likert scale items with responses that range from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating greater acceptability., 7 weeks
Concordant illness understanding (oncologists, patients, caregivers), will be measured using two items assessing participants' beliefs about the patient's chances of living two or more years and chances of being cured. Items are rated on a seven-point scale: 100%, 90% 75%, 50-50, 25%, 10%, 0%. Patient, caregiver, and oncologist responses that differ by two or more response categories will be categorized as discordant., 7 weeks|Communicational self-efficacy, will be measured with the 10-item Perceived Efficacy in Patient-Physician Interactions (PEPPI) survey., 7 weeks|Patient-caregiver communication quality, will be assessed with the 5-item Family Communication subscale of the Cancer Communication Assessment Tool for Patients and Families, a valid measure in cancer patients and caregivers., 7 weeks|Patient/caregiver-oncologist relationship strength, will be measured with the 16-item Human Connection scale Each item is rated on Likert scale from 1 to 4 with higher scores indicating a stronger relationship with the oncologist., 7 weeks|Psychological distress, will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a 14-item self-report measure45 commonly used with cancer patients46-51 and caregivers, 7 weeks|Meaning and purpose (patients, caregivers), will be assessed with the 48-item Life Attitude Profile-Revised, a self-report measure of discovered meaning and the motivation to find purpose that has been used with advanced cancer patients and caregivers., 7 weeks
