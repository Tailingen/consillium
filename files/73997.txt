Pilot Study of a Novel Type of CT Scan to Assess Treatment Response During Chemoradiotherapy for Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Dual-energy CT (DECT) provides information on the blood volume in tumors and lymph nodes. As tumors respond to treatment, preliminary data suggests that the blood volumes changes as well. Investigators are therefore using DECT to test whether it can be used on radiation treatment to rapidly assess response to treatment.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage III
Change in the tumor's maximum iodine related attenuation (IRA) from baseline to on-treatment DECT., This change in the maximum IRA will be compared with the change in the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) between baseline PET-CT and follow-up PET-CT at 3 months after treatment. For patients undergoing surgery, this change in the maximum IRA will be compared between patients who have a complete pathologic response, and those patients who do not., 0, 1, 3, 5
