A Study of PARG Inhibitor IDE161 in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IDE161 as a single agent and in combination with pembrolizumab.
Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors|Breast Cancer|Ovarian Cancer|Prostate Cancer|Endometrial Cancer|Colorectal Cancer|Head and Neck Cancers|Nsclc
DRUG: IDE-161|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Part 1 (Dose Escalation): To characterize the safety and tolerability of IDE161 monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab to determine the MTD and/or RDE, * Incidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities
* Incidence of treatment-emergent Adverse Events as characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE version 5.0), timing, seriousness, and relationship to study therapy
* Laboratory abnormalities as characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE version 5.0), and timing, Approximately 2 years|Part 2 (Dose Expansion): To further assess the safety and tolerability of IDE monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab at the RDE, * Incidence of treatment-emergent AEs as characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE version 5.0), timing, seriousness, and relationship to study therapy
* Laboratory abnormalities as characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE v5.0), and timing, Approximately 4 years|Part 2 (Dose Expansion): To evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity of IDE161 monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab, Tumor response: Overall Response Rate assessed using RECIST criteria v1.1, Approximately 4 years
Part 2 (Dose Expansion) Assess the risk/benefit at an IDE161 monotherapy dose and exposure alternative to the initial expansion dose; as well as an IDE161 dose in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab and exposure alternative to the initial, Descriptively compare the totality of emerging data (efficacy, safety, PK, PD) between the initial expansion dose cohort and dose optimization cohort, Approximately 4 years|To characterize the single dose PK Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of IDE161 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab., Single-dose PK parameters of IDE161, Approximately 4 years|To characterize the multiple dose PK Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of IDE161 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab., Multiple-dose PK parameters of IDE161, Approximately 4 years|To characterize the single dose PK Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of IDE161 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab., Single-dose PK parameters of IDE161, Approximately 4 years|To characterize the multiple dose PK Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of IDE161 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab., Multiple-dose PK parameters of IDE161, Approximately 4 years|To characterize the single dose PK Time to Peak drug Concentration (Tmax) of IDE161 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab., Single-dose PK parameters of IDE161, Approximately 4 years|To characterize the multiple dose PK Time to Peak drug Concentration (Tmax) of IDE161 monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab., Multiple-dose PK parameters of IDE161, Approximately 4 years
The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability including determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD), maximum accepted dose (MAD), recommended dose(s) for expansion (RDE) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary anti-tumor activity of IDE161 as a single agent in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring BRCA1/2 loss of function alterations and/or other defects in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway and in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer.
