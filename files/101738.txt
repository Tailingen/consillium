Alternative Surveillance Program for Patients With High Risk Group of HCC
In a high-risk group, ultrasonography at 6-month intervals and short-protocol magnetic resonance imaging at 1-year intervals were performed. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for very early stage HCC are compared between conventional (biannual US) and alternative surveillance test are compared
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Non-contrast focused MRI
Comparison of alternative surveillance program (alternating focused MRI + US in 6 month interval) and conventional surveillance (biannual US) for HCC detection, per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value for very early stage HCC, early stage HCC, all stage of HCC/liver cancer., up to one year
Comparison of annual focused MRI and biannual US for HCC detection, per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value for very early stage HCC, early stage HCC, all stage of HCC/liver cancer., up to one year|diagnostic yield for HCC, HCC incidence in the group and detection rate with either US or focused MRI, up to one year|scan time of focused MRI, in room time, table time are manually recorded, up to one month|comparison between false referral rates of biannual US and annual focused MRI, comparison between false positive report/finding for HCC in each surveillance modality., up to one year
