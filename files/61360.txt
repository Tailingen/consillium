Study of Lenzilumab in Previously Treated Patients With Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)
This is a multicenter, open-label, repeat-dose, Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity.
Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)
DRUG: lenzilumab
Safety of lenzilumab (as measured by the number of participants with adverse events) at various doses in order to determine a recommended Phase 2 dose, Up to an average of 12 months
Clinical activity of lenzilumab (as measured by changes in spleen size, blood and bone marrow measurements of disease, clinical symptoms, etc), Up to an average of 12 months
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of lenzilumab, At end of infusion or 1 hour after end of infusion on Day 1|Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of lenzilumab, Pre-dose to end of infusion or 1 hour after end of infusion on Day 1|Minimum plasma concentration (Cmin) of lenzilumab, At Day 15|Area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of lenzilumab, Predose, end of infusion, 1 hour after end of infusion on Day 1, Day 2, Day 7, Day 15|Plasma half life (t Â½) of lenzilumab, End of infusion, 1 hour after end of infusion on Day 1, Day 2, Day 7, Day 15|Plasma clearance (CL) of lenzilumab, End of infusion, 1 hour after end of infusion on Day 1, Day 2, Day 7, Day 15|lenzilumab immunogenicity (as measured by antibodies against lenzilumab in blood), Up to an average of 12 months
The purpose of the study is to examine the safety and determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of lenzilumab when administered to subjects with previously treated CMML who meet the entry criteria. Study will begin enrollment in July 2016.
