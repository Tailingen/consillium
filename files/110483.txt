A Study of RO5212054 (PLX3603) in Participants With BRAF V600-Mutated Advanced Solid Tumors
This open-label, multi-center study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RO5212054 \[PLX3603\] in participants with BRAF V600-mutated advanced solid tumors. Cohorts of participants will receive escalating oral doses of RO5212054. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
