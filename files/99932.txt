Comparison of Duration of Treatment Interruption With or Without Curcumin During the Off Treatment Periods in Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Intermittent Androgen Deprivation Therapy
This was a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial designed with the aim of establishing whether curcumin influenced the duration of treatment interruption and rate of prostatic specific antigen(PSA) progression, compared with placebo among men with prostate cancer receiving intermittent androgen deprivation therapy.

DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: curcumin|DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Placebo
Duration of treatment interruption with or without curcumin, To determine whether the period from the first interruption of the androgen deprivation therapy to the time when androgen deprivation therapy needs to be retreated differ between curcumin group and placebo group, up to 42 months
Mean change in PSA(ng/ml) from baseline between curcumin group versus placebo, Measure the mean change of PSA at each point from the baseline and compare differences between the two groups, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,12,18,30,42 months|Mean change in testosterone(ng/ml) from baseline between curcumin group versus, Measure the mean change of testosterone at each point from the baseline and compare differences between the two groups, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,12,18,30,42 months|Adverse events, Adverse events were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE). Vital sign, blood test and urine analysis were also performed., 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,12,18,30,42 months
