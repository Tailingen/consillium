Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin in Induction and Glasdegib in Postremission Therapy in Patients With AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia)
The study is a randomized phase III trial with a 2x2 factorial design with measurable residual disease and event-free survival as primary endpoints, respectively. Patients are upfront randomized for the two induction schedules (Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (GO)-147 versus GO-1; ratio 1:1) and for Glasdegib or Placebo (double blinded, ratio 1:1) as adjunct to consolidation therapy and as single agent 6 months maintenance therapy. Chemotherapy backbone for induction therapy is standard 7+3 with cytarabine 200mg/m² continuously day 1 to day 7, daunorubicin 60mg/m² days 1, 2 and 3 and for consolidation therapy intermediate dose cytarabine (1g/m², bi-daily, days 1,2,3). The trial is designed to gain evidence of anti-leukemic activity of GO and Glasdegib in older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.
