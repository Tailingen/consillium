A Study of Navitoclax in Addition to Bendamustine and Rituximab in Patients With Relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (NAVIGATE)
This randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of navitoclax in addition to bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients will be randomized to receive navitoclax in addition to bendamustine and rituximab or bendamustine and rituximab alone for 6 cycles.
