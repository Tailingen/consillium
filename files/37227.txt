Asia PDL1 Study Among NSCLC Patients
MEDI-APEX is a non-interventional, retrospective, cohort study to characterize PD-L1 expression and to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes among NSCLC patients
Locally Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC
Characterization of PD-L1 expression among NSCLC patients, Characterization of PD-L1 expression among locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC patients (Stage III) and newly diagnosed Stage IV or recurrent metastatic NSCLC patients., from NSCLC diagnosis date between January 2010 and December 2014 until index date, defined as the date of data abstraction
Examination of overall survival by PD-L1 status among NSCLC patients, from NSCLC diagnosis date between January 2010 and December 2014 until index date, defined as the date of data abstraction|Examination of disease-free survival (DFS) by PD-L1 status among NSCLC patients, from NSCLC diagnosis date between January 2010 and December 2014 until index date, defined as the date of data abstraction|Examination of relapse-free survival (RFS) by PD-L1 status among NSCLC patients, from NSCLC diagnosis date between January 2010 and December 2014 until index date, defined as the date of data abstraction|Examination of progression-free survival (PFS) by PD-L1 status among NSCLC patients, from NSCLC diagnosis date between January 2010 and December 2014 until index date, defined as the date of data abstraction|Description of patient characteristics by PD-L1 status among NSCLC patients., from NSCLC diagnosis date between January 2010 and December 2014 until index date, defined as the date of data abstraction|Description of the overlap between PD-L1 expression and presence of EGFR, ALK or KRAS mutations among NSCLC patients, And the prevalence of PD-L1 expression ≥25%, and ≥90%, will be calculated for each mutation status for the EGFR, ALK and KRAS biomarkers., from NSCLC diagnosis date between January 2010 and December 2014 until index date, defined as the date of data abstraction
MEDI-APEX is a non-interventional, retrospective, cohort study to characterize PD-L1 expression among NSCLC patients and to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of these patients with specific attention to EGFR, ALK, and KRAS mutations. The study will determine whether PD-L1 is a prognostic factor in the Asia-Pacific patient population; The study will enrol NSCLC patients with disease diagnosis between January 2010 and December 2014; The patients will be recruited from Asia-Pacific, potentially China, Japan, and South Korea. A total of approximately 750 patients will be enrolled in the study; around 250 NSCLC patients will be enrolled per country.
