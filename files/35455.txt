Prostate Cancer
DRUG: enzalutamide|DRUG: abiraterone acetate|DRUG: prednisone
Number of participants with adverse events, Until End of Study (Up to 96 Months)
Subjects must continue on the treatment regimen that the subject was receiving in the prior study. Dose changes of any of the prior therapies subjects were receiving on the previous protocol are allowed after medical monitor approval. The day 1 visit for this study should coincide with the last treatment visit for the study the subject will be enrolling from (≤ 7 days post last visit of parent study). The subjects will be followed according to the local institution's standard of care and will be required to return to the institution every 24 weeks (± 7 days) to review adverse events (AEs), collect concomitant medications and confirm that no discontinuation criteria are met. At each visit and at every 12 weeks (IP only visit) subjects are to return all dispensed study drug and to receive more study drug if applicable. All AEs (new and ongoing from the study the subject is enrolling from) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) (including death), will be collected from the time the subject signs the consent form until the end of study visit.
