Taletrectinib in Previously Treated Metastatic CDH1-mutated Invasive Lobular Cancer (ILC)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of talectrectinib as treatment for Stage IV ILC with CDH1 mutation
Breast Cancer|Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Taletrectinib
Objective response rate (ORR) as measured by RECIST v1, The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence., 24 Weeks
Progression Free Survival Rate(PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Every 12 weeks until 180 days from EOT until death, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up or termination of the study by the sponsor, whichever occurs first.|Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical benefit rate as measured by total number of participants with complete response, partial response and stable disease in participants treated with taletrectinib, Up to 6 months (180 days) after completion of therapy or until death, whichever comes first|Duration Of Response(DOR), Defined as the subset of participants who achieved a confirmed CR or PR from the date of first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD)., Up to 6 months (180 days) after completion of therapy or until death, whichever comes first|Safety analysis, with toxicities graded according to NCI CTCAE v5.0, Incidence tables will be generated to summarize incidence of participants reporting at least one episode of each specific adverse event, incidence of adverse events causing withdrawals and incidence of serious adverse events. Listing of adverse events by participants will include the time to onset, the duration of each event, the severity of each event, and the relationship of the event to study therapy, whether it was a serious event, and whether it caused withdrawal. Proportion and exact confidence boundaries (95% CI) will be estimated for toxicity., Up to 30 days after the final dose of the study drug|Overall Quality Of Life(QOL) with EORTC QLQ-C30 assessments, The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a 30-item cancer-specific questionnaire that incorporates 5 functioning scales (physical, role, cognition, emotional, and social), 8 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea), financial well-being scale and a global scale (based on 2 items: "How would you rate your overall health during the past week?" and "How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?")., Assessed every 12 weeks starting from first treatment visit till EOT and then every 12 weeks until 6 months after EOT|Overall Quality Of Life(QOL) with FACT-B assessments, The FACT-B v4.0 is a 37-item self-reported instrument designed for participants to report on quality of life measures within 5 domains: Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, Functional Well-Being, Breast Cancer Subscale., Assessed every 12 weeks starting from first treatment visit till EOT and then every 12 weeks until 6 months after EOT
Invasive lobular cancer (ILC) represents 10-15% of all breast cancers, up to 75% of ILCs carry a mutation in CDH1 gene which encodes for e-cadherin (ECAD), which is a cell adhesion glycoprotein. Preclinical data using patient derived xenografts have shown loss of ECAD due to CDH1 mutation is associated with an upregulation ROS1 activity, and ROS1 inhibitors have demonstrated synthetic lethality in CDH1-mutated cell lines. Taletrectinib is a novel ROS1/NTRK inhibitor with demonstrated activity in ROS1 mutated non-small cell lung cancer. The purpose of the trial is to estimate the activity of taletrectinib in previously treated CDH1-mutated metastatic breast ILC.
