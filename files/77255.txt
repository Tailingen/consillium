Cardiopulmonary Monitoring in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Combined Thoracic Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy
The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate cardiopulmonary toxicity in patients with lung cancer (NSCLC or SCLC) undergoing combined thoracic radiotherapy Â± chemotherapy and immunotherapy through timed monitoring and blood sample collection and to identify correlative biomarkers for predicting cardiopulmonary adverse events.

RADIATION: Curative Radiotherapy|DRUG: Immunotherapy
Clinical cardiopulmonary toxicities, To determine clinical cardiopulmonary toxicities from standard RT and immunotherapy per CTCAEv5.0, 25 months
subclinical/asymptomatic cardiopulmonary events, Asymptomatic cardiopulmonary events determined per abnormal lab values such as troponin and physiological testing, 25 months
This aims to collect observational data that describe clinical (primary endpoint) and subclinical (secondary endpoint) cardiopulmonary toxicities from combined thoracic radiotherapy and immunotherapy up to 25 months after thoracic radiotherapy and 12 months after consolidation immunotherapy among patients with locally advanced lung cancer.
