An uMbrella Study of BIomarker-driven Targeted Therapy In Patients With Platinum-resistant Recurrent OvariaN Cancer(AMBITION)
This study is a pilot study of biomarker-driven targeted therapy in patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. More specifically, this is a randomized, multi-center, open label, phase II study for Homologous Recombination Deficiency(HRD)+ patients and a biomarker-driven multiple-arm phase II study for Homologous Recombination Deficiency(HRD)- patients.

This study will consist of a number of study modules (substudies), each evaluating the antitumor activity of targeted agents in patients whose tumors express specific phenotype relevant to the molecules under investigation.
