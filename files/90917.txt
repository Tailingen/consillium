Adaptive Intervention to Maximize Colorectal Screening in Safety Net Populations
The goal of this study is to find the best ways to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.
Colorectal Cancer
OTHER: I2|OTHER: Health Education
CRC screening completion rate, Rate of participants who receive CRC screening during study participation, 12-14 Months
Cost analysis of each intervention pathway, Measure will be calculated by estimating all cost factors in the CRC screening process, include personnel and materials/supplies costs, materials development costs, and time of all study staff involved. Measure represented as a per participant cost to complete screening., 14 Months
Colorectal Cancer is preventable and curable but is still the second most common cause of cancer death in the U.S. Minorities and those with low income have more CRC than middle and high income Whites.. They also get fewer CRC screening tests. Low knowledge of CRC screening may, in part, drive this lower test use. We need new ways to improve CRC screening in primary care clinics where many minority and uninsured patients receive health care.
