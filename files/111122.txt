A Feasibility Study Utilizing Immune Recall to Increase Response to Checkpoint Therapy
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of administering the Tetanus Diptheria Vaccine (Td) or Polio Boost Immunization (IPOL) to patients with metastatic melanoma who are receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (IO) therapy per standard of care. Subjects will have the vaccine at cycle 4 of IO therapy and will have research blood and tissue samples collected prior to starting IO therapy, at cycle 4 prior to vaccine administration, and at 12-17 days post vaccine.
Melanoma
BIOLOGICAL: Tetanus Diptheria Vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: Polio Boost Immunization
Number of subjects out of the proposed 25 that successfully receive the vaccine after 4 cycles of IO therapy, Evaluable patients are defined as those who receive four cycles of IO therapy and then receive a Td or IPOL vaccine, informed consent through date of vaccine (est apx 4-5 months)|Safety, as measured by the change in the number and severity of adverse events deemed related to the vaccine or study procedures (blood draw and biopsies), Adverse events will only include those that are determined to be related to the study vaccine or study procedures (blood draw and biopsies), Baseline, cycle 4 of IO therapy (apx 12-16 weeks), 12-17 days post vaccine, SOC scan following vaccine (apx 8-12 weeks post vaccine)
Preliminary efficacy, as measured by objective response rate, Number of patients that experience tumor response vs. stable disease vs. progression as determined by PI assessment of standard of care scans, up to 36 months
