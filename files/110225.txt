Semi-automatic Download of Prostate Biopsy Cores While Keeping the Orientation, Unfolding and Unity of the Sample
Performance evaluation of a novel, semi-automated device and method for needle core biopsy download compared to standard methods in terms of:

1. Biopsy core length obtained (i.e. collecting all tissue fragments)
2. Biopsy core yield (i.e. percent of tissue loss during the pathologic processing)
3. Pathologist interpretability
4. Processing time
5. Prostate cancer detection.
