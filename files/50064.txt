Genetic Susceptibility to Radiation Induced Thyroid Cancer
Case control on thyroid cancer occuring in a cohort of 7300 subjects treated during their childhood, mostly by radiotherapy, for a skin Angioma at Gustave Roussy, Villejuif France between 1947 and 1973.

This case control study, which is included in a larger european project, aims to investigate the DNA variant interacting with the risk of radiation induced thyroid cancer after irradiation.

The sutdy is planed to include about 30 cases and 30 controls. Matching criteria are date of birth, gender, and age at irradiation.
