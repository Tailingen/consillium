Pre-emptive Daratumumab Therapy of Minimal Residual Disease Reappearance or Biochemical Relapse in Multiple Myeloma
PREDATOR is a study investigating a role of preemptive daratumumab therapy for preclinical relapse or progression of multiple myeloma (MM).
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Daratumumab 20 MG/ML [Darzalex]
Event Free Survival (ESF), To compare (EFS) between daratumumab arm and observation arm after randomization of patients with biochemical relapse of Multiple Myeloma and MRD reappearance in Multiple Myeloma, from randomization till the date of development clinical relapse or death from any cause; up to 129 weeks
Overall Response Rate, ORR as determined by Investigator evaluation, defined as the percentage of subjects achieving an objective response (i.e. partial response or better), using IMWG Consensus Panel 1 response criteria, from randomization till progression or death from any cause, up to 129 weeks|Overall Survival, To compare overall survival between arms, throughout the duration of the study, no longer than 6 years
The study is composed of two phase 2 randomized multi-center substudies:

* PREDATOR-BR: to investigate the role of daratumumab in the setting of biochemical relapse
* PREDATOR-MRD: to investigate the role of daratumumab in minimal residual disease (MRD) reappearance
