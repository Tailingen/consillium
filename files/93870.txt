Efficacy and Safety of Anlotinib Plus Platinum Plus Pemetrexed in T790M-negative NSCLC
This study is conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of anlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2（VEGFR）、FGFR（fibroblast growth factor receptor）, platelet-derived growth factor receptor（PDGFR） and tumor cell proliferation related kinase c-Kit, combined with platinum plus pemetrexed in T790M mutation negative metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) after the failure of EGFR-TKI.

Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from first dose of study treatment until the first date of either objective disease progression or death due to any cause., Up to 24 months|Dose limiting toxicity (DLT), Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is referred to grade 3 non-hematological toxicity or grade 4 hematological toxicity according to NCI CTCAE 4.03 criteria, Estimated about 6 months|Maximum tolerance dose (MTD), Maximum Tolerance Dose (MTD) is the dose of treatment in the cohort where there are 2 cases of DLT reported., Estimated about 6 months
Objective response rate(ORR), To determine ORR of Anlotinib Anlotinib combined with Platinum-based Pemetrexed in T790M mutation negative Advanced NSCLC. ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects with evidence of a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1., Up to 24months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 1.1., Up to 24months|Duration of Response (DOR), Defined as the the time from first confirmed CR or PR until the first date of either objective disease progression or death due to any cause., Up to 24months|Safety (Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability), Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, Until 21 day safety follow-up visit
Anlotinib, an oral highly potent tyrosine-kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR、PDGFR、FGFR and c-kit，has demonstrated improved survival in previously treated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC).

In the phase Ⅲ study ALTER0303, patients who failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance were treated with anlotinib or placebo, the anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Therefore,we envisage using anlotinib plus platinum plus pemetrexed treat the EGFR wild-type metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients who were failure in the treatment of chemotherapy with platinum containing drugs, to further improve the patient's PFS.

The study is divided into two stages，phase I use a dose escalation trial design to explore the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities(DLT), Maximum Tolerable Dose(MTD), A cohort of 3\~6 subjects will be enrolled at each dose level, If 0 of 3 or ≤ 1 of 6 subjects experience a DLT, the phase I trial will move ahead to the next dose until ≥ 2 of 6 subjects experience a DLT，and the current dose will be considered the MTD. Following completion of the dose escalation trial and determination of MTD（Phase I）, a single arm study including 44 subjects may be enrolled to further evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of anlotinib in combination with platinum plus pemetrexed in the same target population（phase II）. Phase II is to designed to explore the anti-tumor activity of anlotinib combined with platinum plus pemetrexed in T790M mutation negative metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) after the failure of EGFR-TKI.
