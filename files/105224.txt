A Study of AMG 951 [rhApo2L/TRAIL] in Subjects With Previously Untreated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Treated With Chemotherapy +/- Bevacizumab
This is a phase 2 multicenter, open label, randomized study of AMG 951 (rhApo2L/TRAIL) in subjects with previously untreated stage IIIb/IV NSCLC treated with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab.

Subjects will be assigned to a set of treatment groups depending on their eligibility to receive bevacizumab. Subjects with squamous NSCLC and/or CNS metastases will not be eligible to receive bevacizumab and will be assigned to either cohort A or B (provided all other eligibility criteria are met). Subjects who are eligible to receive bevacizumab will be assigned to cohort C, D or E. Cohorts are defined as follows:

Subjects with squamous NSCLC or CNS mets:

Cohort A: Chemotherapy alone Cohort B: Chemotherapy plus 8 mg/kg AMG 951 for 5 days

Subjects without squamous NSCLC and without CNS mets:

Cohort C: Chemotherapy and bevacizumab Cohort D: Chemotherapy, bevacizumab plus 8 mg/kg AMG 951 for 5 days Cohort E: Chemotherapy, bevacizumab plus up to 20 mg/kg AMG 951 for 2 days Approximately forty subjects will be recruited to each cohort.
