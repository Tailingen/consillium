A Study to Evaluate SHR-1210 in Combination With Capecitabine + Oxaliplatin Sequenced by SHR-1210 + Apatinib as First-line Therapy in Treatment of Advanced Gastric Cancer
This is a randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 plus capecitabine and oxaliplatin sequenced by apatinib with or without SHR-1210 versus capecitabine and oxaliplatin as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma.
