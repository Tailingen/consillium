Stem Cell Therapy Combined With NeuroRegen Scaffoldâ„¢ in Patients With Erectile Dysfunction After Rectal Cancer Surgery
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is one of the commonest complications in men after rectal cancer treatment. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) or allogeneic human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HUC-MSCs) combined with NeuroRegen scaffold transplantation in men with erectile dysfunction after rectal cancer treatment.
