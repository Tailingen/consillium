OTHER: No intervention; Observational study
Incidence of chemotherapy-related myelosuppression and current status of prophylactic therapy, The incidence and treatment status of chemotherapy-related myelosuppression were investigated in the form of questionnaires Like what：

1. Did bone marrow suppression occur after the previous cycle of chemotherapy? (First chemotherapy/occurrence/non-occurrence)

The purpose of this research project was to gain an in-depth understanding of the myelosuppression of cancer patients in counties in China after receiving chemotherapy-based treatment regimens through a cross-sectional survey with the help of an online questionnaire system, and to investigate doctors' cognition and treatment concepts of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. 1. Fill the gaps in relevant domestic research and provide basic data for follow-up longitudinal studies and intervention studies; 2. Analyze the influencing factors and coping strategies of chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression from multiple perspectives, so as to provide reference for improving the knowledge level and treatment level of patients and doctors; 3. Provide more scientific guidance and suggestions for chemotherapy for cancer patients, help patients reduce the harm of bone marrow suppression, improve the survival rate and quality of life of patients, and also provide strong data support for the prevention and treatment of tumors and promote the development of cancer prevention and treatment.
