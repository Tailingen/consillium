Comparative Retrospective Analysis of Skin Tumors of the Eyelids and Face in 2 Brussels University Hospitals Over 5 Years in Dermatology or Ophthalmology
Skin cancers are the most common of all cancers. Their incidence has increased sharply over the decades.This increase in incidence partly reflects an aging population and behavioral patterns such as repeated exposure to the sun. Indeed, exposure to UV rays is the predominant factor involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors, hence the fact that they mainly develop in photo-exposed regions such as the cephalic extremity.

The objective of this study is to provide an epidemiological analysis of tumors in the populations of both CHU Brugmann and St Pierre hospitals.
