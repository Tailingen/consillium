Zoledronic Acid Treatment (Every 4 or 12 Weeks) to Prevent Skeletal Complications in Advanced Multiple Myeloma Participants
This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of a dosing method for zoledronic acid in preventing skeletal complications in multiple myeloma participants who have been on an intravenous (IV) bisphosphonate for about one to two years.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: zoledronic acid
Percentage of Participants With ≥1 SRE at the End of 1 Year on Study, SRE was defined as pathological bone fracture, initiation of radiotherapy or surgery on bone, spinal cord compression, or hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM). SRE was assessed by centrally read radiographic bone surveys., 1 year
Time to First SRE on Study, The time to first SRE is defined as the date of enrollment to the date of the first occurrence of any SRE on the study. SRE includes pathological fracture, initiation of radiotherapy or surgery on bone, spinal cord compression, or HCM. Participants who drop-out was treated as censored observations. Time to first SRE on the study was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 2 years|Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Pathologic Bone Fracture, Pathologic bone fractures are defined as bone fractures that occur spontaneously or as a result of trivial trauma., Years 1 and 2|Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Spinal Cord Compression, Spinal cord compression is caused by the impingement of a tumor on the spinal cord and is associated with neurologic impairment and/or back pain., Years 1 and 2|Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Radiation to Bone, Radiation therapy to bone events includes irradiation of bone to palliate painful lesions, to treat or prevent pathologic fractures, or to treat or prevent spinal cord compression., Years 1 and 2|Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Surgery to Bone, Surgery to bone events includes surgical procedures that are performed to set or stabilize pathologic fractures or areas of spinal cord compression and surgical procedures that are performed to prevent an imminent pathologic fracture or spinal cord compression., Years 1 and 2|Percentage of Participants Who Experienced HCM, HCM is defined as corrected serum calcium ≥ 12.0 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (3.00 millimoles per liter \[mmol/L\]), or a lower level of hypercalcemia that was symptomatic and required active treatment other than rehydration., Years 1 and 2|Skeletal Related Event (SRE) Rate, The SRE rate for each participant was calculated as the number of SREs/total follow-up time. SRE included pathological bone fracture, initiation of radiotherapy or surgery on bone, spinal cord compression, or HCM., Years 1 and 2|Change From Baseline in Urinary N-telopeptide of Type 1 Collagen (uNTx), uNTx is a biomarker used to measure the rate of bone turnover found in urine., Baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 100/End of Study (EOS)|Time to Death, Time to death was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of death. Participants who dropped out or completed the study were considered censored observations. Time to death was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method., Up to 2 years
