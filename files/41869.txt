A Study of TQB2102 for Injection in Patients With Recurrent/Metastatic Breast Cancer
TQB2102 is an antibody-drug conjugate comprised of a humanised antibody against Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), an enzyme-cleavable linker, and a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, which combine the ability of antibodies to specifically target tumour cells with the highly potent killing activity of drugs with payloads too toxic for systemic administration. This is a Phase 1/Phase 2 study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and anti-drug antibody (ADA) of TQB2102 for injection in subjects with HER2-expressing relapsed/metastatic breast cancer.
