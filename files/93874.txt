Pilot Study of Nivolumab w/Ipilimumab or Relatlimab in Surgically Resectable Melanoma Brain Metastases
The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the safety and feasibility of giving a single dose of Nivolumab with Ipilimumab or Relatlimab in participants with brain metastases from melanoma who can undergo surgery for removal of their brain metastases 7- 10 days after receiving the study drug.
Metastatic Melanoma|Metastasis to Brain
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|DRUG: Nivolumab + Relatlimab|PROCEDURE: Standard of Care Craniotomy
Feasibility: Ability to recruit per treatment arm, Feasibility is defined as being able to recruit 8 patients per treatment arm (16 total) within 30 months., At 30 months|Comparison of immune cell population per treatment arm, Investigators will compare immune cell population between treatment arms (Nivolumab + Ipilimumab vs Nivolumab +Relatlimab). The expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in all samples collected will be evaluated, as well as the expression of cytokines and inflammatory cells including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, T regulatory cells, B cells, plasma cells, IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-β, GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, myeloid-derived suppressor cells(MDSCs), dendritic cells (DCs), and macrophages. Size of immune cell population will be summarized in the following two ways. One is normalized per 100 cells so that the numbers are comparable between samples. The other estimation is the proportion of cells for each cell population. Other characterizations will be performed., Up to 15 months
