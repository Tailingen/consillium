Study of Atezolizumab Plus Carboplatin and Etoposide With or Without Tiragolumab in Participants With Untreated Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this multicenter study in China is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and carboplatin and etoposide (CE) compared with placebo plus atezolizumab and CE in participants with untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.
