CytID Analysis of Oral Lesions
The purpose of this study is to correlate the results from a standard of care biopsy with CytID™ and hpvID™ swab tests for potentially premalignant and malignant oral lesions. The biopsy is considered standard of care and will be performed regardless of the patient's enrollment in the study. The study-related data gathering will not influence the treatment decisions of the clinician.
