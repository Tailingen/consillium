A Study of Nivolumab Alone or Nivolumab Combination Therapy in Colon Cancer That Has Come Back or Has Spread
The purpose of this study is to examine if Nivolumab by itself, or Nivolumab in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, will result in meaningful tumor size reduction, in participants with colon cancer that has come back or has spread, and who have a specific biomarker in their tumors.
