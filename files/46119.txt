Chidamide Combined With Sintilimab and Bevacizumab for the First-line Treatment of Advanced Liver Cancer
The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and tolerability of chidamide in combination with Sintilimab and bevacizumab in patients with advanced liver cancer, to determine the recommended dose for this combination regimen, and to explore preliminary efficacy data. And based on the tumor immune microenvironment multidimensional (lymphocyte subsets, multiple cytokines, multicolor fluorescence immunohistochemistry, single cell sequencing, etc.) to explore the therapeutic efficacy related markers.
