Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine and Bevacizumab in Women With Recurrent Mullerian Carcinoma
The main purpose of this study is to begin to collect information and try to learn whether or not the combination of oxaliplatin, gemcitabine and bevacizumab works in treating women with recurrent mullerian carcinoma. We will also collect more information about the safety and side effects of this combination of drugs. Gemcitabine and oxaliplatin are chemotherapy drugs that kill cancer cells. Bevacizumab is a new anti-cancer drug that works to slow or stop cell growth in cancerous tumors by decreasing the blood supply to the tumors.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Partial Response Rate, Precentage of women who responded to the treatment regimen Response was determined by RECIST criteria, Outcome was assessed every 2 cycles (every 8 weeks) for the duration on study, an average of 4.5 cycles (18 weeks)
Progression Free Survival, Time participant remains free of progression of her disease. Evaluated by RECIST criteria, Assessed every 2 cycles (every 8 weeks) of chemotherapy until progression of disease is documented with a median duration of follow up of 24 months|Overall Survival, Duration of time participants are alive after enrolling on the study. Assessed by clinical records, Assessed every 3 months until death from disease, other causes, or loss to follow up at a median follow up of 24 months|Determine the Nature and Degree of Toxicities Following Treatment With Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine, and Bevacizumab in This Patient Population., The nature and toxicities of treatment were graded per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events version 3.0 Patients with grade 2 or higher toxicity were reported, Toxicities were assessed every cycle and for up to 30 days after being removed from the trial
* The study treatment is divided into periods called cycles. Each cycle is 28 days long. Participants will be given the study drugs intravenously on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle.
* Gemcitabine will be given first, over a period of 30 minutes. Then oxaliplatin over a period of 2 hours. Finally, bevacizumab will be given over a period of 30 to 90 minutes. Participants will continue study treatment as long as their tumor is not growing and they are not experiencing unacceptable side effects. If the tumor goes away completely, the participant will have 2 more cycle of study treatment.
* Blood will be drawn for routine testing every week during study treatment to check for side effects. Before day 1 and 15 of each cycle the following tests and procedures will be performed: a medical history; complete physical exam; vital signs; blood tests; and urine tests. Before day 1 of every other cycle, the following additional procedures will be performed: A CT scan, x-ray or ultrasound of your abdomen and pelvis; an x-ray of the chest (if required by the study doctor); blood tests; and urine samples.
* If the participant's tumor goes away, they will be asked to return to the clinic for follow-up visits every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years. At each follow-up visit the following tests and procedures will be performed: medical history; complete physical examination; CT scan, x-ray or ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis; x-ray of the chest; and other tests if the doctor feels they are needed.
* There is an optional sub-study that six subjects will be asked to take a part in that will give the study doctors important information about the way the body uses and breaks down the study drugs. This sub-study will involve special surgical procedures and scans that will be done during cycle 1 of the study treatment.
