Grade Descriptor

0 Clear: no visible seborrheic keratosis lesion

1. Near Clear: a visible seborrheic keratosis lesion with a surface appearance different from the surrounding skin (not elevated)

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 2 concentrations of A-101 compared to Vehicle for the treatment of 4 seborrheic keratosis (SK) Target Lesions on the trunk, extremities and face.

The secondary objectives of this study include duration of response of A-101. During the study, the investigator will identify 4 eligible SK Target Lesions on each subject on the trunk, extremities and face. For each subject, at least 1 SK Target Lesion must be on the face and at least 1 Target Lesion must be on the trunk or extremities. The Target Lesions will be treated at a maximum of two treatment visits.
