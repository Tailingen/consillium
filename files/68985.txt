Safety and Efficacy of Vitamin C Infusion in Combination With Local mEHT to Treat Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
This trial studies efficacy and safety of combination of vitamin C infusion with modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) in treatment of non small cell lung cancer patients.Phase I of this clinical study is to find the tolerable dose and best schedule of the combination of vitamin C infusion and mEHT that can be given to patients with NSCLC. Phase II of this study is to learn if the combination of vitamin C infusion and mEHT can help to control NSCLC and improve quality of life.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Recurrent Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: vitamin C|DEVICE: Modulated Electro-Hyperthermia (mEHT)|OTHER: Supportive care
Safety and tolerability of vitamin C infusion（1g/kg.d, 1.2g/kg.d,1.5g/kg.d） in combination with oncothermia on NSCLC patients, Adverse events, whether volunteered by the study subject, discovered by the investigators during questioning, or detected by physical examination, laboratory tests, or other means will be collected and recorded at each visit. Events will be recorded from the time the consent is signed until 4 weeks after the study protocol is discontinued., weekly for up to 8 weeks
Anti-Tumor Response, Tumor markers such as CEA,CYFRA21-1,CA153,SCC will be evaluated at baseline and one month after completion of treatment. Enhanced CT scan will be performed at baseline and one months after completion of treatment to measure the size of the tumor., 12 weeks after start of treatment|Changes in Health Related Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ-C30), basal,1,2,3,6,12 months follow up|Progression free Survival, CT assessment every 2 months|Overall Survival, every month follow up
Phase I and Phase II clinical trial indicated large dose of vitC infusion is safe and can reduce toxic side effects from chemo drugs when it was used synergy with chemotherapy. The new technology of modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT),trade name: oncothermia has been proven efficacy in lung cancer with minimal side effects.The investigators have accumulated some successful cases in the treatment of primary lung cancer by using vitamin C infusion in combination with oncothermia. One diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer patient survive beyond 5 years only receiving intravenous vitamin C+ mEHT. Based on this, it is necessary to conduct an in-depth study to explore the best treatment protocol for NSCLC patients.
