A Study of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel and Glofitamab as Second-Line Therapy for Relapsed or Refractory Patients With Large B Cell Lymphoma
To learn if the combination of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and glofitamab as first-line therapy in high-risk LBCL participants or as second-line therapy in LBCL participants can help to control the disease.
B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Glofitamab|DRUG: Obinutuzumab|DRUG: Axi-cel
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives

* To evaluate the safety of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and glofitamab as combination therapy in 2nd line LBCL participants
* To evaluate the effect of axi-cel and glofitamab as combination therapy on the best complete response rate in 2nd line LBCL participants

Secondary Objectives

* To evaluate the effect of axi-cel and glofitamab as combination therapy on overall survival (OS) in 2nd line LBCL participants
* To evaluate the effect of axi-cel and glofitamab as combination therapy on progression free survival in 2nd line LBCL participants
* To evaluate the effect of axi-cel and glofitamab as combination therapy on best overall response rate in 2nd line LBCL participants

Exploratory Objectives

* Characterization of tumors via tumor profiling and antigen density measurement using flow cytometry at baseline
* Characterization of genetic markers via tumor single cell (sc) multiome sequencing and whole exome sequencing (WES) at baseline
* To study the kinetics of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) during study progression
* To evaluate the development of anti-axi-cel antibodies during study progression
* To evaluate the effect of glofitamab administration on T cell exhaustion during study progression
