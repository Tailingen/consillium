Sequencing of Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy in Combination With PD-1 Blockade Using Pembrolizumab in Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma
This investigator driven Phase Ib study will examine the safety, efficacy and biological effects of two schedules of pembrolizumab, an antibody targeted against anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), which will be given either before or after stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) for metastatic NSCLC.
