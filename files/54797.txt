DECT Ventilation Imaging
Demonstrate the feasibility of dual energy computed tomography using Krypton as a gaseous contrast media in order to study the in vivo ventilation.

Two different clinical situations will be tested :

* Prediction of postoperative pulmonary function for oncologic patients
* Detection of Bronchiolitis Obliterans in lung transplant recipients.
For Oncologic Patients|Potentially Operable Lung Tumor|With a Recent (Less Than 1 Month) VQ Scan|For Lung Transplant Recipients|Single of Bilateral Lung Transplant|From 5 Months Onwards|With Recent (Less Than 1 Month) Respiratory Functional Explorations
RADIATION: Single source dual energy compted tomography (CT750HD, General Electric, USA) with Krypton as a gaseous contrast media
Image quality on a qualitative 5 levels scale, 1 day of DECT ventilation imaging
