Safety and Biomarker of OPB-111077 in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumor
This open-label, non-randomized trial will comprise of 2 parts. A dose escalation part will characterize the safety, biomarker and pharmacokinetics of OPB-111077 in advanced solid tumor. Subsequently, an expansion part will further evaluate the biomarker, safety, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of OPB-111077 in selected tumor types.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: OPB-111077
Adverse Events, Number of participants with Adverse Events, 21 days|Maximum tolerated dose, The highest dose that does not lead to discontinuation of dose escalation, 21 days|Biomarker of OPB-111077, Change from baseline on predictable biomarker specified in the protocol, 21 days
Tumor response measured by RECIST(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor) 1.1 Assessment, Tumor response measured by RECIST(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor) 1.1 Assessment will be conducted at Screening, end of Cycle 1, end of Cycle 2, end of every 2 cycles thereafter, at the final study visit., 3~18 weeks depending on tumor response|Pharmacokinetics (PK) properties of OPB-111077 and its metabolites., The following PK parameters (Cmax (maximum observed concentration), AUC(area uder the concentration time curve from zero), tmax (Time to maximum plasma concentration), etc.) will be determined using a non-compartmental methods., 21 days
This trial is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose of OPB-111077 administered orally 4-days on and 3-days off (3 weeks/cycle) to subjects with advanced solid tumor in the dose escalation part so that biomarkers, efficacy, and others can be evaluated at the recommended dose in an expeditious manner in the expansion part. The dose escalation part employs a 3+3 escalation design as a standard dose escalation design for a small sample size.
