Detection of Plasma DNA in Non Small Cell and Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients
The majority of lung cancer patients have a tumor-derived genetic alteration in circulating plasma DNA that could be exploited as a diagnostic tool. The aim of this study is to evaluate if plasma DNA can be used as a valuable non invasive test to monitor disease progression without assessing the tumor.
