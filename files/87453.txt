Use of Lipid Emulsion or Nanoemulsion of Propofol on Children Undergoing Ambulatory Invasive Procedures.
The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of the of propofol nanoemulsion and lipid emulsion for sedation in non-invasive ambulatory procedures.
Leukemia
DRUG: propofol
Classification of the sedation level, Instantly after the loss of consciousness (loss of corneal-palpebral reflex) will be measured the sedation using the Ramsay Modified Scale., time 0
Time of latency, Time between the injection and loss of the corneal-palpebral reflex, 3-10 seconds|Pain at injection, The pain will be measured by CHEOPS Scale which evaluates the behavior of the child against pain., 3 - 10 seconds: during the injection|Physician satisfaction, The satisfaction of the medical specialist will be assessed through a questionnaire that assesses conditions of sedation for the procedure., 12 hours: end of procedure|Awakening time, Time between the last dose of propofol and the time when the patient awakes (cry, eyes opening and spontaneous movement)., 10 hours: when the patient awakes|Total dose, The total dose used will be measured in mg/kg/hour., 12 - hours End of procedure|Incidence of Adverse Events, Adverse events will be compared in its incidence in the two formulations of propofol during the anesthetic induction and 12 hours after the procedures., 0 to 14 hours
Nanoemulsion of propofol has been developed without lipid solvent in the formulation to minimize the adverse events such as pain of injection, redness, heat, phlebitis.
