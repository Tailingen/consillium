Rectal Indomethacin to Prevent Acute Pancreatitis in EUS-FNA of Pancreatic Cysts
The aim of this randomized trial is to compare the rate of post-procedure pancreatitis in patients undergoing EUS-FNA of pancreatic cysts; patients will receive either a single dose of indomethacin or placebo administered rectally, during EUS-FNA.

Pancreatic cysts are pre-malignant lesions and are being increasingly diagnosed on cross-sectional imaging. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is performed to further evaluate pancreatic cysts, and fine needle aspiration (FNA) is conducted to obtain a sample of the cystic fluid for analysis and examination for malignant cells. Acute pancreatitis is a complication of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of pancreatic cysts, which can lead to significant morbidity and substantial health care costs. The aim of this randomized trial is to compare the rate of post-procedure pancreatitis in patients undergoing EUS-FNA of pancreatic cysts; patients will receive either a single dose of indomethacin or placebo administered rectally, during EUS-FNA.
