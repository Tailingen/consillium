BC001 in Combination with Sintilimab and XELOX in the Treatment of HER-2 Negative Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer or Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma.
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn the efficaty and safety of BC001 in combination with Sintilimab and XELOX in treating patients with advanced or metastatic GC/GEJ.

Participants will:

Be administered with BC001, Sintilimab and Oxaliplatin once every three weeks for up to 24 months or until disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 or withdrawal from this study.

Take Capecitabine once daily in the first two weeks of each three-week treatment cycle for up to 24 months or until disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 or withdrawal from this study.

This trial is an open-label Phase I clinical trial, which is divided into the dose escalation phase and the dose expansion phase. It aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics and preliminary efficacy of BC001 in combination with Sintilimab and XELOX, and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and preliminary efficacy of BC001 in combination with Sintilimab and XELOX in the treatment of patients with HER-2 negative advanced or metastatic gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GC/GEJ) who have never received systemic treatment before.

The dose escalation phase adopts a 3+3 dose escalation design and three dose groups are planned initially.

The dose expansion study will recommend two appropriate dose groups based on data from the dose escalation phase, and 30 subjects planned to be enrolled in each group. According to the safety and efficacy of each group, one of the doses will be selected and determined as the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).
