Treatment of Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) Patients (FIBROSARC USA)
The present study is an open-label, randomized, controlled, two-arm multi-center study of the efficacy of L19TNF treatment in combination with doxorubicin versus doxorubicin alone in metastatic leiomyosarcoma patients.

In the study, 122 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive doxorubicin treatment (Arm 1) or L19TNF treatment in combination with doxorubicin (Arm 2).

The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate if L19TNF in combination with doxorubicin (Arm 2) given for metastatic leiomyosarcoma improves efficacy measured as progression free survival, as compared to doxorubicin alone (Arm 1).

Anti-cancer activity will be assessed every 6 weeks during therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter.
