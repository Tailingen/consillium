A Phase II Study of Parotid-gland Sparing IMRT in Patients With Midline Tumour of the Head and Neck
This study is a phase II trial designed to test the feasibility of delivering IMRT to head and neck cancer patients with tumours arising in the midline (oropharynx and hypopharynx), and to assess possible improvement in reducing the incidence of xerostomia with bilateral superficial lobe parotid sparing IMRT.
