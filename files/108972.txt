Low Dose Dasatinib (50 mg Daily) as First-line Treatment for Newly Diagnosed Chronic-Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this multicenter randomized study is to compare efficacy and safety of dasatinib 50 mg once daily and dasatinib 100 mg once daily in patients with early chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia
DRUG: Dasatinib
Proportion of patients who achieve and maintain MMR at 12 months using RQ-PCR test, Major molecular response (MMR) is defined as BCR-ABL1 ≤ 0.1%, 12 months
Incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) to dasatinib, Evaluation of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests according to laboratory reference ranges, 18 months|Transformation free survival (TFS) in eligible patients randomized to dasatinib 50 mg or dasatinib 100 mg treatment arms, Transformation free survival was measured from the start of therapy to the date of transformation to accelerated or blastic phases while on therapy or to the date of last follow-up., 18 months|Event free survival (EFS), EFS is measured from the start of treatment to the date of any of the following events : loss of CHR, loss of CCyR or MCyR, dose escalation, discontinuation of therapy for toxicity or lack of efficacy, progression to AP or BP, or death from any cause at any time, 18 months|Blastic phase (BP) transformation, BP is defined as the presence of 30% blasts or more in the peripheral blood or bone marrow, 18 months|Overall survival, Overall survival time is defined as the time from date of randomization until the date of death from any cause at any time or date of last follow up, 18 months|Proportion of patients with Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months, defined as 0% Ph+ metaphases, or FISH ≤2%, or BCR-ABL transcripts (IS) ≤1%, 12 months|Proportion of patients with MR 4.5 at 18 months, (BCR-ABL transcripts ≤ 0.0032%), 18 months|Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL): EORTC QOLCML24, Mean change in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) utilizing EORTC QOLCML24 questionnaire throughout treatment visits, 18 months|Frequency of not taking the medications as prescribed, Evaluated by identifying the frequency of not taking the medications as prescribed and the reasons. The decision on non-compliance is based on the treating physician's judgment., 18 months
A multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized Phase II study to compare efficacy by measuring rates of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months in patients with Ph+ chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) randomized to receive either dasatinib 50 mg QD or dasatinib 100 mg QD. Approximately 100 patients are expected to be randomized. The duration of patient participation will be 18 months
