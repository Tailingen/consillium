CREEK is a retrospective, observational, registry-based study including patients with an incidental diagnosis of CLL and started treatment (1st line, 2nd line, or Subsequent lines of treatment) within the period between 01 June 2016 and 12 months before data collection as identified from the patient records (from participating hospitals across the GCC States and the International region countries) with at least 12 months of follow-up, after starting on treatment.

Moreover, the study will include a pilot cohort in the GCC as an exploratory objective to describe the clinical and patient characteristics for the treatment-naive CLL patient
