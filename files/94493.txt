Erythropoietin to Enhance Recovery of Erectile Function in Men Following Radical Prostatectomy
This research study aims to explore the effectiveness of human erythropoietin versus placebo in promoting the recovery of erectile function in patients undergoing bilateral nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.

Pre-clinical studies have shown erythropoietin potently promoted recovery of erectile function in rats and humans have similar receptors on penile tissues and the periprostatic neurovascular bundles. A clinical non-randomized study conducted in men undergoing radical prostatectomy demonstrated a benefit to recovery of erectile function.

Therefore, the hypothesis is that erythropoietin offers nerve protection in men undergoing nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy and results in a reduced degree of erectile dysfunction and also an improved rate of erection recovery following surgery.

This study will evaluate the effectiveness of erythropoietin versus placebo in the recovery of erectile function in patients undergoing bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.

Recent laboratory findings in rat models and on human urogenital tissues suggest that erythropoietin may play a role in protection of the cavernous nerves during surgery. Some degree of nerve trauma occurs during bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, but for most it is temporary. Erythropoietin will be studied as an investigational drug for enhancement of erectile function postoperatively in a prospective, randomized study. Erythropoietin has been used in many men undergoing open radical prostatectomy in the past according to FDA indications for preparation for noncardiac, nonvascular surgery with a high risk of blood loss. Evidence also suggests it is safe with no demonstration of increased risk of venous thromboembolism (blood clots) or cardiac events for men with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy.

The length of the study is 12 months and involves receiving a dose of study drug or placebo on the day before surgery, the day of surgery, and the day following surgery. The dose is given by subcutaneous injection. The study will also require the completion of questionnaires which will be completed online every three months until study completion (at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) to assess outcomes.
