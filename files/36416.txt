Stereotactic Multiple Fraction Radiotherapy for Non-spine Bone Metastases
To investigate, whether multi-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) within 3 treatment fractions is non-inferior to the current standard of care of 5 fraction SBRT regarding pain response at 3 months after radiotherapy.

RADIATION: SBRT
Pain relief (response rate) measured with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from Baseline to 3 months after treatment., The Visual Analog Scale is a validated, subjective measure for pain. Possible scores ranges between zero (no pain) and ten (worst possible pain).

The primary endpoint was defined as pain relief \> 2 points from Baseline to 3 months after treatment., Baseline and 3 months after treatment
To investigate, whether multi-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) within 3 treatment fractions is non-inferior to the current standard of care of 5 fraction SBRT regarding pain response at 3 months after radiotherapy.
