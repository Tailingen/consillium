A Trial of SHR-A1904 in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
The study is being conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of SHR-A1904 in patients with with advanced pancreatic cancer and to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of SHR-A1904
