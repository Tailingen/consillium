Efficacy of Hypno-ear-acupuncture on Insomnia in Advanced Cancer Patients
This randomized controlled trial aims to test if a combination of medical hypnosis and ear acupuncture improves sleep quality in patients with advanced cancer during a hospital stay in a palliative care unit.

Patients submitted to our palliative care unit will receive a medical hypnosis and ear acupuncture on the second day of their stay. Sleep quality will be measured using validated patient-reported outcome measures at baseline and after 7 days. Additionally, the use of sleep medication will be documented as a secondary outcome.

The intervention will be compared to a sham medical hypnosis and ear acupuncture to see if the effect of the true intervention has a unique effect.
