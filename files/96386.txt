A Phase I Study of Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Volitinib in Combination With Gefitinib in EGFR(+) NSCLC
This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multicentre study of AZD6094 in combination with gefitinib in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (m+) and progressed on EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment.

A total of 53 patients will be enrolled in the safety run-in and expansion phases:

* Safety run-in phase - patients with EGFR mutation-positive (EGFRm+), locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who have progressed on previous EGFT TKI treatment.In the safety run-in phase of the study, the sample size may vary, depending on the number of dose levels evaluated and the number of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) observed in each cohort.
* Expansion phase - patients who are EGFRm+ and cMet-positive with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, who have progressed on previous EGFR-TKI treatment.
