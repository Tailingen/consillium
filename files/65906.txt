A Study of Venetoclax Plus Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed t(11;14)-Positive Multiple Myeloma in Subjects Who Are Ineligible for High-Dose Therapy
This study will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of venetoclax when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for participants with newly diagnosed, active t(11;14) positive multiple myeloma (MM).

This study will consist of 2 parts: Part 1 Dose Escalation and Part 2 Dose Expansion.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: venetoclax|DRUG: lenalidomide|DRUG: dexamethasone
Percentage of Participates Who Achieve CR, Complete response (CR) is defined as negative immunofixation of serum and urine, and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas, and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow., From baseline up to approximately 24 months
Percent of Participants Who Achieve MRD Negativity, Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative after treatment is described as less than one myeloma cell per 100,000 bone marrow cells., From baseline up to approximately 24 months|Percent of Participants Who Achieve VGPR or Better, Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) per international myeloma working group (IMWG) criteria is defined as serum or urine myeloma protein (m-protein) detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis, or greater than or equal to 90% reduction in serum m-protein and urine m-protein less than 100 mg/24 hours., From baseline up to approximately 24 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is described as the percentage of participants who experience partial response (PR) or better; PR per IMWG is described as follows:

* ≥ 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M protein by ≥ 90% or to \< 200 mg/24 h
* If the serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, a decrease ≥ 50% in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels is required in place of the M-protein criteria
* If serum and urine M-protein are not measurable, and serum free light assay is also not measurable, ≥ 50% reduction in bone marrow plasma cells is required in place of M-protein, provided baseline percentage was ≥ 30%
* In addition, if present at baseline, ≥ 50% reduction in size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required, From baseline up to approximately 24 months|Time to Response (TTR), Time to response is defined as the time from randomization to the first response (CR, stringent complete response \[sCR\], VGPR, PR)., From baseline up to approximately 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first observation of PR to the time of disease progression, with deaths from causes other than progression censored., Approximately 7 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from start of the treatment to disease progression or death (regardless of cause of death), whichever comes first., Approximately 7 years|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Rate at 12 Months, Percent of participants meeting the MRD Negative criteria at 12 months after initial dose; MRD Negative defined as less than one myeloma cell per 100,000 bone marrow cells., Approximately 12 months after initial dose of study drug|Time to Disease Progression (TTP), TTP is defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression, with deaths from causes other than progression censored., Approximately 7 years|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), The time to next treatment is defined as the time between the date of the first study drug intake and the date of the first next treatment intake after study drug discontinuation., Approximately 7 years|Overall Survival (OS) Rate, OS was defined as the time from the date the participant was randomized to the date of death., Approximately 7 years
