Incidence and Risk Factors
Go to Patient Version
Nonmelanoma skin cancers include basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). These skin cancers are very rare in children and adolescents. Based on National Childhood Cancer Registry data from 2016 to 2020, the incidence rate of skin carcinomas in children younger than 20 years was 0.1 cases per 1 million.[
1
]
In one series of 28 patients, approximately one-half of patients had predisposing conditions such as Gorlin syndrome (also known as
nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome
or basal cell nevus syndrome), and one-half of patients were exposed to iatrogenic conditions such as prolonged immunosuppression or radiation.[
2
]
Gorlin syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that is associated with germline
PTCH1
or
SUFU
pathogenic variants.[
3
,
4
] This syndrome predisposes patients to develop early-onset neoplasms, including BCCs, ovarian fibromas, and desmoplastic medulloblastomas.[

8
] For more information, see the
Basal cell nevus syndrome
section in Genetics of Skin Cancer.
A retrospective analysis identified 25 BCCs in 11 patients with Gorlin syndrome.[
9
] Eighty percent of the BCCs occurred on the head and neck, and 64% of the specimens demonstrated infundibulocystic differentiation.
BCCs and SCCs in adults have been associated with exposure to solar UV radiation, iatrogenic immunosuppression, UVB radiation, and other risk factors.[
10
]
In one retrospective follow-up study of patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, development of melanoma of the skin increased by more  than 2,000-fold and development of nonmelanoma skin cancers  increased by 10,000-fold.[
11
] For more information about xeroderma pigmentosum, see

Clinical Presentation
Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) generally appear as raised lumps or ulcerated lesions,
usually in areas with previous sun exposure.[
1
]  Multiple BCCs may be present, and
they are exacerbated by radiation therapy.[
2
] Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are usually reddened lesions with varying degrees of
scaling or crusting. SCCs have an appearance similar to eczema, infections,
trauma, or psoriasis.

Diagnostic Evaluation
Biopsy or excision is necessary to diagnose any skin cancer. 
A specific diagnosis is necessary for decisions regarding treatment.  Basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are generally curable with surgery alone, and further diagnostic workup is not indicated.[

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[
3
-
5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as
Skin Cancer Treatment

Treatment of Childhood Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) of the Skin
In This Section
Surgery
Targeted Therapy
Treatment options for childhood BCC and SCC of the skin include the following:
Surgery
.
Targeted therapy
.
Surgery
Treatment for nonmelanoma skin cancer is predominantly surgical, either surgical excision or Mohs micrographic surgery.[
1
]
Targeted Therapy
Most BCCs have activation of the hedgehog pathway, generally resulting from variants in
PTCH1
. For more information about
PTCH1
, see
Genetics of Skin Cancer
.[
2
]
Vismodegib.
In adults, vismodegib (GDC-0449), a hedgehog pathway inhibitor, has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of metastatic or advanced BCC.[
3
-
5
]  This drug also reduces the tumor burden in patients with basal cell nevus syndrome.[
6
] In a case report, one child with xeroderma pigmentosum and a nodular BCC achieved a complete clinical response with vismodegib.[
7
]
Cemiplimab.
No prospective trials of cemiplimab (PD-1 inhibitor) have been conducted in children and adolescents. However, the FDA approved cemiplimab for use in patients with metastatic or locally advanced cutaneous SCC who are not candidates for surgery or radiation and in patients with locally advanced or metastatic BCC previously treated with a hedgehog pathway inhibitor or for whom a hedgehog pathway inhibitor is not appropriate.[
