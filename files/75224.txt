Blinatumomab Followed by High-dose Chemotherapy for Ph-negative Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)
This is a phase II interventional trial to evaluate the efficacy of blinatumomab followed by high-dose chemotherapy in the first-line treatment for Ph-negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in adults. The aim is to increase the number of complete molecular responses after first two cycles of therapy. Early molecular response is considered to be the most powerful prognostic factor in ALL. Thus, a higher proportion of early molecular responses should translate into improved survival and fewer indications for allogeneic stem cell transplants

Primary Objective:

To evaluate the percentage of complete molecular responses after two cycles of induction therapy composed of a single cycle of blinatumomab followed by chemotherapy. Molecular response id monitored by a patient-specific Ig/TCR rearrangements in an assay with the sensitivity of at least 10e-04.

Outline:

Run-in phase: dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 PO (day 1-7), cyclophosphamide IV 200 mg/m2 (day 3-5), vincristine 2 mg IV (day 6), daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 IV (day 6-7), G-CSF until recovery, methotrexate 15 mg IT.

Day 11: Screening to the study. Induction I: blinatumomab 9 µg/day IV continuously (day 12-19), dose step to 28 µg/day (day 19-40). Induction II: dexamethasone 10 mg/m2 PO (day 50-54), vindesine 3 mg/m2 IV (day 50), methotrexate 1.5 g/m2 IV (day 50), etoposide 250 mg/m2 IV (day 53-54), cytarabine 2x 2 g/m2 IV (day 54), G-CSF until recovery, methotrexate 15 mg + cytarabine 40 mg + dexamethasone 4 mg IT (day 60).

Week 11: Primary endpoint assessment.

* Complete Remission (CR) and Complete Remission with incomplete blood count recovery(CRi) continue with Consolidation I;
* no CR/CRi: end of study, salvage regimen upon the investigator´s decision.

Consolidation I (week 13): rituximab 375 mg/ m2 IV (day 0, if CD20+ at diagnosis), methotrexate 1.5 g/m2 IV (day 1, 15), PEG-asparaginase 2000 U/m2 IV (day 2, 16), 6-MP 60 mg/m2 PO (day 1-7, 15-21), methotrexate 15 mg + cytarabine 40 mg + dexamethasone 4 mg IT (day 1).

Week 18 assessment:

* CR/CRi and MRD \<10-4: continue the protocol;
* CR/CRi and MRD ≥10-4;

  * and CR/CRi on day 40 or ≥50% reduction of bone marrow blasts on day 40: 1-2 cycles of blinatumomab followed by alloSCT;
  * and no CR/CRi on day 40 and \<50% reduction of bone marrow blasts on day 40: 1 cycle of high dose chemotherapy followed by alloSCT;
* relapse: end of study.

Consolidation II (week 19): rituximab 375 mg/ m2 IV (day 0, if CD20+ at diagnosis), prednisone 60 mg/m2 PO (day 1-14), vindesine 3 mg/m2 IV (day 1, 7), adriamycine 50 mg/m2 IV (day 1, 7), cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2 IV (day 15), cytarabine 75 mg/m2 IV (day 17-20, 24-27), thioguanine 60 mg/m2 PO (day 15-28), methotrexate 15 mg + cytarabine 40 mg + dexamethasone 4 mg IT (day 1), methotrexate 15 mg IT (day 17, 24). Consolidation III+VI (week 27 and 43): rituximab 375 mg/ m2 IV (day 0, if CD20+ at diagnosis), methotrexate 1.5 g/m2 IV (day 1, 15), PEG-asparaginase 2000 U/m2 IV (day 2, 16), 6-MP 60 mg/m2 PO (day 1-7, 15-21). Consolidation IV (week 33): rituximab 375 mg/ m2 IV (day 0, if CD20+ at diagnosis), cytarabine 1000 mg/m2 IV (day 1, 3, 5), methotrexate 15 mg + cytarabine 40 mg + dexamethasone 4 mg IT (day 8).
