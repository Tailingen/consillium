Randomized Trial of Colonic Stents as a Bridge to Surgery
The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the role colonic self-expanding metal stent (SEMS) placement as a bridge to surgery in patients with acute malignant left-sided colonic obstruction. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that SEMS placement could be effectively and safely used in this group of patients to relieve colonic obstruction thereby allowing safe recovery and medical stabilization before proceeding to elective surgery

PROCEDURE: Emergency endoscopic colonic stenting|PROCEDURE: Emergency surgery
The primary endpoint was postoperative complication rates., 30 days
