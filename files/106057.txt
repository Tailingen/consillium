Tolerance and Resistance to Ibrutinib in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL
Assessment of the mutational profile of the residual clone and the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations at 3 years of treatment with ibrutinib

This project has an epidemiological part: to establish the percentage of patients, in a real-life situation, still undergoing treatment 3 years after its initiation, as well as a biological part: to determine the evolution of the clone and the prevalence of BTK mutations and PLCg2 in the absence of clinical or biological criteria for scalability.
