A Study to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Lisocabtagene Maraleucel vs Investigator's Choice Options in Adult Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Whose Disease Has Failed Treatment With Both BTKi and BCL2i Therapies
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of liso-cel vs Investigator's Choice options (idelalisib + rituximab or bendamustine + rituximab) in adult participants with R/R CLL or SLL, whose disease has failed treatment with both BTKi and BCL2i targeted therapies.
