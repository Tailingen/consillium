Itraconazole as a Targeted Therapy for Inhibiting Hedgehog Pathway Signaling in Esophageal Cancer Patients
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that orally administered itraconazole, a commonly used antifungal medication, can inhibit Hedgehog pathway signaling in patients with esophageal cancer, including adenocarcinoma (EAC) and squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
Esophageal Cancer
DRUG: Itraconazole
Inhibition of Hedgehog pathway signaling as measured by real-time PCR., mRNA expression levels as measured by real-time PCR of Hedgehog pathway ligands and target genes will be compared between baseline and post-itraconazole treatment., 2-3 weeks
Inhibition of VEGFR2 pathway signaling as measured by Western blot, Protein expression levels of phosphorylated VEGFR2 will be compared between baseline and post-itraconazole treatment., 2-3 weeks
The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that orally administered itraconazole, a commonly used antifungal medication, can inhibit Hedgehog pathway signaling in patients with esophageal cancer, including adenocarcinoma (EAC) and squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
