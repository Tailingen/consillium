Use of Fiber-optic Probe for Non-invasive Diagnosis of Melanoma and Assessment of Impact of Ultraviolet (UV) Exposure on Skin
This study is designed to collect information about melanoma using a research probe, a device placed only on the skin. This study will investigate whether using the probe to examine skin lesions could improve the accuracy of identification pre-cancerous melanoma lesions or to predict the risk melanoma in the skin of subjects. Ultimately, we would see this technique used routinely as a non-invasive device during subjects' skin examination to aid dermatologists to identify pre-cancerous (melanoma) lesions without taking tissue samples of the skin. Alternatively, this technique would, in the future, also be used to screen patients at risk for melanoma.
Melanoma
Investigate the ability of the fiber-optic probe to identify lesions of melanoma and severe/high-grade dysplasia, To correct for skin color effect and heterogeneity, the readings of the pigmented lesion will be normalized by the readings taken from the corresponding normal skin around the lesion., 3 years
To test whether the fiber-optic probe can discriminate the severe/high-grade dysplasia from the mild and moderate dysplastic nevi;, 3 years|To test whether the fiber-optic probe readings are different among tissues with different degree of sun exposure, 3 years|To test whether the fiber-optic probe readings are different between the most and the least suspicious lesions, 3 years
