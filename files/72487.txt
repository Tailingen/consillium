Maximum Tolerable Dose (MTD), Usually refers to the highest dose at which a subject's probability of developing DLT does not exceed the probability of target toxicity during the regime-specified DLT observation period., up to 12 months|Objective response rate (ORR), CR + PR rate according to the RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., up to 12 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), To assess the efficacy of Surufatinib Combine With Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy as second-line therapy to Advanced CRC, patients by assessment of progression free survival (PFS) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)., up to 12 months|Overall survival time, OS was calculated from the date of pharmacy to death from any cause., up to 36 months|Assess the anti-tumor activity:DCR, Disease control rate (DCR):CR + PR + SD rate according to the RECIST version 1.1 guidelines., up to 12 months
Currently second-line treatment is the Anti-vascular combined chemotherapy, the third line standard is multi-target antivascular therapy, RIGONIVO research in three line treatment of good data, but failed to further validation in the real world, one of the reasons may be the third line therapy, patients physical score is relatively poor, immunotherapy to join may play a role,As we know, the PS score of all effective cases in the Rigonivo study was 0. Therefore, if the idea of antivascular combined immunotherapy is moved forward, it is possible to achieve better efficacy,Based on the above,The objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Surufatinib Combine With Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy for Second-line Treatment in Advanced Colorectal Cancer.
