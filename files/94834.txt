A Study of Telaglenastat (CB-839) in Combination With Palbociclib in Patients With Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1b/2 study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical activity of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenestat (CB-839) with the CDK4/6 Inhibitor, palbociclib in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.
Solid Tumors|NSCLC|CRC|KRAS Gene Mutation
DRUG: Telaglenestat (CB-839)|DRUG: Palbociclib Oral Capsule or Tablet [Ibrance]
Safety and Tolerability of telaglenestat (CB-839) in combination with palbociclib: (CR) number of participants with treatment related adverse events, Number of participants with treatment related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, Start of treatment to 28 days post treatment|Maximum tolerated dose and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose:, Incidence and nature of dose-limiting toxicities, Measured from Part 1 patients only within their first 28 day cycle
Maximum plasma concentration of telaglenastat and palbociclib:, Non-compartmental method of analysis will be used to analyze the plasma concentrations, PKs are drawn on two different days (Day 8 and Day 15) during Cycle 1|Anti-tumor activity of telaglenestat and palbociclib:, Change in tumor size from baseline, Approximately every 8 weeks until disease progression, for approximately 18 months
This is a Phase 1b/2 study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical activity of the glutaminase inhibitor telaglenestat (CB-839) with the CDK4/6 Inhibitor, palbociclib in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors.
