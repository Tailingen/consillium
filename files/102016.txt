FGF401 in HCC and Solid Tumors Characterized by Positive FGFR4 and KLB Expression
Estimate the maximum tolerated dose and/or recommended phase II dose and efficacy of FGF401 as single agent and in combination with PDR001 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and as single agent in patients with other solid malignancies based on RECIST 1.1.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)|Solid Malignancies
DRUG: FGF401|BIOLOGICAL: PDR001
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT): Phase I Only, A dose-limiting toxicity was defined as an adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, inter-current illness, or concomitant medications that occurred within the evaluation period of DLTs and met any of the criteria listed. The estimation of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the treatment was based upon the estimation of the probability of DLT during the evaluation period for subjects in the dose determining set (DDS). A subject with multiple occurrences of a DLT under one treatment is counted only once in the AE category for that treatment. A subject with multiple DLTs within a primary system organ class is counted only once in the total row., Cycle 1 (C1) (21 days) for FGF401 single agent, Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (C2) (42 days) for FGF401 and PDR001 combination|Time to Progression (TTP): Group 1 & Group 2 (Phase II Only), TTP is defined as the date of start treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer.

The primary objectives of this study were in 2 parts: Phase l \& Phase II.

The study included different periods starting by molecular pre-screening (applicable for all subjects enrolled under protocol versions 00 to 03, or applicable only for Phase I and Group 3 in Phase II of FGF401 single agent, for subjects enrolled under protocol version 04), Screening, Treatment, End of Treatment, Disease progression follow-up (if applicable), Safety follow-up and then ended by survival follow-up period

In the Phase I part, subjects with HCC or other advanced solid tumors characterized by positive FGFR4 and KLB expression were enrolled and treated with FGF401 as a single agent or in combination with PDR001. Subjects in this phase were dosed under fasted or fed conditions.

In the Phase 2 part, subjects with advanced HCC or other solid tumors bearing positive FGFR4 and KLB expression were enrolled into three groups (Group 1: HCC subjects from Asian countries; Group 2: HCC subjects from non-Asian countries; Group 3: Subjects with other solid malignancies regardless of geography) to assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of FGF401 in Phase ll. This Phase II part investigated the anti-tumor activity of FGF401 single agent and in combination with PDR001.

Each group within the Phase II dose expansion part targeted a different number of subjects. Group 1 and Group 2 planned to enroll around 40 subjects each and Group 3 planned to enroll approximately 20 subjects. Subjects in this phase were dosed under fasted conditions.

Oral FGF401 was administered on a continuous once daily (QD) dosing regimen for both FGF401 single agent and in combination with PDR001 parts. Intravenous PDR001 was administered in a fixed dosing regimen of 300 mg iv every three weeks as per protocol until subject experienced unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease and/or treatment was discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator or withdrawal of consent.

Because the enrollment of new subjects in this study was halted for business reason on 03-Jul-2018 early enrollment termination was declared following the initial halt of enrollment once the global last subject last visit was achieved as per protocol, and consequently the phase II part of the FGF401+PDR001 combination did not start, none of the planned analyses related to the phase II part of the FGF401+PDR001 combination arm were performed.

Duration of treatment: Subjects could continue study treatment until they experienced any of the following: Disease progression (radiologically documented according to RECIST v1.1) as assessed by the Investigator, unacceptable toxicity, \& treatment was discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator or the subject.

Subjects who permanently discontinued the study treatment for any reason other than disease progression or withdrawal of consent had to continue efficacy assessments as scheduled in the protocol until the time of disease progression.
