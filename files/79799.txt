A Study of Mitomycin-c/ Capecitabine ChemoRadiotherapy Combined With Nivolumab Monotherapy or Ipilumimab and Nivolumab, as Bladder Sparing Curative Treatment for Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer: the CRIMI Study
A multicenter Phase 1b/2, two stage, open label study of MMC/Capecitabine ChRT combined with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy in adult (\>18 years) subjects with non-metastatic muscle invasive bladder cancer that qualify for ChRT with curative intent.

Immunotherapy combined with chemoradiation for localized bladder cancer may exhibit improved efficacy with an acceptable toxicity profile.

The aim of this phase 1b/2, two stage, open label study of MMC/Capecitabine ChRT combined with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy stuy is: to assess the feasibility and safety, the disease free survival (DFS) and disease free survival rate (DFS-rate) of the addition of nivolumab and/or ipilimumab to MMC/capecitabine chemoradiation of the bladder.
