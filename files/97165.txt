Metabolic Outcomes in Patients Receiving Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Therapy With Dasatinib or Nilotinib
The purpose of this study was to determine how often and how likely patients are to develop Type 2 Diabetes or high cholesterol/lipids when receiving dasatinib or nilotinib as therapy for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML).
