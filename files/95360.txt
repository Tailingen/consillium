Use of ACA 125 in Patients With Ovarian Cancer: Safety and Immune Response
The purpose of this study is to use an immunologic approach following the treatment for recurrent disease in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Neoplasms|Peritoneal Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: ACA 125
Safety, feasibility and tolerability|The primary endpoint is drop-out due to toxicity as the overall measure of feasibility
Duration and strength of the immune response induced by ACA 125 vaccination
Patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer who receive surgical cytoreduction and platinum/taxane containing chemotherapy have a significant chance of entering complete clinical remission but about 70% will eventually relapse. Many patients respond to additional cytotoxic treatment with partial or complete responses, yet approximately 100% of these patients will ultimately progress. Novel consolidation strategies following treatment for recurrent disease are needed and an immunologic approach is an attractive option.
