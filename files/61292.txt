Salivary LINC00657 as a Diagnostic Biomarker for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This study was designed to verify the role of salivary LINC00657 as a diagnostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients as compared to oral lichen planus (OLP) (as an example of oral potentially malignant lesions) and normal individuals, and to show its relation to miR-106a. A total of 36 participants were included.
Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
LINC00657 level in salivary samples from all participants measured using PCR, quantitative real-time PCR is used to detect LINC00657 levels in saliva samples from patients with OSCC and OPMD compared to healthy subjects, level of miR-106a is measured after the completion of all salivary sample collection carried at the 1 day of enrollment of subjects in the investigation after diagnosis confirmation
miR-106a level in salivary samples from the included subjects evaluated by PCR, quantitative real-time PCR is used to detect miR106a levels in saliva samples from patients with OSCC and OPMD compared to healthy subjects, level of miR-106a is measured after the completion of all salivary sample collection carried at the 1 day of enrollment of subjects in the investigation

A total of 36 participants were included, subdivided into 3 groups: Group I: 12 patients diagnosed with OSCC. Group II: 12 patients diagnosed with OLP. Group III: 12 systemically free individuals with no oral mucosal lesions. statistical analysis and ROC analysis were performed
