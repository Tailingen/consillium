A Clinical Trial to Evaluate Effect of IBB0979 in Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumors
This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose escalation and dose expansion study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and preliminary antitumor activity of IBB0979 in previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

The study consists of Dose Escalation Phase, Dose Expansion Phase and Clinical Exploration Phase.

Dose Escalation Phase：This phase is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter, dose-escalation study. From the starting dose of 0.01 mg/kg, an accelerated titration combined with a "3+3" design will be adopted.

Dose Expansion Phase：The application of Dose Expansion Phase can be discussed by investigator and sponsor based on data obtained in Dose Escalation Phase. This phase is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study. 6 patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors are expected to be enrolled at DRDE. Each treatment cycle is defined as 21 days, patient may receive treatment until withdrawal or Treatment Discontinuation.

Clinical Exploration Phase：After completing the dose escalation and expansion studies, the indication and study population can be discussed by the investigator and sponsor based on the efficacy and safety data that have been obtained.
