Palbociclib, Letrozole & Venetoclax in ER and BCL-2 Positive Breast Cancer
This study is investigating the combination of palbociclib, letrozole and venetoclax in ER and BCL-2 positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

It is hypothesised that venetoclax may augment the actions of palbociclib and letrozole in these patient groups. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination treatment, which can be used in subsequent studies. The study will also investigate disease response and survival.

Participants will receive palbociclib (daily, on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle), letrozole (daily, on days 1-28 of each 28 day cycle) and venetoclax (daily, on days 1-21 of each 28 day cycle) until the last patient has completed 18 months treatment on the study.

Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and recommended phase 2 dose of drug combination of palbociclib, letrozole and venetoclax., To determine the MTD and DLTs of the combination of palbociclib, letrozole and venetoclax in ER positive, BCL-2 positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer or locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to surgical or local therapy with curative intent, and to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose., 36 months
Safety profile of the combination of palbociclib, letrozole and venetoclax: CTCAE V 5, Toxicities measured using CTCAE V 5, maximum 36 months|Response Rate, To describe the best response (according to RECIST v1.1), defined as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) or stable disease (SD) at 24 weeks., 24 weeks|Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) defined as the time from commencement of the study to date of death from any cause, 36 months|Clinical benefit rate, To estimate clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as CR, PR or SD., 36 months|Patient reported outcomes, Defined as treatment-related symptoms, patient functioning, and health-related quality of life associated with venetoclax in combination with palbociclib and letrozole. Assessed through patient reported outcomes using a validated quality of life questionnaire - EORTC QLQ C30. The questionnaire is deigned to evaluate change in quality of life over time. Outcomes are rated by the patient on a numerical scale over 28 questions of between 1-4 With 1 being no issue to 4 being a significant issue. There are an additional 2 questions regarding overall quality of life which are rated on a numerical scale 1-7 with 1 being the poorest and 7 being excellent., 36 months
