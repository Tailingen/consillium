Precision Medicine Trial Based on Molecular Matching Therapy for Patients With Standard Treatment Exhaustion
The main purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility of selecting treatment plans based on genomic variations guided by MTB in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.

PFS2/PFS1(Progression Free Survival 2/Progression Free Survival 1), The time to progression-free survival during the substudy (PFS2) exceeds the documented time to disease progression-free survival during the last treatment prior to substudy entry (PFS1) by at least 35% (ie, PFS2/PFS1≥1.3) or, if PFS1 is not evaluable, time to progressive disease exceeds 6 months., 24 months
OS(Overall Survival), Evaluation of overall survival (OS) defined as the time between inclusion and death, whatever the cause is. Alive patients will be censored at their last known contact date., 24 months|ORR(Objective Response Rate), Evaluation of the best objective response rate (ORR) for each treatment according to RECIST 1.1. The best ORR is the best response reached during treatment according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., 24 months|Number of treatment related adverse events with grade 3 or greater severity by CTCAE 5.0, Treatment related adverse events with grade 3 or greater severity by CTCAE 5.0., 24 months
Using comprehensive genome sequencing to analyze recurrent and metastatic solid tumors that have failed previous conventional treatments, and matching possible targeted therapy drugs to screen for potential effective treatment drugs until tumor disease progression, and then continuing to monitor tumor resistance mutation signals and provide matching therapy, can help improve the clinical outcomes of patients with advanced refractory tumors, and is also an important direction for personalized and precise treatment of tumors in the future. Therefore, the investigators designed this study to explore the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of targeted therapy based on tumor molecular feature matching for advanced solid tumor patients who have failed previous treatments. All patients who receive treatment with a drug available in the protocol will be followed for standard efficacy outcomes including clinical efficacy ,clinical safety and exploratory endpoints such as biomarkers for drug response, change in the tumor microenvironment. The core concepts of the clinical research interventional initiated include: target priority principle, combination therapy principle, individualized dose adjustment method for combination therapy, and Bayesian adaptive trial design. For some clinical studies, to meet the primary objective, at least 35% of participants had to achieve a PFS2(Progression-Free Survival 2)/PFS1(Progression-Free Survival 1) ≥ 1.3 in a sample population of 25 evaluable patients. Sample size was calculated using an exact single-stage design for phase II studies with a one-sided type I error of 5% and a power of 90% under the assumption that PFS2/PFS1≥ 1.3 in ≤10% of patients would be clinically irrelevant, while a success rate ≥ 35% would merit further investigation.
