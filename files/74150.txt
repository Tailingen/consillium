A Phase II Study of High Dose Bolus IL2 in Patients With Inoperable Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma Who Have Failed Prior Anti-PD1 Immunotherapy: Efficacy and Biomarker Study
This study is for patients with advanced stage III or stage IV melanoma not adequately treated by surgery who have progressed after treatment with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The purpose of this study is to see if giving high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) after progression on nivolumab or pembrolizumab is effective in treating metastatic melanoma. This study is also being done to look at the severity of side effects of IL-2 in patients.

IL-2 is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced melanoma.

DRUG: High dose bolus interleukin-2 (HD IL2)
Response Rate, Percentage of complete responses (CR) plus partial responses (PR), based upon Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, Up to 15 months for accrual, plus 6 months of intervention for last subject enrolled (21 months)
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Number of months of survival without disease progression from start of protocol therapy until objective tumor progression or death, per RECIST v1.1, Up to 15 months for accrual, plus 6 months of intervention for last subject enrolled, plus 5 years of follow-up (6 years, 9 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Number of months from start of protocol therapy until death from any cause., Up to 15 months for accrual, plus 6 months of intervention for last subject enrolled, plus 5 years of follow-up (6 years, 9 months)|HD IL2 Levels, Levels of HD IL2 biomarker in the blood of patients that received at least course 1 of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) version 1.1, Up to 21 months
This is a phase II study of high dose bolus interleukin-2 (HD IL2) in patients with advanced inoperable stage III or stage IV melanoma who have prior anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

Each course consists of 2 cycles of HD IL2 as follows: high-dose IL2 at 600,000 IU/kg is given intravenously (IV) every 8 hours for up to 14 doses (one cycle), followed by a rest period of 1-2 weeks and readmission for a second HD IL2 cycle for up to 14 doses (second cycle).

The planned treatment consists of 3 courses (6 cycles) of HD IL-2. Response assessment will occur at the end of each course of therapy and patients without evidence of disease progression (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, RECIST, version 1.1) or limiting toxicities will be offered additional courses of treatment of HD IL2 for a maximum of 3 courses.
