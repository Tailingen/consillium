Adebrelimab Plus Chemotherapy, Bevacizumab and Fluzoparib in Platinum-Sensitive Relapsed Ovarian Cancer
The investigators explore the efficacy and safety of adebrelimab (PD-L1 inhibitor) plus chemotherapy and bevacizumab induction therapy followed by maintenance therapy with adebrelimab plus fluzoparib (PARP inhibitor)and bevacizumab in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer.
