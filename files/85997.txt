Intra-arterial Versus Intravenous Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer
This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of intra- arterial infusion of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. This protocol is overseen by the Fudan University Institutional Review Board which has Federal Wide Assurance through the U.S. Department of Health \& Human Services (Approved: April 25, 2002).
Carcinoma, Pancreatic
PROCEDURE: Transcatheter arterial infusion|PROCEDURE: Intravenous chemotherapy|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
Overall survival, From date of randomization until the date of death, assessed up to 100 months.
Progression free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months.
Primary Outcome Measures:

To compare the overall survival (OS) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer treated with transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI) of chemotherapeutics or systemic delivered chemotherapy.

Secondary Outcome Measures:

To compare the progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), quality of life (QoL), and adverse effects of treating locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients with TAI or systemic chemotherapy.

Exploratory Outcome Measures:

To evaluate the correlation between prognosis and expression of serum microRNAs of the patients.
