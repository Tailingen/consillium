Impact of a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Perioperative Geriatrics Unit on Functional Status of Patients Aged 70 and Over Operated on for Colorectal Cancer
Health establishments encourage the development of specific care pathways for the elderly by supporting Geriatric Peri-Operative Units (GPOU). Indeed, this shared care model has shown a clear reduction in mortality and the number of re-hospitalizations in patients 6 months after their care. The multidisciplinary approach of global management of the patient in the perioperative period aims to reduce surgical stress as well as the rapid restoration of previous physical and psychic abilities. Colorectal surgery, the main treatment for stage I to III colon cancer, is a morbid surgery. Despite numerous efficacy data on improved rehabilitation after colorectal surgery, care programs are not specific to the geriatric population and geriatric assessment criteria to describe the functional status of patients are not commonly used. The study investigators wish to evaluate the impact of GPOU treatment following colorectal surgery, on the evolution of several clinical parameters such as: functional status, morbidity mortality, quality of life, and lifestyle. The study investigators hypothesize that management in the GPOU for colorectal cancer surgery in patients aged 70 and over will improve functional status at 3 months, in comparison with traditional management. The proposed intervention should also lead to an improvement in patient satisfaction with care, complications and re-hospitalizations, nutritional status, lifestyle and patient survival.
