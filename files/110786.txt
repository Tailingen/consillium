A Study of Fluzoparib±Apatinib Versus Placebo Maintenance Treatment in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer Following Response on First-Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy
This is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, 3-arm Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fluzoparib alone or with Apatinib versus Placebo, as maintenance treatment, in patients with Stage III or IV ovarian cancer. Patients must have completed first-line platinum based regimen with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). The study contains a Safety Lead-in Phase in which the safety and tolerability of Fluzoparib+Apatinib will be assessed prior to the Phase 3 portion of the study.
