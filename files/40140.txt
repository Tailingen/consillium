Multimodal Approach in Patients With mHSPC. Randomized Trial of APA+ADT vs APA-ADT and Local Treatment
Italian multicenter study, will enroll \~566 pts with oligometastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer who are candidates to receive treatment with apalutamide.

After 6 months from the start of treatment, patients will be randomized to receive local treatment based on the investigator's choice ( either one between primary radiotherapy or cytoreductive prostatectomy), in addition to apalutamide, or to continue just with medical therapy.
Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC)
DRUG: APA + ADT|PROCEDURE: Local Treatmetn RT or RP
Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS), Evaluation of the efficacy of treatment with APA+ADT for 6 months followed by locoregional treatment with radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy compared to treatment with APA+ ADT alone in terms of Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS) in patients with hormone prostate adenocarcinoma -susceptible with low-volume metastatic disease., Up to 48 months
Local event - free survival, Defined as the absence of one of the following conditions in the follow up: urinary retention, hydronephrosis, acute or chronic renal failure exacerbation, intestinal obstruction, Up to 48 months|Local treatment - free survival, Defined as the absence of the need for one of the following interventions: trans-urethral resection of the prostate, placement of a ureteral stent or nephrostomy for hydronephrosis, bladder catheterization, surgery for intestinal obstruction/colostomy, Up to 48 months
Primary end point: To determine whether treatment with apalutamide in combination with androgen-deprivative therapy for 6 months followed by locoregional treatment with radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy has better efficacy than medical treatment with apalutamide + ADT alone in terms of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), specifically time to radiographic progression in soft tissue per RECIST 1.1 or in bone per PCWG3 criteria by investigator, or death. Secondary end points: To evaluate tumor shrinkage after locoregional approach and to evaluate short and long term side effects after locoregional surgery or RT, time to PSA progression, time to castration resistance, cancer specific survival, overall survival and quality of life according to EPIC-26 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires.
