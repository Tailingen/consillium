Number of Subjects With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or 4 haematological or non-haematological toxicity occurring at any dose level until the end of Week 4, and suspected to be reasonably related to the investigational medicinal product by the Investigator and/or Sponsor. Toxicities not considered to be DLTs are as follows- Allergic reactions or anaphylaxis; any Grade 3 or 4 out-of-range laboratory values without any clinical correlate, which were reversible within 7 days, unless the Investigator decided this event is clinically significant. For this reason Grade 3 or 4 out-of-range laboratory values must be re-assessed within 7 days. In case the Investigator provides the subject any treatment(s) due to the out-of-range laboratory values, the event was regarded as a DLT., Baseline up to Week 4|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax): After Single Dose, Pre-dose, hour 1(end of infusion [EOI]), 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours after start of infusion at Week 1|Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of EMD 525797:After Multiple Dose, Pre-dose, hour 1 (EOI), 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours after start of infusion at Week 5|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration(AUC0-t) of EMD 525797: After Single Dose, Area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to the last sampling time at which the concentration is at or above Lower limit of quantification (LLQ)., Pre-dose, hour 1 (EOI), 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours after start of infusion at Week 1|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration(AUC0-t) of EMD 525797: After Multiple Dose, Area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to the last sampling time at which the concentration is at or above LLQ., Pre-dose, hour 1 (EOI), 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours after start of infusion at Week 5|Total Body Clearance (CL) of EMD 525797: After Single Dose, Total body clearance of drug in serum was calculated: as CL= Dose divided by Area under the serum concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-inf)., Pre-dose, hour 1 (EOI), 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 hours after start of infusion at Week 1|Total Body Clearance at Steady State (CLss) of EMD 525797, Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.
