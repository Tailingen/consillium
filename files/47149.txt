Higher scores in the symptom scales demonstrated higher levels of symptoms., From the start of immunotherapy until 24 months of follow-up.|Health-related quality of life (EQ5D), EuroQol Five Dimensions Health Questionnaire. Domains: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. It also includes a VAS regarding patients' "Health Today" scored between 0 and 100. Each domain will be converted into categorical values (problems vs no problems)., From the start of immunotherapy until 24 months of follow-up.|Health-related quality of life (CWS), Cancer worry scale. Rated on a Likert-type scale from one (never) to four (almost always), which were summed to produce a total CWS score ranging from 8 to 32, with higher scores indicating more frequent worries about cancer., From the start of immunotherapy until 24 months of follow-up.|Health-related quality of life (IT), Immunotherapy questionnaire. Rated on a Likert-type scale from one (never) to four (almost always), to evaluate toxicity after immunotherapy treatment., From the start of immunotherapy until 24 months of follow-up.|Health-related quality of life (sexuality questionnaire), Rated on a Likert-type scale from one (never) to four (almost always), to evaluate problems in sexual functioning., From the start of immunotherapy until 24 months of follow-up.|Treatment duration, Total duration of received treatment, From the start of immunotherapy until the end of treatment (average 6 weeks)|Treatment stops, The amount of times and the length of time the immunotherapy, surgery or adjuvant radiotherapy had to be stopped., From the start of immunotherapy until the end of treatment (average 6 weeks)|Disease-specific survival, The length of time a patient survives without death due to disease., From the start of immunotherapy until 2 years follow-up.|Recurrence-free survival, The length of time a patient survives without recurrent disease., From the start of immunotherapy until 2 years follow-up.|Event-free survival, The length of time a patient survives without recurrent disease or death of any cause., From the start of immunotherapy until 2 years follow-up.|Overall survival, The length of time a patient survives after treatment., From the start of immunotherapy until 2 years follow-up.|Healthcare consumption, Healthcare consumption during the trial., From the start of immunotherapy until 24 months of follow-up.|Cost-effectiveness, The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between quality-adjusted life years and the cost of trial-related healthcare., From the start of immunotherapy until 24 months of follow-up.

This is an investigator-initiated phase 2 clinical trial consisting of 41 patients with stage I-IVa CSCC and an indication for morbid/extensive curative surgery. All patients will receive two courses of nivolumab 3 mg/kg in week 0 and week 2, and one course of ipilimumab 1 mg/kg in week 0. In week 5 response to immunotherapy will be evaluated using clinical examination, \[18F\]FDG-PET/CT imaging, regional lymph node ultrasound with FNAC (if applicable) and a multicentre multidisciplinary meeting. Non-responders will receive standard of care surgery (w/wo radiotherapy). Responders will enter a wait-and-monitor follow-up schedule in which response will be monitored every 3 months for a total of 2 years. If a patient is no longer responding to immunotherapy during follow-up they will receive standard of care surgery (w/wo radiotherapy).
