Radiopharmaceuticals Analysis for Detailed Insights And INternational Tracking of Safety
Little is known about cancer therapy-related radiopharmaceuticals drugs safety. Here the investigators use VigiBase (http://www.vigiaccess.org/), the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to identify and describe cases of cancer therapy-related radiopharmaceuticals drugs.

Toxicity of Radiopharmaceuticals drugs, Identification and report of toxicities of radiopharmaceuticals drugs. The research includes the report with MedDRA terms: System organ class (SOC), Preferred terms (PT), High level group term (HLGT), High level term (HLT), Case reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports through study completion, an average 5 years
Individual safety case reports parameters, weight in kilograms, height in meters, age in years, country, date of report in years, co-medication in active ingredients name, sex (male / female), severity (yes or no), death reported (yes or no), reporter qualification, action taken with drug, outcome (recovered, not recovered, role of co-medication (suspect, concomittant, unknown), drugs doses (MegaBecquerels, milligrams, grams, international units, milliliters), route of administration. Date of suspected drug administration, Start date and end date of reported adverse events. Dechallenge of suspected drugs (yes , no, unknown), Rechallenge of suspected drugs (yes , no, unknown)., Through study completion, an average 5 years
Radiopharmaceuticals drugs especially for therapeutic purposes are responsible of a wide range of side effects. The investigators use VigiBase, the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to identify cases of adverse drug reactions following treatment with radiopharmaceuticals drugs.
