Prophylactic or Preemptive Entecavir in Patients With Gastrointestinal Cancer Who Are Inactive Hepatitis B Carriers
There has been no report on whether the patients with gastrointestinal cancer who are also inactive hepatitis B carriers should receive prophylactic use or preemptive use of an anti-viral drug entecavir during anti-tumor therapy. This open, multicentre, phase 3, randomized controlled clinical trial aims to compare the impact of the prophylactic use or preemptive use of an anti-viral drug entecavir on the outcomes of patients with gastrointestinal cancer who are also inactive hepatitis B carriers during chemotherapy or immunotherapy and the subsequent follow-ups, including two cohorts of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
Gastrointestinal Cancers
DRUG: Entecavir
The incidence of hepatitis B virus reactivation, HBV reactivation is defined as (1) an increase in HBV-DNA levels by ≥2 log10 (100-fold) compared to baseline or conversion from negative serum HBV-DNA to positive HBV-DNA; (2) if baseline HBV-DNA was undetectable, achieving HBV-DNA levels ≥3 log10 (1,000 IU/mL); or (3) if baseline levels were unknown or unavailable, reaching HBV-DNA levels ≥4 log10 (10,000 IU/mL)., through study completion, an average of 1 year
Hepatitis, Hepatitis is defined as a 3-fold or greater increase in the serum ALT level that exceeded the reference range or an absolute increase in the level of ALT of greater than 100 U/L compared with the baseline level, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Hepatitis B virus associated hepatitis, Hepatitis B virus associated hepatitis is defined as hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation occurring prior to or concurrent with hepatitis during or following chemotherapy/immunotherapy , in the absence of clinical or laboratory evidence of acute infection by other hepatitis viruses or systemic diseases., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Interruption of chemotherapy/immunotherapy due to hepatitis, Chemotherapy/immunotherapy disruption due to hepatitis is defined as either premature termination or a delay of at least 7 days between therapy cycles due to hepatitis ., through study completion, an average of 1 year|Severe HBV associated hepatitis, Severe HBV associated hepatitis is defined as grade 3 or higher HBV associated hepatitis according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0., through study completion, an average of 1 year|HBV associated acute liver failure, HBV associated acute liver failure, also termed HBV associated fulminant hepatic failure , is defined as acute hepatic decompensation linked to HBV reactivation or acute exacerbation of HBV infection. It manifests within days to weeks, leading to severe complications such as coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, and multiorgan failure, with a high 28-day mortality rate . Delayed initiation of nucleotide analogues may contribute to rapid disease progression and poor prognosis., through study completion, an average of 1 year|HBV related death, HBV related death is defined as mortality directly attributable to HBV reactivation, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Patients with gastrointestinal cancer who are also inactive hepatitis B carriers are enrolled and randomized into two groups as following. Patients in experimental group are treated with entecavir prophylactically in the dose of 0.5mg p.o. every day from the initiation of chemotherapy or immunotherapy till 6 months after the end of chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Patients in active comparator group are only treated with entecavir in the dose of 0.5mg p.o. every day from the time that the DNA copies of hepatitis B virus become positive till 6 months after the end of chemotherapy or immunotherapy.
