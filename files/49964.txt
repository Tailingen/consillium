Fistula-associated Anal Adenocarcinoma
The fistula-associated anal adenocarcinoma is rare in patients suffering from anal fistulas. There is only little data available for this patient collective making characterization and management of this disease difficult. Late diagnosis and advanced tumor stage at diagnosis result in poor clinical outcome. It is the purpose of this study to evaluate patients clinically diagnosed with a FAAC and to further perform a histopathological characterization of the available tumor specimen.
