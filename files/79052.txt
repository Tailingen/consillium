A Prospective Cohort Study for Patients With Adrenal Diseases
The purpose of this study is to investigate the pathologic features, complications, and prognostic factors of functioning adrenal adenoma and suggest follow-up algorithms for adrenal incidentaloma.
Adrenal Adenoma|Cushing Syndrome|Pheochromocytoma|Adrenal Incidentaloma|Adrenocortical Carcinoma|Primary Hyperaldosteronism
OTHER: Hormone study and Imaging study
Number of participants in remission, Remission rate, Up to 10 years
Complication of adrenal disease, all complications including deaths, Up to 10 years
The investigators will recruit 150 patients annually for 10 years (adrenal incidentaloma 100 patients, pheochromocytoma 15 patients, primary aldosteronism 25 patients, adrenal cushing syndrome 10 patients, adrenocortical carcinoma 2 patients) and perform hormonal, biochemical, imaging exam according to each disease's clinical guidelines. Based on this, the investigators will identify pathologic features, complications, and prognostic factors of each disease.
