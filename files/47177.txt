Holmium-166 TARE in Liver Limited Unresectable Colorectal Cancer Patients
The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of 166Ho-TARE followed by maintenance therapy with fluoropyrimidine and anti-EGFR or bevacizumab in liver-limited unresectable colorectal cancer patients, in terms of progression free rate 9- and 8-months for cohort A and B, respectively.

PROCEDURE: 166Holmium TARE|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Panitumumab|DRUG: 5-Fluorouracil|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Capecitabine
Progression-free survival (PFS) Rate, PFS is defined as the time from study enrolment to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive, on study and progression free at the time of the analysis., 36 months
Overall Toxicity rate, Overall Toxicity rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, who receive 166Ho-TARE and at least one cycle of chemotherapy, experiencing any adverse event, according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 5.0) during the study treatment., 36 months|Grade 3/ Grade 4 Toxicity rate, Grade 3/ Grade 4 Toxicity rate is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, who receive 166Ho-TARE and at least one cycle of chemotherapy, experiencing a specific adverse event of severity grade 3/ grade 4, according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 5.0) during the study treatment., 36 months|Post-treatment Disease Control Rate (DCR), Post-treatment DCR, is defined as the percentage of patients, relative to the total of enrolled subjects, achieving a complete (CR), partial (PR) response or stable disease (SD), according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, during the study treatment. The determination of clinical response will be based on investigator reported measurements. Tumor re-assessment with CT scan will be repeated every 8- weeks., 36 months|Progression free survival, Progression free survival (PFS), is defined as the time from study enrolment to the first documentation of objective disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be censored on the date of the last evaluable on study tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who are alive, on study and progression free at the time of the analysis., 36 months|Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS), is defined as the time from enrolment to death from any cause. For patients still alive at the time of analysis, the OS time will be censored on the last date the patients were known to be alive., 36 months|Dose-response relationships, Dose-response relationships are defined as the relationships between the tumor-absorbed doses calculated on post-treatment SPECT-CT (dependent variables) and the following independent variables: tumor response (SD, PR, CR according to RECIST CRITERIA v 1.1), progression free survival rate, and Overall Survival., 36 months|Quality of Life (QoL) assessed using the EORTC QLQ-CR29 questionnaire, The EORTC QLQ-CR29 is a patient-reported outcome measure to evaluate health-related quality of life among colorectal cancer patients in research and clinical practice.

QoL assessed using the EORTC QLQ-CR29 questionnaire will be evaluate at specific time-points (baseline, tumor reassessment and disease progression) and will be assessed through descriptive summary statistics., 36 months|Quality of Life (QoL) assessed using the EORTC QLQ-CR30 questionnaire, The EORTC QLQ-CR30 is 30-item instrument designed to measure quality of life in all cancer patients.

QoL assessed using the EORTC QLQ-CR30 questionnaire will be evaluate at specific time-points (baseline, tumor reassessment and disease progression) and will be assessed through descriptive summary statistics., 36 months|Quality of Life (QoL) assessed using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire, The EuroQol EQ-5D comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems.

QoL assessed using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire will be evaluate at specific time-points (baseline, tumor reassessment and disease progression) and will be assessed through descriptive summary statistics., 36 months
HAITI is a phase II, single-arm trial of 166Ho-TARE followed by maintenance therapy in liver-limited unresectable colorectal cancer patients, achieving partial response or stable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria after 6-12 cycles of induction first-line chemotherapy.

Two cohorts of patients are included:

* left sided RAS/BRAF wild-type (cohort A)
* right-sided and/or RAS mutated (cohort B)

Enrolled patients will be treated with different maintenance therapy according to study cohort (fluoropyrimidine + anti-EGFR or bevacizumab).
