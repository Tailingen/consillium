The identification of robust prognostic and predictive markers could allow the individualization of pulmonary stereotactic radiotherapy treatments and the selection of patients at high risk of relapse, who could then benefit from a dose escalation in order to increase the chances of local control .

Beyond the pulmonary RTS (Radiotherapy in stereotactic condition), this study will aim to generate one or more models of multi-scale response to hypofractionated irradiation from biomarkers (biological or images) extracted from preclinical or clinical literature data and to allow simulations of Various modified fractionation irradiation schemes, potentially leading to new regimens that reduce side effects and increase therapeutic efficacy.
