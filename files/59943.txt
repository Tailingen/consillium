GPC3-targeting CART Cell in Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
A Phase I Clinical Trial for Evaluating the Safety, Tolerance and Efficacy of GPC3-targeting CART Cell in Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: GPC3 Targeting CART Cells
Incidence, severity, and type of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), An adverse event refers to any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product (investigational or non-investigational), which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment, Minimum 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate, Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) refers to a drug-related toxicity during treatment with the drug, the severity of which is clinically unacceptable, limiting the further escalation of drug dose., Minimum 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) finding, RP2D established through ATD+BOIN design, 30 days after CART infusion (Day 1)|CAR positive T cells, CAR positive T cells after CART infusion, Minimum 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)|CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood, CAR transgene levels in peripheral blood after CART infusion, Minimum 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)
Overall response rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR or PR after treatment via CART cell infusion, and the objective tumor response rate will be calculated for patients with measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 only, Minimum 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response, partial responses and stable disease, Minimum 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)|Duration of Response(DoR), Duration of Remission (DoR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of remission (PR or better) to the first documented disease progression evidence (according to RECIST 1.1) of the responders (who achieve PR or better response), Minimum 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)|Time to Response (TTR), Time to Response (TTR) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of CART to the date of the first response evaluation of the subject who has met all criteria for PR or better, Minimum 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)|Progress Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of the CART to the first documented disease progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first, 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first infusion of CART to death of the subject, Minimum 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)|Incidence of anti-CART antibody, Venous blood samples will be collected to measure CART positive cell concentrations and the transgenic level of CART, at the time points when anti-CART antibody serum samples are evaluated, Minimum 2 years after CART infusion (Day 1)
This is an open-label, dose escalation/expansion study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of CART cell in patients â‰¥ 18 years of age with relapsed or refractory advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will receive cell infusion. The study will include the following sequential phases: screening, pre-treatment (cell product preparation; lymphodepleting chemotherapy), treatment and follow up
