Study of Lymphatic Drainage Mapping in Oropharyngeal Cancers
The purpose of the study is to see how practical it is to inject a radiotracer called 99m-Technetium Sulfur Colloid around the tumors for the imaging of patients with oropharyngeal cancer.

This study will evaluate a technique called lymphatic drainage mapping. This is a technique where a radiotracer (a radioactive material that can be seen with a special computed tomography \[CT\] scanner to create 3D images) is injected into a vein around the tumour, either with local anesthesia or under general anesthesia. The radiotracer that will be used for the lymphatic drainage mapping is called 99m-Technetium Sulfur Colloid. Images will be taken of neck to detect the movement of the radiotracer. This will allow the doctors to see the drainage pattern of the lymph nodes in the neck.

The information from this study will be used to better understand the tendency for oropharyngeal cancers to spread to lymph nodes. In addition, the information from this clinical trial will be used in future clinical studies to help specialists identify strategies to help plan treatment based on this type of imaging study.
