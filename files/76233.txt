Study to Establish the Diagnostic Performance of 18F Fluciclovine PET in Detecting Recurrent Brain Metastases
An open-label, single dose, single arm, prospective, multicenter Phase 3 study to establish the diagnostic performance of 18F fluciclovine positron emission tomography (PET) in detecting recurrent brain metastases after radiation therapy
