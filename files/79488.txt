HDAC Inhibitor Combination with Chemoimmunotherapy in the Neoadjuvant Treatment of PMMR Locally Advanced Colon Cancer
The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn the safety and efficacy of HDAC inhibitors in combination with neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy compared to neoadjuvant therapy in the treatment of locally advanced colon cancer.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Can HDAC inhibitors combined with neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy improve the rate of pCR and complete resection in patients? Are HDAC inhibitors combined with neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy safe and reliable? Does the combination of HDAC inhibitors and neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy achieve a better long-term prognosis than neoadjuvant therapy?
