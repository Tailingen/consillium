Safety, Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of GS-9901 in Adults With Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma, Marginal Zone Lymphoma, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma
This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of GS-9901 monotherapy in adults with follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The study will also characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of GS-9901, determine the appropriate dosing regimen of GS-9901 for use in future clinical trials, and to evaluate the efficacy of GS-9901 monotherapy in adults with FL, MZL, CLL, or SLL.
Follicular Lymphoma|Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Marginal Zone Lymphoma
DRUG: GS-9901
Occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory abnormalities defined as dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Overall safety profile will be characterized by number of participants experiencing adverse events or laboratory abnormalities., Up to 28 days
Occurrence of AEs and clinical laboratory abnormalities not defined as DLTs, Overall safety profile will be characterized by number of participants experiencing adverse events or laboratory abnormalities., Up to 2 years|Overall response rate, Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., Up to 2 years|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval from the start of study therapy to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Duration of response, Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the interval from the first documentation of CR or PR to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause., Up to 2 years|PK profile of GS-9901, This endpoint will measure the plasma PK profile of GS-9901. The following parameters will be measured:

* Cmax: maximum observed concentration of drug in plasma
* AUCtau: concentration of drug over time (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve over the dosing interval), Predose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 hours postdose on Days 1 and 15; predose and 1.5 hours postdose on Days 29, 43, 85, and 169
