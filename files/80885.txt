Study of Brexucabtagene Autoleucel (KTE-X19) for the Treatment of Individuals With Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Malignancies
The primary objectives of this study are:

Cohort 1: to provide access to brexucabtagene autoleucel (KTE-X19) for individuals with relapsed or refractory (r/r) mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) until KTE-X19 is commercially available

Cohort 2: To provide access to KTE-X19 for individuals with r/r MCL whose commercially manufactured product did not meet commercial release specification(s)
Relapse/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Brexucabtagene Autoleucel (KTE-X19)|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
This is an open-label, expanded access study of KTE-X19 for the treatment of individuals with r/r B-cell malignancies. The study will consist of 2 cohorts as indicated below:

Cohort 1 will enroll individuals prior to commercial availability of KTE-X19 for the proposed indication.

Cohort 2 will enroll individuals after KTE-X19 becomes commercially available in cases when KTE-X19 does not meet commercial release specification(s).

The participants who received an infusion of KTE-X19 will be provided the opportunity to transition to a separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) study, KT-US-982-5968.
