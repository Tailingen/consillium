PTeye in Parathyroid Adenoma
Identifying the parathyroids is compulsory for success of parathyroidectomy for parathyroid adenoma. Near-infrared autofluorescence devices have been proposed as useful intraoperative tools for the identification of parathyroid glands. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the correlation of PTeye autofluorescence device with biochemical data of parathyroid adenoma patients.
Parathyroid Adenoma
PROCEDURE: parathyroidectomy
assess the correlation of PTeye values with biochemical data, Biochemical data included are pre- and postoperative parathyroid hormone, serum calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D levels, intraoperatively and 1st postoperative day
Identifying the parathyroids is compulsory for success of parathyroidectomy for parathyroid adenoma. Near-infrared autofluorescence devices have been proposed as useful intraoperative tools for the identification of parathyroid glands. Two approaches are available to surgeons to perform near-infrared autofluorescence: (i) Camera-based systems (CBS) and (ii) Probe-based systems such as PTeyeâ„¢ (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN).The aim of the present study is to evaluate the correlation of PTeye autofluorescence device with biochemical data of parathyroid adenoma patients.
