CAR T Cells for Refractory B Cell Malignancy
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 will be evaluated for safety and efficacy in patients with B cell malignancy including lymphoma or leukemia.
B-Cell Leukemia|B-Cell Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: Autologous CD19-targeting CAR T cells
Tumor load, Tumor load will be quantified with radiology, bone marrow and/or blood samples dependent on diagnosis., Up to 24 months
CAR T cell persistence, Tumor load will be quantified with radiology, bone marrow and/or blood samples dependent on diagnosis, Up to 24 months
B cell number and immunoglobulins in peripheral blood, The number of B cells and immunoglobulins in peripheral blood will be evaluated by routine methods, Up to 12 months
The CAR consists of a CD19 targeting antibody scFv with three intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta, CD28 and 4-1BB. Autologous T cells will be gene engineered with the CAR gene using a lentivirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy.
