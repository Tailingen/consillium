Low Dose Radiation Therapy for Glioblastoma Multiforme
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of low dose rate radiation therapy plus temozolomide. This will be in patients with High Grade Glioma (to only include Anaplastic Astrocytoma or Glioblastoma Multiforme) who have previously been treated with surgery followed by radiation surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy plus temozolomide.
High Grade Glioma
RADIATION: Low Dose Fractionated Radiation Therapy (LDFRT)|DRUG: Temozolomide
Response Rate, To estimate the response rate to salvage temozolomide plus LDFRT., 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up after therapy has been completed|Overall Survival Rate, Overall survival rate is calculated as the median number of months that patients were alive for the cohort, up to 12 months after completion of temozolomide (48 weeks of treatment)
Progression Free Survival Rate, Progression free survival rate is calculated as the median number of months for the cohort until patient's disease worsened/progressed, up to 12 months after completion of temozolomide (48 weeks of treatment)|Number of Patients With Hematologic Toxicities, The number of patients with grade 3+ hematologic toxicities., Approximately every month from study start until 48 weeks, and then up to 12 months after completion of temozolomide at 3, 6, and 12 months follow up|Number of Patients With Neurologic Toxicity, The number of patients with reported grade 3+ neurologic toxicities, Approximately every month from study start until 48 weeks, and then up to 12 months after completion of temozolomide at 3, 6, and 12 months follow up
In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that low dose fractionated radiation therapy (LDFRT) may be used to potentiate full dose chemotherapy, decreasing the development of resistance found with standard doses of radiation and chemotherapy. This is a nonrandomized, open label, single institution phase II trial with a safety run-in to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LDFRT plus temozolomide in patients with High Grade Glioma (to only include Anaplastic Astrocytoma or Glioblastoma Multiforme) previously treated with surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy plus temozolomide. The primary objective of the phase II study is to estimate response rate in patients treated with twice daily fractions of low dose radiation plus temozolomide chemotherapy.
