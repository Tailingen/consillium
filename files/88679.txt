Kidney Cancer|RCC|Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Vorolanib|DRUG: cadonilimab
Objective Response Rate assessed by RECIST 1.1, ORR, per RECIST 1.1 calculated as the proportion of patients with a best overall response defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)., 12 months
Progression Free Survival assessed by the investigator, PFS, defined as time from study drug administration to progression or death due to any cause.disease progression (PD) or death due to any reason. Imaging assessment is based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1)., 24 months|Number of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0, During the AE reporting period specified in the protocol, collect all AEs (including SAEs) and record them in the CRF form., 24 months|Overall Survival, OS, defined as the time from study drug administration until the date of death due to any cause., 24 months|Disease Control Rate, DCR, defined as proportion of complete response, partial response, and disease stabilization to the proportion of patients with evalueable tumors., 12 months|12 months Progression Free Survival Rate, The progression-free survival rate is evaluated for all enrolled patients from the start of the first treatment to 12 months., 12 months|12 months Overall Survival Rate, Assess the overall survival rate for all enrolled patients from the start of the first treatment to 12 months., 12 months|24 months Overall Survival Rate, Assess the overall survival rate for all enrolled patients from the start of the first treatment to 24 months., 24 months|Health-related quality of life, Use the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) to conduct a questionnaire survey on subjects., 24 months
Circulating Tumor Cell / circulating tumor DNA, Exploration of biomarkers with potential clinical value for the clearance of circulating tumor cells/DNA, It is anticipated that blood tests will be conducted on patients before medication, 42±3 days after medication, and within 7 days following disease progression.
This study is a multicenter, prospective, phase I/II single-arm trial, aiming to enroll 37 untreated patients with advanced or metastatic ccRCC to receive vorolanib combined with cadonilimab treatment, and to perform CTC/ctDNA testing on subjects.

In the phase I dose exploration phase, a 3+3 dose escalation method is used to explore the safety of vorolanib at the standard dose combined with cadonilimab within one treatment cycle, and to determine the dose.

In the phase II trial phase, the dosage of vorolanib is determined by the optimal tolerated dose found in the phase I trial, while cadonilimab is combined for treatment.

Patients need to be evaluated for efficacy and safety after every 2 treatment cycles (within ±3 days at the end of each cycle), and continue treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or completion of the prescribed treatment cycle.
