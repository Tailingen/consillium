DRUG: SHR-2004|DRUG: Enoxaparin Sodium Injection; Rivaroxaban Tablets
Primary efficacy endpoint: The incidence rate of VTE from the first medication to the end of the treatment period (Day 28), including asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (confirmed by bilateral lower limb venous compression ultrasound), objectively confirmed symptomatic DVT, and objectively confirmed non-fatal. The composite endpoint of pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) and VTE-related death., up to Day 28|The composite endpoint incidence rate of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) from the first dose to the end of the treatment period, Primary safety endpoints, up to Day 28
The event rate of each component of the primary efficacy endpoint, Secondary efficacy endpoint, up to Day 28|Secondary efficacy endpoint: The total VTE incidence rate from the first medication to the end of follow-up (D85) and the incidence rate of each component event, including asymptomatic DVT (confirmed by bilateral lower limb venous compression color ultrasound), objectively confirmed symptomatic DVT, and objectively confirmed non-fatal. The composite endpoint of sexual PE and VTE-related death., up to Day 85|The event rate of each component of the primary safety endpoint, Secondary safety endpoints, up to Day 28|The incidence of any bleeding events (including minor bleeding events) from the first dose to the end of the treatment period, Secondary safety endpoints, up to Day 28|The composite endpoint incidence rate and each component event rate of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events that meet the definition of ISTH from the first medication to the end of follow-up, Secondary safety endpoints, up to Day 85|The incidence of any bleeding events (including minor bleeding events) from the first dose to the end of follow-up, Secondary safety endpoints, up to Day 85|The incidence and severity of adverse events., Secondary safety endpoints, up to Day 85
