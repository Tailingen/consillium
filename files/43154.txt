Bendamustine and Rituximab With or Without Orelabrutinib in MCL Treatment
This multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Orelabrutinib in combination with Bendamustine and Rituximab (OBR) versus Bendamustine and Rituximab (BR) in patients with intermediate- to high-risk mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who are ineligible for transplantation. The primary objective is to assess the complete response (CR) rate during the induction phase, with secondary objectives including progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. Exploratory analysis will investigate the correlation between tumor biomarkers and treatment efficacy.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)
DRUG: Orelabrutinib|DRUG: Bendamustine|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Venetoclax
Complete response rate, Percentage of participants with complete response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., End of induction treatment visit (6-8 weeks after last dose on Day 1 of Cycle 6 [Cycle length=28 days]
Overall Response Rate, Percentage of participants with overall response was determined on the basis of investigator assessments according to 2014 Lugano criteria., End of induction treatment visit (6-8 weeks after last dose on Day 1 of Cycle 6 [Cycle length=28 days]|Progression-free survival, Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of the first documented day of disease progression or relapse, using 2014 Lugano criteria, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)|Overall survival, Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause., Baseline up to data cut-off (up to approximately 2 years)
