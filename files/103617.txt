A Study of Nivolumab Combined With FOLFOX and Regorafenib in People Who Have HER2-Negative Esophagogastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out whether combining nivolumab, FOLFOX, and regorafenib may be a safe and effective treatment for people who have HER2-negative metastatic esophagogastric cancer.

Nivolumab is an antibody, like the proteins made by the immune system to protect the body from harm. Nivolumab blocks the protein PD-1 (programmed cell death receptor-1) that usually acts as a "brake" on the immune system. Blocking this protein is like releasing the brakes, so that the immune system can target cancer cells and destroy them.

FOLFOX is a combination of three standard chemotherapy drugs (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) commonly used to treat your type of cancer. The drugs work by damaging the DNA in cancer cells, which can cause the cells to stop growing and die.

Regorafenib is a type of drug called a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). This drug targets the tyrosine kinase protein found in or on the surface of cancer cells that the cells need to survive and grow. Blocking this protein may stop cancer cells from growing, or cause them to grow more slowly or to shrink.

The study researchers think that combining nivolumab, FOLFOX, and regorafenib may be a more effective treatment for HER2-negative metastatic esophagogastric cancer than the usual chemotherapy treatment(s) alone.
