Fold change in % γH2AX positive cells from baseline value in tumour samples, To assess the effects of study treatment on γH2AX change in participants with localised prostate cancer, Tumour biopsy taken at diagnosis within approx 2 months of Day 1 planned start of study treatment; post treatment tumour biopsy taken following 21 days (+ up to 7 days) of study treatment
Severity of Treatment-Emergent AEs/SAEs per CTCAE v5.0, To assess the safety and tolerability of study treatment in participants with localised prostate cancer, Day 1 to 28 days post-surgery|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent AEs/SAEs per CTCAE v5.0, To assess the safety and tolerability of study treatment in participants with localised prostate cancer, Day 1 to 28 days post-surgery|Number of patients with abnormal laboratory values, To assess the safety and tolerability of study treatment in participants with localised prostate cancer, Day 1 to 28 days post-surgery|Change from baseline in blood pressure reported as clinically significant, To assess the safety of study treatment in participants with localised prostate cancer, Day 1 to 28 days post-surgery|Change from baseline in heart rate reported as clinically significant, To assess the safety of study treatment in participants with localised prostate cancer, Day 1 to 28 days post-surgery|Change from baseline in QTc value, To assess the safety of study treatment in participants with localised prostate cancer, Day 1 to 28 days post-surgery|Number of participants undergoing planned surgery, To assess the impact of study treatment on surgical feasibility in participants with localised prostate cancer, Measured based on Day 1 to Day 21 of treatment|Reasons of participants requiring treatment-related and non-treatment related delays of surgery and delays > 7 days from scheduled day, To assess the impact of study treatment on surgical feasibility in participants with localised prostate cancer, Measured based on Day 1 to Day 21 of treatment|Number of participants requiring treatment-related and non-treatment related delays of surgery and delays > 7 days from scheduled day, To assess the impact of study treatment on surgical feasibility in participants with localised prostate cancer, Measured based on Day 1 to Day 21 of treatment|Change in Ki-67 % positive cells from baseline in tumour samples, To assess the effects of study treatment on Ki-67 change in participants with localised prostate cancer, Measured based on Day 1 to Day 21 of treatment
