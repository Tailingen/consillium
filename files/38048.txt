A Phase II Study of Postoperative S-1-Based Chemoradiotherapy in Gastric Cancer
The aim of this phase II trial was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and tolerability of intensity-modulated radiotherapy combined with S-1 based chemotherapy in patients with pathologically positive lymph node after completely resected gastric cancer. Furthermore, the investigators sought to compare the dosimetric differences between the volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), Tomotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques in treatment planning for gastric cancer as adjuvant radiotherapy.
