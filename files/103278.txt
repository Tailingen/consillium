Long Term Follow-up Study for Patients Enrolled on the BP-004 Clinical Study
This is a long-term follow up study evaluating the safety of BPX-501 T cells (rivogenlecleucel) and infused in pediatric patients previously enrolled on the BP-004 study.

Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) in both malignant and non-malignant subpopulations at 1 and 2 years in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population, 1 and 2 years after rivogenlecleucel infusion|Incidence of Disease-free Survival, KM Parameter Estimates of disease-free survival (DFS) in the non-malignant subpopulation at 1 and 2 years in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population, 1 and 2 years after rivogenlecleucel infusion|Relapse-free Survival, Kaplan-Meier Parameter Estimates of Relapse-free survival rate (number of patients survived without experiencing a recurrence) at the 1-year and 2-year timepoints in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population in the malignant study arm (patients with a malignant reason for their transplant).

ITT Population: Includes all patients treated with HSCT who received rivogenlecleucel at the dose of 1Ã—10E6 cells/kg, 1 and 2 years after rivogenlecleucel infusion
Subjects enrolled on the BP-004 study who have completed or discontinued from the study, and are beyond Day 180 will be requested to enroll on this long-term follow up protocol. Long term follow up for gene therapy clinical and safety endpoints will continue up to 15 years.
