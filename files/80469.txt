PD-1 Antibody and Sapropterin Dihydrochloride in Patients With PDAC
The prognosis for pancreatic cancer remains dismal, with current guidelines favoring FOLFIRINOX or AG (consisting of Gemcitabine and Abraxane) as the primary chemotherapeutic option. However, research has indicated limited benefits for patients with pancreatic cancer undergoing immunotherapy using Anti-PD-1 antibodies. In this context, researchers aim to investigate the therapeutic potential of Sapropterin Dihydrochloride combined with PD-1 antibody in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who failed to standard treatment.

There is no standard treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who failed to FOLFIRINOX or AG (consisting of Gemcitabine and Abraxane). Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who are unable to tolerate or have failed to respond to standard chemotherapy will be enrolled in this clinical trial. They will be administered a combination treatment of Sapropterin Dihydrochloride and PD-1 antibody. The primary endpoints of this study are objective response rate and safety. The secondary endpoints will encompass overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life. The study aims to enroll a total of 20 participants.
