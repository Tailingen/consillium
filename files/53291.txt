Cancer survivors were selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2007 and 2018. Total sedentary time was assessed by self-reported daily hours of sitting and depressive symptoms were assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves and the Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the separate and joint prognostic effects of sedentary behavior and depressive symptoms with mortality outcomes of cancer survivors.
