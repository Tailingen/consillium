Trial Comparing Metal Versus Plastic Stents for Preoperative Biliary Decompression
Compare the performance of full covered metal stents and plastic stents for preoperative biliary decompression
Obstructive Jaundice|Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: Stent Dysfunction|PROCEDURE: Complications
Complications related to stent dysfunction, Evaluate the rates of complications (%) related to stent dysfunction which include persistent hyperbilirubinemia and cholangitis that warrant stent exchange by a repeat ERCP., 30 days
Procedural complications, This will be measured as proportion of patients who encounter a procedural complication (%) during ERCP that includes pancreatitis, perforation or hemorrhage., 30 days
Covered self expandable metal stents (CSEMS) are three times larger in diameter than 10 Fr plastic stents. When compared to plastic stents, randomized trials have shown longer patency and fewer stent-related complications for CSEMS. The investigators hypothesize that placement of CSEMS would be a better treatment option for preoperative biliary decompression in patients with pancreatic cancer.
