Doxil & Carboplatin Plus HER2+ in Metastatic Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the ORR associated with Doxil in combination with carboplatin in HER2- (negative) MBC (and with Herceptin in HER2+ MBC).
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: trastuzumab
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Objective response (OR) = CR + PR., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of intolerable toxicity, whichever came first, assessed up to 54 months.
Duration of Response, Duration from date of stating treatment to the date of first CR or PR., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of intolerable toxicity, whichever came first, assessed up to 54 months.|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or date of death, whichever comes first. If a patient neither progresses nor dies, this patient will be censored at last contact date.

Progression is defined as appearance of one or more new lesions. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Although a clear progression of "non-target" lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the Treating Physician should prevail, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel., 30 months|1-year Overall Survival, OS is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death for a dead patient. If a patient is still alive or is lost to follow up, the patient will be censored at the last contact date., 1 year
