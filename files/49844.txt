A Single arm, Multicenter, International Trial of Tisotumab Vedotin (HuMax®-TF-ADC) in Previously Treated, Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer.
Cervical Cancer
DRUG: tisotumab vedotin
Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response (OR) as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), The confirmed OR is defined as best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) based upon RECIST v1.1, assessed by the IRC. The CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. A confirmed CR is 2 CRs (CR-CR sequence) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. The PR is ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesion. A confirmed PR is PR-PR sequence or PR-CR sequence that were separated by at least 4 weeks. The intermediate missing (Not Evaluable \[NE\]) scan evaluations between response scan and confirmation scan were allowed, eg, PR-NE-PR and PR-NE-NE-PR was considered PR confirmed (a repeat scan not earlier than 4 weeks after initial scan documenting response). 95% CI was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method., From Day 1 through IRC verified disease progression, initiation of new anticancer therapy, study withdrawal, or death, whichever occurred first (approximately 20 months)
Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by the IRC, The DOR is defined as the duration from the first documented response of CR or PR (the start date of response, not the date when response was confirmed) to the date of the first documented progression disease (PD) verified by IRC or death. Based upon RECIST v1.1, the CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; the PR is defined as ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesion; and the PD is defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline), unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and/or new lesion. The DOR was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., From Day 1 through IRC verified disease progression, initiation of new anticancer therapy, study withdrawal, or death, whichever occurred first (approximately 49 months)|Percentage of Participants With Confirmed OR as Assessed by the Investigator, The confirmed OR is defined as best overall response of confirmed CR or confirmed PR based upon RECIST v1.1, assessed by the investigator.

The DOR was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., From Day 1 through investigator verified disease progression, initiation of new anticancer therapy, study withdrawal, or death, whichever occurred first (approximately 49 months)|Time to Response (TTR) as Assessed by the IRC, The TTR is defined as the duration from the start of study drug to the first documented response of either CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1, assessed by the IRC. A confirmed CR is defined as 2 CRs (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. A confirmed PR is defined as 2 PRs (≥ 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesion) or an un-confirmed PR and an un-confirmed CR or achieved PR-NE-PR or PR-NE-NE-PR that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between., From Day 1 through IRC verified disease progression, initiation of new anticancer therapy, study withdrawal, or death, whichever occurred first (approximately 49 months)|TTR as Assessed by the Investigator, The TTR is defined as the duration from the start of study drug to the first documented response of either CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1, assessed by the investigator. A confirmed CR is defined as 2 CRs (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. A confirmed PR is defined as 2 PRs (≥ 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesion) or an un-confirmed PR and an un-confirmed CR or achieved PR-NE-PR or PR-NE-NE-PR that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between., From Day 1 through investigator verified disease progression, initiation of new anticancer therapy, study withdrawal, or death, whichever occurred first (approximately 49 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the IRC, The PFS is defined as the time from the start of study drug until the first documentation of PD based on RECIST v1.1, as assessed by the IRC or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

A SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following criteria: fatal or life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect; medically significant (an event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above \[medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is "medically important"\]); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. A TEAE is defined as an AE occurring or worsening between the first dose of tisotumab vedotin and 30 days after the last dose received., From Day 1 through 30 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately 49 months)|Number of Participants With Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Parameters Reported as TEAEs, Laboratory abnormalities that induced clinical signs or symptoms, required concomitant therapy or required changes during treatment emergent period were reported as TEAEs. Number of participants with abnormal clinical laboratory parameters reported as TEAEs are reported., From Day 1 through 30 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately 49 months)|Plasma Concentrations of Tisotumab Vedotin (HuMax-TF), Tisotumab Vedotin Antibody-drug Conjugate (HuMax-TF-ADC), and Free Monomethyl Auristatin E (MMAE), Plasma concentrations of HuMax-TF, HuMax-TF-ADC, and Free MMAE measures on Cycle 1 Day 1 (predose and end of infusion) and Cycle 6 Day 1 (predose and end of infusion) are reported., Predose and end of infusion of Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) and Cycle 6 Day 1 (C6D1)|Number of Participants With Positive Anti-drug Antibodies (ADA) to Tisotumab Vedotin, Number of participants with positive ADA titer to tisotumab vedotin at baseline and post-baseline are reported. Baseline is defined as the latest available measurement made before the first dose of tisotumab vedotin. For post-baseline results, a participant was considered ADA positive if either ADA is negative at baseline and at least one post-baseline result is positive or positive at baseline and at least one positive post-baseline result with a titer higher than baseline., Predose of each treatment cycle (Cycle 1 to 21) and end of treatment visit (approximately 49 months)
The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of tisotumab vedotin in patients with previously treated, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Tisotumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting tissue factor (TF), a protein aberrantly expressed in a wide number of tumors including cervical cancer. Preliminary safety and efficacy data observed in a cohort of previously treated cervical cancer patients suggest a positive benefit risk profile for this population of high unmet need.
