Carnoy's Solution Versus Formalin in Rectal and Gastric Cancer Specimens Following: a Randomized Trial
This study evaluates the number of lymph nodes dissected in specimens following fixation with 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde or Carnoy's solution. Specimens were randomized for fixation in each solution.
Rectal Cancer|Gastric Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: Carnoy's solution|OTHER: 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde
Lymph node yield, Primary outcome will be the total number of lymph nodes dissected in each specimen, 10 days - accessed with the pathological report for each specimen
Dissection duration, Secondary outcome will be measured in minutes, counting from the start to the end of the dissection, 10 days - accessed with the pathological report for each specimen
Carnoy's solution is a tissue fixative that has alcohol allowing for fat clearing along with tissue fixation. Specimens were randomized after the surgical procedure. The perivisceral fat was removed from the stomach and the lymph node stations disected and then fixed in formalin or carnoy's solution for 24-48h. After dissection the residual fat from the formalin group was re-fixed in carnoy and re-disected.
