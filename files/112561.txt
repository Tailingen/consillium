Phase 3 Study of DCC-2618 vs Placebo in Advanced GIST Patients Who Have Been Treated With Prior Anticancer Therapies
This is a 2-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, international, multicenter study comparing the efficacy of ripretinib (DCC-2618) to placebo in patients who have received treatment with prior anticancer therapies. Prior anticancer therapies must include imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib (3 prior therapies). Approximately 120 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to ripretinib 150 mg QD or placebo
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: DCC-2618|DRUG: Placebo Oral Tablet
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the earliest documented evidence of the first disease progression based on the independent radiologic review or death due to any cause on initially assigned study treatment, whichever comes earlier, assessed at 26, 39, and 52 weeks., From date of randomization to the earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause [through database cutoff 31-May-2019 (up to approximately 15 months)].
Objective Response Rate (ORR), The percentage of patients with a confirmed complete response or PR (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions (if present at baseline); all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size) or partial response (PR: \>=30% decrease in the Sum of Diameters of target lesions and non-target lesions non-PD or NE or none at baseline; or target lesions CR and non-target lesions non-CR/Non-PD or NE) based on the independent radiologic review and during the initially assigned study treatment. To be assigned a status of a CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat CT or MRI assessments that must be performed at least 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met., From date of randomization to the earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause [through database cutoff 31-May-2019 (up to approximately 15 months)].|Time to Tumor Progression (TTP) Based on Independent Radiologic Review, TTP is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the earliest documented evidence of disease progression based on the independent radiologic review., From date of randomization to the earliest date of disease progression [through database cutoff 31-May-2019 (up to approximately 15 months)].|Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the interval between the date of randomization until the date of death or the date of last follow-up., From the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause [through database cutoff 31-May-2019 (up to approximately 15 months)].|Quality of Life & Disease-Related Symptoms - European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer 30-Item - Role Functioning, Changes from baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer 30-item - Role Functioning. For the ripretinib arm the minimum and maximum for the outcome were -67 to 67; the placebo arm had a range of -83 to 67. The higher value represents a higher quality of life in disease-related symptoms., From the date of randomization (Baseline) to Cycle 2 Day 1 (Month 2)|Quality of Life & Disease-Related Symptoms - Physical Functioning, Changes from baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer 30-Item - Physical Functioning. For the ripretinib arm, the minimum and maximum for the outcome were -33 to 53; the placebo arm had a range of -47 to 20. The higher value represents a higher quality of life in disease-related symptoms., From the date of randomization (Baseline) to Cycle 2 Day 1 (Month 2)|Quality of Life & Disease-Related Symptoms - EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale, Change from baseline in EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale. For the ripretinib arm the minimum and maximum for the outcome were -43 to 91; the placebo arm had a range of -68 to 23. The higher value represents a higher quality of life in disease-related symptoms., From the date of randomization (Baseline) to Cycle 2 Day 1 (Month 2)
