CTNNA1 Familial Expansion Study
The goal of the CAFÉ Study is to determine the cancer risks associated with germline CTNNA1 loss-of-function variants.

OTHER: Collection of personal and family history from CAFÉ Study participants
Rate of cancer amongst carriers of CTNNA1 loss-of-function variants, After collecting personal and family cancer history from enrolled participants, family pedigrees will be utilized to calculate cancer risk estimates for for CTNNA1 loss-of-function variant carriers including gastric cancer risk, breast cancer risk, as well as risk of other cancers currently not known to be associated with CTNNA1 variants gene., Through study completion, which will average 1 year|Number of CTNNA1 genotypes associated with a cancer phenotype, Using collected family pedigrees from enrolled participants, we will correlate estimated cancer risk for CTNNA1 loss-of-function variant carriers with their CTNNA1 genotype, to determine if there is a significant genotype-phenotype correlation observed., Through study completion, which will average 1 year
The CAFÉ Study aims to determine the degree to which loss-of-function variants in the CTNNA1 gene are associated with hereditary cancers, including gastric cancer, breast cancer, as well as other cancers that may be associated with this gene. By obtaining personal and family history information from individuals who carry a CTNNA1 loss-of-function variant and their family members, this study will aim to better define CTNNA1 associated cancer risks and determine whether there is a genotype/phenotype correlation for CTNNA1 loss-of-function variants. This information will be important for the future cancer risk management of individuals who carry a CTNNA1 loss-of-function variant.
