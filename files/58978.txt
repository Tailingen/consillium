A Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Biomarker-Driven Therapies in Patients With Persistent or Recurrent Rare Epithelial Ovarian Tumors
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple biomarker-selected treatments in patients with persistent or recurrent rare epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal tumors. Enrollment will take place in two phases: a preliminary phase followed by a potential expansion phase.
