HAIC Versus TACE for Large and Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Staged BCLC A/B
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with large and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: Hepatic arterial infusion|PROCEDURE: Transarterial chemoembolization|DRUG: Folfox Protocol|DRUG: TACE Drug Protocol
Disease control rate, Best response based on RECIST, 16 months
Time to progression, 16 months|Adverse Events, Postoperative adverse events were graded based on CTCAE v4.03, 30 Days after HAIC and TACE
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely used palliative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. While a number of studies demonstrate poor effect of TACE for patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma staged BCLC A/B. Our previous prospective study also revealed similar results of large HCC patients treated with TACE. Recently, the results of our preliminary pilot study suggested that, compared with TACE, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve tumor response for HCC with large HCC.

Thus, the investigators carried out this prospective nonrandomized control to demonstrate the superiority of HAIC over TACE.
