Study of HL-085 and Vemurafinib in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)
The study consists of the two parts, phase IIa and phase IIb.
CRC
DRUG: HL-085|DRUG: Vemurafenib
ORR（by investigator）, Phase IIa：ORR per the RECIST version 1.1，defined as the number of patients achieving an overall best response of CR or partial response (PR) divided by the total number of patients, up to 12 months|ORR（by ICR）, Phase Ⅱb：ORR per the RECIST version 1.1，defined as the number of patients achieving an overall best response of CR or partial response (PR) divided by the total number of patients, up to 12 months
PFS（by investigator）, Phase IIa：PFS，defined as the time from first dose to the earliest documented disease progression or death due to any cause, up to 12 months|PFS（by ICR）, Phase IIb：PFS，defined as the time from first dose to the earliest documented disease progression or death due to any cause, up to 12 months|DOR（by investigator）, Phase IIa：DOR，Duration of response is defined as subjects who show a confirmed clinical response (CR) or partial response (PR), the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death, up to 12 months|DOR（by ICR）, Phase IIb：DOR，Duration of response is defined as subjects who show a confirmed clinical response (CR) or partial response (PR), the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until the first documented sign of disease progression or death, up to 12 months|DCR（by investigator）, Phase IIa：Proportion of subjects with response defined as CR, PR, and SD throughout the study from subjects first dose to disease progression or death, up to 12 months|DCR（by ICR）, Phase IIb：Proportion of subjects with response defined as CR, PR, and SD throughout the study from subjects first dose to disease progression or death, up to 12 months|OS, OS is defined as the time from the date of taking drugs to the date of death due to any cause, up to 24 months|Number of Adverse Events, Number of Treatment-Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v5.0 will be counted, up to 12 months
The study consists of the two parts, phase IIa and phase IIb. Phase IIa study is to assess the safety and the antitumor activity in patients with mCRC and to recommend reasonable dosage regimen of HL-085 for phase IIb study. Phase IIb is a pivotal study to evaluate HL-085 plus Vemurafenib in patients with BRAFV600E mCRC whose disease has progressed after 1 or 2 prior regimens in the metastatic setting.
