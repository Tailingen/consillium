SHR-1210 Combined With Apatinib Mesylate in the Perioperative Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab + apatinib mesylate neoadjuvant therapy combined with camrelizumab adjuvant therapy and camrelizumab adjuvant therapy alone in patients with technically resectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab + apatinib mesylate neoadjuvant therapy combined with camrelizumab adjuvant therapy and camrelizumab adjuvant therapy alone in patients with technically resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. There are two groups:

1. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant group: (1) Preoperative：Camrelizumab ：200mg, iv, d1, q2w, 4 cycles；apatinib：250mg, po, qd, q2w, 3 cycles; (2) Operation; (3) Postoperation 4-8 weeks，Camrelizumab ：200mg, iv, d1, q2w, Up to 8 cycles.
2. Adjuvant group: (1) Operation; (2) Postoperation 4-8 weeks，Camrelizumab ：200mg, iv, d1, q2w, Up to 12 cycles.
