QUALIOR Feasibility and Efficacy of a Supervised Home-based Standard Physical Exercise Program
This phase II-III study will be randomized (2:1) patients starting first-line oral targeted therapies (OTT) for metastatic cancer between an individualized supervised physical exercise programs (SPEP) by a personal coach, and recommended physical exercises via a booklet. Eligible patients will have received ≤2 lines of metastatic chemotherapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance status (ECOG PS) ≤2, controlled pain (visual analogue scale (VAS) \<3/10), and life expectancy ≥3 months.
