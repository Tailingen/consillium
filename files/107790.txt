Neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy is the recommended therapeutic approach for patients with localized triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The combination regimen improved the pCR rate of triple negative breast cancer, but its side effects also increased. In the KEYNOTE-522 trial, 78% of patients receiving pembrolizumab combined with anthracycline and paclitaxel chemotherapy experienced grade 3 or higher adverse reactions, while the incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events for patients receiving tislelizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin in the CTRIO study was 53.2%. Toripalimab (an anti PD-1 monoclonal) combined with paclitaxel (albumin binding type) for first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic TNBC was recently approved based on the results from the TORCHLIGHT study. This study aims to investigate efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant toripalimab plus docetaxel and carboplatin in patients with localized TNBC.
