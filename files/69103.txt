A Phase 2 Single-Arm Open-Label Pilot Trial Evaluating Zanidatamab (ZW25) in Patients With Early Stage HER2/Neu Positive (HER2+) Breast Cancer (BC)
This is a Phase 2, single-site, single-arm open-label trial of zanidatamab in patients with early stage, low risk HER2+ BC.

The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of zanidatamab for patients with early stage HER2/neu positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC) as determined by pathologic complete response (pCR) .
Breast Cancer|HER2-positive
DRUG: Zanidatamab|DRUG: Letrozole|DRUG: Tamoxifen
To determine the efficacy of zanidatamab for patients with early stage HER2/neu positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC) as determined by pathologic complete response (pCR, through study completion, an average of 1 year
Primary Objective:

To determine the efficacy of zanidatamab for patients with early stage HER2/neu positive (HER2+) breast cancer (BC) as determined by pathologic complete response (pCR) 1

Secondary Objective(s):

* To determine pathologic response by residual cancer burden (RCB). 1-3
* To evaluate the radiographic response and volumetric change in tumor size by ultrasound and MRI
* To evaluate tolerability and safety of zanidatamab for treatment-na√Øve early stage HER2+ breast cancer (BC).
* To evaluate the rate of adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events with zanidatamab alone (for patients with hormone receptor negative tumors) or with endocrine therapy tamoxifen or letrozole (in hormone receptor positive tumors)
* To evaluate the feasibility of treating patients with early stage HER2+ breast cancer with monotherapy zanidatamab
* To determine tumor-based predictive biomarkers of response

Exploratory Objective(s):

* To assess circulating free DNA levels and dynamics as biomarkers of response
* To assess effect of zanidatamab on immune environment
