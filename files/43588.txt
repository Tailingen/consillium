A Study of Osimertinib With or Without Chemotherapy Versus Chemotherapy Alone as Neoadjuvant Therapy for Patients With EGFRm Positive Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a Phase III, randomised, controlled, 3-arm, multi-centre study of neoadjuvant osimertinib as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, versus SoC chemotherapy alone, for the treatment of patients with resectable EGFRm Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Osimertinib|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Major Pathological Response (MPR), Defined as â‰¤10% residual cancer cells in the main tumour, as assessed per central pathology laboratory post-surgery, From date of randomization to an average of 12 weeks after the first dose
Pathological complete response (pCR), Defined as absence of any viable cancer cells in the dissected tumour samples, including the main tumour, lymph nodes, and margins as assessed per central pathology laboratory post-surgery, From date of randomization to an average of 12 weeks after the first dose|Event-free survival (EFS), An event is defined as documented disease progression that precludes surgery or prevents completion of definitive surgery; recurrence or a new lesion, local or distant (a new primary malignancy, confirmed by pathology if clinically feasible, is not considered to be an EFS event); death due to any cause, From date of randomization up to approximately 5.5 years after the last patient is randomized|Overall Survival (OS), OS will be defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death due to any cause, From date of randomization up to approximately 5.5 years after the last patient is randomized|Disease free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from the date of surgery until the first date of disease recurrence (local or distant) or date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From date of randomization up to approximately 5.5 years after the last patient is randomized|Downstaging, Measured using pathologic mediastinal lymph node evaluation, From date of randomization to an average of 12 weeks after the first dose|Difference between treatment arms in change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Core 30 items), Assess disease-related symptoms, functioning, and global health status/quality-of-life in patients, From date of randomization up to approximately 5.5 years after the last patient is randomized|Concordance of EGFRm status between tumour tissue DNA and patient-matched plasma-derived ctDNA, Baseline|Corcordance of EGFR mutation status between the local and central cobas EGFR mutation test results from baseline tumour samples, Baseline|PK plasma concentrations of osimertinib, From the pre-dose of Cycle 2 to post-dose of Cycle 3 (each cycle is 21 days)|Difference between treatment arms in change from baseline in EORTC QLQ-LC13 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire - Lung Cancer 13 items), Assess lung cancer-associated symptoms and side effects from conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, From date of randomization up to approximately 5.5 years after the last patient is randomized
Cure rate, The cure rate is defined as the percentage of people in this study who are still alive and disease free for a certain period of time after they finished the surgery. Here 5-year landmark cure rate will be calculated in the same time as OS analysis., From the surgery until 5 years after surgery|Number of adverse events as assessed by CTCAE 5.0 and other clinical variables for safety and tolerability profile of neoadjuvant osimertinib as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy prior to surgery compared with chemotherapy alone, Other clinical variables include deaths, laboratory data, vital signs (pulse and BP), ECG, LVEF, ECOG performance status, and ophthalmologic assessment, From the time of enrollment to either 28-days after the last dose of last study treatment for patients who do not undergo surgery, or 90-days post-surgery|MPR using plasma-derived circulating-free tumour DNA (ctDNA), From date of randomization to an average of 12 weeks after the first dose
