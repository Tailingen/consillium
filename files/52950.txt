MRI in Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Prior to Breast Conserving Surgery
To see if performing breast MRI before a lumpectomy will help the surgeon successfully remove the entire cancer with normal tissue margins in a single operation thereby reducing the need for additional surgical procedures. The study will also measure how well MRI can find unsuspected cancers in the same breast as the known cancer; how well MRI will find unsuspected cancers in the opposite breast; how often MRI will generate false positive MRI findings; whether routinely incorporating breast MRI delays care or adds unnecessary cost; and, whether breast MRI is able to reduce the frequency of cancer recurrence in the treated breast or elsewhere in the body.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Breast MRI
To determine whether pre-lumpectomy breast MRI reduces the frequency of repeat lumpectomy in women with DCIS < 5 cm or T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer
To determine how often MRI will detect occult multifocal or multicentric disease|To determine how often MRI will miss occult DCIS or invasive cancer subsequently detected on surgical pathology|To determine the frequency with which breast MRI changes the surgical plan|To determine the frequency of false positive MRI findings requiring biopsy|To measure whether MRI reduces the frequency of repeat lumpectomy to a greater extent in women with mammographically dense vs fatty breasts|To measure whether preoperative MRI is associated with enhanced postoperative cosmesis|To measure whether preoperative MRI alters cost of care|To measure the degree and extent to which preoperative MRI lengthens the time required to deliver care|To measure whether preoperative MRI increases the rate of patient directed ("unnecessary") mastectomy|To measure whether MRI decreases the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence|To measure disease-free survival without/with preoperative breast MRI|To measure overall survival without/with preoperative MRI
