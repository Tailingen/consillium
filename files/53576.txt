Relationship Between Liver Cancer and Sarcopenia
By tracking the short-term and long-term results of patients after hepatectomy, the difference of short-term results between patients with sarcopenia and patients without sarcopenia was analyzed, and the correlation between sarcopenia and short-term and long-term results of patients after hepatectomy was explored, so as to improve people's awareness of sarcopenia and pay attention to its prevention and treatment.
Liver Cancer|Sarcopenia
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: gait speed; ct scan;grip strength and chair stand test
Short-term postoperative results, Postoperative complicationsï¼›90 days readmission rate, 3 months|Long-term results after operation, Overall survival; Disease free survival, 10 years
Postoperative hospitalization time, Time window from the day of operation to the day of discharge., 2 months|Hospitalization expenses, All hospitalization expenses, including drug expenses, operation expenses, anesthesia expenses, nursing expenses and other expenses., 2 months
All implementation details are based on the newest EWGSOP definition. The investigators consecutively admitted patients the questionnaire and evaluated the assessment of muscle strength (grip strength test and chair stand test), muscle quantity (L3 plane total skeletal muscle area) and physical performance (gait test) following the F-A-C-S approach, to confirm patients with sarcopenia accurately. And by tracking the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients after hepatectomy, the differences were analyzed and the relationship between sarcopenia and liver cancer was explored.
