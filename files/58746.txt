Early Reversal of Defunctioning Stoma Trial
In this trial will be investigated if a defunctioning loop stoma used in low anterior resection of the rectum for cancer can be reversed after 14 days instead of 3-12 months which is present clinical practise.
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: Reversal of defunctioning stoma
Reversal of defunctioning loop stoma on postoperative day 14 following low anterior resection of the rectum for cancer with or without preoperative adjuvant treatment, Preoperatively, postoperative day 7, postoperative day 30 and at 6 months postoperatively
Postoperative 30 day morbidity. Postoperative ano-rectal function at 1 and 6 months., Postoperatively at 1 and 6 months.
Patients undergoing low anterior resection of the the rectum for adenocarcinom (total mesorectal excision; TME) with a defunctioning loop stoma are assessed preoperatively and for 6 days postoperatively according to a trial protocol including daily clinical, physiological, and serological variables, and a rectal contrast study on day 6. If inclusion criteria are fulfilled, a decision is taken on day 7 to schedule reversal of the defunctioning loop stoma on postoperative day 14. This trial is considered a hypothesis generating pilot study of feasibility type and is no power calculation. The present trial will include 20 consecutive patients who accept participation.
