Conducting Active Surveillance Without Prostate Biopsy for Patients With Low-risk Suspected Prostate Cancer
The goal of this observational study is to evaluate the role of the USTC diagnostic model in risk-adaptive strategies for biopsy decision-making in patients with low-risk suspected prostate cancer in order to reduce unnecessary biopsy. Based on the USTC diagnostic model (website: https://ustcprostatecancerprediction.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/) and serum PSA levels, patients with low-risk suspected prostate cancer are enrolled and received active surveillance rather than biopsy. The main questions to be answered is:

• The safety and feasibility of conducting biopsy-free active monitoring in patients with low-risk suspected prostate cancer accessed by the USTC diagnostic model and serum PSA levels.

Participants will be required to undergo serum PSA testing every 3 months, mpMRI testing every 6 months, and reassessment of the probability of developing prostate cancer using the USTC model every 3 months. Patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria and are at increased risk will no longer receive active surveillance and will be advised to undergo biopsy. Dynamic changes in PI-RADS score and biopsy results will also be recorded.
Prostate Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: active surveillance
prostate cancer diagnostic free survival time, survival analysis by K-M curves and log-rank tests, through study completion, an average of 2 year
dynamic change of serum total PSA, dynamic change serum PSA level after active surveillance, every 3 months up to 2 years|dynamic change of PI-RADS score, dynamic change PI-RADS score after active surveillance, every 6 months up to 2 years
