Definitive Radiation for High-Risk Spine Metastases
This study is looking at whether patients with cancer that has aggressively spread to the spine can be treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy only and avoid a large spine surgery

RADIATION: SBRT to the spine
Cumulative incidence of spinal surgery/stabilization within 6 months following SBRT, Assess the efficacy of spine SBRT alone in controlling spine metastases, 6 months
Reduction in epidural tumor volume, Percent reduction of epidural volume of the treated metastatic lesions, 3 months|Changes on Neck Disability index, The Neck Disability Index measures neck pain and disabilities in patients with neck pain, with scores varying from 0 to 50. Lower scores indicate better outcomes, higher scores indicate a worse outcome., 1 months, 3 months, 6 months|Changes on Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire, The Oswestry Disability Index measures disability in patients with low back pain, with scores varying from 0 to 50. Lower scores indicate better outcomes, higher scores indicate a worse outcome., 1 months, 3 months, 6 months|Changes on EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire, The EuroQol 5D-5L questionnaire measures quality of life on a 5-component scale including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each health dimension is scored from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating a better health state, and 5 the worse state possible. Respondents also indicate their overall health status on visual analogue score, with values ranging from 0 (worst health imaginable) to 100 (best health imaginable), 1 months, 3 months, 6 months|Progression-free survival, 6 months|Overall survival, 6 months
