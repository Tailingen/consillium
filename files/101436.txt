HCC Staging Modified by Tumor Micronecrosis
Tumor micronecrosis is a pathological feature that reflects malignant biological behavior in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of tumor micronecrosis based on the current BCLC and TNM staging systems, and futher improve the performance of the staging models by establishing modified new staging models including tumor micronecrosis.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BEHAVIORAL: tumor micronecrosis
Overall survival, the number of months from the date of surgery to the date of the last follow-up visit or time of death., from date after liver resection until death or last follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 72 months
Disease-free survival, the number of months from the date of surgery to the date of first confirmable recurrence or death, from date after liver resection until recurrence or last follow-up, whichever came first, assessed up to 72 months
