Comparison of Efficacy in SBRT of HCC ≤5 cm With or Without TACE
The study aims to compare efficacy and adverse reactions of hepatocellular carcinoma participants (≤5cm) who receive stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.The investigators will optimize the combined treatment schedule of SBRT for hepatocellular carcinoma participants by comparing overall survival rates, progression-free survival rates and local control and adverse reaction occurrence rates in the two groups.
Small Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy|Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization
PROCEDURE: transcatheter arterial chemoembolization
Overall survival rates, OS is calculated starting from the date of SBRT to the date of the final follow-up or demise of the patients., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months|Progression-free survival rates, PFS is estimated starting from the date of SBRT to the date of disease progression or patient death., From date of randomization until the date of disease progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months|Local control rates, LC is defined starting from the date of SBRT to the date of treated-lesion progression or patient death., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 36 months
Radiation-induced liver injury rates, From the date of radiotherapy completion until the 4 months after therapy,up to 6 months.|Adverse reaction, From the date of radiotherapy completion until the 4 months after therapy,up to 6 months.
