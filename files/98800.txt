Study Maintenance Regorafenib vs Placebo, no Progression Patients After I Line Chemotherapy Metastatic Gastric Cancer
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase-II study.

Approximately 120 subjects with CR/PR/SD after platinum compounds and fluoropyrimidines based regimens: up to 6 cycles of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine, up to 12 cycles of FOLFOX, up to 8 cycles of XELOX, will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to one of the following treatment groups:

Arm A: Placebo 4 tablets once daily on day 1-21, every 4 weeks, until intolerance or progression disease Arm B: Regorafenib 160 mg, 4 tablets once daily on days 1-21, every 4 weeks, until intolerance or progression disease Primary Variable: PFS1
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Regorafenib|OTHER: placebo
PFS1, Progression free survival will be calculated for all patients from the date of randomization until the date PD or death is first reported., 36 months
OS, time from date of randomization to the date of Death from any cause, 36 months|PFS2, PFS 2 will be calculated from the start of second line therapy to PD or death, 36 months|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability, The overall incidences of AEs will be summarized. Patients who experienced the same event on more than one occasion are counted only once in the calculation of the event frequency, at the highest intensity ever observed., 36 months|Response Rate, in patients who are randomized at enrollment to treatment with regorafenib vs placebo,, 36 months|quality of life To compare the patient treatment-related symptoms, To compare the patient treatment-related symptoms as measured by the European Organization for research and treatment of cancer EORTC QLQ-C30, (days 1, week , 8, 16, 24, 32) , for patients in each treatment arm., up to 8 months|biomarker evaluation, To correlate the genetic mutational profile of the tumors with the RR and the OS of the patients, 36 months
