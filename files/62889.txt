A Phase II Study of Increased-Dose Abiraterone Acetate in Patients With Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad,an increased dose of Abiraterone Acetate in combination with prednisone has on patients and their prostate cancer. This study will investigate whether an increased-dose (2,000mg daily) is safe and potentially effective when given to patients whose cancer has grown while taking the standard dose.
Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Abiraterone Acetate|DRUG: Prednisone
Number of Patients With PSA Response From Dose Escalation, A PSA response for the dose escalation group is defined as a participant with a documented PSA decline after 12 weeks of therapy with standard-dose, then had disease progression, and then achieved a â‰¥30% PSA decline after 12 weeks from the start of dose escalation therapy., Up to 12 weeks from start of dose escalation
Number of Participants With Worst-grade, Treatment-related Toxicities for Dose Escalation Group, Frequency of any treatment-related toxicity with increased-dose Abiraterone Acetate by maximum observed grade will be tabulated for the study cohort. Toxicities will be graded for management according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 as a measure of patient safety., Up to 24 months|Time to PSA Progression for Dose Escalation Cohort, Time to PSA progression as defined by RECIST criteria or by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG) criteria for patients whom were treated with increased dose Abiraterone Acetate., up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival for Dose Escalation Cohort, Progression free survival for patients treated with increased dose Abiraterone Acetate, up to 24 months|Serum Concentration Levels of Abiraterone Acetate Over Time, Pharmacokinetic assessment at the initiation of standard dose therapy, at the time of initial disease progression, at the time of a response to increased dose of abiraterone acetate and at the time of disease progression on increased-dose therapy., Up to 24 months|Correlation of Circulating Testosterone Levels at Baseline and Week 12, Pearson's correlation coefficients ("r") will be calculated to summarize the relationship between testosterone values at baseline and at 12 weeks. Testosterone labs will be obtained at an earlier time point if the patient comes off study for disease progression before week 12. Coefficients are on a continuous scale ranging from -1 to +1 with a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative linear association of testosterone levels between the 2 time points, a value of 0 indicating no association between testosterone levels between the two time points, and a value of +1 indicating a positive linear association of testosterone levels between the two time points., Baseline and Week 12|Comparison of Circulating Testosterone Levels Between Primary-Resistant Patients and Responders, The distribution of the baseline testosterone levels and the change in hormone level at 12 weeks will be compared between patients experiencing a PSA decline \>30% (responders) and patients without such a PSA decline (primary-resistant) using a two group t statistic. Measurements will be obtained at an earlier time point if the patient comes off study for disease progression before week 12., Baseline and Week 12|Correlation of Circulating Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) Levels From Baseline to Week 12, Pearson's correlation coefficients ("r") will be calculated to summarize the relationship between DHEA values at baseline and at 12 weeks. DHEA labs will be obtained at an earlier time point if the patient comes off study for disease progression before week 12. Coefficients are on a continuous scale ranging from -1 to +1 with a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative linear association of DHEA levels between the 2 time points, a value of 0 indicating no association between DHEA levels between the two time points, and a value of +1 indicating a positive linear association of DHEA levels between the two time points., Baseline and Week 12|Comparison of Circulating DHEA Levels Between Primary-Resistant and Responders, The distribution of the baseline DHEA levels and the change in hormone level at 12 weeks will be compared between patients experiencing a PSA decline \>30% (responders) and patients without such a PSA decline (primary-resistant) using a two group t statistic.

DHEA-S labs will be obtained at an earlier time point if the patient comes off study for disease progression before week 12. Coefficients are on a continuous scale ranging from -1 to +1 with a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative linear association of DHEA-S levels between the 2 time points, a value of 0 indicating no association between DHEA-S levels between the two time points, and a value of +1 indicating a positive linear association of DHEA-S levels between the two time points., Baseline and Week 12|Comparison of Circulating DHEA-S Levels Between Primary-Resistant Patients and Responders, The distribution of the baseline DHEA-S levels and the change in hormone level at 12 weeks will be compared between patients experiencing a PSA decline \>30% (responders) and patients without such a PSA decline (primary-resistant) using a two group t statistic.

This is a phase II multicenter trial of Abiraterone Acetate (AA) in patients with progressive prostate cancer despite androgen deprivation with a particular focus on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacogenomic events occurring at the time of apparent drug resistance. All eligible patients will have baseline (prior to taking the first dose of Abiraterone Acetate 1000mg/daily) measures of routine clinical variables along with measurements of baseline and treatment related changes in testosterone, androgen, and endocrine levels, genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the selected enzymes known to be directly inhibited by Abiraterone Acetate, and collection of circulating tumor cells. All patients will be requested to consent for biopsies which will be performed prior to treatment and at the time of disease progression on standard dose Abiraterone Acetate therapy. These biopsies will be analyzed for expression of an androgen receptor (AR)-signature as well as for microarray analysis to explore changes in methylation, and expression of CYP17A1 and other androgen synthesis genes.

Subjects will then begin daily oral therapy with Abiraterone Acetate 1000mg po daily with physiologic prednisone 5mg BID replacement. No food should be consumed for at least 2 hours before the dose of Abiraterone Acetate and for at least 1 hour after the dose of Abiraterone Acetate is taken. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) will be followed monthly. Abiraterone Acetate will be supplied by Janssen Services. At the end of the first month, the third month, and then every three months thereafter, Abiraterone Acetate, testosterone, and androgen levels will be followed. Subjects not achieving a greater than or equal to 30% PSA decline at 12 weeks will be taken off study. At the time of progression (defined by RECIST criteria OR by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG) criteria as a 25% increase in PSA above the nadir and an increase in the absolute value PSA of at least 2ng/dl or back to baseline confirmed at least 2 weeks afterward) for subjects who achieved an initial greater than or equal to 30% PSA decline (referred to as Progressive Disease (PD) #1), subjects will begin taking Abiraterone Acetate 1000 mg po BID. Patients will continue to take prednisone 5mg twice a day (BID) and will continue this therapy until a second progression at which point they will be withdrawn from the study. While 1000 mg po BID is not the FDA recommended dose, it is the dose to be investigated in this study.
