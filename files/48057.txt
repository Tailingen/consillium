The Treatment of Bioartificial Liver With hiHep Cells After Extensive Hepatectomy
It is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm cohort study. A total of 10 patients will be included in this study. Based on standardized treatment, the treatment of bioartificial liver device will be applied 48-72 hours after extensive hepatectomy. In order to evaluate the security and effectiveness of the device, liver function, liver volume, the incidence of liver failure and other results will be analyzed.
Hepatoma Resectable
BIOLOGICAL: hiHep bioartificial liver therapy
The incidence of adverse events (safety and tolerability)., Record adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and AEs (TEAE) that occurred during treatment., 3 months after therapy
Patient's recovery of liver function, Through child-pugh liver function grading standard and changes in ALT, AST, AKP, r-GGT, TBil, DBil, ALB to evaluate liver function., 1day,3day,7day,1month,3 months after therapy|Rate of liver proliferation, Remaining liver growth rate (calculation of residual liver volume based on CT three-dimensional reconstruction)., 7day,1month,3 months after therapy|Incidence of liver failure, Use Guidelines for The Diagnosis and Treatment of Liver Failure (exclude liver failure caused by surgical hemodynamic problems)., 1day,3day,7day,1month,3 months after therapy|Complication rate, Such as pleural effusion, hydrops abdominis, hemorrhage, bile leakage., 1day,3day,7day,1month,3 months after therapy|Immunoinflammatory index, Changes in PCT, hCRP, immune globulin (IgA, IgM, IgG), complement (C3, C4) after the treatment., 1day,3day,7day,1month,3 months after therapy|Renal function, Record the changes in creatinine and urea nitrogen, calculate GFR through MDRD or CKD-EPI formula to evaluate renal function by classification standards for renal insufficiency., 1day,3day,7day,1month,3 months after therapy|Electrolyte level, Changes in the concentration of Na+, K+, Cl+, Ca+ in blood before and after treatment., 1day,3day,7day,1month,3 months after therapy
Include large-scale hepatectomy patients who meet the Inclusion criteria into the experimental group. Patient will be sent to ICU monitoring after surgery , the investigators will evaluate the blood routine, liver and kidney function, blood coagulation function, and immune inflammation indicators on the first day after surgery, and large veins will be temporarily indwelled within 48-72 hours Hemodialysis tube, then take artificial liver treatment which lasts 4-6h, follow-up test results on the 1st day, 3rd day, 7th day, 1 month and 3 months about blood routine, liver and kidney function, coagulation function, blood ammonia, Immune inflammation indicators, imaging examinations (CT or MR) at 7 days, 1 month and 3 months after treatment, to evaluate the recovery of liver function and liver regeneration after artificial liver treatment.
