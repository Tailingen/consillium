Acute Effect of Chromatic Environment During Chemotherapy
The primary objective is to examine the acute effect of color, room orientation (affecting amount of luminosity) on perceived health status and stress levels in oncologic patients during chemotherapy sessions at outpatient clinic. The secondary objectives will be to study the effect on vital signs (body temperature, heart rate, systolic blood pressure). Patients will be allocated into four conditions (Group A: Cold North, Group B: Cold South C: Warm North D: Warm South) for each session. For the next session, patients will be assigned a new condition. Assignment of sequences will be randomized for each patient.

20 patients will be randomly assigned to one of the four groups, after having signed the Free and Informed Consent Form and agreed to participate in the project, will respond to the evaluation form and will be submitted to physical examination. Patients will be treated per standard of care.

EUROQOL-5D-5L questionnaire: Mobility, The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement using a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension., 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after chemotherapy session|EUROQOL-5D-5L questionnaire: Self-care, The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement using a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension., 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after chemotherapy session|EUROQOL-5D-5L questionnaire: Usual activities, The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement using a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension., 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after chemotherapy session|EUROQOL-5D-5L questionnaire: Pain/Discomfort, The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement using a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension., 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after chemotherapy session|EUROQOL-5D-5L questionnaire: Anxiety/Depression, The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement using a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension., 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after chemotherapy session|EUROQOL-5D-5L questionnaire: EQ-VAS, The EQ VAS is an independent subscale of the EUROQOL-5D-5L questionnaire, which uses a vertical visual analogue scale format. The EQ VAS is used for recording the self-rated health on a range from 0 to 100, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' (100) and 'The worst health you can imagine' (0). The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement, 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after chemotherapy session
ID-Pain questionnaire, Assessment of neuropathic pain, 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after chemotherapy session|Vital signs: body temperature, Per standard of care, in Celsius, 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after chemotherapy session|Vital signs: blood pressure, Per standard of care, in mm Hg, 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after chemotherapy session|Vital signs: heart rate, Per standard of care, in beats per minute, 5 minutes before to 5 minutes after chemotherapy session
