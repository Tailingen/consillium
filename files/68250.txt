Long-term Evaluation of the Quality of Life of Former Patients Treated With Orthopedic Surgery, With or Without Radiotherapy
Surgery and radiation therapy play a major role in the treatment of bone and soft tissue tumors. Osteosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and Ewing tumors are the most common histologic types. Surgery may require multiple techniques and radiation therapy may be conformational, or more recently IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy). If surgery is possible, lower limb surgery is generally the recommended treatment, even if a poor functional result can be expected.

The literature is very poor regarding the impact of radiotherapy on quality of life and functional results, mainly with the use of prosthetic materials.

Tools such as the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) are now available for self-assessment of functional outcomes. The presence of large cohorts such as FCCSS, COHOPER and SALTO facilitates these studies.

The SF-36 is a short 36-question health questionnaire that consists of a generic, consistent, and easy-to-administer set of measures. These measures are based on self-report by patients and are now widely used by organizations managing the care of adult patients.

The TESS Functional Questionnaire is a patient-completed self-questionnaire widely used for motor stimulation in patients with musculoskeletal tumors. This score is based on the definitions of handicap, impairment and handicap as documented by the World Health Organization (WHO). It includes 30 questions assessing overall function and daily activities. The final score varies from 0% to 100%, 100% being the best possible score. So far, several studies have reported the validation of TESS in Portuguese, Danish, Korean, Japanese and since this year in French. Indeed, the TESS questionnaire was validated in French by the study "Transcultural validation of TESS and MSTS questionnaires" promoted by the Nantes University Hospital.
