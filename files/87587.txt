Neoadjuvant Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) in Cutaneous Stage L-lll Melanoma
Randomized trial to determine if neo-adjuvant subcutaneous GM-CSF restores the host regional lymph node immunity

Th1/Th2 Normalized Gene Expression, The Th1/Th2/Th3 Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) arrays will be used to quantify RNA expression of Th1 and Th2 messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs). Normalized gene expression was calculated from qRT-PCR results comparing GM-CSF and control subjects for both Th1-associated gene T-bet and Th2-associated gene GATA3 respectively. Fold change values are calculated by taking the normalized gene expression in GM-CSF treated group samples divided by the normalized gene expression in the control group samples., 14 days post treatment
The sentinel lymph nodes in patients with melanoma are immunosuppressed and the investigators have shown this occurs early in the disease process. This regional nodal immunosuppression precedes nodal metastasis and may be required for nodal spread. Administration of GM-CSF has been used to alter the immune response to metastatic melanoma. The investigators propose to assess whether administration of a short course of GM-CSF preoperatively to patients about to undergo wide local excisions and sentinel lymph node dissection can alter the immune environment of the sentinel lymph node and restore an immune surveillance profile in the sentinel lymph node.
