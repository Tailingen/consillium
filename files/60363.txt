5-azacytidine Treatment Versus 5-azacytidine Followed by Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation in Elderly Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
5-azacytidine treatment prolongs survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but does not cure the disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment option but is associated with a high risk treatment-related morbidity and mortality. In the current trial allogeneic stem cell transplantation will be compared to 5-azacytidine only treatment according to donor availability in elderly patients with MDS (55-70 years).
Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia
PROCEDURE: allogeneic stem cell transplantation|PROCEDURE: 5-azacytidine until progress
overall survival, compare to overall survival of patients who receive after 4 cycles of 5-azacytidine either allogeneic stem cell transplantation or continuous 5-azacytidine if no compatible donor is available overall 230 patients, three years
response, Comparison of response according to International Working Group Response Criteria between both arms:

- Examinations of bone marrow (count of blasts) and peripheral blood (hematological improvement)after schedule of study assessments (after cycle 4 in both arms, after cycle 8 and after months 12-24-36 in the 5-azacytidine treatment and on day 100, day 180, months 12-24-36 after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, three years|event-free survival, comparison of event free survival in both arms (230 pat.):

- evaluation of survival status (relapse, date of relapse, alive or death) in the whole study period, three years|overall survival, Comparison of overall survival between both arms (230 pat.).

- evaluation of survival status (alive or death/date of death) in the whole study period, three years|impact of Comorbidity-index on outcome, impact of comorbidity-index on outcome after study entry and prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (according definitions and weighted scores of comorbidities by Sorror et al):

* physical examination
* laboratory values(creatinine,Alt, AST, bilirubin, etc.)
* apparative diagnostics (echo,lufu,ECG), three years|Treatment-related mortality, compare treatment related mortality in both arms (230 pat.):

- death according to treatment in both arms, three years|Evaluation of toxicity, the evaluation of toxicity will be performed according to the reporting guidelines as per NCI CTCAE in the whole study period:

* adverse events grade 3 and 4
* cytopenia grade 3 and 4 only be reported as AE which are judged by the investigator as clinically relevant, three years|quality of life, Comparison of quality of life between both arms with the quality of life core questionnaire QLQ-C30 and the treatment specific high-dose chemotherapy module QLQ HD-C29 to assess the quality of life of cancer patient. The questionnaire has to be answered after the fourth cycle, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years after both treatment arms, three years
5-azacytidine treatment prolongs survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but does not cure the disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a curative treatment option but is associated with a high risk treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Dose-reduced conditioning prior transplantation allows also treatment of elderly patients with MDS. In the current trial allogeneic stem cell transplantation will be compared to 5-azacytidine only treatment according to donor availability in elderly patients with MDS (55-70 years).
