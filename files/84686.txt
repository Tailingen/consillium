Adjuvant Pyrotinib and Capecitabine For HER2 Positive Micro Invasive Breast Cancer
For patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer, NCCN guidelines recommend chemotherapy plus targeted therapy as the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with tumors larger than 1 cm or lymph node-positive. The APT study enrolled patients with stage I HER2-positive breast cancer and has confirmed the efficacy and safety of intravenous chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy, but only 2.2% of the patients enrolled in microinvasion are enrolled, and there is a lack of large sample size data to provide a treatment reference for these patients. In order to further explore the optimal strategy for adjuvant therapy in this type of patient, we designed a new clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral capecitabine plus pyrotinib as adjuvant therapy in previous retrospective studies.
