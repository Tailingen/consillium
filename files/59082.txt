Clinical Study of PM01183 in Patients With Acute Leukemia or Relapsed/Refractory Myelodysplastic Syndrome
Phase I Study of PM01183 in Patients with Advanced Acute Leukemia to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) of PM01183.
Acute Leukemia
DRUG: PM01183 1 mg Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion and PM01183 4 mg Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Dose (RD) of PM01183 in patients with advanced acute leukemia., The recommended dose (RD) will be the immediate lower DL below the MTD (maximum tolerated dose)with less than 1/3 of the first 6 evaluable patients experiencing DLT (dose limiting toxicity)during the induction, provided the RD is â‰¥ dose level 2. If the RD is determined at dose level 1, no further expansion will be done, and the study will be terminated., Up to 30 months
Antileukemic activity, Activity will be defined according to the International Working Group (IWG) criteria., After induction/reinduction and every 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation; up to 30 months|Pharmacogenomic (PGx) profile of PM01183 in patients with advanced acute leukemia., Identification of potential biomarkers of response to PM01183, Between day -24 to day 1|Pharmacokinetics (PK) of PM01183 in patients with advanced acute leukemia, The PK will be elucidated using standard non-compartmental methods. The following parameters will be calculated: maximum drug concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC), volume of distribution based on the terminal half-life (Vz), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), clearance (CL) and half-life (t1/2), Days 1 to 8 of induction and day 1 of next phase
Open-Label, Dose-Escalating, Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Phase I Study of PM01183 in Patients with Advanced Acute Leukemia to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD) of PM01183 administered as 1-hour intravenous (i.v.) infusion on three consecutive days (Days 1-3) to patients with advanced acute leukemia and to assess the safety profile and tolerability, to obtain preliminary information on the efficacy and to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenomic (PGx) profile of PM01183.
