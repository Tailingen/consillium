CpG 7909/Montanide ISA 720 With or Without Cyclophosphamide in Combination Either With NY-ESO-1-derived Peptides or the NY-ESO-1 Protein for NY-ESO-1-expressing Tumors
Subjects will receive immunizations every other week for 8 immunizations prior to clinical and immunological evaluations. Patients will then receive immunizations every month up to one year. Cyclophosphamide will be administered intravenously 3 days prior to the first immunization, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and subsequent monthly immunizations. Women and men \>= 18 years of age with refractory metastatic malignancies that express NY-ESO-1 by RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry. Alternatively, patients may be elected on the basis of serum anti-NY-ESO-!-antibodies as detected by ELISA.

Primary Objective: To evaluate the toxicity profile of the regimens described in Section 1.6.

Secondary Objective: To detect and quantitate immune responses induced by the proposed peptide vaccine or protein vaccine in association with CpG 7909 and cyclophosphamide. This endpoint will be assessed by an IFN-y ELISPOT assay of NY-ESO-1-specific tumor-reactive CD8 + T cells. We also will look for NY-ESO-1 tetramer CD8+ T cells, Delayed-type Hypersensitivity (DTH), and NY-ESO-1-specific CD4+ T cell responses with ELISPOT assays and cytokine-release-assays.

Tertiary Objectives: To evaluate tumor response in terms of clinical tumor regression and progression-free interval. To evaluate the survival of patients treated with the regimens described in Section 1.6.

The first 3 patients will be assigned treatment A. All three patients will be treated and observed for one month. If no DLTs are observed in the first 3 patients, accrual to arm A will be put on hold and accrual will continue with Arm B. However, if 1 DLT is observed in Arm A, up to 3 additional patients will be treated on Arm A, until either 2 DLTs have been observed, or 6 patients have been treated with just 1 DLT among them. If 2 DLTs are observed in Arm A, the study will terminate and all treatments will be deemed intolerable. The same principles apply to the cohorts treated on B-E: if the number of DLTs (after one month of treatment) is zero, accrual proceeds to the next treatment group; if it is 1, accrual continues with the same treatment for up to 3 additional patients; if it is 2, no patients will be treated on the remaining treatment arms.
