Phase I/Ib Study of GWN323 Alone and in Combination With PDR001 in Patients With Advanced Malignancies and Lymphomas
The purpose of this trial is to explore the clinical utility of two investigational antibodies in patients with advanced cancer or lymphomas.

This is a multi-center, open-label Phase I/Ib study. The study consists of two dose escalation parts and two dose expansion parts testing GWN323 as a single agent or GWN323 in combination with PDR001. The dose escalation parts will estimate the MTD and/or RDE and test different dosing schedules.

The dose expansion parts of the study will use the MTD/RDE determined in the dose escalation part to assess the activity, safety and tolerability of the investigational products in patients with specific types of cancer and lymphomas.

Approximately 264 adult patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas will be enrolled.
