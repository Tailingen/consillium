Impact of Microparticles on Postoperative Complications in Surgical Patients
Microparticles are cellular fragments which are released actively or passively under conditions of inflammation and stress. The impact of surgical operations on quantity and quality of microparticles remains unknown. In this observatory study we investigate quantitative and qualitative aspects of microparticles during cardiac and abdominal operations.
