Gabapentin in Reducing the Need for Pain Medication in Patients With Bladder Cancer Undergoing Radical Cystectomy
This randomized phase II/III trial studies gabapentin in reducing the need for pain medication in patients with bladder cancer undergoing surgery to remove the bladder and nearby tissue and organs. Gabapentin may reduce the amount of pain medicine required after surgery, improve pain after surgery, and/or reduce the length of hospital stay after surgery.
Bladder Carcinoma
DRUG: Gabapentin|OTHER: Placebo|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Patient Total Equivalent Analgesic Requirement (Morphine Equivalents), Geometric Mean and Standard Deviation of patient total equivalent analgesic, 48 hours post-radical cystectomy
Length of Stay Following Radical Cystectomy, The two study groups will be compared by Length of stay following radical cystectomy, duration of hospital stay. Days to weeks|Patient Self-assessed Pain on Numerical Pain Scale, The two study groups compared on Patient self-assessed pain on numerical pain likert scale. Numeric Pain Scale was utilized with values of 0-10 with increasing severity., Up to 48 hours post-radical cystectomy
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess if perioperative gabapentin will decrease post-operative analgesic requirements within the first 48 hours after radical cystectomy (RC) in patients undergoing RC as measured morphine equivalents.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess patient self-assessment of postoperative pain on Numeric Pain Scale (NPS) at 24 and 48 hours.

II. To assess time to return of bowel function (ROBF).

III. To assess length of stay (LOS) following RC.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

ARM I: Patients receive gabapentin orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) for 48 hours after surgery.

ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO TID for 48 hours after surgery.
