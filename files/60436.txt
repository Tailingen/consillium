RCT of Screening Strategies Among Patients at High Risk for Developing HCC in a Safety-net Health System
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 9th leading cause of cancer-related death in the US and one of the leading causes of death in patients with cirrhosis. Fewer than 1 in 5 high-risk patients undergo HCC screening, with lower rates in non-Caucasian and low socioeconomic status patients receiving care through safety-net health systems. Screening and follow-up failures lead to more advanced cancers, when curative therapies are not available and survival is significantly worse. Over 60% of HCC are diagnosed at advanced stages, due to poor recognition of high-risk patients, underuse of screening among these patients, and poor follow-up of abnormal screening tests. To address these barriers, the investigators propose to conduct a comparative effectiveness research randomized controlled trial of three screening strategies among a socioeconomically disadvantaged and racially diverse cohort of cirrhotic patients at high risk for developing HCC.

Overall, 1800 patients attending Parkland, the Dallas safety-net health system, will be randomized to:

* Group 1: Usual care, with visit-based HCC screening per discretion of individual providers
* Group 2: Mailed HCC screening invitation outreach to eligible patients (low resource intensity)
* Group 3: Mailed HCC screening invitation outreach to eligible patients combined with centralized patient navigation to promote screening completion and follow-up (high resource intensity)

Through three specific aims, this effectiveness research randomized controlled trial will:

* Aim 1: Engage stakeholders in design and implementation of HCC screening outreach interventions.
* Aim 2: Compare the clinical effectiveness and patient acceptability of the intervention strategies to increase completion of one-time and repeat HCC screening.
* Aim 3: Evaluate whether intervention effects are moderated by patient sex, race, ethnicity, English proficiency, and connectedness to primary care.

The screening intervention strategies combine EMR-enabled case identification, system-level screening outreach, and patient navigation to improve identification of previously unrecognized cirrhotic patients, promote HCC screening completion, and facilitate follow-up of abnormal screening tests. This study will engage stakeholders throughout the research process, evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of HCC screening strategies, and determine which patient subgroups benefit the most.
