Whole-Neck Computed Tomography Perfusion Scan in Imaging Patients With Head and Neck Tumors
This pilot clinical trial studies how well whole-neck computed tomography perfusion scans work in imaging patients with head and neck tumors. Diagnostic imaging procedures, such as whole-neck computed tomography perfusions scans, may provide more information about the blood supply to head and neck tumors which may help doctors plan better treatment.

Number and site of each suspicious lymph node assessed by WNCTP, Will be compared to traditional neck CTP. Within each patient, the number and sites of each suspicious lymph node will be recorded for the whole-neck imaging area. A 95% confidence interval for the proportion of patients whose status (lymph node negative \[LN-\] versus lymph node positive \[LN+\]) was changed based on the WNCTP image compared to standard of care will be constructed., Day 1
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the difference in whole-neck computed tomography perfusion (WNCTP) parameters (blood volume \[BV\], blood flow \[BF\], capillary permeability \[CP\] and mean transit time \[MTT\]) between head and neck tumor masses (benign or malignant) and adjacent normal skeletal muscle within the same patient.

II. To assess whether the difference in WNCTP parameters between tumor masses and adjacent normal skeletal muscle is different between patients with benign tumor versus (vs.) malignant tumor.

III. To assess the correlation in WNCTP parameters between tumor masses and adjacent normal skeletal muscle.

IV. Determine if more suspicious cervical lymph nodes will be seen using the whole-neck coverage employed in WNCTP compared to the limited coverage of traditional neck CTP.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo WNCTP scan over 2-3 minutes during standard of care computed tomography (CT).

After completion of study, patients are followed up within 2 days.
