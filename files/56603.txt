The Lyon Real World Evidence in Metastatic NeuroEndocrine Tumours
Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare and include a heterogeneous group of neoplasms derived from the endocrine system found in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and lung. Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs represent the majority of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) and the annual incidence of all GEP-NETs has been estimated to 6.98 per 100,000 person-years in 2012 and is steadily rising. While data on the incidence of metastatic GEP-NET is limited, more than 50% of patients with GEP-NET have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Incorrect and delayed diagnoses are still common. Treatment options include surgery, locoregional interventions, and systemic treatment.

The Lyon Real world Evidence in Metastatic NeuroEndocrine Tumours study (LyREMeNET) is a descriptive observational cohort study. The main objective is to assess the healthcare resources use and the corresponding costs for management of patients with metastatic GEP and lung NETs. The secondary objective is to describe the clinical characteristics, prognostic factors, treatment patterns, and the overall survival among patients with metastatic GEP and lung NETs.

Cost in euros per year of healthcare resources related to the management of metastatic NETs patients., The cost will be calculated, per year, from the date of metastatic diagnosis of NETs to the date of death or last follow-up (study end in September 2018)
