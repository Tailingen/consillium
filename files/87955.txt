A Study of BBI608 in Combination With Standard Chemotherapies in Adult Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Cancer
This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 dose escalation study of BBI608 administered in combination with either FOLFOX6 with and without bevacizumab, or CAPOX, or FOLFIRI with and without bevacizumab, or regorafenib, or irinotecan.
Advanced Gastrointestinal Cancer
DRUG: BBI608|DRUG: Fluorouracil|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Regorafenib
Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Assessment of safety of napabucasin administered in combination with either FOLFOX6 with and without bevacizumab, or CAPOX, or FOLFIRI with and without bevacizumab, or regorafenib, or irinotecan in participants with advanced gastrointestinal malignancies by reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events, The time from the date of first treatment, while the patient is taking napabucasin, and for 30 days after stopping therapy, an average of 4 months.|The Objective Response Rate of Napabucasin Administered in Combination in FOLFIRI in Patients With FOLFIRI/XELIRI-refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, Assessment of the objective response rate (ORR) of napabucasin administered in combination with FOLFIRI in patients with FOLFIRI/XELIRI-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the proportion of participants with a complete response or partial response who have measurable disease at baseline imaging., From the date of first treatment, every 8 weeks, until the date of first documented objective disease progression, up to 24 months
Determination of the Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) and Area Under the Plasma Concentration vs. Time Curve (AUClast), To determine the maximum concentration of napabucasin and the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve of napabucasin when administered in combination with either FOLFOX6 with and without bevacizumab, or CAPOX, or FOLFIRI with and without bevacizumab, or regorafenib., Blood samples drawn on days 1, 2, 15, 16, 21, and 22 of the first study cycle|Pharmacodynamics, To determine the response (increase or decrease) of biomarkers from biopsied tumors following the administration of napabucasin, Day 1 of cycle 2|Disease Control Rate, To determine the anti-tumor activity (specifically the disease control rate) of napabucasin administered in combination with either FOLFOX6 with and without bevacizumab, or CAPOX, or FOLFIRI with and without bevacizumab, or regorafenib, or irinotecan. Percentage of participants with a documented complete response, partial response and stable disease based on RECIST 1.1., From the date of first treatment, every 8 weeks, until the date of first documented objective disease progression, up to 24 months.|Disease Control Rate of Patients With FOLFIRI/XELIRI-refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, To determine the disease control rate of napabucasin administered in combination with FOLFIRI in patients with FOLFIRI/XELIRI-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Percentage of participants with a documented complete response, partial response and stable disease based on RECIST 1.1., From the date of first treatment, every 8 weeks, until the date of first documented objective disease progression, up to 24 months|Progression Free Survival of Patients With FOLFIRI/XELIRI-refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, The effect of napabucasin given in combination with FOLFIRI on Progression Free Survival (PFS) of patients with FOLFIRI/XELIRI-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. PFS of patients with FOLFIRI/XELIRI-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer., The time from the date of first treatment to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, up to thirty six months|Overall Survival of Patients With FOLFIRI/XELIRI-refractory Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, The effect of napabucasin given in combination with FOLFIRI on Overall Survival (OS) of patients with FOLFIRI/XELIRI-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer., 4 weeks after the patient has been off study treatment, every 3 months thereafter until death, the study closes, up to 36 months.
This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 dose escalation study of BBI608 administered in combination with either FOLFOX6 with and without bevacizumab, or CAPOX, or FOLFIRI with and without bevacizumab, or regorafenib, or irinotecan. A study cycle will consist of daily and continuous oral administration of BBI608 for four weeks (28 days) in combination with FOLFOX6 with and without bevacizumab, or CAPOX, or FOLFIRI with and without bevacizumab, or regorafenib, or irinotecan.
