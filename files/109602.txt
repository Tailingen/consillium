Positron Emission Tomography in Monitoring Treatment Response in Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer
This study will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of FLT-PET/CT in primary breast cancer detection and in the use of FLT-PET in monitoring how well a breast tumor respond to treatment. We will compare this technique with other imaging modalities as well as with tissue collection (during a biopsy). We will recruit women with a newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer, who are able to tolerate undergoing a PET/CT (possibly two scans) scan,
Adult Women With a New Diagnosis of Invasive Breast Cancer (Have Not Undergone Treatment)
OTHER: 3'-deoxy-3'-[18F]fluorothymidine|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography/computed tomography|RADIATION: FLT-PET/CT
Sensitivity and specificity of FLT-PET comparing with standard FDG-PET|Correlate SUV with % Ki67 nuclear stain
Change in SUV with change in tumor proliferation index (%Ki67 nuclear stain) (when neoadjuvant therapy is used)|Tumor volume pre and post chemotherapy as assessed by clinical exam, breast imaging studies, histopathological examination, and breast cancer outcome parameters (when neoadjuvant therapy is used)
Our overall goal is to use this clinical trial as a platform to validate fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as a biomarker for the tumor microenvironment and to explore the dynamic interaction between proliferating tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our long term goal is to develop new drugs that will target the tumor microenvironment as novel therapeutic and chemoprevention strategies.
