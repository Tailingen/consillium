Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis(RA) is a disorder with altered immunologic function and increased risk of developing malignancies, while studies examining the association between hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and RA remain lacking. The investigators aimed to investigate the risk of HCC between participants with and without RA.

the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, between Jan 1, 1999 and Dec 31, 2009
The investigators did a retrospective, observational, nested case-control study in a cohort that was previously recruited from a population-based RA survey. All participants were enrolled prospectively in Taiwan's national health insurance between Jan 1, 1999, and June 30, 2009, and had follow-up data until Dec 31, 2009. RA was diagnosed based on the 1987 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria. The investigators matched RA and non-RA subjects by propensity score in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome was the risk of developing HCC. Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of HCC for RA and non-RA cohort.
