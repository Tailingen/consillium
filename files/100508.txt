A Phase II Study of the Menin Inhibitor Revumenib in Leukemia Associated With Upregulation of HOX Genes
To learn if revumenib (also known as SNDX-5613) can help to control leukemias associated with an increase in expression of HOX genes.
Leukemia|HOX Gene
DRUG: Revumenib
Safety and adverse events (AEs), Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, Through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objectives

â€¢ To assess the efficacy of revumenib in leukemias associated with upregulation of HOX genes.

Secondary Objectives

* To assess rates of measurable residual disease (MRD) clearance, as assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry in participants who respond to treatment.
* To assess rates of cytogenetic remissions in participants with baseline cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis.
* To assess event-free survival (EFS), duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS) in participants with leukemia associated with upregulation of HOX following treatment with revumenib.

Exploratory Objectives

* To evaluate molecular and cellular markers that may be predictive of antitumor activity and/or resistance
* To evaluate HOX/MEIS1 expression as a biomarker of response.
* To assess the rate of mutations in the MEN1 gene as a mechanism of resistance.
