Molecular Characterization of Gliomas Using a Broad Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)Panel
Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors with poor prognosis. The genotyping of tumors using NGS platforms enables the identification of genetic alterations that constitute diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers.Here in, we investigated the molecular profile of 32 tumor samples from 32 patients with high grade gliomas by implementing a broad 80-gene targeted NGS panel while reporting their clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes.
