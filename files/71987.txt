Clinical Observation on the Safety and Efficacy of Cardonilmab in the Treatment of Second-line and Above Advanced Melanoma and Advanced Renal Cancer
Safety and efficacy of Cardonilmab as a second-line or above treatment in patients with advanced malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.

To investigate the safety and efficacy of cardunnilizumab in the treatment of advanced mucosal, acral and cutaneous malignant melanoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma.

Primary end point: objective response rate (ORR) Secondary end point: progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), incidence of treatment-related adverse events Exploratory study end point: efficacy related marker exploration, gut microbiota or metabolomics changes
