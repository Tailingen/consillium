Vaccination With Autologous, Lethally Irradiated Melanoma Cells Engineered by Adenoviral Mediated Gene Transfer to Secrete Granulocyte-Macrophage Stimulating Factor (GMSF)
The purpose of this study is to see if the proposed therapy will delay or stop the progression of the participants skin cancer. This study is being done because there are currently no treatments which have been shown convincing to treat disease which has progressed. This research study is designed to evaluate the immunologic effects and clinical side effects of giving vaccines to patients that are made from their own skin cancer cells.

* The vaccines created from the participants melanoma cells are scheduled to be given to the participants on days 1, 8, 15, 29 and every two weeks after until the supply of vaccine has run out. The amount of vaccine is dependent on the total amount of cells yielded when the tumor is processed and treated. It is hoped that participants will receive at least six vaccines.
* The vaccines will be administered in two injections that will be placed underneath the participants skin. The two injections will be given at the same place on the body.
* If tumor sample yields enough cells, participants will also receive an injection of non-transduced irradiated melanoma cells. The purpose of this is to measure the amount of reaction of the participants immune system occuring created by the vaccine.
* If either the vaccine site or DTH placement site has shown a reaction, a punch-biopsy will be taken. This will consist of a small piece of skin tissue removed under local anesthesia.
* With vaccine #5, participants will receive a second DTH injection. Two days after the vaccine and DTH injection, punch biopsies will be taken of both sites.
* At week 10 of treatment (or earlier if necessary), participants will undergo a chest, abdomen and pelvic CT scan. The physician may also have participants undergo a brain MRI if indicated at this time.
