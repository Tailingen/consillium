Improved Therapy Response Assessment in Metastatic Brain Tumors
TREATMENT is an observational study addressing the need for knowledge and adequate diagnostic biomarkers in the response assessment of patients with brain metastasis. Reliable response assessment will be highly relevant in the coming years given the introduction of next-generation cancer drugs, including immunotherapy. This project uses advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Vessel Architecture Imaging (VAI) to better understand the response to traditional stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and immunotherapy.

Secondary objectives include:

In patients with brain metastases, use advanced MRI and Vessel Architectural Imaging methods to reveal parameters of traditional, immunotherapeutic, and anti-angiogenic therapy response.

In patients with brain metastases, use advanced MRI and Vessel Architectural Imaging methods to compare results with traditional biomarkers.

Use existing infrastructure at Oslo University Hospital to standardize therapy monitoring.

In patients with brain metastases, use advanced MRI and Vessel Architectural Imaging methods to separate real tumor progression from treatment-induced pseudoprogression or radionecrosis

In patients with brain metastases, use advanced MRI and Vessel Architectural Imaging methods to assess whether anti-angiogenic drugs improve delivery of chemotherapy.
