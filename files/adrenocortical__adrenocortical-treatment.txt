Incidence and Mortality
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor with an annual incidence of 2 cases per
1 million people.[
1
]  Although it mainly occurs in adults, children may be affected. The median age at
diagnosis is 46 years.  Historically, about 30%
of these malignancies are confined to the adrenal gland at diagnosis.[
2
] However, more ACCs are being diagnosed at early stages, most likely because of the widespread use of high-quality imaging techniques.
Prognostic Factors
Retrospective studies have identified the following three important
prognostic factors:[
3
]
Completeness of resection.
Stage of disease.
Pathological grade.
Patients who have low-grade tumors without evidence of invasion into local tissues or spread to lymph nodes have an improved prognosis. The role of other prognostic indicators is controversial.
Clinical Features
In approximately 60% of patients, symptoms related to excessive hormone secretion are the main reason for seeking medical attention. Biochemical hormone testing reveals that up to 80% of tumors are functioning. The second most common symptoms at time of initial presentation are unspecific abdominal symptoms, such as abdominal pain or fullness. A small percentage of ACCs are incidentally discovered when imaging studies are conducted for reasons other than potential adrenal disease.
Diagnosis
Initial evaluation should include careful endocrine studies to reveal any excessive hormone production by the tumor, which can serve as a tumor marker during therapy. Staging should include imaging of the primary site by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen. In addition, a CT of the chest is necessary to assess potential lung metastasis. Although the use of positron emission tomography may be effective in identifying unsuspected sites of metastases, its role as a staging tool is unclear. The detection of metastatic lesions may allow effective palliation of both functioning and nonfunctioning tumors.
Prognosis and Survival
The most common sites of metastases are the lung, liver, peritoneum, and, less commonly, the bones and major veins. Palliation of metastatic functioning tumors may be achieved by resection of both the primary tumor and metastatic lesions. Unresectable or widely disseminated tumors may be palliated by adrenolytic therapy with mitotane, antihormonal drugs (i.e.,  ketoconazole and metyrapone), systemic chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. However, 5-year survival rates for patients with stage IV tumors are usually less than 20%.[
2
]
Although several studies have shown partial or even complete remission, there is no convincing evidence that systemic therapy improves the survival duration of patients with adrenal cancer. Radical
open surgical excision is the treatment of choice for patients with localized malignancies and
remains the only method for achieving long-term disease-free survival.[
4
] Overall 5-year survival rates are
approximately 38% to 46%.[

Cellular Classification of Adrenocortical Carcinoma
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) can be classified into functioning and nonfunctioning tumors by clinical and biochemical assessment.  Approximately 60% of ACCs produce hormones.[
1
] The associated clinical syndromes include:
Hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome).
Hirsutism/virilization.
Feminization.
Precocious puberty.
Hyperaldosteronism.
Biochemical assessment aims to detect increased levels of cortisol (24-hour urine, 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test, serum adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol), androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone), estrogens (estradiol), and mineralocorticoids (renin, aldosterone).
Pathological assessment can differentiate high-grade and low-grade tumors according to the mitotic activity of the tumor. The Weiss score can differentiate benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors, based on several histopathological criteria, including:[
2
]
Nuclear grade.
Number of mitoses.
Presence of atypical mitosis.
Percentage of clear cells.
Diffuse architecture.
Necrosis.
Venous invasion.
Sinusoidal invasion.
Capsular invasion.

Stage Information for Adrenocortical Carcinoma
In This Section
AJCC Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
Several staging systems for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) are in use.
The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) defines ACC stage by the size of the primary
tumor, the degree of local invasion, and whether it has spread to regional
lymph nodes or distant sites.[
1
]  Proper staging should include computed
tomography (CT) of the abdomen and chest.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may add
specificity to CT evaluation of an adrenal mass.[
2
]  In-phase and out-of-phase
T1-weighted imaging may be the most effective noninvasive method to
differentiate benign from malignant adrenal masses.  MRI may suggest evidence of  extracapsular tumor invasion, extension into the
vena cava, or metastases.  Patency of surrounding vessels can often be
demonstrated with gadolinium-enhanced sequences or flip-angle techniques.[
3
]
In addition to AJCC staging, the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT) staging system is widely used internationally.[
4
] The ENSAT staging system is essentially the same as the AJCC system, but reserves stage IV only for tumors with distant metastasis. Other staging systems include the classical Macfarlane   system, modified by Sullivan, and the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer staging system, published by the World Health Organization.[
5
]
AJCC Stage Groupings and TNM Definitions
The AJCC has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) to define ACC.[

In This Section
Treatment Options for Stage III Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC)
Current Clinical Trials
Treatment Options for Stage III Adrenocortical Carcinoma (ACC)
Treatment options for
stage III ACC
include:
Complete surgical removal of the tumor, with or without regional lymph node
dissection, is the treatment of choice for patients with stage III ACC.  The treatment of patients who have tumors with local invasion, but
without clinically enlarged regional lymph nodes, is complete surgical removal,
as for stage I and stage II tumors.  For those with enlarged regional lymph
nodes, a lymph node dissection should be included in the procedure.  These
patients are at high risk of disease recurrence and should consider enrolling in a clinical trial.
Radiation therapy (approximately 50–70 Gy over a period of 4 weeks) may be given to
patients with localized but unresectable tumors (under clinical evaluation).[
1
]
Chemotherapy with mitotane in doses as high as 10 to 12 g/day to achieve a blood level of 14 to 20 mg/L should be considered for patients unable to undergo complete resection (under clinical evaluation). This adrenolytic drug produces useful clinical responses in about 20% to 30% of patients with measurable tumor burden.[
2
,
3
]
The role of mitotane as adjuvant therapy after complete tumor resection is still unclear but should be discussed with the patient. For patients who undergo a complete resection, the role of adjuvant mitotane and radiation therapy is the same as for patients with stage I  and stage  II ACC.
Chemotherapy with mitotane plus streptozotocin or mitotane plus etoposide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin may be effective and has been compared in a phase III clinical trial  (
NCT00924144
) (under clinical evaluation).[
2
]
Many patients with functioning tumors who receive treatment experience reduced hormone production. In patients with increased hormone production, antisteroidogenic drugs, such as ketoconazole and metyrapone, and steroid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone and mifepristone, should be considered.
Clinical trials are appropriate for newly diagnosed patients.

Temporary palliation of disseminated ACC can sometimes be achieved with the chemotherapeutic agent mitotane. Although measurable partial remissions are unusual and are reported in only 20% to 30% of patients, palliation of hormone symptoms is commonly observed. Prolonged treatment with mitotane, however, is often limited by gastrointestinal and neurological toxicity. Local recurrences and selected sites of metastatic disease can sometimes be palliated surgically or with radiation therapy.[

Clinical trials of other chemotherapy regimens are ongoing.
Many patients with functioning tumors who receive treatment experience reduced hormone production. In patients with increased hormone production, antisteroidogenic drugs, such as ketoconazole and metyrapone, and steroid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone and mifepristone, should be considered.

Treatment of Recurrent Adrenocortical Carcinoma
In This Section
Current Clinical Trials
Deciding to treat patients with recurrent adrenocortical carcinoma
(ACC), and what treatment to use, depends on many factors, including previous treatment, site of recurrence, and individual patient considerations.  Local recurrence and selected sites
of metastatic disease can sometimes be palliated by surgery or radiation therapy.  Although recurrent ACC is not considered curable, palliation of hormonal symptoms and
occasional 5-year survivals can be achieved.[

]  However, substantial morbidity is associated with resection of recurrent tumors.
Clinical
trials, including phase I and II trials of newer chemotherapeutic and biological agents, are appropriate and  should be considered.
