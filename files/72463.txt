Chemoradiotherapy Combined With or Without PD-1 Blockade in Anal Canal Squamous Carcinoma Patients
This is a phase III, multi-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of concurrent mitomycin C/5-Fu chemotherapy and long-course IMRT combined with PD-1 antibody Sintilimab for locally advanced anal canal squamous carcinoma patients, by comparing an experiment group (traditional chemoradiotherapy with PD-1 antibody Sintilimab) with a control group (traditional treatment without Sintilimab).
