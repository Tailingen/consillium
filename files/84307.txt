A Clinical Trial of BP1002 in Patients With Refractory/Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of BP1002 (Liposomal Bcl-2 Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotide) in patients with refractory/relapsed AML. The study is designed to assess the safety profile, identify DLTs, biologically effective doses, PK, PD and potential anti-leukemic effects of BP1002 as single agent (dose escalation phase) followed by assessing BP1002 in combination with decitabine (dose expansion phase).
