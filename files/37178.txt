Reduced Intensity Allogeneic PBSCT to Treat Hematologic Malignancies and Hematopoietic Failure States
The purpose of this study is to look at whether the combination of lower-dose chemotherapy with two chemotherapy (anti-cancer) drugs, called busulfan and melphalan, and an antibody medication called alemtuzumab (CampathÂ®), can prevent rejection of donor blood stem cells so that those cells take hold and build a healthy new blood cell factory after transplant. The study will also look at the safety of the combination of drugs and of the transplant of peripheral blood stem cells from a healthy relative or an unrelated donor.

DRUG: busulfan, and melphalan, and alemtuzumab
Number of Participants With Presence of Donor Lymphohematopoietic Chimerism (Defined as at Least 50% Donor Cells in the Peripheral Blood) in Peripheral Blood by Day +100 (i.e., 100 Days After Allogeneic PBSCT)., To determine the efficacy of related or unrelated allogeneic PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) using a preparative regimen of busulfan, melphalan and alemtuzumab, as measured by durable donor lymphohematopoietic cell engraftment. The primary efficacy endpoint is the presence of donor lymphohematopoietic chimerism (defined as at least 50% donor cells in the peripheral blood) in peripheral blood by day +100 (i.e., 100 days after allogeneic PBSCT)., Day +100
Number of Participants With Relapse-free Survival., To determine the safety of related or unrelated allogeneic PBSCT using a preparative regimen of busulfan, melphalan and alemtuzumab. The primary safety endpoint is non-relapse mortality at day +100., Day +100|Number of Participants With Event-free Survival., To determine the safety of related or unrelated allogeneic PBSCT using a preparative regimen of busulfan, melphalan and alemtuzumab. The primary safety endpoint is non-relapse mortality at day +100., Day +100|Number of Participants With Overall Survival., To determine the safety of related or unrelated allogeneic PBSCT using a preparative regimen of busulfan, melphalan and alemtuzumab. The primary safety endpoint is non-relapse mortality at day +100., Day +100
Transplantation of related or unrelated allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) after administration of a reduced-intensity regimen of busulfan, melphalan and alemtuzumab will be associated with satisfactory engraftment and acceptable post-transplant non-relapse mortality.
