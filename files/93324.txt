A Single Center Experience in the Management of Pilonidal Disease
Sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease (PND) is a common entity affecting the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the upper portion of the natal cleft of the buttocks. It is characterized by the presence of sinus tracts with recurrent inflammation and infection. It poses a significant healthcare problem due to its related morbidity, impaired quality of life, and financial costs.
Pilonidal Sinus
PROCEDURE: surgery
Select the best operative technique as regard the number and distribution of the pits in pilonidal sinus cases., best surgical option based on pits location, 6 months|Recurrence rate, how many cases developed recurrence, 6 months - 1 year
the incidence of complications such as: wound infection, wound dehiscence, postoperative pain., complication rate, 1 month
This acquired disease is caused by negative suction of the hair present in the natal cleft region, leading to a foreign body reaction and subsequent granuloma . It affects 26 per 100000 people, and it mainly affects young men . Surgery for PND is frequently performed in Egypt by general surgeons, with no published data regarding its incidence or prevalence in the Egyptian population.

The PND patient may report different presentations ranging from asymptomatic disease to acute infection and abscess formation. Others may have a chronic disease with recurrent perianal inflammation and discharge.

Multiple surgical options have been described for chronic PND. However, no technique has been universally accepted. The idea of any procedure is to excise the pits with the related sinus tracts leaving healthy tissue as possible to decrease recurrence. The most commonly performed surgical techniques include excision with either primary closure, lay open, or flap-based reconstruction.
