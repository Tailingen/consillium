Vorinostat With XRT and 5-FU for Locally Advanced Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
The durg vorinostat (Zolinza) is a type of drug called an histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. It inhibits a group of enzymes called histone deacetylases. These enzymes help cancer cells survive. By inhibiting these enzymes, vorinostat helps kill cancer cells. In this research study vorinostat will be given along with radiation therapy and the drug 5-FU. This is the first research study in which vorinostat will be given along with radiation therapy and 5-FU. The purpose of this research study is to find the highest dose of vorinostat that can be given safely along with radiation therapy and 5-FU. The investigators will also begin to get information about whether vorinostat combined with radiation and 5-FU may help to treat pancreatic cancer.

Maximally Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Vorinostat in Combination With Infusional 5-FU and Radiation Therapy., The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as one dose level below the dose level at which participants experience an unacceptable rate of dose-limiting toxicity., 6 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 7 Months From Registration, Progression free survival was defined as the duration of time from registration on study to time of objective disease progression. Death was regarded as a progression event. Progression was defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions as seen on radiologic evaluation., 7 months
Progression Free Survival, Progression free survival for this endpoint was defined as the duration of time from beginning of the patients' initial chemotherapy to time of objective disease progression. Death was regarded as a progression event. Progression was defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions as seen on radiologic evaluation., 2 years|Number of Participants Experiencing Unacceptable Toxicity, All participants who receive at least one dose of study treatment were evaluable for toxicity. Unacceptable toxicity is based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. Most grade 3 (severe) or 4 (life-threatening) events are considered to be unacceptable toxicities -- exceptions include nausea or vomiting, fatigue, and alopecia. Hematologic toxicities need to be either grade 4 or last for protocol-defined durations to be considered unacceptable., 1 year|Overall Survival, Percentage of participants still alive at 1 year after enrollment on study, 1 year|Response Rate, Participants who have either a complete response (disappearance of all target lesions), partial response (at least 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions) or stable disease (decrease in size of less than 30% or increase in size of less than 20%)., 1 year|Resectability Rate, Percentage of patients able to undergo surgical resection after protocol therapy., 5 months
* Since we are looking for the highest dose of vorinostat that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will receive the same dose. The dose will depend upon the number of participants enrolled on the study and how well they have tolerated their doses.
* 5-FU will be given intravenously over 24 hours 7 days per week during each week of radiation therapy. In order for participants to be able to receive the 5-FU as an outpatient, they will need to have central line catheter placed.
* Radiation therapy will be given once per day, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks.
* Vorinostat is taken orally.
* Participants will be seen once per week during the 6 weeks that they are receiving 5-FU, radiation therapy and vorinostat.
