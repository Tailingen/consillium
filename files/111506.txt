Spectro-IRM and Evaluation Response to Prostatic Radiotherapy
Context:

Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer and the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in European and North-American men.

After external radiotherapy or brachytherapy, the Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) value is often fluctuating and PSA nadir may only be reached after 2 years or more and may remain detectable several years after the completion of radiation. Moreover, PSA bounces and blips render patients and physicians very anxious about any possibility of a relapse. In this context, biomarkers that could predict the response to radiation earlier than PSA for patients with prostate cancer appear long overdue.

Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy at 3 Tesla without endorectal coil is a non invasive procedure which allows quantification of metabolites such as Choline, Creatine, Polyamines and Citrate within the prostate gland.

Objectives:

The investigators are conducting a French prospective study on the Evaluation of the Response to Irradiation with MR Spectroscopy (ERIS). Their purpose is to monitor the early response of radiation with 3D MR Spectroscopy during the first year after completion of radiation and its impact on biochemical control. Therefore, the ERIS trial aims to investigate whether or not there could be a correlation between the time course of PSA and that of Choline and Citrate.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: MR-Spectroscopy
PSA value compare to Choline and Citrate levels as measured with MR-spectroscopic imaging as predictive factor of the response to treatment, Data will be collected at the end of the radiotherapy and every 3 months up to 1 year for each patient. Data analysis will be performed at the end of data completion in december 2011., up to 1 year
