Temodar (Temozolomide), Bevacizumab, Lithium and Radiation for High Grade Glioma
This pilot phase II trial studies how well giving temozolomide, bevacizumab, lithium carbonate, and radiation therapy works in treating patients with newly diagnosed high grade glioma.

DRUG: Temozolomide|DRUG: Bevacizumab|DRUG: Lithium Carbonate|RADIATION: Radiation
Median Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS defined as time from date of diagnosis to most recent follow up, disease progression, or death. Disease progress defined as either clinical deterioration or radiographic progressive disease on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) per updated response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria (Wen, et al)., Up to 50 months
Median Overall Survival (OS), OS defined as time from diagnosis to most recent follow up or death., Up to 50 months|Number of Patients With Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events, Adverse events evaluated per CTCAE 3, The whole time while on treatment and 30 days after the treatment
Treatment of high grade glioma (HGG) with anti-angiogenic therapy results in clinical improvement and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS). However, mant patients experience diffuse recurrence and treatment failure. This is a phase II trial testing the feasibility of adding lithium carbonate, previously shown to have anti-invasive properties in HGG, to bevacizumab and chemoradiation following surgical resection of HGG.
