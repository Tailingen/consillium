CAV Regimen Bridging to HSCT for R/R AL
Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment option for acute leukemia (AL), relapsed or refractory (R/R) AL is still a big challenge. It is believed that decreased tumor burden before HSCT is a favorable factor contributing to the long-term survival of R/R AL patients and many kinds of bridging chemotherapy regimens were devised to kill leukemic cells before HSCT, there is still no consensus that which regimen is optimal. This study is to investigate the curative efficacy and safety of bridging CAV (cladribine combined with low dose Ara-C and venetoclax) regimens followed by HSCT treatment protocol for R/R AML.
Acute Leukemia, Relapsed|Acute Leukemia Refractory
PROCEDURE: CAV regimen bridging to HSCT
ORR (overall response rate), ORR was calculated as the sum of CR, CRi, MLFS and PR., 1 month
OS (Overall survival), OS was defined as the time from enrollment to this study to the date of death from any cause; patients not known to have died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were last known to be alive., 1 year|EFS (Event-free survival), EFS was defined as the time from the initiation of CAV to treatment failure, relapse, death from any cause or the last follow-up., 1 year|Adverse events (AEs), It is evaluated and graded according to CTCAE 5.0., 2 months
