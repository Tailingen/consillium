Study of Cordycepin Plus Pentostatin in Patients With Refractory TdT-Positive Leukemia
This is a two-part, open-label, Phase I/II study in subjects with relapsed or refractory TdT-positive leukemia for which no standard therapies are expected to result in durable remission.
Refractory TdT-Positive Leukemia
DRUG: Cordycepin plus Pentostatin
Establishment of the recommended dose (RD) of cordycepin, given one hour following a fixed dose of the ADA inhibitor pentostatin, in subjects with refractory TdT-positive leukemia, one year
Determination of the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of cordycepin. Measurement and quantification any any clinical responses following administration of cordycepin/pentostatin at the recomme, 18 months
In the first phase the Study Objectives are to:

* Define the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) for administration of cordycepin as a 1-hour IV infusion, administered 1 hour following administration of an IV bolus of pentostatin, in subjects with refractory TdT-positive leukemia;
* Determine plasma ADA levels prior to pentostatin infusion and at 60 and 120 minutes after administration of pentostatin;
* Determine the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of cordycepin given 1 hour after a fixed dose of pentostatin;
* Assess cordycepin pharmacodynamics by measurement of blast cell apoptosis from peripheral blood smears;
* Measure and quantitate any clinical responses in refractory TdT-positive leukemia patients following cordycepin/pentostatin administration.

In the second phase, the Study Objectives are to assess the safety, PK, and clinical outcomes of cordycepin in combination with pentostatin, at the RD, in a 20 subject cohort
