Japan Phase 2 Study of Niraparib (Maintenance Therapy) in Participants With Relapsed Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of niraparib in Japanese participants with platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in the last chemotherapy containing platinum-based anticancer agents.
Ovarian Cancer|Fallopian Tube Cancer|Primary Peritoneal Cancer
DRUG: Niraparib
Number of Participants With Grade 3 or 4 Thrombocytopenia Occurring Within 30 Days After Initial Administration of Niraparib, An adverse event of 'thrombocytopenia' was collected and graded as per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.03.As per the NCI-CTCAE, Grade 1 scales as Mild; Grade 2 scales as Moderate; Grade 3 scales as severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; Grade 4 scales as life-threatening consequences; and Grade 5 scales as death related to Adverse Events (AE)., Up to 30 days after the first dose
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who has enrolled in a study; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., From the day of signing the informed consent form (ICF) until 30 days after last dose of study drug administration or beginning of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever comes first (up to 48 months).|Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher TEAEs, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who has enrolled in a study; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A severity grade is defined by the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.03. As per NCI-CTCAE, Grade 1 scales as Mild; Grade 2 scales as Moderate; Grade 3 scales as severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; Grade 4 scales as life-threatening consequences; and Grade 5 scales as death related to AE., From the day of signing the ICF until 30 days after last dose of study drug administration or beginning of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever comes first (up to 48 months).|Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), An SAE is any AE that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in significant disability or incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event., From the day of signing the ICF until 30 days after last dose of study drug administration or beginning of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever comes first (up to 48 months).|Number of Participants With TEAEs Leading to Drug Discontinuation, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who has enrolled in a study; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., From the day of signing the ICF until 30 days after last dose of study drug administration or beginning of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever comes first (up to 48 months).|Number of Participants With TEAEs Leading to Dose Interruption, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who has enrolled in a study; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., From the day of signing the ICF until 30 days after last dose of study drug administration or beginning of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever comes first (up to 48 months).|Number of Participants With TEAEs Leading to Dose Reduction, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who has enrolled in a study; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug., From the day of signing the ICF until 30 days after last dose of study drug administration or beginning of subsequent anticancer therapy, whichever comes first (up to 48 months).|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time in months from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death as assessed by the Investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Per RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the SoD (Sum of Diameters) of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest (nadir) SoD since (and including) baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the SoD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm., From first study drug administration until disease progression or death (up to 48 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the study enrollment to death due to any cause., Up to 48 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as assessed by the investigator per RECIST (v.1.1). Per RECIST 1.1, CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions; PR is defined as atleast 30% decrease in sum of diameters (SoD) of target lesions., Up to 48 months
The drug being tested in this study is called niraparib. Niraparib is being tested to treat people who have platinum-sensitive, relapsed ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer. This study will look at the safety and efficacy of niraparib in Japanese participants.

The study will enroll approximately 15 participants. Participants will be enrolled to one group and after that will be asked to take niraparib capsules at the same time each day throughout the study:

- Niraparib 300 mg

This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately 28 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in the treatment period, and the post-treatment period including follow-up assessments after the last dose of the study drug.
