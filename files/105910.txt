An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following criteria: fatal or life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect; medically significant (an event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above \[medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is 'medically important'\]); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. A TEAE is defined as an AE occurring or worsening during the treatment period including the safety follow-up period., Day 1 through Day 565 (corresponding to maximum observed duration)|Number of Participants With >= Grade 3 Laboratory Results, Number of participants with laboratory measurements of Grade \>= 3 by NCI-CTCAE v4.03 are reported. The NCI-CTCAE is a descriptive terminology is used for AE reporting. The NCI-CTCAE v4.03 displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE. Based on this general guideline: Grade 1 as mild AE, Grade 2 as moderate AE, Grade 3 as severe AE, Grade 4 as life-threatening or disabling AE, and Grade 5 as death. In case a participant reported multiple severity grades for an AE, only the maximum grade was used., Day 1 through Day 565 (corresponding to maximum observed duration)

A participant was considered positive if negative at baseline (screening) and had at least one positive post-baseline result, or positive at baseline and had at least one positive post-baseline result with a titer higher than baseline. Number of participants with ADA positive to GEN1029 are reported., From Screening (Day -21 to -1) through Day 478 (corresponding to maximum observed duration)|Change From Baseline in Anti-tumor Activity Measured by Tumor Shrinkage, Anti-tumor activity measured by tumor shrinkage was evaluated on based on of sum of the diameter(s) of all target lesions from the computerized tomography (CT) scan/positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan.

The OR was defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECIST v1.1. The CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and reduction in short axis to \<10 mm of any pathological and non-pathological lymph nodes. The PR was defined as \>=30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline), no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and no new lesion., From Day 1 through 8.8 months (corresponding to maximum observed duration)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) According to RECIST 1.1, The PFS was defined as the number of days from the date of first study drug administration to first progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause. The PD was defined as at least 20% (and \>= 5 mm) increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, compared to the smallest sum of the target LDs recorded while in trial or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions; unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions; and/or new lesion. The radiological evaluation based on RECIST v1.1 was assessed using CT scan/PET scan. The PFS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., From Day 1 through 8.8 months (corresponding to maximum observed duration)|Overall Survival (OS) According to RECIST 1.1, Overall survival was defined as the number of days from date of first study drug administration to death due to any cause. If a subject was not known to have died, then OS was censored, and the censoring date was the latest date the subject was known to be alive (on or before the cut-off date). The OS was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., From Day 1 through 8.8 months (corresponding to maximum observed duration)|Duration of Response (DoR) According to RECIST 1.1, The radiological evaluation based on RECIST v1.1 was assessed using CT scan/PET-CT scan.

The trial is an open-label, multi-center first-in-human trial of GEN1029 (HexaBody速-DR5/DR5). The trial consists of two parts a dose escalation part (phase 1, first-in-human (FIH) and an expansion part (phase 2a). The expansion part of the trial will be initiated once the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) has been determined.
