HER-TEMPO - Real World Treatment-related Outcomes on T-DXd in Canada
Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) has been studied in multiple global prospective DESTINY-Breast trials and has a marketing authorization from Health Canada for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mBC) and HER2-low mBC, respectively.

Multiple stakeholders, including clinicians, patients, regulators, and healthcare decision makers, are interested in real-world treatment-related outcomes in order to better represent the effectiveness of therapies in routine care settings.

DRUG: Trastuzumab deruxtecan
Early treatment discontinuation rates, Summary statistics of cumulative number and proportion of patients discontinuing at each timepoint, 3, 6, 9 months|Dose modifications, Summary statistics about number and proportion of patients experiencing a dose modification (reduction or interruption) while receiving treatment in the PSP, from baseline to treatment discontinuation or the end of PSP, assessed up to 12 months (HER2-positive cohort) and up to 14 months (HER2-low cohort)
Real world time to treatment discontinuation (rwTTD), Median time from first dose of T-DXd to earliest date of T-DXd discontinuation as recorded in the patient support program (PSP) database or self-report from follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first, from baseline to treatment discontinuation (self-report or recorded in the PSP database), end of the PSP, or end of the study period, assessed up to 24 months|Reasons for treatment discontinuations, Summary statistics about the number and proportion of patients with pre-specified reasons for treatment discontinuations as recorded by the clinician in the PSP program or based on self-report, from baseline to treatment discontinuation (self-report or recorded in the PSP database), end of the PSP, or end of the study period, assessed up to 24 months|Median treatment duration and dose intensity, Median treatment duration (and range, 95% CI): time from treatment initiation to treatment discontinuation excluding any dose interruptions; and dose intensity (DI) will be measured by the total drug delivered over the total time for the course of treatment (RDI will be the ratio of DI to the standard dose intensity), from baseline to treatment discontinuation (as recorded in the PSP database) or end of the PSP, assessed up to 12 months (HER2-positive cohort) and up to 14 months (HER2-low cohort)
This is a non-interventional, observational, hybrid (involving both primary and secondary data), cohort study that is utilizing patient support program (PSP) data. PSPs in Canada can support patients in accessing medicines after Health Canada has granted marketing authorization of a new drug or new indication before public reimbursement is available.

The outcomes will be assessed for the HER2-positive and HER2-low cohorts separately.

The primary objectives include assessing early treatment discontinuation rates at 3-, 6-, and 9-months after initiating T-DXd, and characterizing T-DXd dose modifications (i.e., interruptions and reductions) over the course of treatment for HER2+ mBC and HER2-low mBC.

Secondary objectives include estimating the real-world time to discontinuation (rwTTD) of T-DXd, reasons for treatment discontinuations, and real world duration of treatment and dose intensity with T-DXd.

The primary analysis population for all primary and secondary objectives will be the Total PSP Population (TPP), which includes all patients enrolled into the PSP who meet study criteria. Sensitivity analyses will also be performed in the Study PSP population (SPP), which will be a subset of patients from the TPP who provide study consent for additional data collection.
