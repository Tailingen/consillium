Study of huCART19 for Very High-Risk (VHR) Subsets of Pediatric B-ALL
This is a phase 2 study to evaluate humanized CD19 redirected autologous T cells (or huCART19 cells) with CD19 expressing relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This study is targeting pediatric and young adult patients aged 3 months - 29 years with CD19+ B cell malignancies in newly diagnosed B-ALL patients predicted to have an exceedingly poor outcome with conventional chemotherapy, in high-risk first relapse, or and in second or greater relapse in this phase 2 trial. In addition, a second cohort will test the efficacy of huCART19 in patients with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy.

Number of Subjects With Event-Free Survival in Patients With Newly Diagnosed VHR B-ALL or High-risk Relapse of B-ALL 1 Year After Treatment., Time from infusion to the first of event or censoring Events = Relapse, No Response, or Death; Censoring =Initiation of New Anticancer Therapy, Last Day of Follow-up/EOS; whichever occurs first., 1 year|Number of Subjects With Event-Free Survival in Patients With Poor Response to Prior B Cell Directed Engineered Cell Therapy 1 Year After Treatment., Time from infusion to the first of event or censoring Events = Relapse, No Response (including CR/CRi without B Cell Aplasia), or Death; Censoring =Initiation of New Anticancer Therapy, Last Day of Follow-up/EOS; whichever occurs first., 1 year
Overall Remission Rate, Overall remission rate as determined by the response at day 28, computed as the number of subjects with CR or Cri, in patients with newly diagnosed VHR B-ALL or high-risk relapse of B-ALL., 28 Days|Overall Remission Rate (Cohort B), Number of subjects with CR/CRi with B Cell Aplasia at Day 28, 28 Days|Percentage of Subjects With Relapse-free Survival, Time from first response of CR/CRi to the first of event or censoring, in responders.

Cohort A: Events = Relapse or Death; Censoring = Initiation of New Anticancer Therapy, Last Day of Follow-up/EOS; whichever occurs first.

Cohort B: When defining responders, CR/CRi without B Cell Aplasia is considered no response. Events = Relapse or Death; Censoring = Initiation of New Anticancer Therapy, Last Day of Follow-up/EOS; whichever occurs first., 1 year
