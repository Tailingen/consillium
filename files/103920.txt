Activity and Tolerability of Pazopanib in Advanced and/or Metastatic Liposarcoma. A Phase II Clinical Trial
Soft tissue and bone sarcomas are rare malignant tumors, which encompasses a large family of more than 50 histologically distinct tumor subtypes, all of which share a putative mesenchymal origin. In the case of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment, but despite curative surgery, around half of patients develop distant metastases and die from disease. Few therapeutic approaches are currently available to patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic STS and only anthracyclines, ifosfamide and trabectedin have shown activity, with response rates of 20-40% in previously untreated patients. Recent and ongoing trials have investigated a variety of combination chemotherapeutic regimens (variously employing ifosfamide, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, temozolomide, vincristine, cisplatin, and dacarbazine, among others) as well as targeted therapies, which in some cases have yielded improvements in response rate but which have had little impact on survival. No other medical option is currently available, and the median survival of patients with soft-tissue sarcoma with non-resectable metastases is around 12-15 months, and approximately 8 months after second line chemotherapy.

Liposarcomas are STS which account for at least 20% of all STS in adults. They can be further classified into 3 histologically and biologically different subtypes: well-differentiated liposarcoma/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (ALT-WD), myxoid or round cell liposarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma.

ALT-WD liposarcomas are locally aggressive rarely metastasizing tumors characterized by ring or giant marker chromosomes on the cytogenetic analysis and by amplification of the 12q13-21 region on Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) (MDM2, CDK4 and HMGIC). They account for about 40% iv of liposarcomas with a 5 year Overall survival (OS) around 80%. In a series of WD/DD treated with several regimens response rate was 12.5% OS 15 months and median PFS 3.6 months(95 confidence interval (CI): 3.3-5.9) Mixoid /round cell liposarcoma accounts for 45-50% of all liposarcomas. They tend to metastasize to unusual soft tissue and bone locations. High histologic grade with more than 5% of round cell component is associated with a 5-year OS of 50% approximately. They are characterized by t(23;16)(q13-14;p11) which leads to the fusion of CHOP and TLS genes Pleomorphic liposarcoma accounts for approximately 5-10% of all liposarcomas, characterized by high grade features with frequent and early lung metastasis and cytogenetically by high chromosome counts and complex structural rearrangements.

VEGF is expressed in many STS in which increased expression is associated with higher grade and worse prognosis.

Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor that targets mainly VEGFR, PDGFR and c-kit. Recently the results of a phase II trial of pazopanib in STS have been published. It was a four-cohort 2-stages study. The liposarcoma stratum was closed after the first stage because of a PFS at 12 weeks of 17% (3 out of 17 patients did not progressed after 12 weeks). After central pathologic review, 2 other patients initially classified as other STS were found to have liposarcoma with stable disease at 12 weeks (5/19: 26% PFS12w), thus fulfilling criteria for cohort expansion. Phase II study had been completed and in phase III study patients with liposarcomas were excluded so therefore data on the liposarcoma cohort are inconclusive.

Furthermore the positive results of the phase III study PALETTE have been recently communicated, encouraging this treatment in other sarcomas: progression-free survival (PFS) per independent review was significantly prolonged with pazopanib (median: 4.6 vs 1.5 months; HR=0.31, 95% CI 0.24-0.40; P\<0.0001). The interim analysis for overall survival shows a statistically non-significant improvement of pazopanib vs placebo (median: 11.9 vs 10.4 months, HR=0.83, 95% CI 0.62-1.09).

Soluble factors associated with efficacy and toxicity of pazopanib in these patients had been also reported. Decreases in VEGFR2 and increase in PlGF were both associated with toxicity (HTA and TSH elevation) and poorer prognosis.
Advanced and / or Metastatic Liposarcoma
DRUG: Pazopanib
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Assessed 12 Weeks After Start of Treatment, The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the activity of Pazopanib in patients with advanced and/or metastatic liposarcoma by means of progression-free survival (PFS) assessed 12 weeks after start of treatment. (According the RECIST criteria 1.1 and central radiology review).

Progression was defined according to RECIST criteria 1.1 as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, 12 weeks after start of treatment
Overall Progression Free Survival (Median PFS), Overall progression free survival will be computed from the date of start of treatment to the first documented date of progression or the date of death, whatever the cause. Patients alive and free from progression at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up., Imaging studies repeated every 6 weeks for the first 12 weeks and every 8 weeks up to 36 months.|Percentage of Patients With Objective Tumor Response (OR), Objective tumor response, measured according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria (central reviewing) at 6 and 12 weeks.

Response criteria are essentially based on a set of measurable lesions identified at baseline as target lesions, and followed until disease progression.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, 6 weeks and 12 weeks|Overall Survival (OS), It will be computed from the date of start of treatment to the date of death, whatever the cause. Patients alive or lost for follow-up at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of last follow-up., Every 12 weeks from disease progression up to 36 months.|Clinical Benefit Rate, Patients who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for 6 months or more and an improvement of symptoms will be considered as having derived clinical benefit., Imaging studies required to investigate known disease should be repeated every 6 weeks for the first 12 weeks and every 8 weeks up to 36 months.|Growth Modulation Index (GMI), GMI is the ratio between time to progression (TTP) with pazopanib (TTPp) divided by the TTPp-1 with the previous line of therapy.

GMI index values higher than 1 indicate that Pazopanib treatment has an increased time to progression when compared to previous line of treatment.

GMI index values lower than 1 indicate that Pazopanib treatment has a reduced time to progression when compared to previous line of treatment.

Higher GMI values are associated to a better outcome., Imaging studies required to investigate known disease should be repeated every 6 weeks for the first 12 weeks and every 8 weeks up to 36 months. At patient progression confirmed by means RECIST criteria V 1.1|Safety Profile (According CTCAE, Version 4.0), The safety and tolerability of Pazopanib will be determined by means of type, incidence, severity, timing, seriousness, and relatedness; of reported adverse events (AEs), physical examinations, and laboratory tests. Toxicity will be graded and tabulated by the NCI-CTCAE v 4.0., Every week during the first month, week 6, week 9, week 12, every 4 weeks until end of treatment and at the end of treatment visit (28 days after the end of treatment), up to 36 months
