Panomics Relationships in the Epidemiology of Cancer Through In Silico Expression (PRECISE)
PRECISE is a study to discover new detection, prognosis and treatment biomarkers for cancer. This is a prospective, multi-center, observational study designed to collect de-identified biospecimens and clinical data from a large cohort of participants from clinical research networks in the United States. In this study, the investigators propose creating a large-scale normalized panomics dataset specifically designed for deep learning-based in silico analysis for biomarker discovery.

This study will enroll all subjects who are eligible and willing to participate with a goal of enrolling at least 10,000 in several categories: (i) Patients with Family History of Cancer, (ii) Patients with Clinical and Environmental Risk Factors for Cancer, and (iii) Patients with a Suspected or Confirmed Diagnosis of Cancer.
