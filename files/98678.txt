Afatinib (BIBW2992) in HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2)-Overexpressing Inflammatory Breast Cancer
The general aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib alone and in combination with weekly vinorelbine (in patients who progress on afatinib monotherapy within this trial) as treatment in patients with HER2-overexpressing, locally advanced or metastatic inflammatory breast cancer. The study will include patients who have and have not failed prior trastuzumab treatment.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Afatinib once daily (OD)|DRUG: Vinorelbine Weekly
Part A: Clinical Benefit (CB) Assessed by Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) for at Least 6 Months Using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1)., Tumour response was assessed separately for Part A and Part B according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The primary endpoint of this study was confirmed clinical benefit, as assessed by Stable Disease (SD) for at least 6 months (defined as \>182 days), Partial Response (PR), or Complete Response (CR) according to RECIST version 1.1 (only confirmed responses were considered)., This endpoint was assessed between the from first administration of trial medication in Part A and the earliest of PD, death or start of next treatment (either Part B combination therapy or new anti-cancer therapy) up to 929 days.|Part B: Clinical Benefit (CB) Assessed by Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) for at Least 6 Months Using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1)., Tumour response was assessed separately for Part B according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The primary endpoint of this study was confirmed clinical benefit, as assessed by Stable Disease (SD) for at least 6 months (defined as \>182 days), Partial Response (PR), or Complete Response (CR) according to RECIST version 1.1 (only confirmed responses were considered)., This endpoint was recorded from first administration of trial medication in Part B until the earliest of PD, death or start of new anti-cancer therapy up to 929 days.
Part A: Confirmed Objective Response (OR) Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., Objective response was defined on a patient level as a best response of CR or PR., This endpoint was recorded from first administration of trial medication until the earliest of disease progression, death or start of next treatment (either Part B combination therapy or new anti-cancer therapy) up to 929 days.|Part B: Confirmed Objective Response (OR) Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., Objective response was defined on a patient level as a best response of CR or PR., This endpoint was recorded from first administration of trial medication in Part B and until the earliest of disease progression, death or start of new anti-cancer therapy up to 929 days.|Part A: Unconfirmed Objective Response (OR) Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)., Objective response was defined on a patient level as a best response of CR or PR., This endpoint was recorded from first administration of trial medication until the earliest of PD, death or start of next treatment (either Part B combination therapy or new anti-cancer therapy) up to 929 days.|Part B: Unconfirmed Objective Response (OR) Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1 )., Objective response was defined on a patient level as a best response of CR or PR., This endpoint was recorded from first administration of trial medication in Part B and until the earliest of PD, death or start of new anti-cancer therapy up to 929 days.|Part A: Duration of Unconfirmed Objective Response., Objective Response (OR) was defined on a patient level as a best response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). Duration of objective response was measured from the time of first unconfirmed objective response to the time of progression or death (or date of censoring for Progression Free Survival (PFS))., From first drug administration until end of Part A, up to 929 days.|Part B: Duration of Unconfirmed Objective Response., Objective response was defined on a patient level as a best response of CR or PR. Duration of objective response was measured from the time of first unconfirmed objective response to the time of progression or death (or date of censoring for PFS)., From first drug administration until end of Part B, up to 929 days.|Part A: Progression Free Survival., PD was evaluated according to the RECIST version 1.1. For patients with a known date of progression (or death), PFS was the earlier of date of progression or death - date of first administration + 1. The date of progression and date of first administration referred to the respective part of the study A., From first drug administration until end of Part A, up to 713 days.|Part B: Progression Free Survival., PD was evaluated according to the RECIST version 1.1. For patients with a known date of progression (or death), PFS was the earlier of date of progression or death - date of first administration + 1. The date of progression and date of first administration referred to the respective part of the study B., From first drug administration until end of Part B, up to 230 days.|Progression Free Survival Over the Whole Sudy., PD was evaluated according to the RECIST version 1.1. Number of days from the start of monotherapy to the date of second PD., From first drug administration until end of study, up to 700 days.
