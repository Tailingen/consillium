Head Stabilization in Whole Brain RT
This is a single-center, single-arm observational study in which the investigators aim to develop an advanced motion control system for head stabilization in patients undergoing whole brain radiation therapy.
Brain Cancer
DEVICE: Freedom Pursuit Robotic Platform
Robotic Head Holder Stabilization During Radiation Therapy, The total percentage of time that a participant is positioned ≤ 0.5mm and ≤ 0.5deg within target during radiation therapy., 24 months
Standard of care treatment is to be immobilized with a mask for whole brain radiation therapy. The purpose of this study is to develop a process to track and correct a person's head movements in real time during radiation treatment. To do this, the investigators will use a mask and head holder connected to a robotic support platform which can make small movements of the head holder.
