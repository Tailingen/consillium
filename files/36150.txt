Efficacy of a Treatment With CHOP and Lenalidomide in First Line in Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma (AITL)
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of lenalidomide associated with CHOP as measured by complete response rate at the end of treatment. Approximately 80 patients aged between 60 and 80 years will be included, to have 70 evaluable patients. The treatment consists of two phases of four 3-weeks cycles: induction phase and consolidation phase, for a total treatment duration of 24 weeks. Each cycle will be broken down as follows: chemotherapy will be administered in the hospital on day 1, prednisone is continued for 5 days and lenalidomide is taken for 14 days. Patients will be followed for at least 18 months after inclusion of the last patient.
