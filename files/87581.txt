A Phase I/IIa Open-Label, Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Trial of Oral TSR-011 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors and Lymphomas
TSR-011 is a potent small molecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinases involved in cancer, including:

1. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
2. The tropomyosin-related kinases TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC

This is a sequential, open-label, non-randomized study with dose escalation in Phase 1, followed by expansion at a recommended phase 2 dose.
