A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Toripalimab or Placebo Combined With Chemotherapy in Treatment-naive Advanced NSCLC
This is one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab injection (JS001) or placebo combined with standard 1st-line chemotherapy in treatment-naïve advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and evaluate the population with the best predictive biomarkers, i.e., positive diagnosis population.

About 450 subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer without activated EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion, or exon 21 L858R, exon 21 L861Q, exon 18 G719X or exon 20 S768I mutations) and ALK fusion will be 2:1 randomized into two groups, JS001 combined with the standard 1st-line chemotherapy will be given in the study group whereas placebo combined with standard 1st-line chemotherapy will be given in the control group. The stratification will be based on the following factors:

PD-L1 expression (TC≥1% vs TC\<1%); Smoking state (often smoking vs no smoking or infrequent smoking); Pathological type (squamous cell carcinoma vs non-squamous cell carcinoma).
