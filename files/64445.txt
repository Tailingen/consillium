Exploratory Study, Evaluating the Treatment Effect of Surgery Plus GLIADELÂ® Wafer in Patients With Metastatic Brain Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the surgical intervention and insertion of GLIADEL wafers on the neurocognitive functioning in patients with metastatic brain cancer.
Metastatic Brain Cancer
DRUG: GLIADEL
Rate of Deterioration in Neurocognitive Functioning (NF) at Month 12, NF was assessed as the performance of 3 neurocognitive domains:memory(MD),executive function(EFD), fine motor coordination(FMCD). For each domain, z-scores were derived from participant's scores in individual neurocognitive tests using an age-adjusted and education-adjusted normative distribution of scores from an unimpaired population.Individual z-scores from related tests were averaged to determine overall z-score.If a z-score average decreased from baseline by greater than or equal to(\>=)3 standard deviations(SD)in tests' normative age-adjusted distribution on 2 consecutive visits or decreased by \>=3 SD on last follow-up visit, participant were considered to have significant deterioration in their NF at time of the first decrease in z-score.Deterioration in NF:demonstrated deterioration for at least two of the three neurocognitive domains based on these changes from screening.Rate of deterioration in NF was measured as estimated percentage of participants using Kaplan-Meier method., Month 12|Number of Participants With Neurocognitive Domains Preserved at Month 2, Preservation of NF was defined as a decrease of \<=1 SD, any increase, or no change (0 SD) in z-score for each domain (memory domain, executive function domain, and fine motor coordination domain)., Month 2|Number of Participants With Neurocognitive Domains Preserved at Month 4, Preservation of NF was defined as a decrease of \<=1 SD, any increase, or no change (0 SD) in z-score for each domain (memory domain, executive function domain, and fine motor coordination domain)., Month 4|Number of Participants With Neurocognitive Domains Preserved at Month 6, Preservation of NF was defined as a decrease of \<=1 SD, any increase, or no change (0 SD) in z-score for each domain (memory domain, executive function domain, and fine motor coordination domain)., Month 6|Number of Participants With Neurocognitive Domains Preserved at Month 9, Preservation of NF was defined as a decrease of \<=1 SD, any increase, or no change (0 SD) in z-score for each domain (memory domain, executive function domain, and fine motor coordination domain)., Month 9|Number of Participants With Neurocognitive Domains Preserved at Month 12, Preservation of NF was defined as a decrease of less than or equal to (\<=) 1 SD, any increase, or no change (0 SD) in z-score for each domain (memory domain, executive function domain, and fine motor coordination domain)., Month 12
Percentage of Participants With Brain Tumor Recurrence (Local Recurrence, Distant Recurrence and Overall Recurrence), Up to Month 12 (from baseline until evidence of neurological deterioration, had a local recurrence, withdrawn, died, lost to follow-up, or the study was closed)|Time to Recurrence (Local, Distant and Overall), Up to Month 12 (from baseline until evidence of neurological deterioration, had a local recurrence, withdrawn, died, lost to follow-up, or the study was closed)|Correlation of Tumor Recurrence With Residual Mass Effect, Up to Month 12 (from baseline until evidence of neurological deterioration, had a local recurrence, withdrawn, died, lost to follow-up, or the study was closed)|Correlation of Tumor Recurrence (Local, Distant or Overall) With NF Domain Scores, The correlation between recurrence (local, distant or overall) \& NF was assessed by presenting change in NF domain scores (memory domain \[MD\], executive function domain \[EFD\], fine motor coordination domain \[FMCD\]) after tumor recurrence (Visits X, X+1, X+2, and X+3) compared to before tumor recurrence (Visit X-1). Here 'Visit X' refers to visit at which participants had tumor recurrence, Visit X-1 refers to visit immediately before the recurrence and X+1, X+2, X+3 refers to subsequent first, second \& third visit after the recurrence.NF domain z-scores were derived from participant's scores in individual neurocognitive tests using an age-adjusted \&education-adjusted normative distribution of scores from an unimpaired population. Individual z-scores from related tests were averaged to determine overall z-score for each of NF domains., Up to Month 12 (from baseline until evidence of neurological deterioration, had a local recurrence, withdrawn, died, lost to follow-up, or the study was closed)|Percentage of Participants With Neurologic Death, Neurologic Death was defined as death due to progression of neurologic disease., Up to Month 12 (from baseline until evidence of neurological deterioration, had a local recurrence, withdrawn, died, lost to follow-up, or the study was closed)|Time to Neurocognitive Deterioration, The time to neurocognitive deterioration was defined as the number of days between the date of study treatment and the date of neurocognitive deterioration based on NF assessment. This was assessed using Kaplan Meier method., Up to Month 12 (from baseline until evidence of neurological deterioration, had a local recurrence, withdrawn, died, lost to follow-up, or the study was closed)|Percentage of Participants With Neurocognitive Decline in NF by Severity (Memory Domain, Executive Function Domain, and Fine Motor Coordination Domain), Neurocognitive decline was defined as any decrease in NF scores less than (\<) 0 SD from baseline. Here, in category titles EFD represents Executive Function Domain and FMCD represents Fine Motor Coordination Domain., Months 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12
