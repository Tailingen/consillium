Femoral Bone Metastases
Bone is a common site of metastasis for a range of malignancies. Bone metastases have the potential to cause significant morbidity including pain, impairment of ambulation and reduced functional independence. Previous research has shown that pathological fractures are observed in 9 to 29 percent of patients with long bone metastases, and a high proportion of these require surgical intervention to relieve pain and restore function.

The goal of this study is to describe the clinical outcomes of patients with femoral metastases at high risk of pathological fracture. Patients referred for treatment of femoral metastases at high risk of fracture will be followed prospectively after undergoing with surgery (± post-operative radiotherapy), or radiotherapy alone. Patient and disease characteristics, ambulatory status and limb function will be documented before treatment. These Clinical outcomes of participants in each treatment group will be measured 6 weeks after treatment, and 3- and 6 months after enrolment, with particular reference to patient-reported outcomes relating to pain, ambulatory status, limb function and quality of life.

To describe the ambulatory status at 3 months by intervention (surgery ± radiotherapy, and radiotherapy alone group) - Ambulatory status, Patient will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months, 6 months
To describe patterns of management in patients with femoral metastases at high risk of pathological fracture - Perioperative Morbidity and Mortality for surgical patients; pain score and performance status; QOL, Patients will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months, 6 months|To describe patient and disease characteristics of major management groups (surgery ± radiotherapy, radiotherapy alone due to preference, radiotherapy alone due to co-morbid conditions) - Assessment of lower limb function, Patient will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months., 6 months
