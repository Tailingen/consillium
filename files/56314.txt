Structural Imaging and Cognitive Functions in Adult Stem Cell Transplant Recipients Treated With Chemotherapy Alone or in Combination With Radiotherapy
The purpose of this study is to learn about possible changes in brain anatomy and in thinking abilities, such as memory skills, in patients with cancer who receive treatment with chemotherapy alone or in combination with total body radiation before undergoing stem cell transplantation.

PROCEDURE: MRI and cognitive evaluation|PROCEDURE: MRI and cognitive evaluation|PROCEDURE: brain MRI study and a brief neuropsychological evaluation
assess changes in hippocampal volume & white matter integrity prospectively in adult ca pts who get treatment w/i chemotherapy alone or in combination with total body irradiation (TBI) before undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation., conclusion of the study
assess memory and executive functions prospectively in these patients. We will investigate whether there is an association between structural brain changes and cognitive performance., conclusion of the study
