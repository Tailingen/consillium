Tusamitamab Ravtansine (SAR408701) in Combination With Ramucirumab in Pretreated Participants With Gastric Cancer
Primary Objectives:

Part 1: to confirm the recommended tusamitamab ravtansine loading dose Q2W in combination with ramucirumab in advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma population

Part 2: to assess the antitumor activity of tusamitamab ravtansine loading dose Q2W in combination with ramucirumab in advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess safety and tolerability
* To assess durability of response (DOR)
* To assess progression-free survival (PFS)
* To assess the disease control rate (DCR)
* To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK)
* To assess the immunogenicity
Adenocarcinoma Gastric|Gastrooesophageal Cancer
DRUG: Ramucirumab (CYRAMZA®)|DRUG: Tusamitamab ravtansine (SAR408701)
Part 1: Number of Participants With Study-Drug Related Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), The following AEs occurred during the first 2 cycles of treatment, unless due to disease progression or to a cause obviously unrelated to study drug, were considered DLTs:

* Grade 4 neutropenia for 7 or more consecutive days.
* Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia complicated by fever (temperature \>=38.5 degree Celsius on more than 1 occasion) or microbiologically or radiographically documented infection.
* Grade \>=3 thrombocytopenia associated with clinically significant bleeding requiring clinical intervention.
* Grade 4 non-hematologic AE.
* Grade \>=3 keratopathy. In addition, any other AE that the Investigators and sponsor deemed to be dose limiting, regardless of its grade, was also considered as DLT., From Cycle 1 Day 1 to Cycle 2 Day 14; approximately 28 days|Objective Response Rate (ORR), The ORR was defined as percentage of participants with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best overall response (BOR) determined per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1. The CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. The PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Tumor assessments performed at Baseline (Day 1), then every 6 weeks (±7 days) thereafter, approximately 88.1 weeks
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: resulted in death or was life-threatening or required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or resulted in persistent disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAE was defined as AEs that developed, worsened, or became serious during the treatment-emergent period., From the first study drug administration (Day 1) up to 30 days after the last study drug administration, approximately 92.4 weeks|Duration of Response (DOR), The DOR was defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) determined per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occured first. The PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study., Tumor assessments performed at Baseline (Day 1), then every 6 weeks (±7 days) thereafter, approximately 88.1 weeks|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The PFS was defined as the time from the first study drug administration to the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever came first as per RECIST v1.1., Tumor assessments performed at Baseline (Day 1), then every 6 weeks (±7 days) thereafter, approximately 88.1 weeks|Disease Control Rate (DCR), The DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved confirmed CR, confirmed PR or stable disease (SD) as per RECIST v1.1. The SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage from the baseline study to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study., Tumor assessments performed at Baseline (Day 1), then every 6 weeks (±7 days) thereafter, approximately 88.1 weeks|Individual Observed Predose Concentrations (Ctrough) of Tusamitamab Ravtansine, Blood samples were collected for the measurement of Ctrough of tusamitamab ravtansine., Pre-infusion on Cycle 2 Day 1|Individual Observed Predose Concentrations (Ctrough) of Ramucirumab, Blood samples were collected for the measurement of Ctrough of concentrations of ramucirumab., Pre-infusion on Cycle 2 Day 1|Number of Participants With Antitherapeutic Antibodies (ATAs) Against Tusamitamab Ravtansine, Blood samples were collected to assess the presence of ATA against tusamitamab ravtansine in plasma from all participants. ATA incidence was defined as the number of participants found to have seroconverted (treatment-induced ATAs) or boosted their pre-existing ATA response (treatment-boosted ATAs) at any time after first study drug administration., Upto 92.1 weeks
34 weeks (up to 4 weeks for screening, a median of 18 weeks for treatment, and a median of 12 weeks for end-of-treatment assessments and the safety follow-up visit).
