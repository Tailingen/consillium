The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerance, pharmacokinetic characteristics, ablative status, and immune response characteristics of the therapeutic BCG in postoperative adjuvant therapy in subjects with moderate and high-risk non-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

The study consisted of three phases: screening period, administration observation period and safety follow-up period. subjects will be treated with 120 mg BCG.
