Pilot Study of Transcranial Stimulation (tDCS)to Relieve Neuropathic Pain in Cancer Patients
This is a pilot study designed to collect preliminary data on safety and efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to relieve pain in cancer patients who developed neuropathic pain in the affected area after a surgical intervention, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy to treat the disease.
Pain
DEVICE: non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
Pain Intensity, Measured on the 11 point numerical paid rating scale with anchor points 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain possible. The outcome measure "Pain intensity" assessed as a change between baseline and post tDCS stimulation (after stimulation day 5). The calculated change in the range of positive numbers indicates decreased pain intensity post-treatment (eg. baseline 6; post treatment 4; change +2 indicating decrease of pain intensity by 2 points). Similarly, change in range of negative numbers indicates a worsening of pain intensity (eg. baseline 6; post treatment 8; change -2)., Assessed at baseline and post tDCS stimulation day 5
This is a pilot study that aims to determine the effect of repetitive tDCS stimulation, performed on five consecutive days at intensity of 2 mA, on pain and somatosensory abnormalities in patients with neuropathic pain that followed surgical, radiation or chemotherapeutic treatment, and to evaluate safety of tDCS in the same model.
