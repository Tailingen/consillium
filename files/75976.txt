Combined Postoperative Radiotherapy With Kidney Sparing Surgery for Locally Advanced High-risk Ureteral Cancer
In this study, we propose to conduct an ambispective study to analyze the safety of preserved renal unit surgery combined with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with limited stage ureteral cancer with high risk factors, and the efficacy analysis compared with traditional radical surgery. It is hoped that a treatment method that preserves patients' renal function to improve the tolerance of subsequent drug therapy without decreasing the effect of tumor treatment can be achieved in patients with high-risk factors.
