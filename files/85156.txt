A Study of Atezolizumab Plus Tiragolumab in Combination With Paclitaxel and Cisplatin Compared With Paclitaxel and Cisplatin as First-Line Treatment in Participants With Unresectable Locally Advanced, Unresectable Recurrent, or Metastatic Esophageal Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus tiragolumab in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin (PC) compared with atezolizumab matching placebo plus tiragolumab matching placebo plus PC as first-line treatment in participants with unresectable locally advanced, unresectable recurrent, or metastatic esophageal carcinoma (EC). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following treatment regimens during induction phase:

Arm A: Atezolizumab plus Tiragolumab and PC Arm B: Atezolizumab placebo plus Tiragolumab placebo and PC Following the induction phase, participants will continue maintenance therapy with either atezolizumab plus tiragolumab (Arm A) or atezolizumab matching placebo plus tiragolumab matching placebo (Arm B).

Overall Survival (OS), From randomization to death from any cause (up to approximately 35 months)|Independent Review Facility (IRF)-Assessed Progression-Free Survival (PFS), From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 35 months)
Investigator-Assessed PFS, From randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 35 months)|IRF-Assessed Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR), From randomization up to approximately 35 months|Investigator-Assessed Confirmed ORR, From randomization up to approximately 35 months|IRF-Assessed Duration of Objective Response (DOR), From the first occurrence of a documented confirmed objective response to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 35 months)|Investigator-Assessed DOR, From the first occurrence of a documented confirmed objective response to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 35 months)|Time to Confirmed Deterioration (TTCD) in Participant-Reported Physical Functioning, Role Functioning and Global Health Status (GHS)/Quality of Life (QoL) as Measured by EORTC QLQ-C30, Clinically meaningful changes in physical functioning, role functioning, global health status (GHS)/QoL as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-Core 30 Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). EORTC QLQ-C30 is a self-reported measure, consisting of 30 questions that assess 5 aspects of participants functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), GHS and QoL, and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties) within the previous week. Functioning and symptoms items are scored on a 4-point scale: 1=Not at all, 2=A little, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Very much. GHS and QoL items are scored on a 7-point scale: 1=Very poor, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7=Excellent. Scores will be linearly transformed to a range of 0 to 100, with higher scores (i.e. closer to 100) reflecting better functioning, better GHS/QoL, and worse symptoms., From randomization until the first confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration (up to approximately 35 months)|TTCD in Participant-Reported Dysphagia as Measured by EORTC QLQ-OES18, Clinically meaningful changes in dysphagia as measured by the EORTC Quality of Life-Esophageal Cancer, Module 18 Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-OES18). EORTC QLQ-OES18 is a modular supplement to the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire for use in participants with esophageal cancer. EORTC QLQ-OES18 consists of 4 multiple-item scale (dysphagia, eating, reflux, and pain) and 6 single items (trouble swallowing saliva, choked when swallowing, dry mouth, trouble with taste, trouble with coughing, and trouble talking) with a recall period of the previous week. Each symptom item is scored on a 4-point scale: 1=Not at all, 2=A little, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Very much. Scores will be linearly transformed to a range of 0 to 100, with higher transformed scores (i.e. closer to 100) reflecting worse symptoms., From randomization until the first confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration (up to approximately 35 months)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Up to approximately 35 months|Minimum Serum Concentration (Cmin) of Tiragolumab, Cycle 1 (cycle=21 days), Day 1: predose, 0.5 hour (h) postdose; Cycles 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, Day 1: predose and at treatment discontinuation (TD) visit (up to approximately 35 months)|Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Tiragolumab, Cycle 1 (cycle=21 days), Day 1: predose, 0.5h postdose; Cycles 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16: Day 1: predose and at TD visit (up to approximately 35 months)|Cmin of Atezolizumab, Cycle 1 (cycle=21 days): Day 1 (predose, 0.5 h postdose); Cycles 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16: Day 1 (predose) and at TD visit (up to approximately 35 months)|Cmax of Atezolizumab, Cycle 1 (cycle=21 days): Day 1 (predose, 0.5 h postdose); Cycles 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16: Day 1 (predose) and at TD visit (up to approximately 35 months)|Percentage of Participants With Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs) to Tiragolumab, Predose on Day 1 of Cycles (cycle=21 days) 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 16 and at TD visit (up to approximately 35 months)|Percentage of Participants With ADAs to Atezolizumab, Predose on Day 1 of Cycles (cycle=21 days) 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 16 and at TD visit (up to approximately 35 months)
