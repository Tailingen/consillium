Neoadjuvant Sintilimab in Combination With Carboplatin and Nab-paclitaxel in Resectable Oral Cavity or Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to look at the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in combination with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel in patients with oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who are about to undergo surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as sintilimab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving sintilimab, carboplatin, and nab-paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
