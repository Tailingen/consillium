A Post Market Clinical Follow-up Study on Biomet Microfixation HTR PEKK (Midface), Facial & Mandibular Plates.
This study will address medical devices manufactured by Biomet Microfixation (d.b.a. Zimmer Biomet) designed for fixation and stabilization of the facial and mandibular skeleton.
Tumor|Facial Fracture|Mandibular Fractures|Fibrous Dysplasia|Osteoma of Mandibular Condyle|Neuroma|Cleft Face|Hemifacial Microsomia|Treacher Collins Syndrome|Miller Syndrome|Nager Syndrome
DEVICE: Titanium Facial Plates|DEVICE: Titanium Mandibular Plates|DEVICE: Add-on Condyle|DEVICE: HTR-PEKK
Survival of implant at 1 year post operative, Frequency and incidence of clinical and radiological adverse events related to the implantation of the subject device leading to removal, 1 year
Infection rate at 30 days post operative, Implant site infection rate, 30 days|Allergic reaction related to implant material, Clinical and/or pathological assessment of implant allergic reactions leading to removal of the device in the first 2 years post implantation, up to 2 years
The subject devices are:

* plates, screws, and primary instruments from the Biomet Microfixation Facial Plating System, including plates to be specifically used in orthognathic procedures
* plates, screws and primary instruments for the Mandibular Plating System, including and a device intended to temporarily restore the functionality of the temporomandibular joint for patients whose natural condyle has to be resected, subsequent to a tumor ablation ("Add-On Condyle") Additionally, a third device intended for the replacement of bony voids in the facial skeleton will be evaluated in this trial (HTR-PEKK- facial application).
