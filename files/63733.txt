Nutrition Intervention in Treating Women With Breast Cancer
RATIONALE: Dietary fat may be involved in the growth of cancer cells. Restricting dietary fat may help fight cancer.

PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of a low fat diet in treating postmenopausal women who have stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer that has been completely removed by surgery.

OTHER: educational intervention|PROCEDURE: therapeutic dietary intervention
OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether dietary fat reduction will effectively prolong disease-free and overall survival in women surgically treated for early stage breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant therapy with or without either tamoxifen, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF), doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (AC), fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (FAC, CAF), or AC followed by paclitaxel. II. Evaluate whether differences in the lipid profile are associated with dietary group assignment and dietary fat.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by center, nodal status, ER status, and type of adjuvant chemotherapy. The first group receives intensive dietary intervention for reduction of total fat intake to 15% of calories, with repeated individual and group counseling sessions. The second group receives USDA/DHHS dietary guidelines and minimal intervention. All patients who are estrogen receptor positive receive concurrent therapy with tamoxifen; cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (CMF) followed by tamoxifen; doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by tamoxifen; fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide (FAC, CAF) followed by tamoxifen; or AC, paclitaxel followed by tamoxifen. Patients are followed annually throughout the study.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,500 women will be accrued for this study.
