The goal of this study is to create a data registry to capture clinical, pathologic, and molecular data/outcomes for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who undergo live donor liver transplantation.

Our primary outcome of interest was the OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) of patients who underwent LDLT at our center.
