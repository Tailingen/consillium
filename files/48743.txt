Scaling CRC Screening Through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE)
This study will test the effectiveness of mailing fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) in increasing colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in U.S. adults ages 45-75. We are implementing this study in two age groups, 45-49 years and 50-75 years.

Proportion of Subjects Who Returned a Completed Mailed FIT at 60 Days, The proportion of subjects who received study Intervention (Age Group - 50-75) and returned a completed FIT per electronic health record review., Up to 60 days after randomization|Proportion of Subjects Who Completed a Follow-up (Diagnostic) Colonoscopy, The proportion of subjects who received study Intervention (Age Group 50-75) and did not receive study information (Usual Care only - Age Group 50-75), who had a positive (abnormal) FIT/FOBT result, and for whom colonoscopy was deemed to be clinically appropriate by the subject's provider, who completed follow-up (diagnostic) colonoscopy per electronic health record review., Up to 6 months after diagnostic colonoscopy referral date|Number of Subject Colorectal Carcinoma (CRC) and Advanced Adenomas Detected at 12 Months, Number of CRCs and advanced adenomas detected among subjects who received study Intervention (Age Group 50-75) and subjects who did not receive study intervention (Usual Care only - Age Group 50-75) per electronic health record review., Up to 12 months after screening or diagnostic colonoscopy result date|Number of Days From CRC Diagnosis to the Date of Evaluation for CRC Treatment, Number of days from CRC diagnosis to the date of evaluation for CRC treatment among subjects who received study Intervention (Age Group 50-75) and subjects who did not receive study intervention (Usual Care - Age Group 50-75) using electronic health record data to ascertain the dates of CRC diagnosis and evaluation for CRC treatment., Up to 12 months after CRC diagnosis|Number of Subjects Who Received Referral for Cancer Treatment, Number of subjects who received study Intervention (Age Group 50-75) and did not receive intervention (Age Group 50-75) who received referral for cancer treatment among individuals diagnosed with CRC per electronic health record review., Up to 6 months after cancer diagnosis date|Number of Subjects Mailed FITs Completed After Two Rounds of Annual FIT Outreach, "Number of annual FIT screenings completed (0, 1, or 2) by subjects who received Intervention (Age Group 50-75) after two annual rounds of mailed FIT outreach per electronic health record review., Round 1 time frame: at 6 months after randomization; Round 2 time frame: at 6 months after determining eligibility for Round 2|Incremental Cost of Each Additional Patient Screened in the Intervention Arm Compared to Usual Care (Trial - Age Group 50-75), Comparison of the programmatic costs incurred and number of subjects screened in Arm 1(Trial Mailed FIT Intervention - Age Group 50-75) compared to Arm 2 (Trial Usual Care - Age Group 50-75), measured as cost of intervention minus the cost of usual care, divided by the number screened in Arm 1 minus the number screened in Arm 2. Intervention costs will be assessed using periodic episodes of direct observation of mailed FIT outreach activities, time logs maintained by the intervention team, and assembly of administrative data capturing non-personnel/non-labor expenditures, such as costs associated with materials printing, FIT processing, and mailing costs. Usual care costs will be assessed using a combination of clinic observations and interviews with staff., Through study completion, up to 36 months after randomization|The Proportion of Subjects, Ages 45-49, Who Are Current With CRC Screening, The proportion of subjects in Arm 3 (Sub-study Mailed FIT Intervention Enhanced Envelope - Age Group 45-49) and Arm 4 (Sub-study Mailed FIT Active Comparator Envelope - Age Group 45-49) who are current with any CRC screening compared to baseline, using any of the screening modalities recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (FIT, fecal occult blood test \[FOBT\], FIT-DNA, colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy with FIT, CT colonography) per electronic health record review., Up to 6 months after randomization|Proportion of Subjects, Ages 45-49, Who Completed Mailed FIT at 60 Days, The proportion of subjects in Arm 3 (Intervention Enhanced Envelope - Age Group 45-49) compared to subjects in Arm 4 (Intervention Active Comparator Envelope - Age Group 45-49) who returned a completed FIT., 60 days after randomization|Proportion of Subjects Who Completed a Follow up (Diagnostic) Colonoscopy, The proportion of subjects in Arm 3 (Sub-study Mailed FIT Intervention Enhanced Envelope - Age Group 45-49) and Arm 4 (Sub-study Mailed FIT Active Comparator Plain Envelope - Age Group 45-40) with a positive (abnormal) FIT/FOBT result for whom colonoscopy is deemed to be clinically appropriate by the subject's provider who completes a follow-up (diagnostic) colonoscopy per electronic health record review., Up to 6 months after abnormal FIT result date
Trial (Age Group 50-75) This randomized controlled trial assesses the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of mailing FITs from a central location to patients served by FQHCs. Subjects are randomly selected and assigned to receive either a mailed FIT intervention (Arm 1: Trial Mailed FIT Intervention - Age Group 50-75) or usual care (Arm 2: Trial Usual Care - Age Group 50-75). To assess United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for annual screening, we will mail subjects one round of FIT per year for up to two years.

Sub-study (Age Group 45-49) A sub-study assesses the effectiveness of mailing FITs from a central location to patients who are 45-49 years of age and newly eligible for CRC screening. The sub-study also assesses the impact of varying the appearance of the FIT packet mailing envelope on FIT return. All eligible patients from one FQHC clinic site are randomly assigned to receive either a mailed FIT intervention that includes an enhanced mailing envelope (Arm 3: Sub-study Mailed FIT Intervention Enhanced Envelope - Age Group 45-49) or a plain envelope (Arm 4: Sub-study Mailed FIT Active Comparator Plain Envelope - Age Group 45-49).

The Trial (Age Group 50-75) and the Sub-study (Age Group 45-49) also assess the effectiveness of delivering patient navigation from a central location to facilitate follow up colonoscopy for patients with a positive (abnormal) FIT result.
