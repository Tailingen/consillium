Metformin in Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving metformin in combination with radiation therapy is more effective than radiation therapy alone. In this study, participants will receive either metformin or a placebo. A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study drug has any real effect.

This is an investigational study. Metformin is FDA approved for the treatment of diabetes. Its use in this study to be given with radiation therapy to treat lung cancer is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

Up to 70 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
Lung Cancer
DRUG: Metformin|OTHER: Placebo|RADIATION: Stereotactic body Radiotherapy (SBRT)
RECIST and PERCIST Tumor Response, The primary objective is the effect of metformin on response in NSCLC patients treated with hypofractionated RT. All patients will receive FDG-PET/CT scan at baseline (prior to metformin start), prior to RT and at 6 months (+/- 30 days) following RT. PET/CT imaging using \[18F\]-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG), using a standard approved radiopharmaceutical dose and administration selected by the nuclear medicine physician (120 min). Response will be determined at 6 months post-treatment via relative change from pre-treatment tumor by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) by complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) and PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) by stable metabolic disease (SMD), progressive metabolic disease (PMD) and complete metabolic response(CMR)., From baseline (prior to metformin start) to Post-Radiotherapy (RT) Treatment, assessed up to 6 months
