A Study of LY2940680 in Japanese Participants With Advanced Cancers
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of LY2940680 up to the global recommended dose in Japanese participants with advanced solid cancers.
Neoplasm Metastasis
DRUG: LY2940680
Number of Participants With LY2940680 Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT), DLT was defined as an AE during Cycle 1 that is possibly related to the study drug and meets any one of the following criteria based on NCI CTCAE,version 4.0): Grade(Gr) 3 nonhematological toxicity(tox) with exceptions for made for nausea(ns),vomiting(vm),constipation(cp),diarrhea(dr),fatigue(ft),anorexia(an),alopecia or electrolyte-abnormality(eab) that is manageable with appropriate care.If \>Gr 3 ns,vm,cp,dr,ft,an,or eab persists for\>2 days with maximal supportive intervention,the event was declared a DLT.Transient(≤5 days) Gr 3 liver enzyme elevations,without evidence of other hepatic injury.Gr 3 thrombocytopenia(throm) requiring platelet transfusion or Gr 4 throm.Gr 4 neutropenia of \>5 days duration.Febrile neutropenia(ANC\<1,000/mm3 with a single temperature(temp) of \>38.3 degrees C or a sustained temp of ≥38 degrees C for more than one hour).Tox requiring dose omissions of \>5 days or significant \& deemed by the primary investigator(PI) \& sponsor(sp) to be dose limiting ., Cycle 1 (28 Days)
Pharmacokinetics (PK): Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY2940680 and a Major Metabolite of LY2940680 (LSN3185556), Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY2940680 and a Major Metabolite of LY2940680 (LSN3185556)., Cycle1 Day1: Predose, 0.5,1,2,4, 6, 8, 10-12 hours; Cycle 1 Day15: Predose, 0.5,1,2,4, 6, 8, 10-12 hours|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration Time Curve From 0 to 24 Hours (AUC[0-24]) of LY2940680 and a Major Metabolite of LSN3185556, Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration time Curve From 0 to 24 Hours (AUC\[0-24\]) of LY2940680 and a Major Metabolite of LSN3185556., Cycle1 Day1: Predose, 0.5,1,2,4, 6, 8, 10-12 hours; Cycle 1 Day15: Predose, 0.5,1,2,4, 6, 8, 10-12 hours|Number of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (Overall Response Rate[ORR]), Response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and all target and non-target lymph nodes were non-pathological or normal in size (\<10 millimeter \[mm\] short axis). PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR calculated as: (sum of the number of participants with PRs and CRs) divided by (number of evaluable participants) multiplied by 100., Baseline Until Disease Progression or Death Due to Any Cause (Up to 29 Months)|Pharmacodynamic (PD): Percentage Change From Baseline in Gene Expression Level of Hedgehog (Hh) Regulated Genes (Gli1) in Skin, Percentage Change From Baseline in Gene Expression Level of Hedgehog (Hh) Regulated Genes (Gli1) in Skin., Baseline, Cycle 1 Day15
