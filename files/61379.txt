Spectroscopy From Duodenum
Purpose of this study is to understand the clinical feasibility of duodenal spectroscopy to adenocarcinoma patients.
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
OTHER: Spectroscopy device
The spectral data of the normal cohort and UICC stage II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cohort, To clarify that there is the statistically-significant difference between two cohorts., 1 year
The sensitivity and specificity to detect UICC stage II pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma among all participants., A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is evaluated. A cut-off is then chosen from this ROC curve to maximize both sensitivity and specificity., 1 year
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the most lethal of all major cancers with a five year survival rate of 5 %. While stage I and II tumors leads to an improvement in survival, almost all PCs are currently diagnosed at more advanced non-resectable stages since minimally invasive technique which is capable of screening early-stage PC does not exist. Serum CA19-9 is not recommended as a screening technique because of its low sensitivity and specificity. Imaging modalities such as MRI, CT, EUS and ERCP are more accurate but are not appropriate screening tools due to their high cost, discomfort and complications. Therefore, there is a strong demand for a screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity which is highly acceptable for the patient. The investigators would like to look at the spectroscopy technique for pancreatic cancer diagnosis via an upper endoscopy. A definite diagnosis of the patient is made with histology, cytology or imaging diagnosis. Therefore this study can be positioned as a feasibility study.
