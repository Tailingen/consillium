Artificial Intelligence-supported Reading Versus Standard Double Reading for the Interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Detection of Local Recurrence for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: a Randomised Controlled Multicenter Study
The aim of this randomized controlled study is to investigate whether the previously developed artificial intelligence model can triage post-radiotherapy magnetic resonance images of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and assist radiologists in their interpretation.
