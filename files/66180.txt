Study of NMS-03597812 in Adult Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The aim of PERKA-812-003 study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of treatment with NMS-03597812 as single agent in Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (R/R AML) patients who have exhausted standard treatment, including a subset of patients with TP53 mutations. It is anticipated that combination with venetoclax will be further evaluated following a future protocol amendment, once the Recommended Range Dose (RDR) as single agent has been defined.
