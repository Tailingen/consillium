The Efficacy and Safety of Temozolomide in SDH-deficient GIST
The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of temozolomide in SDH deficiency GIST patients.
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors
DRUG: Temozolomide capsule
Objective respone rate in SDH deficiency wild type GIST, complet response+partial response defined by RECIST v1.1, up to 4 years
Wild type GISTs are less responsive to imatinib with a response rate of 23.1-44.6% and a median progressiion-free survival of 12.3-12.8 months. The efficacy of imatinib is limited in particular in SDH deficienctGIST with a reported response of 2%. Therefore, the development of a new therapeutic agents is urgently needed.

Recently, a study of TKI-resistant SDH-deficient preclinical model showed that temozolomide, an alkylating agent, promotes DNA damage in tumor cells, leading to tumor cell killing. In a retrospective analysis, 2 out of 5 SDH deficient GIST patients treated with temozolomide showed partial response, suggesting its efficacy in this patient population.

Based on these findings,The goal of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of temozolomide in SDH deficiency GIST patients. In addition, for exploratory purposes, aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of temozolomide in KIT and PDGFRA wild-type GIST without SDH deficiency.
