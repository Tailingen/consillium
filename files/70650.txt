Improving Sleep in Gynecologic Cancer Survivors
This purpose of this study is to learn about how to provide treatment to gynecologic cancer survivors who have difficulty sleeping.
Sleep Disturbance|Gynecologic Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Sleep restriction|BEHAVIORAL: Stimulus control|BEHAVIORAL: Systematic light exposure
Changes in objectively-measured sleep outcomes from baseline to immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention, Wrist actigraphy, Baseline (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), immediately after the intervention (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), 3-months post-intervention (Part 2 participants only)|Changes in subjectively-reported sleep quality from baseline to immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention, Subjectively-reported sleep quality over the past 7 days will be measured with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance questionnaire. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more of the underlying construct., Baseline (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), immediately after the intervention (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), 3-months post-intervention (Part 2 participants only)|Changes in perceived impairment during wake associated with sleep problems from baseline to immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention, Perceived impairment during wake associated with sleep problems over the past seven days will be measured with the PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment questionnaire. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more of the underlying construct., Baseline (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), immediately after the intervention (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), 3-months post-intervention (Part 2 participants only)
Changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) from baseline to immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention, The 27-item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) will measure HRQOL., Baseline (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), immediately after the intervention (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), 3-months post-intervention (Part 2 participants only)|Changes in overall symptom burden from baseline to immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention, The 32-item Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) will evaluate symptom burden., Baseline (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), immediately after the intervention (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), 3-months post-intervention (Part 2 participants only)|Changes in symptoms of depression from baseline to immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention, Symptoms of depression over the past seven days with be measured with the PROMIS Depression questionnaire. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more of the underlying construct., Baseline (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), immediately after the intervention (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), 3-months post-intervention (Part 2 participants only)|Changes in symptoms of anxiety from baseline to immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention, Symptoms of anxiety over the past seven days with be measured with the PROMIS Anxiety questionnaire. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more of the underlying construct., Baseline (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), immediately after the intervention (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), 3-months post-intervention (Part 2 participants only)|Changes in fatigue from baseline to immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention, Fatigue over the past seven days with be measured with the PROMIS Fatigue questionnaire. Raw scores will be converted to T-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Higher scores indicate more of the underlying construct., Baseline (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), immediately after the intervention (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), 3-months post-intervention (Part 2 participants only)
Changes in circadian activity rhythms from baseline to immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention, Wrist actigraphy, Baseline (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), immediately after the intervention (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), 3-months post-intervention (Part 2 participants only)|Changes in urinary 6-Sulfatoxymelatonin from baseline to immediately after the intervention and 3-months post-intervention, The night prior to each assessment participants will collect overnight urine to enable analysis of urinary 6-Sulfatoxymelatonin, Baseline (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), immediately after the intervention (Part 1 and Part 2 participants), 3-months post-intervention (Part 2 participants only)
This study has two parts.

In Part 1, 15 gynecologic cancer survivors will receive three candidate intervention components known to reduce sleep disturbance (i.e., sleep restriction, stimulus control, systematic light exposure) simultaneously for six weeks. Participants will then complete semi-structured individual interviews to provide feedback about barriers to and facilitators of intervention adherence. Results of Part 1 will inform the design and delivery of the candidate components in Part 2.

In Part 2, a 2\^3 full factorial design will be followed to randomize 80 gynecologic cancer survivors to one of eight six-week intervention conditions reflecting all possible combinations of the three candidate intervention components.
