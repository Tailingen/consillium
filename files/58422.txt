SCH 727965 in Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (P04717AM2)(TERMINATED)
Participants with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) will be randomized to SCH 727965 or gemtuzumab ozogamicin. All participants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) will receive SCH 727965. Part 1 of the study will determine the activity of SCH 727965 treatment in participants with AML and participants with ALL. Part 2 of the study will determine the activity of SCH 727965 treatment in participants with AML who experienced disease progression after standard treatment with gemtuzumab ozogamicin during Part 1.
