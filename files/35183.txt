Safety and Preliminary Efficacy Study of MRG001 in Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)
This study consists of two parts. Phase Ia is a dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MRG001. Phase Ib is a dose expansion study to assess the preliminary efficacy of MRG001 in patients with CD20-positive relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL at the confirmed RP2D. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity of MRG001 will be evaluated in both parts.
Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)
DRUG: MRG001
Adverse Events (AEs), Any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug., Baseline to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), The highest dose confirmed wherein â‰¤ 1/6 of patients in a treatment cohort experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) within 21 days after the first dose of study treatment., DLT will be evaluated during the first treatment cycle (Day 1-21).|Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D), The dose level of MRG001 recommended for further phase II clinical studies., Baseline to study completion (up to 15 months).
PK parameter: Concentration-time curve, Plot of drug concentration changing with time after drug administration., Baseline to 90 days after the last dose of study treatment.|Immunogenicity, The proportion of patients with positive ADA immunogenicity results., Baseline to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects with CR and PR., Baseline to study completion (up to 15 months)|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the duration from the initial recording of objective disease response to the first onset of tumor progression, or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 15 months)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) after treatment., Baseline to study completion (up to 15 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to the onset of tumor progression or death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 15 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the duration from the start of treatment to death of any cause., Baseline to study completion (up to 15 months)
