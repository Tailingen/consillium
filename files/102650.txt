A Study of Vemurafenib Adjuvant Therapy in Participants With Surgically Resected Cutaneous BRAF-Mutant Melanoma
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of vemurafenib in participants with completely resected, cutaneous BRAF mutation-positive melanoma at high risk for recurrence. Participants will be enrolled in two separate cohorts: Cohort 1 will include participants with completely resected Stage IIC, IIIA (participants with one or more nodal metastasis greater than \[\>\] 1 millimeter \[mm\] in diameter), or IIIB cutaneous melanoma, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Classification, Version 7; Cohort 2 will include participants with Stage IIIC cutaneous melanoma, as defined by this classification scheme. Within each cohort, participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive vemurafenib or matching placebo over a 52-week period.
Melanoma
DRUG: Vemurafenib|DRUG: Placebo
Disease-Free Survival (DFS) as Assessed Using Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CT), DFS was defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first local, regional, or distant melanoma recurrence, occurrence of new primary melanoma, or death from any cause., From randomization until the date of the first local, regional, or distant melanoma recurrence, occurrence of new primary melanoma, or death from any cause (up to the April 17, 2017 data cut-off, approximately 4.5 years)
Distant Metastasis-Free Survival (DMFS) as Assessed Using Contrast-Enhanced MRI or Contrast Enhanced CT, DMFS was defined as the time from randomization until the date of diagnosis of distant (i.e. non-locoregional) metastases or death from any cause., From randomization until the date of diagnosis of distant (i.e., non-locoregional) metastases or death from any cause (up to the April 17, 2017 data cut-off, approximately 4.5 years)|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of death from any cause., From randomization until the date of death from any cause (up until 13-July-2018, approximately 6 years)|Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events, An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution., From randomization up to study completion or discontinuation (up until 13-July-2018, approximately 6 years)|Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 30-Item Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) Score, European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-Item Quality of Life Questionnaire assesses 8 symptoms, function, financial difficulties, and a global health status/health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Most questions use a 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much';2 questions use a 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale. Higher scores for the function and HRQoL represent higher levels of functioning and HRQoL, higher scores for the symptom represent higher levels of symptoms/problems, higher score for financial difficulty represent higher level of perceived financial burden of treatment. Changes of 5-10 points are considered to represent a minimally important difference to participants. A positive value means an increase, and negative value means a decrease in score at the indicated time-point relative to the score at baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1)., Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22 of Cycle 1;Day 1, Day 15 of Cycle 2;Day 1 Cycles 3-13;end of treatment(up to 13 months);every 13 weeks thereafter until recurrence or occurrence of a new primary melanoma (up to 17-Apr-17 data cut-off,approximately 4.5 years)|Plasma Concentration of Vemurafenib, Pre-morning dose (0 hour [hr]) and 1 to 4 hrs post-dose on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1; pre-morning dose (0 hr) on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 2; pre-morning dose (0 hr) on Day 1 of Cycles 3-13; at end of treatment (up to 13 months)
