A Study of CSL362 in Patients With CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia Currently in Remission
This is a first in human, prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of repeat doses of CSL362.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
BIOLOGICAL: CSL362
Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs), Number of subjects reporting any AEs and the severity of those AEs., From the first treatment (Day 1) up to approximately Day 106|Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation, Number of participants with DLT.

Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as:

* A non-hematological toxicity grade 3 or worse.
* A hematological toxicity grade 3 that does not recover to baseline within 14 days.
* A hematological toxicity grade 4 or worse according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.0., From the first treatment (Day 1) up to approximately Day 106
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameters, PK Parameters comprise:

* Area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) from time point zero (before dosing):

  * to the time point at which the analyte first returns to baseline (AUC0-last)
  * to a meaningful time after infusion (AUC0-y)
  * extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-âˆž).
* The maximum observed serum concentration (Cmax).
* First time to reach maximum concentration in serum (Tmax).
* Terminal serum half-life (t 1/2), Before each infusion and: at 6 time points within a week after infusion 1, at 1 time point within a week after infusions 2 to 5, at 5 time points within a week after infusion 6, and once at the final visit, approximately 5 weeks after infusion 6|Number of subjects developing antibodies against CSL362, From the first treatment (Day 1) up to approximately Day 106
