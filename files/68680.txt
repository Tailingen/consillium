Study of Neoantigen mRNA Vaccines in Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of treating pancreatic cancer with surgery to remove cancerour tissue, followed by camrelizumab and a personalized cancer mRNA vaccines.
Pancreatic Cancer
PROCEDURE: Surgery|DRUG: Camrelizumab|BIOLOGICAL: SJ-Neo006|DRUG: Gemcitabine+Abraxane
Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), To observe and evaluate the safety of Neoantigen mRNA vaccine combined with Camrelizumab, for the number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., 2 years
Disease control rate (DCR), The efficacy of Neoantigen mRNA vaccine combined with Camrelizumab by tumor lesion recurrence cycle at different time., 3,6,12 months
The first purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of treating pancreatic cancer with surgery to remove cancerour tissue.

Following with camrelizumab and a personalized Neoantigen mRNA Vaccines, and then with chemotherapy.
