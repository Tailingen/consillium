Radiation During Osimertinib Treatment: a Safety and Efficacy Cohort Study
Study Objectives are:

To assess the safety of osimertinib treatment continuation during irradiation therapy for palliation or oligoprogressive disease by assessment of grade 3-5 AEs during and after concomitant osimertinib and irradiation of tumor sites.

To assess the efficacy of osimertinib treatment continuation during irradiation therapy for palliation or oligoprogressive disease.

To investigate Quality of Life during and after irradiation therapy and concomitant osimertinib.

Many patients with advanced lung cancer require palliative irradiation of metastases to relieve symptoms and prevent local complications. In addition, guidelines recommend local treatment (including radiation) for oligoprogression during TKI treatment. Clinicians are faced with the decision whether to continue TKI therapy during irradiation, a practice for which there is little data, or to interrupt the oral treatment for the duration of radiation, which may lead to progression of non-irradiated lesions. For erlotinib and gefitinib there is some data indicating that cranial irradiation as well as stereotactic body irradiation may be carried out safely without discontinuing or interrupting the TKI treatment. Although some small case series report on a PFS benefit with irradiation during osimertinib treatment, there is very limited data on the safety of osimertinib during irradiation, and no evidence-based recommendations around stopping osimertinib for irradiation.

The hypothesis is that osimertinib can be continued without interruption during irradiation of individual tumor lesions in the setting of oligoprogressive NSCLC, or for local symptom control of primary tumor or metastasis.
