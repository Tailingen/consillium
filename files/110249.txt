Thiol Disulfide Balance in Cervix Cancer
The aim of this research is to evaluate thiol-disulfide balance in cervix cancer patients

total oxidant capacity (TOC), TOC in mmol H2O2 equivalent/L, preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers|total antioxidant capacity (TAC), TAC in mmol trolox equivalent/L, preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers|Oxidative stress index (OSI), OSI in mmol trolox/L., preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers|ischaemia-modified albumin, ischaemia-modified albumin in IU/mL, preoperative in the morning or preprandial for healthy volunteers
To date various oxidative stress parameters were studied in patients with cervix cancer, however dynamic thiol disulfide hemostasis has not been previously investigated.

The thiol-disulfide balance in the circulation will be measured by the automated system created by Erel \& Neselioglu (1).
