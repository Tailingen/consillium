A Study of Extending Relugolix Dosing Intervals Through Addition of Itraconazole or Ritonavir in Prostate Cancer Patients
Researchers leading this study hope to learn about the safety of combining the study drug relugolix with another study drug called itraconazole or ritonavir in prostate cancer. This study is for individuals who have advanced prostate cancer and plans to have medical castration (the use of medications or chemicals to lower hormone production in the testicles). Your participation in this research will last up to 1 month.

The purpose of this research is to gather information on the safety and effectiveness of relugolix in combination with ritonavir or itraconazole. The goal of this research is to find out if combining two medications (relugolix and itraconazole or relugolix and ritonavir) could possibly lead to using less relugolix, which is an expensive drug.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Cancer Metastatic|Prostate Adenocarcinoma
DRUG: Relugolix Pill|DRUG: Ritonavir|DRUG: Itraconazole
Testosterone Suppression of Participants as Assessed by Testosterone Levels, To determine whether the addition of itraconazole and ritonavir to relugolix sustains testosterone suppression as assessed by participant testosterone levels., 1 month post start of treatment
Decrease in Relugolix Levels, To evaluate whether itraconazole or ritonavir significantly decreases relugolix clearance in participants with prostate cancer as assessed by relugolix serum levels on days 8 and 15., 1 month post start of treatment|Reduction in Prostate-Specific Antigens Levels of Participants After Study Treatment, To evaluate the efficacy of itraconazole or ritonavir combined with relugolix in patients with prostate cancer as assessed by a reduction in Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels of patients after study treatment., 1 month post start of treatment|Rate of Reported Adverse Events Among Participants, To evaluate the safety of itraconazole or ritonavir combined with longer interval relugolix dosing regimens in patients with prostate cancer as assessed by the rate of reported adverse events according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V5., 1 month post start of treatment
