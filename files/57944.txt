TGRX-678 Phase I Oral Pharmacokinetic Study
A study evaluating the effects of food intake on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of TGRX-678
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: TGRX-678
Plasma Tmax, Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) of TGRX-678 measured in plasma, During Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 43)|Plasma Tlag, Time between drug administration to drug absorption (Tlag) as indicated by TGRX-678 plasma concentration, During Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 43)|Plasma Cmax, Maximum concentration (Cmax) of TGRX-678 measured in plasma, During Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 43)|Plasma AUC(0-t), Area Under drug concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to last measureable timepoint for TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, During Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 43)|Plasma AUC(0-inf), Area Under drug concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity for TGRX-678 as measured in plasma, During Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 43)|AUC(%Extrap), Calculated percentage of Area under curve for AUC(0-inf) that is from last measurable timepoint ot infinity, calculated based on TGRX-678 plasma concentration over time curve., During Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 43)|Half Life (T1/2), Time for TGRX-678 to decrease from maximum plasma concentration to half of maximum plasma concentration, During Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 43)|Plasma volume of distribution (Vz/F), Apparent volume of distribution of TGRX-678 in plasma, During Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 43)|Plasma clearance (CL/F), Apparent clearance of TGRX-678 in plasma, During Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 43)
Adverse Events (AE), To record adverse events to participants during study participation, Starting from consent signing and until end of Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 43)
This study is designed as single-center, single-dose, randomized, open-label and parallel-comparison to evaluate food effect on PK profile of TGRX-678 in healthy subjects. Safety and tolerability of the drug is also evaluated during study.
