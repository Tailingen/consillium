A Phase 1b/2 Study of Intravenous Brincidofovir in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Lymphoma and Relapsed or Refractory Extranodal Natural Killer/T-cell Lymphoma
This study is a multi-center, global, open-label, Phase 1b/2 clinical study, and it will be conducted at multiple study sites in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Singapore, to reveal the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of BCV in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma and to assess the efficacy and safety of Brincidofovir (SyB V-1901, BCV) in patients with relapsed or refractory Extranodal Natural Killer/T-cell Lymphoma (ENKL).

This study consists of 2 parts and will enroll a total (maximum) of 43 male and female participants who meet the eligibility criteria (Phase 1b part: Up to 18 participants \[3 to 6 participants in each of the 3 cohorts\], Phase 2 part: 25 participants).
