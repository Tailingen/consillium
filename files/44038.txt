Carac & PDT Combination in the Treatment Of Actinic Keratoses
To demonstrate if Carac treatment after PDT treatment of actinic keratoses leads to superior clinical improvement when compared to Carac or PDT treatment alone. This will be done by manual counts and through photography.
Actinic Keratoses
DRUG: Fluorouracil|PROCEDURE: Photodynamic therapy|PROCEDURE: Carac in combination with PDT
Reduction of Actinic Keratoses, The objective of this study is to demonstrate if Carac treatment after PDT treatment of actinic keratoses leads to superior clinical improvement when compared to Carac or PDT treatment alone based on a manual lesion count., Outcomes are assessed at 3 months
Photographic Improvement of Actinic Keratoses, The objective of this study is to demonstrate if Carac treatment after PDT treatment of actinic keratoses leads to superior clinical improvement when compared to Carac or PDT treatment alone based on a photographic improvement using the Actinic Keratosis-Field Assessment Scale., Outcomes are assessed at 3 months
Carac has been shown to be highly effective for the treatment of actinic keratoses. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) has also been shown to be highly effective for the treatment of actinic keratoses. Both treatments are FDA approved. The mechanism of action of each therapy is different. In general a more vigorous, but less cosmetically acceptable appearance is seen after Carac treatment as compared to PDT treatment. The purposes of this study are to determine 1) If the use of Carac, followed by PDT treatment, of actinic keratoses leads to an enhanced clinical improvement as compared to PDT treatment alone; 2) If the cosmetic appearance of the skin during Carac is improved with PDT pre-treatment; 3) Evaluate histologic changes induced by combined Carac/PDT treatment as compared to Carac treatment alone and PDT treatment alone.;4) Evaluate safety of treatments in terms of potential for infection and scarring
