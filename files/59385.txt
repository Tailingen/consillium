A Study of Elranatamab (PF-06863135) in Chinese Participants With Refractory Multiple Myeloma.
The purpose of this study is to understand the study medicine (called Elranatamab, or PF-06863135) as potential treatment for refractory multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a form of cancer in the bone that forces healthy blood cells to go out. Sometimes, multiple myeloma does not respond to current therapy or quickly progresses, and this is called refractory multiple myeloma.

Elranatamab is a study medicine that target multiple myeloma and activates the human body to fight against this disease. We are seeking Chinese participants to take part in this study. The study will be 2 parts, called part 1b and part 2. In part 1b, participants will receive Elranatamab at 2 steps priming and full dose as a sc (subcutaneous injection) therapy. We will monitor participants' safety and reactions to the study medicine. This will help us understand the dosage of Elranatamab to be used safely.

In part 2 of the study, participants will receive Elranatamab and their multiple myeloma growth will be monitored. This will help us understand if Elranatamab, when used alone, may be a therapy for refractory multiple myeloma. Participants in this part of the study are expected to take part for about 2 years.

All the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher scores on the functional scales represent higher levels of functioning. Higher scores on the global health status/quality of life scale represent higher health status/quality of life. Higher scores on symptom scales/items represent a greater presence of symptoms., Baseline and up to 37 months|Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Myeloma-Specific Module (EORTC QLQ-MY20), EORTC MY20 is a myeloma-specific module developed by the EORTC group specifically to assess quality of life in participants with multiple myeloma.

Overall scores range from 0 to 1, with lower scores representing higher levels of dysfunction. EQ-VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., Baseline and up to 37 months
