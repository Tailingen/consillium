Frailty Phenotype Assessments to Optimize Treatment Strategies for Older Patients With Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this research study is to determine if frailty assessments can be used to predict how well patients aged 60 years and older will do after chemotherapy, CAR T-cell therapy, or allogeneic stem cell transplant.
