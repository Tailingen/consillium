A Study of Atezolizumab in Combination With Carboplatin or Cisplatin + Pemetrexed Compared With Carboplatin or Cisplatin + Pemetrexed in Participants Who Are Chemotherapy-Naive and Have Stage IV Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (IMpower 132)
This is a randomized, Phase III, multicenter, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin + pemetrexed compared with treatment with cisplatin or carboplatin + pemetrexed in participants who are chemotherapy-naive and have Stage IV non-squamous NSCLC. Eligible participants will be randomized by a 1:1 ratio into 2 groups: Arm A (Atezolizumab + Carboplatin or Cisplatin + Pemetrexed) and Arm B (Carboplatin or Cisplatin + Pemetrexed). The study will be conducted in two phases: Induction Phase and Maintenance Phase.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Pemetrexed
Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Investigator Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurred first., Randomization up to approximately 39 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as time from randomization to death from any cause., Randomization up to approximately 39 months
Overall Survival Rate at Year 1, The Overall Survival Rate at the 1-year landmark time point is defined as the probabilities that participants are alive 1-year after randomization., Year 1|Overall Survival Rate Year 2, The Overall Survival Rate at the 2-year landmark time point is defined as the probabilities that participants are alive 2-years after randomization., Year 2|Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response (Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) Assessed by the Investigator Using RECIST V1.1, An objective response is defined as either an unconfirmed CR or a PR, as determined by the investigator using RECIST v1.1. Objective Response Rate is defined as the proportion of patients who had an objective response., Randomization up to approximately 25 months|Duration of Response (DOR) as Determined by the Investigator Using RECIST v1.1, DOR is defined as the time interval from the date of the first occurrence of a CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that progressive disease or death is documented, whichever occurs first., Randomization up to approximately 25 months|Change From Baseline in Patient-Reported Lung Cancer Symptoms as Assessed by European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Symptom Score, EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated and reliable self-report measure that consists of 30 questions that assess five aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global health/quality of life, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). EORTC QLQ-C30 is scored according to the EORTC scoring manual (Fayers et al. 2001). All EORTC scales and single-item measures are linearly transformed so that each score has a range of 0-100. A high score for a functional/global health status scale represents a high or healthy level of functioning/HRQoL (Health-Related Quality of Life); however a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems. A ≥10-point change in the symptoms subscale score is perceived by patients as clinically significant (Osoba et al. 1998)., Baseline up to 3 and 6 months after disease progression or loss of clinical benefit (up to approximately 25 months)|Change From Baseline in Patient-Reported Lung Cancer Symptoms as Assessed by EORTC Quality-of-Life Lung Cancer Module (QLQ-LC13) Symptom Score, The EORTC QLQ-LC13 module incorporates one multiple item scale to assess dyspnea and a series of single items assessing pain, coughing, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, and hemoptysis. The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is scored according to the EORTC scoring manual (Fayers et al. 2001). All EORTC scales and single-item measures are linearly transformed so that each score has a range of 0-100. A high score for a functional/global health status scale represents a high or healthy level of functioning/HRQoL (Health-Related Quality of Life); however, a high score for a symptom scale or item represents a high level of symptomatology or problems. A≥10-point change in the symptoms subscale score is perceived by patients as clinically significant (Osoba et al. 1998)., Baseline up to 3 and 6 months after disease progression or loss of clinical benefit (up to approximately 25 months)|Change From Baseline in Patient-Reported Lung Cancer Symptoms as Reported Using the Symptoms in Lung Cancer (SILC) Scale Score, Change from baseline per SILC scale will be analyzed for each lung cancer symptoms scores. SILC questionnaire comprises 3 individual symptoms \& are scored at individual symptom level, thus have a dyspnea score, chest pain score, \& cough score. There are a total of 9 questions in SILC questionnaire, each question has a minimum value of 0 \& maximum value of 4. Each individual symptom score is calculated as average of responses for symptom items. 'Chest pain' score is mean of question 1 \& 2, 'Cough' score is mean of question 3 \& 4 and 'Dyspnea' score is mean of question 5 to 9 in SILC questionnaire. An increase in score is suggestive of a worsening in symptomology. A score change of ≥0.3 points for dyspnea \& cough symptom scores is considered to be clinically significant; whereas a score change of≥0.5 points for chest pain score is considered to be clinically significant., Baseline up to 3 and 6 months after disease progression or loss of clinical benefit (up to approximately 25 months)|Minimum Observed Serum Atezolizumab Concentration (Cmin), Minimum observed serum atezolizumab concentration (Cmin) prior to infusion at selected cycles (Arm A), Predose (Prd; 0 hour [h]) on D1 of Cy 2,3,4,8,16 (Cy length=21 days) and thereafter on D1 of every 8th cycle (up to approximately 25 months)|Maximum Observed Serum Atezolizumab Concentration (Cmax), Maximum observed serum atezolizumab concentration (Cmax) after infusion (Arm A), Day 1 of Cycle 1 (Cycle length=21 days)|Plasma Concentrations for Carboplatin in Arm A(Atezolizumab + Carboplatin or Cisplatin + Pemetrexed), Prd (0 h), 5-10 minutes (mins) before end of carboplatin infusion (infusion duration=1-2 h), 1 h post-infusion on D1 of Cy1,3 (Cy length=21 days)|Plasma Concentrations for Cisplatin in Arm A (Atezolizumab + Carboplatin or Cisplatin + Pemetrexed), Prd (0 h), 5-10 mins before end of cisplatin infusion (infusion duration=30-60 mins), 1 h post-infusion on D1 of Cy1,3 (Cy length=21 days)|Plasma Concentrations for Pemetrexed in Arm A (Atezolizumab + Carboplatin or Cisplatin + Pemetrexed), Prd (0 h), 5-10 mins before end of pemetrexed infusion (infusion duration=10 mins), 1 h post-infusion on D1 of Cy1,3 (Cy length=21 days)|Percentage of Participants With Anti-Therapeutic Antibodies (ATAs) of Atezolizumab, Baseline prevalence and post-baseline incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) to Atezolizumab in the Arm A (Atezolizumab + Carboplatin or Cisplatin + Pemetrexed), Prd (0 h) on D1 of Cy1,2,3,4,8,16 (Cy length=21 days) and thereafter on D1 of every 8th cycle, at treatment discontinuation & then every 30 days (up to 120 days) after last dose of atezolizumab (up to app 25 months)
