the Efficacy and Safety of PEG-rhG-CSF in Mobilizing Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Lymphoma
A single center, non-inferiority, two-way cohort clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte stimulating factor injection in the mobilization of autologous hematopoietic stem cells in lymphoma.
Lymphoma
DRUG: PEG-rhG-CSF|DRUG: RhG-CSF
Mobilization success rate, Accumulate CD34+cells ≥ 2×106/kg for 3 times or less, 48 months
White blood cell trough and peak, The treatment period is from the beginning of chemotherapy to the end of collection, the trough value is recorded at the beginning of chemotherapy, and the peak value is recorded after PEG-rhG-CSF is applied, 30 days|Speed of recovery, The number of days when the leucocyte trough rose to the peak, 30 days|Time of highest point of CD34+ cells, Time of highest point of CD34+ cells, 30 days|Single acquisition volume, Single acquisition volume, 30 days|Acquisition times, Acquisition times, 30 days|Administration times of rhG-CSF, Administration times of rhG-CSF, 30 days
The objective was to to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte stimulating factor injection in the mobilization of autologous hematopoietic stem cells in lymphoma.
