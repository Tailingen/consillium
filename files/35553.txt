Disease-free survival (DFS), The period from the beginning of treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause. If such situation is not met, the last evaluation date shall be used for analysis. In addition, if the treatment is terminated without confirming the progress of the disease, the imaging examination and follow-up should also be carried out after the treatment is terminated., 3 years
Objective Remission Rate (ORR), The proportion of patients whose tumor volume has shrunk to a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum time limit. The remission period usually refers to the period from the beginning of curative effect to the confirmation of tumor progression. The objective response rate is generally defined as the sum of complete response plus partial response (CR+PR)., 3 months after preoperative chemotherapy|3-year overall survival (OS), The time from the date of treatment to the date of death due to any reason. For patients who survived in the final analysis, the date of the last contact will be recorded., 3 years|CC0/1 resection rate, Complete tumor reduction surgery: CC-0: no peritoneal residual tumor; CC-1: residual tumor diameter\<2.5mm., during operation|Incidence rate of adverse events, According to NCI CTCAE v5.0, Baseline before any treatment,3 months after any treatment
