Immune Responses to COVID-19 Vaccination in Lymphoma Patients
This prospective observational study aims to evaluate the robustness and persistence of immune responses to vaccination, define factors associated with impaired immune responses and assess the incidence of COVID-19 infections in vaccinated individuals. To do this, we will collect peripheral blood from patients with lymphoid cancers before and after their COVID-19 vaccination. The blood will be explored in the laboratory for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and T-cell responses to the spike protein. Detailed clinical information will also be collated on about their cancer and treatment.
