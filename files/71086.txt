A Study to Evaluate 3 Dose Schedules of Daratumumab in Participants With Smoldering Multiple Myeloma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate three daratumumab dose schedules in participants with Smoldering Multiple Myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: daratumumab|DRUG: daratumumab|DRUG: daratumumab
The percentage of participants who achieve a complete response (CR), CR, defined having negative immunofixation on the serum and urine, and \<5% plasma cells (PCs) in bone marrow., Up to 7 years|The percentage of participants that have an event (disease progression or death) per patient-year, Up to 7 years
The percentage of participants who are minimal residual disease (MRD) negative, Up to 7 years|Time to next treatment (TNT), TNT, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first subsequent multiple myeloma treatment., Up to 7 years|The percentage of participants who achieve a Complete Response (CR) or a Partial Response (PR), See definition of CR above. PR, defined as \>=50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-hour urinary M-protein by \>=90% or to \<200 mg/24 hours., Up to 7 years|The median time of progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from date of randomization to date of initial documented disease progression (PD) according to SLiM-CRAB (S=sixty, Li=light chains, M=MRI, C=calcium \[elevated\], R=renal failure, A=anemia, B=bone lesions) criteria, myeloma defining events, or date of death, whichever occurs first. As per SLiM-CRAB criteria, clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage \>=60%, Involved : uninvolved serum free Li ratio \>= 100, \>1 focal lesion on MRI studies, calcium elevation: \>0.25 millimole per liter (mmol/L) ( \>1 milligram per deciliter \[mg/dL\]) higher than upper limit of normal or \>2.75 mmol/L (\>11 mg/dL); creatinine clearance \<40 milliliter per minute (mL/min) or serum creatinine \>177 micromole per liter (Âµmol/L) (\>2 mg/dL); hemoglobin \<10 gram per deciliter (g/dL) (\<6.5 mmol/L) or \>2 g/dL (\>1.25 mmol/L) lower than lower limit of normal; 1 or more osteolytic lesions on skeletal radiography, computed tomography (CT), or positron emission tomography-CT (PET-CT)., Up to 7 years|The percentage of participants with symptomatic multiple myeloma, Up to 7 years|Response to first subsequent multiple myeloma treatment, Up to 7 years|Overall survival rate, Up to 7 years
This is a randomized, open-label (identity of assigned treatment will be known to participants and study staff), 3-arm (3 treatment groups), multicenter study of daratumumab in participants diagnosed with intermediate or high-risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM \[ie, early disease without any symptoms\]). Participants will be randomized (assigned by chance) to one of 3 treatment groups (arm A \[long intense\], arm B \[intermediate\] and arm C \[short intense\]) to receive daratumumab. Each treatment group will investigate 1 of 3 dosing schedules of daratumumab. The study will include a 28-Day Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase of 1 to 20 treatment cycles (each cycle is 8 weeks in duration for total period of 8 to 160 weeks), and a Follow up Phase of 4-weeks from the last dose of study drug. For participants in Arm A (long intense) and Arm B (intermediate), there is a possibility to extend treatment with IV daratumumab (Q8W) after the end of Cycle 20 if, as per investigator discretion, there is a positive benefit/risk ratio, absence of Grade \>=3 treatment related toxicity, and at least stable disease has been achieved. For participants participating in treatment extension, the duration of infusion may be shortened to a 90-minute infusion or can switch to daratumumab 1800mg subcutaneous (Q8w). The Follow-up Phase will continue until death, lost to follow up, consent withdrawal, or study end, whichever occurs first. The end of the study will occur approximately 7 years after the last participant enrolled receives a first dose of study drug. 'Disease assessment will be performed locally per Standard of Care.
