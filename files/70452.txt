Improving Cyberknife Spinal Stereotactic Radiotherapy in Difficult to Treat Cases (IMPRESS)
A prospective study evaluating prone and supine positioning for radiation planning of spine Cyberknife radiotherapy treatment. Patients with tumours in which PTV coverage is compromised due to tumour geography, including posteriorly based lesions in the vertebral column and close proximity to organ at risk (other than the spinal cord).
Solid Tumor, Adult
OTHER: Setup and Imaging for at CT radiation planning
PTV isodose coverage, To compare the PTV coverage of radiotherapy plans delivered in prone and supine positions, Through study completion, an average of 1 year.
Organs at risk dose, Compare organs at risk dose between supine and prone positioning., Immediate|Comfort scores, Evaluate comfort scores in both treatment positions (supine and prone), Immediate|CT and MRI registration, Evaluate CT and MRI registration on tumour target delineation, Immediate|Treatment time duration, Treatment time duration, Immediate
This is a prospective, non-randomised radiotherapy planning study.

Subsets of patients with specific tumour and anatomical characteristics will benefit from improved PTV prescription isodose coverage, reduced spinal cord dose, and organs at risk dose by undergoing either prone or supine setup, planning and treatment. Both prone and supine CT radiotherapy planning scans for patients undergoing spine SBRT treatment will undergo comparison of radiotherapy plans to guide recommendation of prone treatment for future patients.

Patients continue to receive treatment in the proposed position as recommended y their treating physician.
