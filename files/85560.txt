Phase 2 Study of Ruxolitinib Versus Anagrelide in Subjects With Essential Thrombocythemia Who Are Resistant to or Intolerant of Hydroxyurea (RESET-272)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib versus anagrelide in subjects with essential thrombocythemia who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea.
MPN (Myeloproliferative Neoplasms)
DRUG: Ruxolitinib|DRUG: Anagrelide|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Placebo
Proportion of Subjects Who Achieve Platelet and White Blood Cell (WBC) Control, Defined as proportion of subjects who achieve a simultaneous reduction of platelet counts to \< 600 × 10\^9/L with a reduction of WBC counts to \< 10 × 10\^9/L for at least 80% of biweekly measurements for a consecutive 12-week period between Weeks 32 and 52., 52 weeks
Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Adverse events reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug/treatment., Baseline through the end of randomized period -up to 14 months per participant|Proportion of Subjects Who Achieve Complete Remission or Partial Remission, Defined as proportion of subjects who achieve CR or PR at Week 32 based on European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2013 response criteria. Per ELN criteria: Complete Remission: durable resolution of disease related signs and symptoms, durable blood count normalization, absence of hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, absence of signs of progressive disease and bone marrow histological remission including disappearance of megakaryocyte hyperplasia and absence of reticulin fibrosis \>Grade 1.

Partial remission: durable resolution of disease related signs and symptoms, durable blood count normalization, absence of hemorrhagic or thrombotic events, absence of signs of progressive disease, persistance of megakaryocyte hyperplasia.

No response: any response that does not satisfy partial remission. Progressive Disease: transformation in PET-MF, MDS or acute leukemia., 32 weeks|Time to Treatment Discontinuation, Defined as the time when treatment is discontinued, 98 weeks|Duration of Response, Defined as measurement of response from the onset of response to the loss of response for responders., 142 weeks|Proportion of Subjects Who Achieve Reduction of Platelet Counts to < 600 × 10^9/L, Defined as Proportion of subjects who achieve reduction of platelet counts to \< 600 × 10\^9/L for at least 80% of biweekly measurements for a consecutive 12-week period between Weeks 32 and 52., Between 32 and 52 weeks|Proportion of Subjects Who Achieve a Reduction of WBC Counts to < 10 × 109/L, Defined as Proportion of subjects who achieve a reduction of WBC counts to \< 10 × 109/L for at least 80% of biweekly measurements for a consecutive 12-week period between Weeks 32 and 52., 52 weeks
