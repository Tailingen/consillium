Feasibility of Cetuximab Associated With Concomitant Radio-Chemotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Phase II, randomised, controlled, non comparative study with 2 parallel groups:

* Arm A: patients will receive induction chemotherapy (cisplatin and docetaxel) followed by a concomitant radio-chemotherapy including 2 cycles of cisplatin and vinorelbine associated with a weekly cetuximab infusion during the radiotherapy.
* Arm B: patients will receive induction chemotherapy (cisplatin and docetaxel) followed by a concomitant radio-chemothérapy including 2 cycles of cisplatin and etoposide associated with a weekly cetuximab infusion during the radiotherapy.
