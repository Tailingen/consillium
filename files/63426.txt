Adoptive Cellular Therapy and Radiation Therapy After Surgery in Treating Patients With Esophageal Cancer
Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells show cytolytic activity against tumor. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining Radiation therapy with adoptive cellular therapy after surgery may be more effective than uses radiation therapy alone in treating esophageal cancer.
