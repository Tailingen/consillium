Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Durvalumab in Combination With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients With Operable Urothelial Cancer.
The main objective is to demonstrate that the addition of neoadjuvant and adjuvant immunotherapy with durvalumab, to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (with cisplatin/gemcitabine) and surgery in urothelial carcinoma could improve event-free survival.
Urothelial Cancer
DRUG: Neoadjuvant and adjuvant durvalumab
event-free survival (EFS), The primary endpoint of the trial is Event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years after neoadjuvant trial treatment start.

Event-free survival is defined as the time from treatment start until one of the following events, whichever comes first:

* Progression during neoadjuvant treatment leading to inoperability
* Recurrence of locoregional disease after surgery
* Appearance of metastases at any localization
* Death Patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the date of the last available assessment before initiation of a subsequent treatment, if any., 2 years after treatment start
Event-free survival (EFS), Event-free survival is defined as the time from treatment start until one of the following events, whichever comes first:

* Progression during neoadjuvant treatment leading to inoperability
* Recurrence of locoregional disease after surgery
* Appearance of metastases at any localization
* Death Patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the date of the last available assessment before initiation of a subsequent treatment, if any., at the occurrence of the event or latest 5 years after surgery|Recurrence-free survival (RFS) after R0 resection, RFS after R0 resection is defined as the time from surgery until one of the following events, whichever comes first:

* Recurrence of locoregional disease
* Appearance of metastases at any localization
* Death Patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the date of the last available assessment before initiation of a subsequent treatment, if any.

This endpoint will only be calculated for patients in the R0 resection set., at recurrence or latest 5 years after surgery|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment start until death from any cause. Patients not experiencing an event will be censored at the last date they were known to be alive., at death or latest 5 years after surgery|Quality of resection, The quality of resection will be assessed in the following way:

* Complete resection (R0) defined as free resection margins proved microscopically
* Completeness of the lymphadenectomy and surgery using the photo documentation and histopathology
* Postoperative complications will be assessed using the Clavien-Dindo classification, after surgery or the latest 20 weeks after registration|Pathological complete response rate (ypT0), Pathological complete response (ypT0) is defined as no residual tumor in the surgical specimen. The proportion of patients with ypT0 will be calculated for patients in the resected patients set., after surgery or the latest 20 weeks after registration|Pathological response rate (PaR) defined by pathological downstaging to ≤ypT1N0M0, Pathological response (PaR) is defined as pathological downstaging to ≤ ypT1N0M0. The proportion of patients with PaR will be calculated for patients in the resected patients set., after surgery or the latest 20 weeks after registration|Pattern of recurrence, Pattern of recurrence is defined as location of first tumor recurrence. Patterns can be locoregional or distant or any combination of these patterns.

Patients with secondary malignancies or patients with no recurrence will not be taken into consideration for this endpoint., after recurrence or latest 5 years after surgery|Treatment feasibility, The following feasibility criteria will be assessed:

* completion of 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
* completion of 4 cycles of neoadjuvant durvalumab treatment
* timely admission to and completion of planned surgery
* timely initiation and completion of 10 cycles of adjuvant durvalumab treatment, after treatment end or the latest 73 weeks after registration|Adverse events, All AEs will be assessed according to NCI CTCAE v4.03, within treatment start and 90 days after last trial treatment and resolution of all related AEs thereafter (at the latest 5 years after surgery)
Despite optimal surgical management the prognosis for localized muscle invasive urothelial cancer (MIUC) is unfavorable with 5-year overall survival of around 45%.

According to international guidelines the use of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered standard of care in all patients with localized MIUC with planned curative local treatment.

However, the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited and there is a clear medical need for improvement for this patient population.

Durvalumab has been tested in a phase I/II open-label study including patients with metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC).

The results demonstrated an overall response rate (RR) of 31% in 42 response-evaluable patients. The side effect profile was favorable with most common grade 1/2 AE representing fatigue (13%), diarrhea (10%) and decreased appetite (8%). Three patients (4.9%) had treatment related grade 3 AE's, no grade 4/5 events were noted.

The combination of cisplatin/gemcitabine chemotherapy with modern immune-checkpoint inhibition has been demonstrated to be feasible with demonstration of favorable immunomodulatory effects.

In view of these data it appears a logical step to apply these novel agents in the curative setting of neoadjuvant treatment.

The expected benefit of combining chemotherapy with durvalumab and to continue durvaluamb postoperatively might be twofold:

* to increase the response rate in the pre-operative setting and subsequently to increase the rate of pathologic complete remission (pT0) and to reduce risk of local recurrence
* to evoke durable systemic anti-cancer responses and subsequently to increase disease free- and overall survival and furthermore to induce antitumor immune response.
