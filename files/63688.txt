A Study of MT-4561 in Patients With Various Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a First In Human (FIH), multicenter, open-label, Phase I/II study to evaluate safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of MT-4561 in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will be conducted in 3 parts.

Part 1 is aimed at evaluating safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics of MT-4561 and determining the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) using the Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design.

The study details and doses of Part 2 (dose-optimization) and Part 3 (Drug-Drug Interaction) will be available after review of applicable Part 1 results.

DRUG: MT-4561
Incidence of Adverse Event, Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Part 1 Frequency, duration, and severity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\] v5.0) of adverse events, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), physical examinations, changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiogram

DLTs are defined as any event meeting the DLT criteria at least possibly related to MT-4561 for Cycle 1 (i.e., DLT monitoring window is approximately 28 days). Events with a clear alternative explanation will not be considered DLTs., a 28-day cycle|Number of Patients with Adverse events (AEs), Part 1 Frequency, duration, and severity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \[CTCAE\] v5.0) of adverse events, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), physical examinations, changes in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiogram

Adverse event: An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not it is considered related to the IMP., Screening through 30 days after last dose
