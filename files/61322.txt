Phase 3 Study of Xaluritamig vs Cabazitaxel or Second Androgen Receptor-Directed Therapy in Participants With Progressive Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
The main objective of the study is to compare overall survival in participants receiving xaluritamig versus investigator's choice (cabazitaxel or second androgen receptor-directed therapy \[ARDT\]).
