Netupitant and Palonosetron Hydrochloride in Preventing Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting in Patients With Cancer Undergoing BEAM Conditioning Regimen Before Stem Cell Transplant
This phase II trial studies how well netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride work in preventing chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer undergoing BEAM conditioning regimen before stem cell transplant. Chemotherapy, such as carmustine, cytarabine, etoposide, and melphalan (BEAM), makes people feel sick to their stomach and causes vomiting. Netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride may reduce the nausea and vomiting caused by the BEAM treatment.

DRUG: Netupitant|DRUG: Palonosetron Hydrochloride|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Complete Response (CR) Defined as no Emesis and no Rescue Therapy, Number of subjects that reached a complete response (CR), defined as having no emesis and no rescue therapy., Up to 5 days post chemotherapy
CR (Acute Phase), Number of subjects that reached a complete response (CR), defined as having no emesis and no rescue therapy from 0 to 144 hours (acute phase) of the study drug administration., Up to 144 hours post-study drug administration on day 1|CR (Delayed Phase), Number of subjects that reached a complete response (CR), defined as having no emesis and no rescue therapy from 145 hours up to 264 hours (delayed phase) of the study drug administration., From 145 hours up to 264 hours post-study drug administration on day 1|Complete Protection (CP) Rate Defined as CR Plus no Nausea, Number of subjects that reached a complete response (CR), defined as having no emesis and no rescue therapy from 0 to 264 hours of the study drug administration., Up to 264 hours post-study drug administration on day 1
Number of Participants With Emetic Episodes and Received Rescue Agents, The number of participants that had emetic episodes and received rescue agents (medications)., Up to 264 hours|Number of Participants With Emetic Episodes and Received Rescue Agents (Acute Phase), The number of participants that had emetic episodes and received rescue agents (medications) (acute phase: for 0 to 144 hours timeframe of study drug administration), Up to 144 hours post-study drug administration on day 1|Number of Participants With Emetic Episodes and Received Rescue Agents (Acute Phase), The number of participants that had emetic episodes and received rescue agents (medications) (for 0 to 24 hours timeframe of study drug administration), Up to 24 hours post-study drug administration on day 1|Number of Participants With Emetic Episodes and Received Rescue Agents (Delayed Phase), The number of participants that had emetic episodes and received rescue agents (medications) during the delayed phase (for 145 hours up to 264 hours timeframe), From 145 hours up to 264 hours post-study drug administration on day 1|Mean Levels of Nausea Per Day Assessed by Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting Questionnaire, The mean level of nausea per day assessed by chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting questionnaire. The full range of nausea level score on the questionnaire was from minimum value of 0 to a maximum value of 10. 0= no nausea or vomiting, and 10= worst nausea and vomiting. Higher score means a worse outcome., Up to 11 days|Time to First Emesis and Time to Receiving First Rescue Medication, Will be depicted via Kaplan-Meier curves showing the percentage of patients who had no emesis or rescue medication use for the acute and delayed time periods., Up to 264 hours|Time to Receiving First Rescue Medication and First Emesis, Will be depicted via Kaplan-Meier curves showing the percentage of patients who had no emesis or rescue medication use for the acute and delayed time periods., Up to 264 hours
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the efficacy of netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride (NEPA) to prevent nausea and vomiting both during and after a highly emetogenic (BEAM) conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To differentiate response to NEPA over different phases of chemotherapy-induced nausea.

OUTLINE:

Within 60 minutes before standard of care BEAM treatment, patients receive netupitant and palonosetron hydrochloride orally (PO) on days 1, 3, and 6.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14 days.
