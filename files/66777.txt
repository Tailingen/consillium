Pivotal Study of MRI-guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation in Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer
A prospective, multi-center, single-arm study, planned in 150 patients. The primary objective of the study is to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy system (TULSA-PRO) intended to ablate prostate tissue of patients with localized, organ-confined prostate cancer.

DEVICE: MRI-guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation
Safety Endpoint - Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, Frequency and severity of all adverse events will be evaluated by attribution and reported in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) standard published by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)., 1 year|Efficacy Endpoint - Proportion of patients achieving a PSA nadir ≤ 25% of the pre-treatment baseline value., Prostate ablation efficacy will be evaluated using the proportion of patients achieving a PSA nadir ≤ 25% of the pre-treatment baseline value., 1 year
Erectile Dysfunction Endpoint, Rate of erectile dysfunction, determined by the change from baseline of the proportion of patients with IIEF-5 \< 17., At each visit post treatment throughout the total study follow-up - (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years).|Erection Firmness Endpoint, Rate of erection firmness sufficient for penetration, determined by the change from baseline of the proportion of patients with IIEF item 2 ≥ 2., At each visit post treatment throughout the total study follow-up - (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years).|Urinary Incontinence Endpoint, Rate of urinary incontinence, determined by the change from baseline of the proportion of patients with EPIC item 5 ≥ 1 (one or more pads per day)., At each visit post treatment throughout the total study follow-up - (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years).|PSA Nadir Endpoint, Proportion of patients achieving PSA nadir ≤ 0.5 ng/ml., 1 year|PSA Stability Endpoint, Proportion of patients with PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/ml at the most recent follow-up visit., At each visit post treatment throughout the total study follow-up - (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years).|Prostate Volume Endpoint, Prostate volume reduction, evaluated on MRI between the treatment day and 12-month follow-up visits., 1 year|Prostate Biopsy Endpoint, Proportion of patients with negative prostate biopsy at the 12-month follow-up visit, determined by transrectal ultrasound-guided 10-core biopsy., 1 year|IPSS Endpoint, Change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), between the baseline and most recent follow-up visit., At each visit post treatment throughout the total study follow-up - (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years).|IIEF Endpoint, Change in the Erectile Function, Orgasmic Function, Sexual Desire, Intercourse Satisfaction and Overall Satisfaction domains of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15), between the baseline and most recent follow-up visit., At each visit post treatment throughout the total study follow-up - (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years).|EPIC Endpoint, Change in Urinary, Bowel, Sexual and Hormonal domains of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), between the baseline and most recent follow-up visit., At each visit post treatment throughout the total study follow-up - (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years).|Targeting Accuracy Endpoint, Conformal prostate ablation, measured quantitatively between the target prostate volume and the target temperature isotherm on MRI thermometry acquired during the TULSA-PRO procedure, and described using three measures of targeting accuracy (Dice Similarity Coefficient; Over- and under-targeted volumes; Linear targeting in mm)., During treatment|CE-MRI Endpoint, Conformal prostate ablation, assessed qualitatively by visualizing the peripheral region of enhancement surrounding the non-perfused volume (NPV) on contrast-enhanced (CE)-MRI acquired immediately after treatment., Immediately after treatment|mpMRI Endpoint, Characterize the effect of the TULSA-PRO ablation on diagnostic multi-parametric prostate MRI (mpMRI), determined using PI-RADS v2 performed at the Baseline and 12-month follow-up visits., 1 year
Profound Medical Inc. has developed a novel technology called the MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound therapy system (TULSA-PRO). The technology is developed for patients with organ confined prostate cancer. The therapeutic endpoint of this technology is thermal coagulation of prostate tissue.

The treatment is conducted within a MRI suite, which enables real-time temperature images of the heated region to be acquired as the ultrasonic treatment is delivered. Using MRI thermometry during treatment, dynamic temperature feedback control over the intensity of the ultrasound beams and rotation of the Ultrasound Applicator can shape the pattern of thermal coagulation accurately and precisely in the prostate gland.

It provides advantages of a non-invasive procedure with short treatment times.
