CyberKnife Radiosurgery for Locally Recurrent Prostate CA
The purpose of this study is to scientifically evaluate the effects (good and bad) of a new type of radiation treatment in patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after prior radiotherapy. The treatment is known as prostate radiosurgery, and is distinguished from traditional radiotherapy by the application of smaller, more precisely controlled margins around the area targeted for full dose radiation, and far fewer treatments, using a much larger dose per treatment.

This research is being done to see what advantages, if any, prostate radiosurgery may have over other salvage treatment methods, including brachytherapy, cryosurgery, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), hormonal therapy and radical prostatectomy.
