Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery for Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess different hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery techniques in management of colorectal cancer as regard: feasibility of the technique, short term oncologic outcome and functional outcome.
Colorectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: natural orifice specimen extraction|PROCEDURE: Laparoendoscopic resection
Feasibility, Rate of conversion to classic laparoscopy or to open laparotomy., 24 hour|operative time, time taken from starting operation till patient wake up, 24 hour|Operative blood loss, measured in milliliter, 24 hour|Wound complications, infection-dehiscence, two week|Major intraoperative complications, bleeding -organ injury, 24 hour|Major postoperative complications, leak-bleeding, two weeks
Adequacy of lymphadenectomy, Number of lymph nodes retrieved, one month|Grading of quality and completeness of mesorectal excision, It is a composite outcome where result will appear as either complete, near complete or incomplete. Criteria in (shape, coning, presence of defects and circumferential safety margin) will be integrated to categorize it., one month|Longitudinal safety margin, either free or infiltrated with tumor by histopathology examination., one month|short term oncologic outcome, incidence of local and distant outcomes and disease free survival, 6 months - one year|Functional outcome, assessing fecal incontinence using Kirwan's grading score, 3 months
Intervention will be done by conventional laparoscopy and transanal endoscopy (TEO or Gelpoint platform), patients are divided into two arms to compare different natural orifice techniques in resection of colorectal cancer.
