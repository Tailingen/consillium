Appraising Medical Trial Experiences of Ovarian Cancer Patients
Historically, participation in clinical trials has been highly skewed towards specific demographic groups. However, research identifying which trial attributes impact participation, in either positive or negative ways, is limited. This study invites participants to record a wide range of data on their clinical trial experience, with the goal being to identify factors which persistently limit patients' ability to participate in, or complete, a trial in which they were initially interested. Data will be analyzed through a range of demographic lenses, in hopes of discovering patterns which might improve the experience of future ovarian cancer patients.
