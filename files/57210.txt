Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Cervical Cancer in Elderly Women
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and safety of weekly Cisplatin /Liposome paclitaxel concurrent chemoradiothrapy in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer in elderly women.
Cervical Cancer
RADIATION: irradiation|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: liposome paclitaxel
Objective Response Rate, Objective Response Rate: Complete response (CR)+ Partial response (PR) rates base on RECIST evaluation system., 1 month after the treatment completed|Adverse Events, Record the Number of participants with adverse events and the Grades of the AE according to CTCAE v3.0, Participants will be followed from the treatment begin to 1 month after the treatment end.
Local Control Rate, Participants will be followed every year for the duration of 5 years|Tumor Free Survival Rate, From date of randomization until tumor recurrence or metastasis,assessed up to 5 years|Overall Survival Rate, From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause,assessed up to 5 years
Concurrent radiotherapy is the standard treatment of inoperable cervical cancer .Due to the physical conditions, elderly patients usually associated with medical complications, so generally just receive radiotherapy alone. Recently, some retrospective studies have shown that the impact of chemotherapy did not cause an increase in the complication rate among elderly patients as compared to younger patients with cervical cancer, and may improve the survival when concurrent with radiotherapy. Cisplatin and paclitaxel are two effective drug in treating cervical cancer, but whether they are safe enough for elderly when concurrent with radiotherapy, there are no clearly reports. In this study ,we replace the conventional dose chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin or lipsome paclitaxel , to compare the efficiency and safety of weekly cisplatin / liposome paclitaxel concurrent chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone in the treatment of cervical cancer in elderly patients.
