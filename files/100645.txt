Masitinib Plus Gemcitabine in Pancreatic Cancer
The objective is to compare efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with gemcitabine to placebo in combination with gemcitabine, in treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer and who have pain related to the disease.
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Masitinib|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Placebo
Overall Survival (median), Overall survival is defined as time in months from the randomization date to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the date of last known date patient alive., From day of randomization to death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months
Survival rates, The proportion of patients alive at each time point, estimated with Kaplan-Meier distribution, every 24 weeks|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of earliest evidence of disease progression or death, for participants who progressed or died before subsequent cancer therapy. Disease progression will be assessed by the investigator on CT scan according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, From day of randomization to disease progression or death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months
Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is thought to promote survival via modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with gemcitabine with respect to placebo in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of non resectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with pain related to the disease. Approximately 330 patients with pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) \> 20 and/or treated with 'opioid analgesics' dose â‰¥ 1 mg/kg/day at baseline will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the masitinib and placebo arms, respectively. The primary outcome measure is overall survival (OS).
