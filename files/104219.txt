Aschistosoma Haematobiumspecific microRNAas a Tumor Marker for Early Diagnosis and Prognosis of Bilharzial Bladder Cancer in Eygpt
miRNAs have been detected in different bodily fluids, which suggests significant potential, such as their use as biomarkers in diagnostics and prognostics. Sha-mir-71a was abundantly found in the urine of patients with bladder cancer as compared to benign bladder cystitis associated with schistosomiasis . Additionally, this miRNA was more highly detected in urine samples from patients with bilharzial bladder cancer than bladder cancer not associated with bilharziasis (schistosomiasis), suggesting its specificity in the identification of bladder cancer associated with infection.
