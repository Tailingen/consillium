RADIATION: curative proton therapy
2-year local control ratio of the treated liver area, The primary goal of this study is the 2-year local control rate of liver lesions treated with proton therapy. It is judged that the local control rate is improved when the liver metastases of colorectal cancer using conventional X-ray is assumed to have 2-year local control rate of 60% and the 2-year local control rate of proton therapy is set to 80% or more, Time Frame: up to 2 years
5-year survival rate of treated patients, To evaluate whether high doses of proton therapy can replace conventional surgical resection. From date of initiation of proton therapy until the date of documented date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years, documented data of death, up to 5 years.|5-year disease-free survival rate of treated patients, To evaluate whether high doses of proton therapy can replace conventional surgical resection. From date of initiation of proton therapy until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 5 years., documented date of progression or death, up to 5 years
This clinical trial is a prospective, single-organ, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of curative proton therapy for liver metastasis of colorectal cancer diagnosed histologically as adenocarcinoma. Patients who meet the selection criteria should be selected, signed for consent, and treated 5 times a week for 7200 cGy / 15 fractions alone for 3 weeks.
