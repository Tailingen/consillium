INvestigating DIGital Outcomes in the Community
To explore the feasibility and best methodology for collecting patient-reported outcome measures in patients who have previously been treated for cancer and are living in the community.

The investigators are working with primary care research teams, and using an online electronic questionnaire. Although the study is entirely observational, the study offers some of the questions in a random order, so the investigators can explore the effect of changing the way in which questions are asked.
Cancer
Completion of study questionnaire, Proportion of patients completing the entire study questionnaire, 12 months|Agreement to link to national cancer data, Proportion of patients agreeing to link their data to national cancer data, 12 months
Completion of PROMs questionnaires, Proportion of patients completing PROMS questionnaires, 12 months|Satisfaction with questionnaires, Patient-reported satisfaction with questionnaires, expressed as average scores (on a scale of 1 - 10, where 10 is better) and proportion scoring 5 or over, 12 months|Effectiveness of different communication channels for recruitment, Enrolment rate via different recruitment channels (Primary Care Research Network, Social Media) expressed as the proportion of patient recruited via each channel, 12 months|Correlation of each PROM score with quality of life, Correlation of each PROM score with the EuroQol 5 Dimensions, 5 levels (EQ5D-5L) quality of life measure, 12 months
The feasibility of developing a national longitudinal cohort, To assess what proportion of participants agree to ongoing, long-term follow-up, 12 months
INDIGO Community aims to both collect data on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMS) and data on the impact of how to do this.

The focus is on adult patients living in the community who have previously been treated for cancer.

The study uses a range of quality of life questionnaires, and randomises the order in which some questions are asked, in order to explore the impact of how questions are asked on responses.

All patients with be offered the EuroQol 5 dimension, 5 level questionnaire (EQ5D-5L)
