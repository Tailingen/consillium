A Study to Determine Frequency of DNA-repair Defects in Men With Metastatic Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of 4 or more DNA-repair gene defects in a population of men with metastatic Prostate Cancer (PC) and to use the reported DNA-repair gene defects to assess biomarker eligibility for niraparib interventional studies.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer
OTHER: Saliva, Blood, or and/or Archival Tumor Tissue Collection and Analysis
Percentage of Participants with 4 or more DNA-repair Gene Defects with Metastatic Prostate Cancer as an Estimate for Prevalence, Percentage of participants with 4 or more Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-repair gene defects with metastatic Prostate Cancer (PC) as an estimate for prevalence will be assessed. A saliva, blood, and/or archival tumor tissue sample will be collected for genomic testing to confirm DNA-repair gene defect (DRD) status., Approximately 2.4 years|Percentage of Participants who Meet Biomarker Eligibility Criteria for Other Niraparib Interventional Studies, Percentage of participants who meet biomarker eligibility criteria for other niraparib interventional studies will be assessed., Approximately 2.4 years
Percentage of Participants with 4 or more DNA-repair Gene Defects with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) and with Metastatic Hormone Sensitive PC (HSPC) as an Estimate for Prevalence, Percentage of participants with 4 or more DRDs with mCRPC and HSPC as an estimate for prevalence will be assessed. A saliva, blood, and/or archival tumor tissue sample will be collected for genomic testing to confirm DRD status., Approximately 2.4 years|Percentage of Participants with 1 or more DNA-repair gene defects with Metastatic Prostate Cancer as an Estimate for Prevalence, Percentage of participants with 1 or more DRDs with metastatic PC as an estimate for prevalence will be assessed. Saliva, blood, and/or archival tumor tissue sample will be collected for genomic testing to confirm DRD status., Approximately 2.4 years
