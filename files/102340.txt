Oral moisturizing jelly is a novel edible, gel-based artificial saliva. It has been proven effective in reducing dry mouth sign and symptoms in elderly patients with xerostomia. This randomized control trial intends to determine if continuous use of oral moisturizing jelly may be effective in reduction of signs and symptoms of dry mouth, improvement of biochemical properties of saliva, subjective swallow ability, appetite, tolerance to spicy food, energy intake and reduce umami taste recognition threshold.
