Lymphedema After Gyneco-oncologic Treatment
Trial developed to inventory the incidence of early and advanced stage lower limb lymphedema in patients diagnosed with and treated for gynaecologic cancer.

Four hundred patients with diagnosis stage 1-3 gynaecologic cancer will be included in an observational cohort between diagnosis until maximum 2 weeks after start of the first treatment. They will be followed for occurrence of lower limb lymphedema up till 2 years after their last treatment.

Data on signs and symptoms, quality of life, time investment and financial expenses will be collected, to provide information on the incidence and risk factors for lower limb lymphedema, and on its impact on patients, regarding quality of life, sexual well-being and time- and financial investment.

Patients developing early stage LLL enter an interventional sub-cohort, in which the effect of class II compressive garments on preventing evolution towards advanced stage LLL will be evaluated.

It is a classification system of the anatomical extent of tumor cancers.

Most common tumors have their own TNM classification. Sometimes also described as the AJCC system.

TNM is a notation system that describes the stage of a cancer, which originates from a solid tumor, using alphanumeric codes:

T describes the size of the original (primary) tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, N describes nearby (regional) lymph nodes that are involved, M describes distant metastasis (spread of cancer from one part of the body to another)., From diagnosis until 2 years after last oncologic treatment|Risk factors for developing LLL - tumor stage (FIGO), The International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, usually just FIGO as the acronym of its French name FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de GynÃ©cologie et d'ObstÃ©trique, is a worldwide non-governmental organisation representing obstetricians and gynaecologists in over one hundred territories.

The FIGO staging system is used most often for cancers of the female reproductive organs, including cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer...

As a rule, the lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means a more advanced cancer. And within a stage, an earlier letter means a lower stage. Cancers with similar stages tend to have a similar outlook and are often treated in much the same way., From diagnosis until 2 years after last oncologic treatment|Risk factors for developing LLL - the number of patients with limited (only one or two gynaecologic organs) or extensive surgery (multiple organs and/or lymph nodes) that develop lower limb lymph-edema as assessed with ISL criteria, Gynecological surgery refers to surgery on the female reproductive system usually performed by gynecologists.

Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers.

Expressed per target volume in dose per fraction, number of fractions, From diagnosis until 2 years after last oncologic treatment|Impact of LLL on QoL - EQ5D, EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health-related quality of life developed by the EuroQol Group to provide a simple, generic questionnaire for use in clinical and economic appraisal and population health surveys. EQ-5D assesses health status in terms of five dimensions of health and is considered a 'generic' questionnaire because these dimensions are not specific to any one patient group or health condition. EQ-5D can also be referred to as a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure, because patients can complete the questionnaire themselves to provide information about their current health status and how this changes over time. 'EQ-5D' is not an abbreviation and is the correct term to use when referring to the instrument in general.

Context of the problem: Improved knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer has resulted in an increased number of cancer survivors. Consequently, more patients are confronted, often life-long, with the complications of their cancer treatment. These chronic conditions impact daily functioning and quality of life (QoL), complicate the return to work and undermine psycho-social well-being. One of the most frequent and disabling complications is lymphedema, a condition undermining QoL to an extent exceeding even a 10-year age increase.

The damage of lymphedema covers many aspects of daily life: it changes body image and complicates daily activities as basic as clothing, it increases patient-related health expenditures for treatment and for coping with the disease, reduces patient autonomy in daily functioning and can even cause sensory or motor dysfunctions. So far, no definitive cure exists for lymphedema: patients are confined to life-long preventive measures, compression therapy and regular manual lymph drainage. Surgical repair may be an option in selected cases, but evidence on surgical techniques is limited and their long-term effects are still unknown. Moreover, even after successful repair, conservative treatment is still needed.

Most studies on lymphedema are limited to upper limb lymphedema (ULL), mainly after breast cancer treatment. Only a few publications focus on lower limb lymphedema (LLL), despite its detrimental impact on QoL. This could be due to the difficulties to diagnose and treat LLL in comparison to ULL: LLL often occurs bilaterally or at the level of the groins or genital region, hence impeding diagnosis through comparison. Perimetric measurement of large cone-like oedematous legs is cumbersome. Manual lymph drainage and application of compressive garments is more strenuous for legs than for arms, and the typical bilateral occurrence and large volumes of LLL inflate the cost of treatment garments. However limited, some groups did evaluate the incidence of LLL after pelvic treatment, but maintained the criteria for advanced stage lymphedema as cut off, thereby underestimating the prior phases in which patients are confronted with functional impairment due to LLL, without apparent swelling.

The observational cohort in this study is aimed at inventorying the incidence, timing and risk factors of early as well as advanced stage lymphedema. Time and cost-investment of patients for prevention and/or treatment of LLL will be analyzed. The impact of LLL on QoL and on sexual well-being will be calculated.

A sub-cohort of this trial is of interventional design: in patients, included in the observational cohort and developing early stage LLL, standard of care treatment will be started, including skin care, active exercises and manual lymph drainage. In the experimental group, compressive garments class II will be added and compliance as well as tolerance of these garments will be analyzed.

Side-kicks of this trial are the standardization of perimetric measurements of the legs, validation of a self-report LLL screening tool and testing of the sensitivity and specificity of ICG fluoroscopy to detect early stage LLL.

Sample size calculation:

The sample size is calculated for the interventional sub-cohort, to have at least 80% power to detect a difference between the compression group and the control group for progression of lymphedema. An alpha has been set equal to 0.05.

Sample size calculation is based on evaluation at year 1. No longitudinal analysis is foreseen as primary analysis, but this could be included as a secondary analysis using a GEE analysis.

To detect a difference, in the interventional sub-cohort 109 subjects are required per group (2\*109=218 subjects in total for the two groups) to have at least 80% power. If 66% of the patients in the observational cohort will meet the inclusion criteria for the interventional randomized trial, at least 330 (=218/0.66) patients should be included in the observational cohort. To correct for drop out we planned to include 400 patients. This number is feasible within the planned recruitment period of 18-24 months. If the number of subjects would be reached before the end of the planned recruitment period, recruitment will be stopped at 400 patients. If the number is not attained, the recruitment period will be prolonged. If the number of 218 subjects is reached in the interventional sub-cohort, randomization will be stopped and analysis starts. However, the observational cohort will continue accrual until 400 subjects are reached.

We assume a difference in true transition rates (T1 to T3) in both study arms, with 0.4 in the interventional group versus 0.75 in the control group. The recruitment of 109 patients in each treatment arm would allow the assessment of benefit of the intervention with 80% power, based on the 95% two-sided confidence interval approach for the differences in two independent proportions.
