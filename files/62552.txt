Copanlisib in Combination With Rituximab and CHOP Chemotherapy in Patients With Previously Untreated DLBCL
This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, phase II study to describe the efficacy of R-CHOP plus copanlisib including a safety run-in phase in order to detect early and common unexpected toxicities caused by the addition of copanlisib to the standard immuno-chemotherapy R-CHOP in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Copanlisib|DRUG: R-CHOP Chemotherapy
2-year progression-free survival, Length of time that a patient lives without disease progression or relapse., From the day of inclusion into the study until event (disease progression, relapse, death due to any other cause) occurs, assessed up to 4 years.
Overall survival, The percentage of patients in this study who are still alive., From the day of inclusion into the study to death due to any cause, assessed up to 4 years.|Event-free survival, Length of time that a patient remains free of certain events (disease progression, start of additional, unplanned antitumor therapy, relapse, death due to any other cause)., From the day of inclusion into the study until event (disease progression, start of additional, unplanned anti-tumor therapy, relapse, death due to any other cause) occurs, assessed up to 4 years.|Rate of complete remission, Rate of complete remission measured as number of complete remissions divided by the number of patients included., From the day of inclusion into the study until date of complete remission, assessed up to 4 years.|Rate of partial remission, Rate of partial remission measured as number of partial remissions divided by the number of patients included., From the day of inclusion into the study until date of partial remission, assessed up to 4 years.|Overall response rate, Overall response rate measured as number of complete and partial remissions divided by the number of patients included., From the day of inclusion into the study until date of complete or partial remission, assessed up to 4 years.|Progression rate, Progression rate measured as number of progressions divided by the number of patients included., From the day of inclusion into the study until date of progression during therapy or within 2 months after last treatment course.|Relapse rate, Relapse rate measured as number of relapses divided by the number of patients included., From the day of inclusion into the study until date of relapse during therapy or within 2 months after last treatment course.|Duration of response, The time between the initial response to therapy and subsequent disease progression or relapse., From documentation of tumor response to relapse, assessed up to 4 years.|Adverse events and serious adverse events, Frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events, The documentation of adverse events, including serious adverse events, starts with first study treatment after patient inclusion and ends 100 days after the last application of copanlisib or any component of R-CHOP|Rate of treatment-related deaths, The number of deaths during therapy or up to 2 months after the end of therapy divided by the number of patients included., From the start of therapy up to 2 months after the end of therapy.|Therapy cycles (number), Number of therapy cycles, From the start of therapy (copanlisib and R-CHOP) until the end of therapy (last application of copanlisib or any component of R-CHOP), assessed up to 0.5 years.|Therapy cycles (duration), Duration of therapy cycles, From the start of therapy (copanlisib and R-CHOP) until the end of therapy (last application of copanlisib or any component of R-CHOP), assessed up to 0.5 years.|Used drugs, Cumulative doses of R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, rituximab) and copanlisib., From the start of therapy (copanlisib and R-CHOP) until the end of therapy (last application of copanlisib or any component of R-CHOP), assessed up to 0.5 years.|Outcome according to lymphoma biology, Lymphoma tissue from all patients will be characterized., From the start of study until the end of study, assessed up to 4 years.
Patients diagnosed with DLBCL can be cured with a combined approach of CHOP chemotherapy and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in roughly 65% of cases. About one third of patients with DLBCL relapse or show primary progressive disease after modern first-line therapy. The outcome of these patients is poor in particular if first-line therapy contained rituximab. Novel therapeutic approaches are urgently warranted. Thus, it is the goal to further improve progression-free Survival (PFS) and overall Survival (OS) by combining R-CHOP with copanlisib. Copanlisib is a small molecule pan-class 1 PI3K inhibitor and approved by US FDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.
