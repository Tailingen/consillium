Adjuvant GVAX Vaccine Therapy in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
This is an open label, phase II trial study of adjuvant GVAX pancreas vaccine in patients with pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: GVAX pancreas vaccine
Number of Patients Experiencing a Grade 3 or Above Treatment- Related Toxicity, When calculating the incidences of adverse events, each adverse event (as defined by NCI CTCAE v3) will be counted only once for a given subject., 14 years
Overall Survival (OS), OS will be measured from date of first dose until death or end of follow-up (OS will be censored on the date the subject was last known to be alive for subjects without documentation of death at the time of analysis). Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 16 years|Disease-free Survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from the first dose until evidence of disease recurrence or progression confirmed by first scan. DFS will be censored at the date of the last scan for subjects without documentation of disease recurrence or progression at the time of analysis. Estimation based on the Kaplan-Meier curve., 16 years
Eligible participants will receive by intradermal administration the GVAX pancreas vaccine consisting of two irradiated allogeneic pancreatic tumor cell lines transfected with the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene.

There will be two cohorts of research participants:

1. Participants previously vaccinated with GVAX pancreas vaccine. These participants will receive booster vaccinations as a continuation of care. Vaccination repeats every 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
2. Participants who were not previously vaccinated with GVAX pancreas vaccine (vaccine naive). These participants received priming vaccinations once a month for 3 months followed by booster vaccinations every 6 months.
