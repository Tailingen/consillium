An Open-Label, Multicenter, Phase 1/2 Study of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor E7449 as Single Agent in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors or With B-cell Malignancies and in Combination With Temozolomide (TMZ) or With Carboplatin and Paclitaxel in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
Overall Design: This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1/2 study which will be conducted in three arms (as described below). Each arm will be conducted in two parts: a Phase 1 part which will include dose escalation and a Phase 2 part which will include four cohorts in specific disease indications. Phase 1 will also include a food effect study of E7449 as a single agent. Once the MTD in the Phase 1 single agent arm and the Phase 1 combination arms of this study has been achieved, the sponsor will submit the relevant safety information and recommended Phase 2 dose to the IRB/Health Authorities. Arm 1: E7449 will be administered as a single agent. Arm 2: E7449 will be administered in combination with TMZ. Arm 3: E7449 will be administered in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel
