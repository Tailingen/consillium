NGS-based Large-panel in Targeted Drug Delivery and Immunotherapy of Lung Cancer
Companion diagnosis by large-panel is in increasing acceptance and need during clinical cancer management. The purpose of this trial is to investigate the benefit of large-panel NGS analysis in companion diagnosis of advanced lung cancer patients and further optimize the parameters.
Lung Neoplasms
OTHER: The method of gene mutation detection
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS refers to the time from initial treatment to the time of disease progression or death, through the whole study period, an average of 3 year|Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB), TMB is defined as the total number of detected somatic mutation counts in coding regions per million bases, halfway of the study, an average of 1.5 year
Other biomarkers, The distribution and clinical application value of molecular biomarkers such as Neoantigen, MSI and LOH in Chinese lung cancer patients, halfway of the study, an average of 1.5 year|Clonality, The tumor clonality in Chinese lung cancer patients, halfway of the study, an average of 1.5 year|Overall survival (OS), OS refers to the time from the patient entering into the group to the time of death, through the whole study period, an average of 3 year
Fresh tumor tissues and matched blood cells will be analyzed by large-panel (Berryoncology, lnc.) for multiple molecular biomarkers including mutations with sensitivity/resistance to targeted therapies, tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) status, etc., Therapeutic approach and outcome will be followed-up to inspect the clinical benefit by large-panel analysis. In addition, selected samples will be analyzed by WES to assess the correctness of TMB estimated by large-panel.
