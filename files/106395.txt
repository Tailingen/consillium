Major Pathological Response Rate, Major pathological response rate is defined as percentage of participants with \<=10% residual viable tumor cells in the resected specimen., Day 1 through Day 42
Pathological Complete Response (pCR) Rate, The pCR rate is defined as percentage of participants with no residual viable tumor cells in the resected specimen., Day 1 through Day 42|Feasibility to Surgery, Feasibility to surgery is defined as the percentage of participants who underwent the planned surgery within Days 29 to 42 after Week 1 Day 1., Day 29 to Day 42 after Week 1 Day 1|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. The TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug., From Day 1 through Day 105|Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Grade 4 Clinical Laboratory Toxicities, Participants with Grade 3 or Grade 4 clinical laboratory toxicities are reported. Laboratory tests included hematology, coagulation, chemistry, and urinalysis., From Day 1 through Day 105|Number of Participants With Abnormal Vital Signs Reported as TEAEs, Participants with abnormal vital sign reported as TEAEs are reported., From Day 1 through Day 105
