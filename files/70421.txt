Study of JDQ443 in Comparison With Docetaxel in Participants With Locally Advanced or Metastatic KRAS G12C Mutant Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a phase III randomized open label study designed to compare JDQ443 as monotherapy to docetaxel in participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring a KRAS G12C mutation who have been previously treated with a platinum-based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy either in sequence or in combination.

DRUG: JDQ443|DRUG: docetaxel
Progression free survival (PFS), PFS is the time from date of randomization/start of treatment to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. PFS is based on central assessment and using RECIST 1.1 criteria., Approximately up to 24 months
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, Approximately up to 33 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on central and local investigator's assessment according to RECIST 1.1., Approximately up to 33 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of participants with Best Overall Response (BOR) of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD) or Non-CR/Non-PD., Approximately up to 33 months|Time To Response (TTR), TTR is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented response (CR or PR, which must be confirmed subsequently), Approximately up to 33 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is calculated as the time from the date of first documented response (complete response (CR) or partial response (PR)) to the first documented date of progression or death due to underlying cancer., Approximately up to 33 months|Progression-Free Survival after next line therapy (PFS2), PFS2 (based on local investigator assessment) is defined as time from date of randomization to the first documented progression on next line therapy or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., Approximately up to 33 months|Concentration of JDQ443 and its metabolite in plasma, To characterize the pharmacokinetics of JDQ443 and its metabolite HZC320, Approximately up to 33 months|Time to definitive deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Group of Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS), Approximately up to 33 months|Time to definitive 10-point deterioration symptom scores of chest pain, cough and dyspnea per QLQ-LC13, The EORTC QLQ LC13 is a 13-item, lung cancer specific questionnaire module, and it comprises both multi-item and single-item measures of lung cancer-associated symptoms (i.e. coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea and pain) and side-effects from conventional chemo- and radiotherapy (i.e. hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth and dysphagia). The time to definitive 10-point deterioration is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of event, which is defined as at least 10 points absolute increase from baseline (worsening), with no later change below the threshold or death due to any cause, Approximately up to 33 months|Time to definitive 10-point deterioration in global health status/QoL, shortness of breath and pain per QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the health-related quality of life of cancer participants. The questionnaire contains 30 items and is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures based on the participants experience over the past week. These include five domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial impact) and a global health status/HRQoL scale. The time to definitive 10-point deterioration is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of event, which is defined as at least 10 points absolute increase from baseline (worsening) of the corresponding scale score, with no later change below the threshold or death due to any cause, Approximately up to 33 months|Change from baseline in EORTC-QLQ-C30, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the health-related quality of life of cancer participants. The questionnaire contains 30 items and is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures based on the participants experience over the past week. These include five domains (physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functioning), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial impact) and a global health status/HRQoL scale. A higher score indicates a higher presence of symptoms., Approximately up to 33 months|Change from baseline in EORTC-QLQ-LC13, The EORTC QLQ LC13 is a 13-item, lung cancer specific questionnaire module, and it comprises both multi-item and single-item measures of lung cancer-associated symptoms (i.e. coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea and pain) and side-effects from conventional chemo- and radiotherapy (i.e. hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth and dysphagia). A higher score indicates a higher presence of symptoms., Approximately up to 33 months|Change from baseline in EORTC-EQ-5D-5L, The EQ-5D-5L is a generic instrument for describing and valuing health. It is based on a descriptive system that defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression., Approximately up to 33 months|Change from baseline in NSCLC-SAQ, The Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (NSCLC-SAQ) is a 7-item, patient-reported outcome measure which assess patient-reported symptoms associated with advanced NSCLC. It contains five domains and accompanying items that were identified as symptoms of NSCLC: cough (1 item), pain (2 items), dyspnea (1 item), fatigue (2 items), and appetite (1 item)., Approximately up to 33 months
The study has been designed as a Phase III trial and consists of 2 parts:

* Randomized part will evaluate the efficacy and safety of JDQ443 as monotherapy in comparison with docetaxel. Participants randomized to docetaxel arm will have the opportunity to cross-over to JDQ443 at disease progression per RECIST 1.1 confirmed by BIRC.
* Extension part will be open after final progression-free survival (PFS) analysis (if the primary endpoint has met statistical significance) to allow participants randomized to docetaxel treatment to crossover to receive JDQ443 treatment regardless of progression on docetaxel.

The study population will include adult participants with locally advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IIIC or IV) KRAS G12C mutant non-small cell lung cancer (by tissue or plasma as determined by a Novartis-designated central laboratory or accepted local tests) who have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy and prior immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy administered either in sequence or as combination therapy.

Approximately 360 participants will be randomized to JDQ443 or docetaxel in a 1:1 ratio stratified by prior line of therapy and ECOG performance status.
