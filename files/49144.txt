Sorafenib Combined With Chemotherapy for Renal Collecting Duct Carcinoma
The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the effectiveness of sorafenib combined with gemcitabine plus cisplatin in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic collecting duct carcinoma(CDC) of the kidney. The safety of each treatment will also be studied.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Cisplatin
progress-free survival,PFS, Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from enrollment to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause., Time from enrollment to the dates of disease progression,death from any cause or last tumor assessment reported between date of first patient enrollment until 30 June 2015 cut of date
adverse event, AE, Any events,no matter related to interventions,occur during the period from the enrollment to death or 30 days after withdrawal from the trial, Time from enrollment to the dates of disease progression,death from any cause or last tumor assessment reported between date of first patient enrollment until 30 June 2015 cut of date
objective response rate (ORR), CR:complete response PR:partial response ORR:CR+PR, Time from enrollment to the dates of disease progression,death from any cause or last tumor assessment reported between date of first patient enrollment until 30 June 2015 cut of date|overall survival (OS), Time from enrollment to the dates of death from any cause or last follow up reported between date of first patient enrollment until 30 June 2015 cut of date, Time from enrollment to the dates of death from any cause or last follow up reported between date of first patient enrollment until 30 June 2015 cut of date|the rate of progress-free survive, the proportion of patients who don't experience progress at 3,6,9 months after enrollment, Time from enrollment to the dates of disease progression,death from any cause or last tumor assessment reported between date of first patient enrollment until 30 June 2015 cut of date
Collecting duct carcinoma(CDC) of the kidney is a rare and aggressive neoplasm of the distal collecting tubules for which there is no established treatment. Since the histology of collecting duct carcinoma is similar to that of urothelial carcinoma, a prospective phase II trial in France(2007) studied gemcitabine plus cisplatin as the first-line treatment of advanced CDC, resulting an effective rate of 26%. The targeted drugs can produce definite efficacy on renal clear cell carcinoma, but the data on targeted drugs for the treatment of renal advanced collecting duct carcinoma is limited. We sponsored this study based on the assumption that targeted drugs combined with chemotherapy can produce additive, positive effects in CDC.
