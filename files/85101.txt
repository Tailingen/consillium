Survey of Cancer Patients' Perceptions of Difficulties Encountered When Filling Opioid Prescriptions
This trial studies the problems that cancer patients face when filling prescriptions for opioids (medications that are used to manage pain). Pain is one of the most common symptoms among cancer patients. Opioid therapy is generally the treatment of choice for adequate management of cancer-related pain. Knowledge of these problems may help health care providers assess the most effective treatment options for cancer patients, and inform policy makers of the adjustments that need to be made to regulations to ensure cancer patients don't lose their access to opioids.
