Gut Microbiota and Glioblastoma Multiforme Prognosis
Glioma is the most common primary cancer of the central nervous system, and around 50% of patients present with the most aggressive form of the disease, glioblastoma. Conventional therapies, including surgery, radiotherapy, and pharmacotherapy (typically chemotherapy with temozolomide), have not resulted in major improvements in the survival outcomes with only a median survival of around 15 months.The main reason may be related to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In recent years, the microbiome has emerged as a key regulator of not only systemic immune regulation but brain circuitry, neuro-physiology and microglia development. We hypothesized that there is a link between the gut microbiota and the GBM development and evolution through the immune regulation cells (microglia and tumor related macrophagocyte) in the blood circulation to impact the prognosis( PFS and MST) of GBM patients.

Pre-operative gut microbiota in molecular subtype glioblastoma mutiforme multiform, To analysis the distribution and components of gut microbiota before operation, 12 months|The perturbation of gut microbiota by temozolomide chemotherapy, To investigate the change of components of gut microbiota induced by chemotherapy, 15 months|Link the gut microbiota and prognosis of GBM, To explore the correlation between the gut micriobiota and the prognosis (PFS and MST) by bioinformatic big data process., 20 months
We divide the paticipants into three groups. (total number = 200 subjects)

1. Radio/Chemotherapy group - 80 subjects
2. Radio/ without chemotherapy group - 70 subjects
3. Healthy volunteer group - 50 subjects

After the collection of stools before operation and 3 months after the operaton, we will analyze the composition and distribution of gut microbiota, and compare the results of three experiment groups.Then we will followe up the patients and analyze the correlation between gut microbiota and prognosis of GBM.
