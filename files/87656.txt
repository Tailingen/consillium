A Web-based Program to Help Caregivers of Lung Patients Learn About Available Supportive Care Resources
Clinical trial that tests the feasibility of a web based caregiver support resource, along with caregiver navigation sessions for caregivers of patients with stage II-IV lung cancer. The Caregiver Oncology Needs Evaluation Tool (CONNECT) is a novel web-based intervention designed for the community oncology setting, to systematically connect lung cancer caregivers with tailored supportive care resources. Lung cancer caregivers provide critical and challenging care for their loved ones and are at risk for their own negative psychosocial and physical outcomes. Implementing the CONNECT program along with caregiver navigation may provide additional support to caregivers of patients with stage II-IV lung cancer.

This study is a multi-site randomized pilot trial enrolling 120 lung cancer caregiver-patient dyads (i.e., lung cancer caregivers (n=120) and their care-recipients (n=120)) across approximately 8-12 practices to assess the multi-site feasibility of a caregiver technology-based intervention (CONNECT) to identify caregivers' needs and connect them with supportive care resources. Caregivers will be randomized 1:1:1 to either the CONNECT intervention, usual care comparison group or generic resource list comparison group. CONNECT is a web-based intervention that empowers and educates caregivers about the benefits of supportive care services and systematically identifies unmet needs to connect lung cancer caregivers with tailored supportive care resources. The Central Caregiver Navigator will assist caregivers with resolving barriers to accessing resources and work with the Local Practice Referral Coordinator to process referrals. Caregivers and patients will complete measures at baseline (prior to caregiver randomization), and 12 and 24 weeks after baseline. Feasibility measures (retention, accrual rates, and participation) will be evaluated to inform the future trial. The Local Practice Referral Coordinator for each practice will report on time needed for practice participation, referral processes, and communication processes with the Central Caregiver Navigator.

Participants (i.e., patients or care-recipients) will be asked to complete study surveys at three time points:

* After consenting and before randomization of participant and caregiver. (Initial survey)
* Approximately 12 weeks after completing the first survey (12-week survey)
* Approximately 24 weeks after completing the first survey (24-week survey)

Each survey will take about 30-45 minutes to complete. The forms will ask about things such as demographics (sex, race, etc.), cancer symptoms, satisfaction with cancer care and health behaviors. You don't have to answer any question that makes you feel uncomfortable. These surveys can be done remotely over the internet, in the clinic, by phone or by mail.

Caregivers will also complete surveys at three time points and will be assigned to 1 of 3 study groups:

* Group 1 will be given the usual care provided at your clinic. At the completion of the study, this group will be given the generic supportive care resource list for their use that Group 2 received.
* Group 2 will be provided with a generic supportive care resource list.
* Group 3 will be asked to watch a brief video and complete the web-based CONNECT program either in the clinic or on your own device. The CONNECT program is designed to help identify any unmet needs and connect the caregiver with tailored supportive care resources, based on specific needs. The CONNECT Navigator will follow-up with within 2 business days of completion of the program and again 4 weeks later.

Caregiver Participants (Group 1, 2 and 3) will be asked to complete study surveys at three time points:

* After consenting and before randomization of participant and caregiver. (Initial survey)
* Approximately 12 weeks after completing the first survey (12-week survey)
* Approximately 24 weeks after completing the first survey (24-week survey)

Each survey will take about 35-45 minutes to complete. The forms will ask about things such as demographics (sex, race, etc.), caregiving experience, use of supportive care resources, quality of life, mood, and social needs (housing, transportation, utilities, etc). You don't have to answer any question that makes you feel uncomfortable.
