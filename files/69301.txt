Head-to-head Study of 68Ga-MGS5 Versus 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in Patients With Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
Cholecystokinin-2 (CCK2) receptor is overexpressed in more than 90% of MTC cases, and preclinical studies have shown that 68Ga-MGS5 (targeting CCK2) has good stability in vivo and is promising for diagnosis and staging of MTC. This prospective study will compare the diagnostic effects of 68Ga-MGS5 and 68Ga-DOTATATE on MTC primary foci, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis, and explore the effect of 68Ga-MGS5 PET/CT on the clinical staging (TNM staging) of MTC.
Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma
DRUG: 68Ga-MGS5
SUVmax and SUVpeak, Determination of SUVmean and SUVpeak for detected lesions and discernible organs of 68Ga-MGS5 and 68Ga-DOTATATE scan., through study completion, an average of 2 years
immunohistochemistry, Primary and lymph node metastases were stained with CCK2 immunohistochemistry and scored., through study completion, an average of 2 years
This study was planned to enroll 20 patients with suspected MTC and MTC recurrence who attended the First Hospital of Fujian Medical University from June 2023 onwards. Each patient completed PET/CT examination within 1 week, one 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT whole-body examination and two 68Ga-MGS5 PET/CT whole-body examinations (1 hour and 2 hours after injection, respectively). CCK2 immunohistochemical staining and expression scoring of primary foci and lymph node metastases were also performed.
