GD2 CAR T Cells in Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas(DIPG) & Spinal Diffuse Midline Glioma(DMG)
The primary purpose of this study is to test whether GD2-CAR T cells can be successfully made from immune cells collected from children and young adults with H3K27M-mutant diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) or spinal H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (DMG). H3K27Mmutant testing will occur as part of standard of care prior to enrollment.
Glioma of Spinal Cord|Glioma of Brainstem
DRUG: GD2 CAR T cells|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Rate of successful manufacture of GD2CART using a retroviral vector in the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy system, The percentage of apheresis samples (fresh or frozen) will be determined for each dose cohort., 14 days after apheresis|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/RP2D of GD2CART in subjects with H3K27M DIPG, Severity of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) following chemotherapy and infusion of GD2CART cells, will be recorded and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 at each dose level tested in subjects with H3K27M-mutant DIPG following standard upfront radiation therapy., 28 days after infusion|Safety of GD2CART in subjects with spinal H3 K27M-mutant DMG treated at the RP2D, Severity of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) following chemotherapy and infusion of GD2CART cells will be recorded and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 in subjects with spinal H3K27M-mutant DMG following standard upfront radiation therapy, 28 days after infusion
Radiographic Response Rate, Radiographic Response will be evaluated using tumor response criteria:

Complete Response (CR): disappearance on MR of all evaluable tumor and mass effect; stable or improving neurologic examination. If CSF was positive, it must be negative.

Partial Response (PR): ≥ to 50% reduction in tumor size; stable or improving neurologic examination.

Stable Disease (SD): at least stable and maintenance corticosteroid dose not increased, and MR/CT imaging meets neither PR nor PD Progressive Disease (PD): Progressive neurologic abnormalities or worsening neurologic status not explained by causes unrelated to tumor progression; OR a \> 25% increase in the bi-dimensional measurement, OR the appearance of a new tumor lesion., Time Frame: Day 28, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months and 24 months post CAR T cell infusion.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the start of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen to the date of death from any cause, Time Frame: Day 28, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months and 24 months post CAR T cell infusion.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the start of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen to the date of radiographic progression or death from any cause., Time Frame: Day 28, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months and 24 months post CAR T cell infusion|Post-progression survival (PPS), PPS is measured for each subject with DIPG as OS minus PFS, and for each patient with recorded progression as OS minus Time to Progression (TTP), ime Frame: Day 28, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months and 24 months post CAR T cell infusion|Measure resolution of toxicity, Resolution of toxicity ≤ grade2, in the event unacceptable toxicity considered possibly, probably or definitely related to GD2CART cells within 72 hours, 72 hours of administration of AP1903
Primary Objectives:

* Determine the feasibility of manufacturing autologous T cells transduced with 14g2a-CD8-BBz-iCasp9 retroviral vector expressing GD2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (GD2CART) for administration in subjects with H3K27M+ diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) or subjects with spinal H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (DMG) using a retroviral vector and dasatinib in the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy® system.
* Assess the safety and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GD2CART in subjects with H3K27M+ DIPG administered after cyclophosphamide/fludarabine-based lymphodepletion regimen using the following dose escalation schedule: DL1: 1e6 transduced T cells/kg; DL2: 3e6 transduced T cells/kg; DL3: 10e6 transduced T cells/kg.
* Assess the safety of the MTD/RP2D of GD2CART in subjects with spinal H3K27M mutant DMG.

Secondary Objectives:

* In a preliminary manner, assess clinical benefit of GD2CART at the RP2D in subjects with H3K27M DIPG or spinal H3 K27M-mutant DMG.
* If unacceptable toxicity occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to GD2CART, assess the capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate clearance of the genetically engineered cells and resolve toxicity.
