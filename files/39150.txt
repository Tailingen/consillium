The Effect of Dexmedetomidine of the Immune System
The goal of this research study is to learn about how dexmedetomidine (a standard of care sedative) affects your immune system (your defenses against cancer) by measuring your white blood cell levels before and after surgery.
Breast Cancer
DRUG: Dexmedetomidine
Pre and Post Surgical Lymphocyte Counts, Lymphocyte counts determined by flow-cytometry and their function by cytotoxicity assays performed in the laboratory using samples obtained before and the morning after surgery. Patients who experience a reduction of less than 50% of their preoperative natural killer cell (NKC) activity considered as a success., 2 days
Dexmedetomidine is a type of sedative used as part of anesthetic care. It is sometimes used to help lower the amount of pain killers and other anesthetics that are given to a patient during surgery. Researchers want to study how this drug works in cancer patients and review the patient's chart for pain levels and medication use after surgery. Part of this research involves studying the immune system of surgery patients.

If you agree to take part in this study, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn before you have surgery and the morning after surgery while you are still in the hospital. This blood will be used to learn more about how your immune system works.

After your second blood draw, your participation in this study will be over.

This is an investigational study.

Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
