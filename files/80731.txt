An Exploration of Apatinib Combined With S-1 in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study is to explore the potential efficacy and safety of low-dose Apatinib combined with S-1 in patients with advanced lung cancer. Patients with advanced NSCLC will be treated with oral apatinib and S-1 after treatment failure of standard regimen.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib Mesylate tablet combined with S-1 capsules
Progression Free Survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the length of time from random assignment to disease progression or to death resulting from any cause other than the progress., 2 years
Overall Survival(OS), Overall Survival is defined as the length of time from random assignment to death or to last contact., 2 years|Objective response rate(ORR), Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1（RECIST1.1）, 2 years|Disease Control Rate(DCR), Disease Control Rate is defined as the percentage of subjects having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response + Stable Disease according to radiological assessments., 2 years|Adverse Events(AEs), AEs are evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0., 2 years
Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which selectively inhibits the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). The anti-angiogenesis effect of apatinib has been proved in preclinical tests. Phase II study has showed an improvement of progression free survival in pretreated patients. S-1, an oral fluoropyrimidine has considerable effectiveness with mild side effect in patients failed to standard treatments. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of low-dose Apatinib combined with S-1 in heavily pretreated patients with advanced lung cancer. And to explore the biomarkers of antiangiogenesis therapy and the possible mechanisms of treatment resistance on the basis of next generation sequencing.
