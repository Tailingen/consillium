Study of FP-1039 in Subjects With Endometrial Cancers
An open-label, non-randomized, single arm study to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of FP-1039 given by weekly intravenous (IV) administrations in advanced endometrial cancer patients with FGFR2-specific mutations. FP-1039 will be dosed weekly starting at a dose of up to 16 mg/kg.
Endometrial Cancers With FGFR2 Mutations
DRUG: FP-1039
Response rate, To assess the response rate of advanced endometrial cancer patients bearing FGFR-specific mutations, up to 1 year|Progression-free survival, To assess 6-month progression free survival of advanced endometrial cancer patients bearing FGFR-specific mutations, 6 months
Safety and tolerability, To evaluate the safety and tolerability of FP-1039 in subjects with advanced endometrial cancer, up to 1 year|Pharmacokinetics of Plasma, To determine pharmacokinetics (PK) plasma concentration at specified times, up to 1 year
FP-1039 will be administered intravenously over 30 minutes once a week. All enrolled subjects will be monitored for the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. Subjects with no evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity after 4 doses of FP-1039 may continue to receive weekly treatment provided there continues to be no evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dosing will be discontinued if a subject has evidence of disease progression. Disease will be assessed approximately every 2 months.
