Independent Risk Factors Analysis and Model Construction For Recurrence After Radiofrequency/Microwave Ablation of Colorectal Cancer With Liver Metastases: a Retrospective, Multicenter Trial
This study is a retrospective, multicenter clinical study. The main objective is to analyze the risk factors affecting the recurrence of colorectal cancer patients with liver metastases who received radiofrequency/microwave ablation. Finally, we will construct a recurrence risk prediction model based on the risk factors and validated the model.
