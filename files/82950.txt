Taxane Acute Pain Syndrome (TAPS) in Patients Receiving Taxane Chemotherapy for Breast or Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to document what course of action physicians choose for their patients when they develop taxane acute pain syndrome (TAPS) and to identify patients at the greatest risk of TAPS by examining specific human genome markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Copy Number Variations (CNVs) that may explain the genetic (hereditary) component.
Acute Pain
OTHER: Quality of life and brief pain inventory
The incidence of TAPS, Participant will be asked prior to each taxane chemotherapy if they experienced TAPS and complete quality of life questionnaires, Every 21 days over 12 weeks
The intervention used to reduced TAPS severity, The intervention used to reduced TAPS severity including

1. Analgesia - pain medication diary
2. Exercise
3. other, Every 21 days over 12 weeks|The TAPS associated treatment modification, The TAPS associated treatment modification

1. Taxane dose reduction
2. Chemotherapy treatment delay
3. Taxane discontinuation

i. No further treatment pursued ii. Or Switch to non-taxane chemotherapy due to taxane toxicity, Every 21 days over 12 weeks|Collection of whole blood and archived tissue for future SNP analysis, Profiling of SNPs will aid to understand the genetic basis for TAPS and outcomes. We will also collect serum and plasma for profiling serum metabolites, drug metabolites and correlate with genotypes (SNPs), At baseline and at one month from the end of Taxane chemotherapy
