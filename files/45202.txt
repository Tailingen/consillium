Second-Line Treatment for Patients With Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the progression-free survival of two treatment regimens for relapsed ovarian cancer.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression in measurable disease is defined as any of the following: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter target lesions; appearance of one or more new lesions; Death due to disease without prior objective documentation of progression; deterioration in health status attributable to the disease requiring a change in therapy without objective documentation of progression

Progression in non-measurable disease according to CA125 levels is defined as any of the following: CA125 that begins in normal range increases to twice the upper limit of normal; CA125 level that begins elevated increases 25% over two previous samples, a 50% increase over three previous samples, or a persistent elevation over 100 U/ml for more than 2 months without a 50% decrease., Every 6 months, to 18 months
Objective Response Rate, Complete response rate plus partial response rate, where: Complete response (CR) is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart and normalization of elevated CA125 in cases of ovarian cancer; Partial response (PR) for measurable disease is defined \>= 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of all target measurable lesions with no unequivocal progression of non-target lesions as well as no new lesions, with documentation by two disease assessments at least four weeks apart. PR according to CA125 levels is defined as a 50% decrease in CA125 levels where two initial samples were elevated and the sample that shows the 50% is confirmed by a fourth sample 28 days after the prior sample.

OR = CR + PR, Every 6 months, starting at 12 months to 24 months|Quality of Life, Quality of Life was measured using the Trial Outcome Index (TOI) score of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) instrument, version 4. The TOI portion of the FACT-O included questions related to Physical well-being (PWB), Social/Family well-being (FWB), and an ovarian cancer specific module (OCS). The PWB score range is from 0-28; the FWB score range is from 0-28; the OCS score range is from 0-44; this gives the TOI a score range from 0-100. (TOI = PWB + FWB + OCS)

With these instruments, a higher score indicates better health-related quality of life., Baseline performed 14 days before first dose, then every other cycle and at study termination|Recurrence-Free Survival, Recurrence-free survival is based on measurable disease using Kaplan-Meier estimates for the intent to treat (ITT) Population who achieved a complete response., Every 6 months starting at 12 months, to 24 months|Median Overall Survival, Every 6 months starting at 12 months, to 24 months
Primary Objective

The primary objective of the study is to compare the progression-free survival of two treatment regimens:

Taxotere速 30 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8, combined with carboplatin AUC 6 IV on Day 1, repeated every 21 days for 6 cycles or until disease progression. (A patient who has completed 6 cycles of treatment and who has achieved a partial response or stable disease may either continue or stop treatment at the investigator's discretion.)

Versus

Taxotere速 30 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and 8, repeated every 21 days up to 6 cycles or until disease progression. Followed by carboplatin (AUC 6) IV every 21 days if the patient does not achieve a complete response or has disease progression on Taxotere速. A patient who has achieved a complete response on Taxotere速 will be followed until the subsequent recurrence at which time she will then receive single-agent carboplatin. Carboplatin treatment will be discontinued if the patient has completed 6 cycles of treatment and has achieved a complete response or has disease progression. (A patient who has completed 6 cycles of carboplatin treatment and who has achieved a partial response or stable disease may either continue or stop treatment at the investigator's discretion.)

Secondary Objectives

The secondary objectives of the study are to compare the objective response rates (defined as a complete response plus partial response), duration of tumor response, median survival, QOL and safety in patients treated with the two regimens described above.
