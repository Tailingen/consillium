UARK 2006-66, Total Therapy 3B: An Extension of UARK 2003-33 Total Therapy
With this study - Total Therapy IIIB - researchers are extending the findings of Total Therapy III based what they have learned from the first two studies (Total Therapy I and II), with new research strategies designed to explore why chromosome abnormalities found in persons with multiple myeloma affect the outcome of drug therapy used in this disease."
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Velcade|DRUG: Thalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Adriamycin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Etoposide
To find out if outcomes of participants in this study will be better when compared to individuals who participated in Total Therapy II, especially those with chromosome abnormalities., 48 months
To find out if outcomes and incidence of toxicities of participants in this study will be better when compared to individuals who participated in Total Therapy III., 48 months
It is well known that myeloma patients with chromosome abnormalities are at higher risk because their disease tends to be more aggressive and does not respond to treatment as well as patients without chromosome abnormalities. When researchers at the Myeloma Institute looked at the results of Total Therapy II, they found that although research subjects with chromosome abnormalities had better outcomes (how many responded, and how long they survived) than those treated with standard chemotherapy; still their outcomes did not improve significantly with Total Therapy II, when compared to Total Therapy I.

The research in this new study is designed to target this high-risk group of individuals with chromosomal abnormalities. However, it is hoped that both groups of research participants - those with and without chromosome abnormalities - will derive benefit from changes made in this new research study.
