Analysis of Primary and Metastatic Tumors in Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma and Urothelial Carcinoma
This is a comparative study using resected/ biopsied tumors samples collected from renal cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma patients who underwent surgical removal of lesions, followed by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment targting programmed cell death 1 (PD1) but developed new lesions later were also removed and stored in the biosample repository (BSR). The histology and genomic analysis of the pre-treatment and metastatic samples from the same patient would be used to find out the changes that may have lead to metastasis. Also, metastatic samples from ICB naive patients would be collected and compared with those from ICB treated patients to find out if the metastasis in treated patients was due to development of reistance.
