Single-center Trial for the Validation of High-resolution Transrectal Ultrasound (Exact Imaging Scanner ExactVu) for the Detection of Prostate Cancer
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of HR-TRUS in detection of prostate cancer lesions relative to whole mount section after radical prostatectomy as the reference.
Prostate Cancer
DEVICE: HR-TRUS
Diagnostic accuracy of high resolution ultrasound, rate of adequately identified (positive or negative) lesions of prostate cancer, From date of HR-TRUS exam until the date of Prostate biopsy data are obtained (average of 7 days)
Precisions of high-resolution ultrasound and multiparametric MRI in the detection of lesions of prostate cancer., sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of high-resolution ultrasound and multiparametric MRI in the detection of lesions of prostate cancer., From date of HR-TRUS exam until the date of Prostate biopsy data are obtained (average of 7 days)|Morphology of lesions not detected by high-resolution ultrasound, Volume and grade of lesions not detected by high-resolution ultrasound, From date of HR-TRUS exam until the date of Prostate biopsy data are obtained (average of 7 days)|Localization of lesions not detected by high-resolution ultrasound, Location of lesions not detected by high-resolution ultrasound, From date of HR-TRUS exam until the date of Prostate biopsy data are obtained (average of 7 days)|Extra-prostatic extensions detected by high-resolution ultra-sound, Extra-prostatic extensions and seminal vesicle invasions detected by high-resolution ultra-sound in positive and negative sectors, From date of HR-TRUS exam until the date of Prostate biopsy data are obtained (average of 7 days)
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of HR-TRUS in detection of prostate cancer lesions relative to whole mount section after radical prostatectomy as the reference. The analysis will include the detection of all prostate cancer lesions as well as the detection of significant prostate cancer lesions. With this approach it is possible to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and overall accuracy of the correct detection of prostate cancer in the prostate. These results are of importance when the ExactVu ultrasound scanner is to be used later for prostate cancer diagnosis using targeted biopsies.
