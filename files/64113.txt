A Study of Individualized Radiotherapy Based on a Prediction Model of Lymph Node Metastasis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Objectives:

1. To further validate the predictive efficacy of our established microRNA prediction model of HCC lymph node metastasis.
2. To establish a precise therapeutic mode of prophylactic radiation therapy in high-risk patients with HCC with lymph node metastasis under the guidance of a microRNA prediction model.

2-year overall survival, The therapeutic effects are mainly evaluated by the 2-year overall survival., The outcome measures are assessed up to 2 years.
First, screening out patients who underwent hepatic tumor resection and pathologically diagnosed as HCC .

Thenï¼Œperforming the detection of miR-145, miR-31 and miR-92a by using the HCC lymph node metastasis microRNA correlation prediction model established in our previous study. The patients are judged as high risk of lymph node metastasis and low risk Patients, then high-risk patients under the condition of informed consent into the group, randomized into treatment group and control groups.

Last, Patients enrolled in the treatment group were treated with radiotherapy and followed up.
