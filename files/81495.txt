Topical Itraconazole in Treating Patients With Basal Cell Cancer
This phase 0 trial studies how well itraconazole gel works in treating patients with basal cell cancer. Itraconazole gel may help to treat basal cell tumors in patients.
Skin Basal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Itraconazole|OTHER: Placebo
Percentage change of GLi levels in treated vs untreated tumors, will be assessed as relative GLi1 mRNA expression, Up to 1 month
Change in BCC tumor size, Analyzed based on tumor size change (longest diameter, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] criteria)., At baseline, 1, 4, and 12 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if 12 weeks of topical itraconazole gel reduces basal cell carcinoma (BCC) biomarkers (Gli1, the target gene of the Hedgehog pathway).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine if topical itraconazole gel will decrease BCC size.

OUTLINE:

Patients apply itraconazole topically twice daily (BID) and placebo topically BID for 12 weeks.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 14 weeks.
