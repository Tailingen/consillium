International Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma Project
This study is to explore risk factors for poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in ENKTL, and establish a prognostic model for ENKTL patients treated with non-anthracycline based treatment.
Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type
Overall survival, Time between the date of diagnosis and any kinds of death, 5 year
Progression-free survival, Time between the date of diagnosis and any kinds of death or relapse/progression, 5 year
This is a retrospective cohort study using anonymized information from patients with ENKTL. The following criteria are required: (1) Patients diagnosed with ENKTL, nasal type between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2014; (2) Patients treated with non-anthracycline based therapy as an initial treatment. The pathology of initial diagnosis was reviewed by designated pathologists.
