Comparative Health Research Outcomes of NOvel Surgery in Prostate Cancer
Men diagnosed with significant cancer confined to the prostate currently undergo radical therapy directed to the whole prostate (radiotherapy or prostatectomy). These provide good cancer control but can cause significant side effects.

Focal Therapy involves targeting the cancer alone, whilst leaving healthy prostate gland alone. Case series have shown similar cancer control over 5 years with a much better side effect profile. However, there have been no randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing the success in cancer control and the quality of life in patients that undergo radical therapy vs those that undergo focal therapy. Further, there is a need to assess the use of additional therapies that may improve the cancer control outcomes following focal therapy. By having a trials platform with two RCTs (CHRONOS-A and CHRONOS-B) that reflect best patient and physician preferences/ equipoise, the investigators aim to answer these questions.

To improve acceptability, recruitment and compliance, the investigators have an embedded study aimed at reviewing clinician and patient perspectives and trial acceptability. CHRONOS-A will compare radical therapy to focal therapy, whilst CHRONOS-B will compare focal therapy alone to focal therapy with various therapies targeting the testosterone pathway that can shrink the cancer before it is treated. The investigators think this might improve outcomes further for men that definitely want focal therapy.

AIM:

CHRONOS-A

Pilot: To determine if men will agree to participate in a randomised controlled trial that randomly assigns them to focal therapy alone or radical therapy (radiotherapy or prostatectomy).

Main: To determine if focal therapy alone is non-inferior when compared to radical therapy (radiotherapy or surgery) in terms of progression-free survival at 5 years in men with clinically significant non-metastatic cancer.

CHRONOS-B

Pilot: To determine if men expressing a preference for focal therapy will agree to participate in a multi-arm, multi-stage Randomised Controlled Trial that randomly assigns them to focal therapy alone or focal therapy in combination with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant agents.

Main: To determine if focal therapy combined with neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant agents, compared to focal therapy alone, will improve failure-free survival at 5 years, in men with clinically significant non-metastatic cancer.

OBJECTIVES To deliver a trials framework that fits with existing patient and physician equipoise so that the investigators can answer the next generation of research questions to evaluate medium-term outcomes following minimally invasive focal therapy in the treatment of clinically significant, non-metastatic prostate cancer.

Embedded internal pilot objectives:

* Determine patient acceptance to randomisation.
* Conduct an embedded qualitative study of patient and clinician acceptance and experience of the linked randomised controlled trial CHRONOS design.
* Establish the feasibility of an economic evaluation alongside the main trial.
* Determine acceptability and completeness of resource use and utility measures.
* Identify the relevant NHS and non-NHS resource use to be collected alongside the main trial.
* Identify the relevant items to populate the Cost and Consequences framework.
* Perform preliminary analysis of pattern of missing data.

MAIN STUDY PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

CHRONOS-A:

To evaluate progression-free survival rates of focal therapy alone compared to radical therapy (radiotherapy or surgery) in the treatment of non-metastatic clinically significant prostate cancer. Progression-free survival is defined as time from randomisation to salvage whole-gland or systemic therapy, prostate cancer metastases or prostate cancer-specific mortality.

CHRONOS-B:

To evaluate Failure-Free-Survival rates of focal therapy alone compared to focal therapy combined with other therapies as a neoadjuvant strategy. Failure-Free-Survival is defined as time from randomisation to further focal therapy session or salvage whole-gland or systemic therapy or prostate cancer metastases or prostate cancer-specific mortality.

MAIN STUDY SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

Disease control:

Determine the histological, biochemical and oncological disease control for men undergoing radical therapy, focal therapy or focal therapy with neo/adjuvant treatments.

Adverse events and Functional Outcomes:

Determine the adverse events and functional outcomes after radical therapy, focal therapy or focal therapy with neo/adjuvant treatments

Health economics:

* Establish the NHS costs of the different interventions.
* Determine the Cost per QALYs (CUA), cost per PFS/FFS (CEA) and cost and consequences (CCA).
* Determine acceptability and completeness of resource use and utility measures.

Qualitative:

* Patient experience of consent and recruitment, including reasons for declining participation.
* Participants' motivation to accept randomisation to and compliance with an intervention, which may or may not include neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatments.
