High Dose PET/CT-guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy and Concurrent Chemotherapy in Esophageal Cancer
To assess the efficacy and feasibility of high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concurrent weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin for patients with locaregionally esophageal cancer
Esophageal Cancer
RADIATION: high dose radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy
overall survival rate, survival time was measured from the date of study enrollment to the date of death or last follow-up, one year
acute and late toxicities, Acute toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 4, 1 year
Standard dose chemoradiotherapy (SCRT) results in poor local control for localregionally advanced esopgageal cancer patients. Most local failures occur in the gross tumor volume.\[F-18\]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT can identify residual metabolic disease (RMD). Hyperfractionated radiotherapy allows for delivering a higher dose without increasing late toxicity. Our previous phase I radiation dose escalation trial demonstrated that 86 Gy could be safely delivered to the RMD with concurrent weekly paclitaxel and cisplatin in advanced esophageal cancer.The aim of this phase II study is to examine the efficacy of this regimen.
