Nivolumab With Ruxolitinib in Relapsed or Refractory Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
This is a Phase I/II, multicenter, open-label, dose escalation/dose-expansion study to evaluate the tolerability, safety, and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib when given with fixed dose nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).
Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Ruxolitinib|DRUG: Nivolumab
Maximum Tolerated Dose, To assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. (Phase I Only), 24 months|Overall Disease Control, To evaluate the best Overall Disease Control (CR+PR+SD) at 3 months of nivolumab in combination with ruxolitinib at MTD in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma using the modified Lugano Classification "lymphoma response criteria to immunomodulatory therapy criteria" (LYRIC)1 (Phase II Only), 24 months
Overall Response Rate, To characterize the Best Overall Response Rate (CR+PR) at 6 months of nivolumab in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL)., 24 months|Progression Free Survival, To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years for nivolumab in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma using the modified Lugano Classification "lymphoma response criteria to immunomodulatory therapy criteria" (LYRIC), 24 months|Duration of Response, To evaluate duration of response (DOR) at 2 years for nivolumab in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma using the modified Lugano Classification "lymphoma response criteria to immunomodulatory therapy criteria" (LYRIC), 24 months|Overall Survival, To evaluate overall survival (OS) at 2 years for nivolumab in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma using the modified Lugano Classification "lymphoma response criteria to immunomodulatory therapy criteria" (LYRIC), 24 months|Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, To characterize he safety and tolerability of nivolumab in combination with ruxolitinib as determined by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs) as defined by the NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE v4), 24 months
