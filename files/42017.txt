Leuvectin Followed By Surgery in Treating Patients With Stage II or Stage III Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Inserting the gene for interleukin-2 into a person's cancer cells may improve the body's ability to fight cancer. Using Leuvectin to deliver this gene may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of Leuvectin followed by surgery in treating patients who have stage II or stage III prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Leuvectin
Disease recurrence, Measure timing and rate of disease recurrence, 2 years
Safety of Leuvectin
OBJECTIVES:

* Assess the toxicity and tolerability of neoadjuvant Leuvectin in patients with stage II or III prostate cancer.
* Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen in preventing or delaying manifestations of disease progression as demonstrated by biochemical failure or clinical recurrence in this patient population.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive Leuvectin intraprostatically over 10-30 seconds under ultrasound guidance on day 0 followed by a second injection between days 4 and 7. Between days 8 and 14, patients undergo retropubic prostatectomy.

All patients are followed at 2 months. Patients with a PSA no greater than 0.2 ng/mL are followed at 4 months and 6 months, every 3 months for 12 months, and then every 6 months for 3.5 years in the absence of disease progression or biochemical failure.

ACTUAL ACCRUAL: 13 patients were accrued for this study.
