A Clinical Study of Bemcentinib With Standard of Care Chemoimmunotherapy in Untreated Advanced/Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With a Mutation in the STK11 Gene
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of bemcentinib with chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) when administered as first line (1L) treatment in participants with locally advanced (Stage IIIb/IIIC) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-squamous NSCLC with no actionable mutations and to determine the anti-tumor activity of the combination of bemcentinib with CIT when administered as 1L treatment in participants with locally advanced (Stage IIIb/IIIc) or metastatic (Stage IV) non-squamous NSCLC with serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) mutation and no actionable mutations.
