A Study of KB-0742 in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Solid Tumors Including Platinum Resistant High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC)
Part 1: Dose Escalation. The primary objective of Part 1 of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KB-0742 in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) solid tumors or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

Part 2: Cohort Expansion. The primary objective of Part 2 of this study is to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of KB-0742 in defined participant cohorts including Platinum Resistant High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer (HGSOC).
