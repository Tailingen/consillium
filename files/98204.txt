Molecular and Cellular Analysis of Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to investigate the different types and subtypes of cells found in breast tumors. The investigators will do this using a variety of molecular analysis tools that may allow for improved tests. The different types of cells in breast cancer impacts the way individuals respond to various treatments.

levels of GM-CSF in plasma, We will be measuring levels of GM-CSF (Granulocyte-macrophayge colony stimulating factor) from the plasma of the patient before during and after the irradiation treatment to study if there is any increase in the GM-CSF production, 10 years
