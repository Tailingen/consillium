Isolation Procedure vs. Conventional Procedure During Distal Pancreatectosplenectomy for Pancreatic Cancer
In the distal pancreatectomy (including pancreatic tail resection) for invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas, we evaluate the usefulness of a procedure of firstly transection of splenic arteries and veins (the isolation procedure group) compared to a conventional procedure of transection of the splenic vein at the end.
