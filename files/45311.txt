Cadonilimab in Combination With Bevacizumab and FOLFOX Regimen for the First-Line Treatment of Advanced Unresectable MSS-Type, RAS-Mutated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The dual immunotherapy regimen significantly outperformed previous chemotherapy or immunomonotherapy for MSS type advanced CRC in two key efficacy indicators, ORR and PFS. Researchers have also conducted in-depth analysis of patient transcriptomics, immune microenvironment characteristics, and other related information, which is expected to guide more accurate immune combination therapy for CRC in the future. Our team plans to conduct a multicenter, prospective, single arm clinical trial in patients with RAS mutant MSS unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer, with a focus on observing the 1-year progression free survival rate of the combination of two chemotherapy drugs, bevacizumab and Cadonilimab, as well as ORR, perioperative safety, and long-term survival.
