Therapeutic Response of Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma According to CHOI Criteria
Non-interventional study consisting of a population of patients who had received for soft tissue sarcoma by at least 2 courses of Yondelis® at a dose of 1.5 mg / m² / 3 weeks after failure or intolerance to doxorubicin / ifosfamide from 2007 to 2011.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma
To assess the feasibility of tumor response according to CHOI criteria, percentage of cases with a feasible evaluation according to CHOI, after 6 weeks of treatment
To classify patients into two categories (progression or no progression) according to RECIST and to CHOI, percentage of cases with a feasible evaluation according to RECIST, after 6 weeks of treatment|To determine percentage of false progression, define as patient progressing according to RECIST and not progressing according to CHOI number of patient in each categories, according to each method of measurement, after 6 weeks of treatment|To determine predictive values of progression free survival and overall survival, progression free survival = median time between date of inclusion and date of clinical or radiological progression overall survival = median time between date of inclusion and date of death, after 6 weeks of treatment|To characterize the profile of patients in false progression, patient in progression according to RECIST but not progressing according to CHOI, after 6 weeks of treatment
Patient selection is based on a database of retrospectively within the GSF / GETO.

The tumor assessment must be made by scanner at baseline and post-C2 or C3 and should be available and sent to sponsor.

The comparative reading of the imaging is centralized and made without the knowledge of the local assessment:

* sum of the large diameter for 2 imagery (baseline and 1st evaluation
* tumor density on areas of interest for the 2 imaging (baseline and 1st evaluation
* Rank patients according to two methods (Choi and RECIST): complete response, partial response, stability, progress and non-assessable.
