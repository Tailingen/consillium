Recurrences After Standard EMR vs Plus Thermal Ablation EMR
The primary objective of this trial is to investigate whether thermal ablation EMR with soft tip snare coagulation (STSC) reduces the recurrence rate of lateral spreading or sessile polyps ≥20mm compared to standard EMR.
Polyps of Colon|Recurrence, Local Neoplasm
PROCEDURE: Snare tip soft coagulation
Recurrence, Adenoma recurrence at resection site, 6 months
Rationale:

Lowering the EMR recurrence rate will potentially lead to fewer colonoscopies resulting in less additional costs, less compliance burdens and less exposure to possible procedure related risks.

Objective:

To investigate whether thermal ablation EMR with snare tip soft coagulation (STSC) reduces the recurrence rate of lateral spreading or sessile polyps ≥20mm compared to standard EMR.

Study design:

This study entails a patient-blinded multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial that will be conducted between January 2022 and May 2025 in 1 academic and 7 non-academic hospitals in The Netherlands and it will take place in the outpatient clinics of the participating centers.

Study population:

All patients aged ≥ 18 years with proven colorectal sessile of lateral spreading polyps (Paris classification 0-IIa/b/c, Is) with a diameter of ≥ 20mm requiring piecemeal resection with EMR are eligible for inclusion.

Intervention:

Snare tip soft coagulation of the entire EMR margin is a technique for the removal of potential residual adenoma.

Main study endpoint:

Polyp recurrence after 6 months follow up. Recurrence is evaluated histologically and endoscopically with biopsies taken during follow up colonoscopy.
