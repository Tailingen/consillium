Deuterated Phenanthrene Tetraol in Smokers Who Are at High Risk For Lung Cancer
This clinical trial studies deuterated phenanthrene tetraol in smokers who are at high risk for lung cancer. Studying samples of urine in the laboratory from smokers who are at high risk for lung cancer may help doctors learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the relationship between urinary deuterated (\[D10\]) phenanthrene tetraol (PheT) level, PheT:phenanthrols (HOPhe) ratio, and the presence of bronchoepithelial metaplasia and/or dysplasia in smokers who have undergone screening bronchoscopy at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI).

OUTLINE:

Patients receive deuterated phenanthrene tetraol orally (PO). Urine samples are collected for laboratory studies for 6 hours after dosing.
