Radioablation With or Without Androgen DeprIvation Therapy in Metachronous Prostate Cancer OligometaStAsis
A randomized phase II clinical trial (RADIOSA trial: Radioablation with or without Androgen DeprIvation therapy in metachronous prostate cancer OligometaStAsis).

The aim is to compare time to progression between the two study arms: SBRT only or SBRT and hormonotherapy (ADT). The primary objective is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the absence of new metastatic lesions (local, regional or distant) between the two arms. The secondary endpoints include the comparison of overall survival (OS), biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS), ADT-free survival, local control, treatment-induced acute and late toxicity, time to castration-resistant disease and QoL between the two arms; the development of a dedicated biobanking (collection of plasma and serum) for further biological investigation of predictive/diagnostic factors for personalized treatment; the preliminary evaluation of prognostic biomarkers; the correlation between imaging-derived parameters and treatment outcome.
Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)|RADIATION: SBRT
Progression-free survival (PFS), Defined as the absence of new metastatic lesions (local, regional or distant) between the two arms., up 3 months from the end of the treatment up to radiological progression within 3 years
Overall survival (OS), From the end of RT treatment to the time of clinical progression or mortality from specific disease cause, Up the end of SBRT until death for cancer or other causes up to 3 years|Biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS), Biochemical progression is defined according to the EAU guidelines \[18\], namely a rising PSA level \>0.2 ng/ml following radical prostatectomy and \>2 ng/ml above the nadir after radiation therapy., up 3 months from the end of the treatment up to 3 years|Numbers of patients who experienced acute and late toxicity, Toxicity will be assessed according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) toxicity criteria v4.3, Up to 1 months after treatment completion and then up to 3 years
