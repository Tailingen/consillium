DRUG: PLX2853
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., First dose of study drug through at least 30 days after end of treatment.|Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of PLX2853., From first dose of PLX2853 up to 30 days after end of treatment.|Maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of PLX2853., From first dose of PLX2853 up to 30 days after end of treatment.|Time to peak concentration (Tmax) of PLX2853., From first dose of PLX2853 up to 30 days after end of treatment.|Half life (t1/2) of PLX2853., From first dose of PLX2853 up to 30 days after end of treatment.|Number of participants who experience dose limiting toxicity as defined in the protocol., The highest dose level at which less than 2 of 6 participants or less than 33% of participants (if cohort is expanded beyond 6) experience a dose limiting toxicity will be considered the maximum tolerated dose / recommended phase 2 dose., Up to 2 years|Change in disease burden using RECIST 1.1 (solid tumors) or Lugano criteria (NHL)., Up to 2 years
Overall response rate (ORR) defined according to standard criteria for the relevant malignancy [Phase1b], From the first dose of study drug until the date of documented response to treatment, assessed up to 2 years.|Duration of response (DOR), DOR defined as the time from the initial objective response to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 2 years.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS time is defined as the time from the first dose of PLX2853 to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 2 years.|Overall Survival (OS), From the first dose of study drug until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 2 years.
