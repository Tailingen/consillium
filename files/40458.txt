Phase I Clinical Trial of CDP1 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CDP1 in patients with advanced solid tumor, to explore dose limited toxicity (DLT), and to determine the recommended dose (RP2D) for phase II clinical trials.
