A Study Evaluating the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of Alectinib in Pediatric Participants With ALK Fusion-Positive Solid or CNS Tumors
This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of alectinib in children and adolescents with ALK fusion-positive solid or CNS tumors for whom prior treatment has proven to be ineffective or for whom there is no satisfactory standard treatment available.
ALK Fusion-positive Solid or CNS Tumors
DRUG: Alectinib
Incidence of Participants with Dose-Limited Toxicities (DLTs), Cycle 1 (cycle length = 28 days)|Percentage of Participants with Adverse Events, Up to 10 years|Plasma Concentration of Alectinib, Up to 10 years|Plasma Concentration of Alectinib Metabolite (M4), Up to 10 years|Confirmed Objective Response Rate (ORR): Defined as the Proportion of Participants with Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) on two Consecutive Occasions >/= 4 Weeks Apart, as Determined by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), Up to 10 years
Confirmed ORR as Determined by the Investigator, Up to 10 years|Duration of Response (DOR) as Determined by BICR and the Investigator, From the first occurrence of a documented objective response (CR or PR) to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to 10 years)|Time to Response (TTR) as Determined by BICR and the Investigator, From the first dose of alectinib to the first documentation of objective response (CR or PR) (up to 10 years)|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) as Determined by BICR and the Investigator, 6 months after the first dose of alectinib|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) as Determined by BICR and the Investigator, From the first dose of alectinib to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (up to 10 years)|Overall Survival (OS), From the first dose of alectinib to the date of death due to any cause (up to 10 years)
This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of alectinib in children and adolescents with ALK fusion-positive solid or CNS tumors for whom prior treatment has proven to be ineffective or for whom there is no satisfactory standard treatment available.
