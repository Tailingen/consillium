Optimize the Support of Patients in Pelvic Onco-gynecology Through Adapted Support Care in the Post-cancer Period. AFTERGYN Pilot Phase
While the sequelae and toxicities after ovarian and endometrial cancer treatments are well described in the literature, the actual needs of patients for supportive oncology care remain poorly documented. Moreover, there is no data available to estimate the complexity of the oncological support care actions to be implemented.

It is expected that an evaluation of the needs for supportive oncology care and its organization in day hospitalization for supportive oncology care will lead to an improvement in personalized post-cancer follow-up for these patients and to an improvement in their long-term quality of life.
