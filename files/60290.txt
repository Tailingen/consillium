High vs Low Dose Dexamethasone on Complications in the Immediate Postoperative Phase After Mastectomy
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a single preoperative high-dose steroid injection on complications in the immediate postoperative phase after breast cancer surgery, with removal of the breast (mastectomy). Primary outcome is the proportion patients who require transfer to the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) and the proportion that can be transferred directly to the ward. Secondary outcomes are organospecific complications in the postanesthesia phase, pain and nausea the first 5 days, seroma and wound infection the first 14 days and readmissions the first 30 days after surgery.

The investigators hypothesize that the frequency of transfer to the PACU and organospecific complications will be lower among patients receiving high dose dexamethasone. The investigators hypothesize, that there will be no difference in wound infections, seroma or readmissions.

Post-surgery, patients are traditionally observed and treated in post-anesthesia care units (PACU) until they are discharged to the ward (or directly home) assessed by standardized international discharge criteria.

The research project "Why in PACU?" (Rigshospitalet, Denmark), has since the beginning of 2016 systematically collected and analyzed procedure-related complications in the recovery phase. The complications include pain, nausea/vomiting, circulatory and respiratory problems, orthostatic intolerance and cognitive disorders. Common to all the above-mentioned post-operative problems are the possible links to the inflammatory response caused by the surgical trauma.

Glucocorticoids can in this context be central for the reduction of acute postoperative organ dysfunctions, caused by the anti-inflammatory effect. In a number of different surgical procedures, single dose, pre-operative glucocorticoids have been shown to reduce post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), acute pain and need of opioids as well as accelerate the convalescence.

Meta-analyses also showed that single-dose administration of glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone and dexamethasone) for surgical patients is safe as opposed to long-term treatment.

Based on positive results in other procedure-specific studies, all mastectomy patients at Rigshospitalet, have received pre-operative high-dose steroids, in the form of 24 mg dexamethasone injection since mid-2015. This has resulted in a decrease in the proportion of patients who need observation in PACU from 30 % to 10 %. The reduction is primarily due to less pain, less sedation, and lower opioid administration.

Whether this is also partly due to a "systemic effect" (Hawthorn effect) as a result of increased focus on the area cannot be excluded.

Prior to creating clinical recommendations and standards, it is required that the results be tested in a randomized, controlled, clinical trial.

The study is not placebo-controlled since the positive effects of dexamethasone 8 mg on PONV have been shown in numerous trials, and is already being administered to all patients at the clinic. It would therefore not be ethically correct to withdraw from this practise.
