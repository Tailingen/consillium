ALL2008 Protocol for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Intermittent Versus Continuous PEG Asparaginase
The purpose of this study is to investigate if intramuscular PEG-asparaginase administered either at six or two week intervals from day 92 until 8 months from diagnosis for patients with non-HR ALL will result in equal probability of Event Free Survival
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: PEG Asparaginase at six weeks interval|DRUG: PEG Asparaginase at two weeks interval
Event Free Survival, 6 years
Secondary Outcome Measures are toxicity (special focus on thrombosis, pancreatitis, and allergic reactions), the formation of silent antibodies, and the influence of antibody production on the EFS., 6 years
20% of children with ALL still fails to be cured. The ALL-2008 protocol is a treatment and research protocol that aims to improve the overall outcome of Nordic children and adolescents with ALL in comparison with the ALL-2000 protocol and previous NOPHO protocols.

The specific and primary objectives of the randomised study is:

To test if intramuscular PEG-asparaginase administered either at six or two week intervals from day 92 until 8 months from diagnosis for patients with non-HR ALL will result in equal probability of EFS. As secondary endpoints asparaginase antibody production and toxicity including allergic reactions in the treatment-arms will be analysed
