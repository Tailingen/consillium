Selinexor in Combination With R-CHOP Followed by Selinexor Maintenance for Untreated EBV-positive DLBCL Patients
This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, phase Ib/II clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of selinexor in combination with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone) followed by selinexor maintenance for untreated EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients.

This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, phase Ib/II clinical trial to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selinexor when combined with R-CHOP regimen for untreated EBV-positive DLBCL patients.

Phase Ib study:

Selinexor will be given orally at two different doses (40mg qw, and 60mg qw ) and combined with the R-CHOP regimen from the second cycle based on the "3+3" principle.

In the induction therapy period, 6 cycles of R-CHOP regimen and 2 cycles of rituximab in combination with selinexor are planned.

The dose limited toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated after the first cycle of selinexor in combination with R-CHOP.

Phase II study:

The phase II study of selinexor at recommended phase II dose (RP2D) dose level combined with R-CHOP regimen was conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of the combined regimen.

After 8 cycles of induction therapy, if the response is assessed as complete remission (CR), maintenance therapy with selinexor will be conducted.
