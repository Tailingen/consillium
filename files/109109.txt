Evaluation of SclerFIX Graft in Scleral Thinning After Exeresis of Tumors of the Ocular Surface
The purpose of this open, multicenter phase II trial is to confirm the tolerance and evaluate the efficacy of the SclerFIX product, an allograft of umbilical cord lining membrane, in reinforcement of scleral thinning in patients who underwent eye tumor exeresis.
Scleral Thinning
BIOLOGICAL: SclerFIX
Rate of tectonic success of the graft at 3 months, The graft will be considered successful at 3 months if the curvature of the eye is respected without thinning, i.e., in the absence of edema, ulceration and loss of substance (thickness of the grafted area/thickness of the adjacent surface \> 80%). The scleral thickness will be determined from images obtained by optical coherence tomography (OCT)., 3 months
Absence of inflammatory reactions and good local tolerance of the implant, Composite score evaluating the presence of local reactions (edema, redness, vascularization, discharge) and of ulceration, pain and foreign body sensation (0: excellent local tolerance, 46: worst possible local tolerance), 15 days, 1 month, 3 months|Evaluation of the visual acuity, Scoring of blurred and poor vision (0: never, 4: all the time), 15 days, 1 month, 3 months|Evaluation of the eye pressure, Measure of eye pressure using a tonometer, 15 days, 1 month, 3 months
As scleral graft is forbidden in France, it cannot be used to reinforce the sclera. This study investigational product, SclerFIX, was developed to substitute scleral grafts.
