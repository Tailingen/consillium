Trial of Romidepsin and Bortezomib for Multiple Myeloma
This is a phase II, open-label, multicenter, dual-strata study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IV romidepsin given in combination with IV bortezomib for multiple myeloma (MM) patients with refractory or relapsed disease. Patients will be enrolled into one of two strata, bortezomib-resistant or bortezomib non-resistant.
