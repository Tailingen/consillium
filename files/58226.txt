A Phase I Trial of Myeloablative Conditioning w/ Clofarabine and HD Busulfan for Pts w/ Refractory Heme Malignancies Undergoing Allo PBSCT
This is a phase trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of clofarabine in a combination with a myeloablative dose of busulfan. This is an initial step in developing a novel myeloablative preparative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). While this phase I trial will initially develop the regimen in patients with refractory disease, it is expected that it will find its best application in patients with less advanced disease
Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: clofarabine
Determine the MTD of clofarabine in association with a myeloablative dose of busulfan as a preparative regimen in patients with refractory hematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic HSCT., 1 year
• Assessment of the toxicity of the combination of clofarabine and busulfan • Assess clofarabine and busulfan pharmacokinetics with combination therapy • Describe the response rate • Describe relapse rate and event-free survival, 1 year
All patients will receive the same dose of busulfan. The dose of clofarabine will be escalated in successive cohorts of patients. Using a standard dose escalation design, successive cohorts of 3 patients will be treated with escalating doses of clofarabine. At the MTD (or highest dose-level if the MTD is not reached), the cohort will be expanded to 10 patients to better investigate correlative studies and give some preliminary idea of efficacy.
