Study of TY-9591 in Patients With a Lung Cancer With Brain or Leptomeningeal Metastases With EGFR Mutation
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TY-9591 tablets in the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain or leptomeningeal metastases.
NSCLC|EGFR Activating Mutation|Brain Metastases|Leptomeningeal Metastasis
DRUG: TY-9591 Tablets
Intracranial Overall Response Rate (iORR), iORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best intracranial response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during the study treatment, 13 months.|Extracranial Overall Response Rate (eORR), eORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best extracranial response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during the study treatment, 13 months.
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) during the study treatment, 13 months.|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) , partial response (PR) or Stable disease (SD) â‰¥6 weeks during the study treatment, 13 months.|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the date of first documented response (PR or CR) until the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause during the study treatment, 13 months.|Median Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from date of first dose of study treatment until the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, 13 months.|Intracranial Median Progression Free Survival (iPFS), iPFS is defined as time from date of first dose of study treatment until the date of first documented intracranial disease progression or death due to any cause, 13 months.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment until death from any cause, From the date of first dose until the date of death from any cause or loss to follow-up, whichever comes first, assessed up to 100 months
This is an open label, multi-center phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety in EGFR mutated NSCLC patients with brain or leptomeningeal metastases. The patients will be assigned to the appropriate treatment cohorts based on the criteria.
