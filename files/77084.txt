Evaluation of Lithium and It's Effect on Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer
Laboratory testing has suggested that lithium may decrease the incidence of certain types of cancer, including prostate cancer. Additional research has suggested that lithium decreases prostate cancer tumor size over time. This study will investigate the effect of lithium on men with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Lithium Carbonate
Observe any change to Performance Status and Adverse Events related to Lithium, To determine the safety and tolerability of lithium in subjects with clinically localized prostate cancer., Weekly for 4 weeks prior to radical prostatectomy and continuing for 1 - 2 weeks after surgery
Serum lithium levels, To document observed levels of lithium in the serum, Weekly for up to 4 weeks prior to radical prostatectomy
Tumor response by lithium concentration, To evaluate tumor response by lithium concentration in the surgically removed prostate and serum PSA levels., Sample collected during surgery and up to 4 weeks after baseline
As lithium has been shown in an in vitro model to suppress cellular proliferation, and suppress tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model, we propose to determine its effect on prostate cancer cells in human patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. In this pilot study we plan to assess the toxicity of lithium administration in patients prior to radical prostatectomy. This will include any clinical toxicity as well as any increase in intra-, peri- or postoperative complications.
