Evaluation of 18F-Fluciclovine Positron Emission Tomography - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET-MRI) in LGG
The purpose of this study is to see if 18F-Fluciclovine (Axumin®) is useful and safe in the management of children with Low Grade Gliomas (LGG). Imaging with 18F-Fluciclovine PET-MRI will be performed prior to initiation of therapy for LGG, and then 3 months, and 1 year after starting therapy. Changes in 18F-Fluciclovine uptake will be compared to changes in MRI measurements at 3 months and 1 year as compared to baseline.

Compare change in standardized uptake value parameters (SUVmax and SUVpeak) on metabolic tumor volume in 18F-Fluciclovine PET, To identify change in the standardized uptake value (SUV) parameters (SUVmax, SUVpeak) for the 18F-Fluciclovine PET scan, 1 year|Compare changes in pretreatment tumor measurement on MRI in pediatric participants who initiate systemic treatment for LGG, Calculate the change in tumor measurement on MRI, 1 year
Safety of 18F-Fluciclovine, The Safety profile of 18F-Fluciclovine PET in pediatric LGG participants will be accessed by the CTCAE 5.0 toxicity experienced after administration of 18F-Fluciclovine, 13 months
