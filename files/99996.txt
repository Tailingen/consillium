Remote Monitoring of Cancer Patients With Outpatient Treatment
This project focuses on studying the use of digital platforms for monitoring, between medical visits, parameters such as toxicities and therapeutic adherence.

The goal of this observational study is to know the degree of usability of the Caaring® digital platform in cancer patients undergoing outpatient oral treatment. This will allow in the future to design comparative studies that demonstrate the advantages of using this application in the management of these patients.

Participants will fill out various questionnaires in the Caaring app related to their symptoms, adherence to treatment, quality of life and physical activity, among others.
Cancer Patients With Outpatient Treatment
Usability of Caaring® for the management of oncology patients in outpatient oral treatment, Percentage of patients with at least 80% of the data completed in the application, Percentage of patients with 100% of the data completed in the application and Percentage of completion per patient, Day 0 up to 3 months
Degree of completion of data relating to treatment adherence, The Degree of completion of therapeutic adherence by patients in Caaring application between visits is defined as the ratio between the questionnaires requested and completed., Weekly up to 3 months|Degree of completion of data related to the toxicity of their treatment, The Degree of completion of toxicity of their treatments by patients in Caaring application between visits: Percentage of patient participation defined as data completed among requested data; Percentage of patients with at least 80% of the data completed; Percentage of patients with 100% of the data completed and Percentage of patients with at least 80% of the data completed by questionnaire, Weekly up to 3 months|Quality of the care process through impact on the patient's quality of life: WHOQOL, Changes in patient's quality of life scale WHOQOL (World Health Organization Quality of Life) scores at the end of the study compared to baseline. Values (0-100), a higher score reflects a higher health-related quality of life., Day 0 and week 12|Quality of the care process through impact on the patient's quality of life: IPAQ, Changes in International Physical Activity Questionaire (IPAQ) scores at the end of the study compared to baseline. Values (46-100), a higher score reflects a higher Physical Activity, Day 0 and week 12|Patient workload, Evaluate the Patient workload through the percentage of patients who complete the study correctly by completing all questionnaires, Week 12
