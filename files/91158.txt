Prospective Study on Modified Delta-shaped Gastroduodenostomy in Totally Laparoscopic Surgery for Distal Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to explore the clinical application value of modified delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy in totally laparoscopic surgery for distal gastric cancer.
Stomach Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy|PROCEDURE: Laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy
3-year disease free survival rate, 36 months
Morbidity and mortality, The early postoperative complication and mortality are defined as the event observed within 30 days after surgery, while the time frame for late complication is the period from postoperative day 31th to the end of month 36th., 30 days;36 months|Intraoperative situation, Operation time, intraoperative blood loss and transfusion volume, conversive rate, intraoperative bleeding and viscera damage, and incision length are used to access the intraoperative situation, 1 day|Postoperative recovery course, Time to first ambulation, flatus, liquid diet and soft diet, duration of postoperative hospital stay and postoperative pain are used to assess the postoperative recovery course.Visual analog pain score method is used to evaluate the difference of postoperative pain degree., 10 days|Postoperative nutritional status and quality of life, The variation of weight, cholesterol and albumin on postoperative 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and the results of endoscopy on postoperative 3 and 12 months are used to access the postoperative nutritional status and quality of life., 12 months|Inflammatory and immune response, The daily highest body temperature before discharge and the values of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, prealbumin and relevant immune cytokines including T cell percentage, T-helper lymphocytes (CD4+) percentage, T-suppressor lymphocytes (CD8+) percentage, natural killer (NK) cells percentage from peripheral blood before operation and on postoperative day 1, 3, 5 are recorded., 7 days|3-year overall survival rate, 36 months|3-year recurrence pattern, Recurrence patterns are classified into five categories at the time of first diagnosis: locoregional, hematogenous, peritoneal, distant lymph node, and mixed type., 36 months
A prospective randomized comparison of the modified delta-shaped gastroduodenostomy in totally laparoscopic surgery and Billroth-I anastomosis in laparoscopy-assisted surgery for distal gastric cancer will be performed, to evaluate the clinical value and provide theoretical basis and clinical experience for the extensive application of the modified technique. The evaluation parameters are perioperative clinical efficacy, postoperative life quality, immune function and 3-year survival and recurrence rates.
