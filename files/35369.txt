CA 125 change as expressed by the KELIM parameter, The CA 125 decline will be calculated between inclusion and end of follow-up. Summarize by mean (SD) or median (25 and 75 percentils) depending if the data distribution is normal or not., up to 60 months|Progression free survival (PFS), The PFS wil be calculated between the date of inclusion and the date of progression or death. The follow-up of patients still alive without progression will be censored at the date of the last follow-up visit. The PFS curves will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods, up to 60 months|Overall survival (OS), The time to death wil be calculated between the date of inclusion and the date of death. The follow-up of patients still alive will be censored at the date of the last follow-up visit. Data on patients lost to follow-up will censored at the date of the administrative inquiry. The survival curves will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method., up to 60 months|Tumor response, The tumour response will be described using the overall response categories,according irRC criteria. Frequecy and percentages will be calculated by category., up to 60 months|Toxicity as assessed by CTCAE V.5.0 scale, Frequency and percentages of patients who had at least one AE will be calculated by category:

* Any adverse event (AE)
* Any AE related to study drug
* Any AE leading to permanent study drug discontinuation
* Any serious AE
* Any serious AE related to study drug
* Any serious AE leading to permanent study drug discontinuation

When n = 5 for PRR cohort and n = 10 for PSR cohort, treatment toxicity datas will be reviewed to the IDMC for validation and agreement to continue the study., up to 60 months
Translational research objectives n°1: Correlation between increase of Tumour Mutational Burden (TMB) after 6 weeks of treatment and response to the treatment combination., TMB will be categorised as high/intermediate/low. TMB after 6 weeks of treatment will be compared to TMB at baseline. Increase is defined as a change in the TMB category.

Response is defined as clinical and radiological non-progressive disease, as assessed by immune-related response criteria (irRC) (Wolchok et al. 2009) at 3 months in the PRR cohort and 6 months in the PSR cohort., up to 60 months|Translational research objectives n°2: Correlation between Homologous recombination (HR) status at baseline and response to the treatment combination., HR status will be categorised as deficient versus proficient based on genotyping of the baseline biopsy with an HR-genes panel.

Response is defined as clinical and radiological non-progressive disease, as assessed by immune-related response criteria (irRC) (Wolchok et al. 2009) at 3 months in the PRR cohort and 6 months in the PSR cohort., up to 60 months|Translational research objectives n°3: Correlation between tumour immune infiltrate and Immune Check Point (ICP) status at baseline and response to the association., Immune infiltrate and ICP status of the baseline tumour will be assessed by a targeted transcriptomic approach (IO360 panel, NanoString). Tumours will be categorised as inflamed/excluded/deserted. ICP status will be categorised as "PD-1/PD-L1 driven" versus "others ICPs involved".

Response is defined as clinical and radiological non-progressive disease, as assessed by immune-related response criteria (irRC) (Wolchok et al. 2009) at 3 months in the PRR cohort and 6 months in the PSR cohort.

The translational research will provide informations on:

Bevacizumab and olaparib have already been tested on 12 patients in a phase I trial at their usual doses (10 mg/kg q2w and 400 mg bid - 50 mg capsules -, respectively), and no DLTs were observed. The addition of an anti-VEGF small molecule, cediranib, to olaparib doubled the median PFS in a randomized phase II trial in patients with platinum sensitive relapse, with a manageable safety profile.

A recently reported phase I trial established the RDP2D of Durvalumab and Olaparib - 150 mg tablets -, when given in combination, at 1500 mg every 4 weeks, and 300 mg bid, respectively. In addition, the ENGOT/GINECO PAOLA phase III trial is currently evaluating the combination of Olaparib and Bevacizumab as first-line maintenance after platinum-paclitaxel combination, in patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. Under the hypothesis of a survival benefit in favor of this combination, it would also be of interest to assess the value of adding Durvalumab in order to improve the efficacy of the overall combination.

There are no trials to date assessing anti-VEGF in combination with anti-PARP and anti-PD-L1 therapy.

Beside additive efficacy, a synergistic effect could be expected :

* Between bevacizumab and durvalumab, through normalization of blood vessel and potentiation of immunologic infiltration.
* Between olaparib and durvalumab, through cytotoxicity-mediated release of antigens and impairment of mutation repair mechanisms, thereby increasing neoantigen loads.
* Between olaparib and bevacizumab, through tumor environment modulation and signaling of DNA damage inhibition, which has already been tested with the anti-VEGF cediranib.

For those reasons the sponsor propose a phase II trial of Olaparib, Bevacizumab and Durvalumab combination, in patients with relapsing AO high grade carcinoma :

* In platinum sensitive relapse (PSR), whatever the line, in patients not amenable to frontline surgery of the relapse and previously-treated by a platinum-containing chemotherapy in first line and

  * Either didn't receive any of the tested drugs,
  * Or previously received either bevacizumab or olaparib BUT NOT the combination of both drugs.
* In platinum-resistant relapse (PRR), in previously untreated patients for their relapse, or in patients who received a maximum of 1 chemotherapy regimen in this setting and either

  * Either didn't receive any of the tested drugs,
  * Or previously received either bevacizumab or olaparib BUT NOT the combination of both drugs.

The trial will also propose translational research, including :

* Assessment of germline and somatic BRCA mutations and determination of HRD phenotype and mutational load by NGS
* Quantification of mutagenesis in simultaneous treatment on ctDNA
* Characterization of immune response in the tumor by Nanostring immuno-oncology panel on tumors
