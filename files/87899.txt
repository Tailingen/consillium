Irofulven in AR-targeted and Docetaxel-Pretreated mCRPC Patients With Drug Response Predictor (DRP®)
The study seek to evaluate the anti-tumor effect after treatment of Irofulven in combination with prednisolone in patients who progressed on androgen receptor(AR)-targeted therapy and Docetaxel-Pretreated Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients. A drug response predictor (DRP®) biomarker in prostate cancer patients will identify patients likely to respond to and benefit from treatment with Irofulven.
