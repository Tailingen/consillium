PSMA and C-11 Choline PET in Patients With Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer
Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning. In this protocol we will image patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer using 11C-Choline PET and Gallium-68 labeled HBED-CC PSMA (more commonly called 68Ga-PSMA-11) or F-18 labeled PSMA 1007 in order to demonstrate their utility in detecting prostate cancer.
