Study of Orally Administered AG-881 in Patients With Advanced Hematologic Malignancies With an IDH1 and/or IDH2 Mutation
The purpose of this Phase I, multicenter study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-881 in advanced hematologic malignancies that harbor an IDH1 and/or IDH2 mutation
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Hematologic Malignancies
DRUG: AG881
Safety/tolerability; incidence of adverse events, Up to 26 weeks, on average|Maximum Tolerated Dose and/or the recommended Phase II dose of AG-881 in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, Up to 26 weeks, on average
Pharmacokinetics of AG-881 in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, Up to 26 weeks, on average|Pharmacodynamic levels of AG-881, Up to 26 weeks, on average|Pharmacodynamic levels of 2-HG, Up to 26 weeks, on average|Clinical Activity according to the 2003 revised IWG criteria for AML, the 2006 modified IWG criteria for MDS, disease-specific response criteria for other hematologic malignancies, Up to 26 weeks, on average
The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-881 to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose. The second portion of the study is a dose expansion phase where patients will receive AG-881 to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the recommended Phase II dose. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs or the patient is removed at the discretion of the investigator.
