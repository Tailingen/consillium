Detection of Tumor DNA in Blood Samples From Cancer Patients
The aim of this study is to employ genomic detection methodologies to measure the relative amount of tumor nucleic acids in the blood of a cancer patient with diagnosed metastatic disease that is either commencing, currently undergoing or completed cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment. More generally, this approach will allow us to develop a quantitative measure of therapy efficacy via the counting of the relative changes in tumor molecules over the course of treatment.
