A Trail of Fluzoparil in Combination With Temozolomide in Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma
This is a one arm, open, single center phase II study. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluzoparil combined with temozolomide in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.
Glioblastoma
DRUG: fluzoparil|DRUG: temozolomide
6-months PFS rate in all participants by RECIST 1.1, 6-months progression-free survival rate in all participants by RECIST 1.1, Up to approximately 24 months
ORR in all paients by RECIST Version 1.1, ORR was assessed by performing study imaging every 6-9 weeks after the first dose of study treatment. ORR was defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who had a CR defined as a disappearance of all target lesions with pathological lymph nodes having a reduction in short axis to \<10 mm) or PR defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, using the baseline sum diameters as a reference., Up to approximately 24 months|Disease control rate in all patients by RECIST Version 1.1, Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of patients whose best curative effect reaches complete remission, partial remission or disease control. Maintain for at least 4 weeks by RECIST Version 1.1, Up to approximately 24 months|Overall survival (OS) in all participants, OS was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to death due to any cause. OS was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method for censored data and reported in months., Up to approximately 24 months|mPFS in all participants, mPFS was defined as as the median time from the first day of study treatment to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Up to approximately 24 months|mOS in all participants, mOS was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 24 months|Number of participants experiencing an adverse event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product/protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a preexisting condition temporally associated with the use of the product was also an AE. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, resulted in or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, was a cancer, was associated with an overdose, was another important medical event., From first dose to last dose of treatment plus 2 months of follow-up, up to 24 months|Number of participants experiencing a serious adverse event (SAE), Any event which causes death, permanent damage, birth defects, or requires hospitalization is considered an SAE., From first dose to last dose of treatment plus 2 months of follow-up, up to 24 months
