Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double Blind Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of 2LVERU®JUNIOR and 2LVERU® on the Treatment of Warts
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common, as most people will experience infection during their lifetime. The most common manifestation of HPV infection is common warts. Common warts may appear at any age.

Conventional treatments can be used to treat warts and they are based on two mechanisms: stimulation of cellular immunity against HPVs or destruction of the lesion. These treatments are based on the location of the wart and the degree of the symptoms.

No specific antiviral therapy is available to cure warts and today, there is no treatment that allows the definitive eradication of the virus.

The 2LVERU® has been available for more than 20 years, and has received a marketing authorization in Belgium by the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAMHP). It is used as an immune regulator in the treatment of common warts (verruca vulgaris), flat warts (verruca plana) or plantar warts (verruca plantaris) caused by Human Papillomavirus. Since 2LVERU® has been made available, clinical observational data collected on treated patients have shown the beneficial effect on the disappearance of warts.

The purpose of this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial is the comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the disappearance of warts at the end of treatment (6-month visit) between the 2LVERU® JUNIOR and 2LVERU® versus the placebo group.
Common Wart|Flat Wart|Plantar Wart
DRUG: 2LVERU® or 2LVERU® JUNIOR|DRUG: Placebo
Disappearance of warts at the end of treatment (6-month visit), A wart will be considered as disappeared if the colour and texture of the skin has returned to normal and can no longer be felt to the touch., 6 months
Disappearance of warts at 4 months., 4 months|Disappearance level (total disappearance, partial disappearance (50%), no modification, increase of number of warts) at 4 months, 4 months|Warts recurrence at 9 months, 9 months|Pain evaluation during the study by visual analogic scale and consumption of antalgic medication., Minimum value: 0 (better outcome) Maximum Value: 10 (worse outcome), 6 months|Safety: occurence of adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs), considered as related or not to the study drug., 6 months|Disappearance level (total disappearance, partial disappearance (50%), no modification, increase of number of warts) at 6 months, 6 months
The study duration will be maximum 45 months with 36 months of inclusion and 9 months of follow-up.

Patients aged 3 years and older who present common warts (Verruca vulgaris), and/or plantar warts (Verruca plantaris), and/or flat warts (Verruca plana) during a visit with their dermatologist/general practitioner.

The total number of patients to include will be 162.

Primary objective:

Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the disappearance of warts at the end of treatment (6-month visit) between the 2LVERU® JUNIOR and 2LVERU® versus the placebo group.

Secondary objectives

* Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the disappearance of warts at 4 months between groups.
* Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the level of disappearance (4 levels) of warts at 4 months and 6 months (end of the treatment) between groups
* Comparison of the efficacy of the treatment on the recurrence of warts 3 months after the end of treatment between groups
* Compare the pain related to warts during the study between groups
* Safety issues.

Treatment phase:

* Group n°1 = 2LVERU® JUNIOR / 2LVERU® (6 months of treatment)
* Group n°2 = Placebo (6 months of treatment)

Post-treatment Follow-up phase: 3 months

Treatment will be considered successful if the following three criteria are met for all treated warts as described at the baseline visit:

* Normal skin colour at the wart site
* Normal skin texture at the wart site
* Normal touch at the wart site Treatment will be considered a failure, at the end of the treatment, if at least one of the above three criteria is not met for all treated warts as described at the baseline visit.
