Clinical Study of SPH3348 Tablets, a C-Met Inhibitor, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a phase 1 clinical trial of SPH3348 tablets, a c-Met inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors with c-Met abnormalities. A modified 3 + 3 design was adopted in patients with advanced solid tumors with c-Met abnormalities, with a total of 6 dose groups, in which accelerated dose escalation was adopted for the lowest dose group, and 3 + 3 dose escalation was adopted from the second dose group. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SPH3348 tablets in patients with advanced solid tumors with c-Met abnormalities.
