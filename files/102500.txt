Treatment with Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy on the Change of Cognitive Function in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients: a Prospective Cohort Study
This is an observational cohort study aimed at investigating changes in hippocampal function and its impact on cognitive function in newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients without metastasis, from baseline to a period after radiotherapy.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC)|Cognitive Function
Incidence of cognitive decline., In a cohort of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy, we will observe the incidence of cognitive decline from baseline, at the end of radiotherapy, and post-treatment. The study will investigate the impact of hippocampal radiation dose on cognitive function in these patients and summarize the patterns of change., 2 years
The relationship between hippocampal atrophy, radiation dose, and cognitive function after radiotherapy., Statistical analysis will be conducted based on the changes in hippocampal volume before and after radiotherapy, tumor target dose, hippocampal irradiation dose, and cognitive function scale test results., 2 years|The relationship between hippocampal functional impairment, radiation dose, and cognitive function after radiotherapy., Using resting-state fMRI technology, individual local brain function and default network information will be obtained. Variance analysis will be used to compare hippocampal changes before and after radiotherapy, clarifying the relationship between hippocampal functional damage, radiation dose, and cognitive function post-radiotherapy., 2 years|The relationship between hippocampal microstructural damage, radiation dose, and cognitive function after radiotherapy., Using Synthetic MRI imaging technology, imaging data of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients will be collected before and after radiotherapy to provide individual whole-brain quantitative parameters and hippocampal microstructural information. Variance analysis will be used to compare pre- and post-radiotherapy differences, elucidating the relationship between hippocampal microstructural damage, radiation dose, and cognitive function., 2 years|The relationship between hippocampal microvascular injury, radiation dose, and cognitive function after radiotherapy., Based on multimodal MRI technology, this study will explore the microvascular status and changes in blood perfusion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before and after radiotherapy, clarifying the relationship between hippocampal microvascular damage, radiation dose, and cognitive function post-radiotherapy., 2 years|The impact of different chemoradiation treatment modalities on the occurrence of cognitive decline., According to the TPS planning system dose statistics and dose-volume histogram, we will quantify the irradiation dose-volume of critical organs, including: hippocampal volume, tumor target volume, clinical target volume, and planning target volume; maximum dose and average dose of the hippocampus, as well as parameters on the dose-volume histogram. The cognitive function of patients after radiotherapy will be evaluated based on common adverse events as defined by CTCAE., 2 years|The correlation between cognitive decline after radiotherapy and quality of life., "The quality of life will be prospectively assessed before treatment and followed up continuously after radiotherapy.", 2 years
