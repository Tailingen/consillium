Study Evaluating Temsirolimus (CCI-779) In Breast Neoplasms
To evaluate the preliminary activity and pharmacokinetics of 2 separate doses and schedules of orally administered Temsirolimus (CCI-779) given in combination with daily letrozole, compared to letrozole alone, in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women. All patients must be appropriate to receive endocrine therapy as treatment for advanced disease.
Breast Neoplasms
DRUG: Letrozole / Temsirolimus (CCI-779)|DRUG: Letrozole / Temsirolimus (CCI-779)|DRUG: Letrozole
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR), OR measured as Complete response (CR) or Partial response (PR) confirmed by assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for the response are first met. CR=disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with normalization of tumor marker level; PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, referencing the screening sum LD. Target lesions=all measurable lesions up to 5 lesions per organ (10 lesions in total), representative of all involved organs, if possible; recorded and measured at screening. Non-target lesions=all other lesions., Baseline, every 4 cycles (1 cycle is defined as a 14 day duration) up to Cycle 25, then every 6 cycles until disease progression
Percentage of Participants With Best Overall Response (Clinical Benefit), Best response (CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) lasting ≥6 months) recorded from baseline to disease progression or recurrence (Progressive disease \[PD\]). CR=disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with normalization of tumor marker level; PR is ≥30% decrease in sum of LD of target lesions; SD=neither sufficient shrinkage to=PR nor sufficient increase to=PD, referencing smallest sum LD since treatment started; PD is ≥20% increase in sum of LD of target lesions referencing smallest sum of LD; appearance of ≥1 new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions., Baseline, every 4 cycles (1 cycle is defined as a 14 day duration) up to Cycle 25, then every 6 cycles until disease progression)|Time to Disease Progression, Number of days to disease progression defined as the interval from the date of randomization until the first date that recurrence or progression is documented; progression (at least 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum of LD; appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions)., Baseline, every 4 cycles (1 cycle is defined as a 14 day duration) up to Cycle 25, then every 6 cycles until disease progression)|Time to Treatment Failure, Number of days to treatment failure defined as interval from start of treatment to first date of progressive disease (at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started; appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions) or death or discontinuation of treatment due to Adverse Event, censored at last evaluation., Baseline until Progressive disease, death, or discontinuation of study treatment|Percentage of Participants Exhibiting Freedom From Progression, Freedom from progression defined as CR (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with normalization of tumor marker level), PR (at least a 30% decrease in sum of the LD of target lesions taking as reference the screening sum LD), or SD (neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD \[at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started; appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions\])., Baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months|Duration of Response, Duration of response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that reoccurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started; the minimal time interval for duration of SD is 8 weeks., Baseline, every 4 cycles (1 cycle is defined as a 14 day duration) up to Cycle 25, then every 6 cycles until disease progression)|Number of Participants With Survival, Number of participants with survival (alive) in the interval from start of treatment to last contact for participant or death as a result of any cause., Baseline, every 4 cycles (1 cycle is defined as a 14 day duration) until death|Health Outcomes Assessment: EuroQol (EQ-5D) Health State Profile Score, EQ-5D is a self-administered questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in 5 domains (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression). Scores from the 5 domains are used to calculate the Health State Profile Score as a single index value; range: 0.0 (death) to 1.0 (perfect health); higher scores indicate a better health state., Prior to baseline, Cycle 7 (Week 12) and final visit (within 15 days of stopping study treatment)|Health Outcomes Assessment: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionaire (EORTC QLQ) BR23, Assess specificity of breast cancer symptoms relevant to participant's perceived quality of life (disease related symptoms of dry mouth, eye pain, hair loss, hot flushes, attractiveness, future health, sexual activity, arm or shoulder pain, breast pain, swollen breast, and skin problems on the breast). 23-item assessment of symptoms or problems during the past week (items 1-13 and 17-23) or during the past 4 weeks (items 14-16); range from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Index scores transformed and range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate higher level of functioning and quality of life., Prior to baseline, Cycle 7 (Week 12) and final visit (within 15 days of stopping study treatment)|Number of Participants With Antitumor Response in Relation to Expression of Akt Phosphorylation, Cyclin D1, PTEN, and p27, Number of participants with antitumor response (CR \[disappearance of all target and non-target lesions with normalization of tumor marker level\] or PR \[at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, referencing the screening sum LD\]) in relation to plasma levels of Akt phosphorylation, cyclin D1, PTEN, and p27., Prior to baseline, after Cycle 4 (Week 8), after Cycle 8 (Week 14), and cross-over or final visit (within 15 days of stopping study treatment)|Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) Sum, Area under the concentration-time curve to infinity (AUC) measured as hours multiplied by nanograms divided by milliliters (hr\*ng/mL) for CCI-779, sirolimus and letrozole. Sum is calculated as the sum of CCI-779 plus sirolimus AUCs (AUCsum)., Cycle 1 Day 1 (1 cycle is defined as a 14 day duration) , Cycle 3 Day 1, and Cycle 4 Day 1, Day 6, Day 9, Day 11, and Day 12|24-hour Trough Concentration (C Trough), C trough in whole blood measured as nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)., Cycle 1 Day 1 (1 cycle is defined as a 14 day duration) , Cycle 3 Day 1, and Cycle 4 Day 1, Day 6, Day 9, Day 11, and Day 12
