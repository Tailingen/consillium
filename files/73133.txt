Utilization of Microbiome as Biomarkers and Therapeutics in Immuno-Oncology
This is an open label, single-center, non-randomized clinical trial on utilization of microbiome as biomarkers and therapeutics in immuno-oncology.

This research consists of two parts:

part 1: development of microbiome biomarkers for immuno-oncology part 2: proof-of-concept trial on the fecal microbiota transplantation in patients who are being treated with immunotherapy for advanced solid tumor
Solid Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: fecal microbiota transplantation
Overall Response Rate, the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1 or immune RECIST(iRECIST), 5 years
