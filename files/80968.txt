Serologic Response to Pneumococcal Vaccination Among Esophageal Cancer Patients With High Grade Lymphopenia After Chemoradiation
To learn how radiation treatment may affect your responses to vaccines against pneumonia.
Pneumococcal Vaccine|Esophageal Cancer|Lymphopenia|Chemoradiation
BIOLOGICAL: Pneumonia vaccine
Impact of grade IV radiation-induced lymphopenia on serologic responses to pneumococcal vaccination, Serologic responses will be calculated as the average fold change in antibody titer for each of 20 pneumococcal serotypes between baseline (time 0) and the first post-vaccination blood draw., through study completion; an average of 1 year
Primary Objectives

- Determine the impact of Grade IV radiation-induced lymphopenia on serologic responses to pneumococcal vaccination.

Secondary Objectives

* Determine the impact of chemoradiation on serologic responses to pneumococcal vaccination.
* Determine the impact of radiation modality on serologic responses to pneumococcal vaccination.
* Determine the impact of radiation modality on systemic immunity.
* Determine the incidence of pneumonia among patients treated with a pneumococcal vaccine.
* Determine the impact of radiation modality on pathologic response.
* Determine the impact of radiation modality on intratumoral immunity.
* Determine the relationship between changes in systemic and intratumoral immunity and clinical outcomes (i.e., incidence of pneumonia and pathologic response)
* Determine the impact of tumor histology on serologic responses to pneumococcal vaccination.
