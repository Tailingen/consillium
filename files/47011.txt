Immunosensitized Radiotherapy Combined With Evoximab (AK112) and Chemotherapy Neoadjuvant Therapy for Stage II-III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This is an open label, prospective, single center Phase II clinical study. Intended to evaluate the main pathological response rate (MPR) and safety of stereotactic immunosensitized radiotherapy combined with Evoximab (PD-1/VEGF-A bispecific antibody) and chemotherapy neoadjuvant therapy for stage II-III NSCLC. Simultaneously observe and evaluate the complete pathological response rate (pCR), R0 resection rate, and event free survival (EFS) of stage II-III NSCLC treated with stereotactic radiotherapy combined with Evoximab (PD-1/VEGF-A bispecific antibody) and chemotherapy. Exploratory analysis based on serum/tumor molecular biological markers, as well as the optimal response time and mechanism for combined response.

Major Pathological Response (MPR) Rate, MPR refers to pathology where the proportion of cancer cells in excised tumors and lymph nodes is less than 10%., Up to 6 months|Safety and tolerability, Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Up to 6 months
Pathological complete response (pCR), Pathological complete response (pCR): defined as the absence of residual tumor cells after evaluation of the excised tumor tissue and regional lymph nodes, Up to 6 months|EFS, Event free survival (EFS): EFS is defined as the time from randomization to exclusion of surgical progression, local or distant recurrence, or death from any cause, Up to 6 months
Exploratory purposes, Exploratory analysis based on serum/tumor molecular biological markers, as well as the optimal response time and mechanism for combined response., Up to 6 months
