Study of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Given With Steroids In Participants With Relapsed Or Refractory Large B-Cell Lymphoma
The goal of this clinical study is to learn more about the study drug, axicabtagene ciloleucel, in participants with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) in the outpatient setting.

EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 components: a descriptive system of the participant's health and a rating of his or her current health state on a 0-100 VAS. The descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Rating gets recorded on a vertical VAS in which the endpoints are labeled best imaginable health state is 100 (on the top) and worst imaginable health state is 0 (on the bottom). Higher scores of EQ VAS indicate better health., Baseline, 6 Months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) as Assessed by Investigator Assessment, ORR is defined as the incidence of either a complete response or a partial response by the revised international working group (IWG) response criteria for malignant lymphoma., Up to 24 months|Complete Response (CR) Rate as Assessed by Investigator Assessment, CR rate is defined as the incident of complete response., Up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR) as Assessed by Investigator Assessment, DOR is defined as the time from first objective response to disease progression per the revised IWG response criteria for malignant lymphoma or death from any cause., Up to 24 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigator Assessment, PFS is defined as the time from the axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion date to the date of disease progression per the revised IWG response criteria for malignant lymphoma or death from any cause., Up to 24 months|Event Free Survival (EFS) as Assessed by Investigator Assessment, EFS is defined as the time from infusion to the earliest date of disease progression per the revised IWG response criteria for malignant lymphoma, commencement of new anti-lymphoma therapy, or death from any cause., Up to 24 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from axicabtagene ciloleucel infusion to the date of death., Up to 24 months|Peak Serum Levels of Homeostatic/Proliferative Cytokines: Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, and IL-15, Up to 24 months|Peak Serum Levels of Inflammatory and Immune Modulating Cytokines: IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-6, IL- 13, IL-17, IL-1, IL-1RA, Granulocyte-macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-α), and IL-12p40/p70, IFN-γ=Interferon-Gamma, IL-1RA=IL-1 Receptor Antagonist, Up to 24 months|Peak Serum Levels of Immune Effector Molecules: Granzyme A, Granzyme B, and Perforin, Up to 24 months|Peak Serum Levels of the Acute Phase Response Proteins: C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Serum Amyloid A (SAA), Soluble IL-2 Receptor Alpha (sIL-1Ra), Ferritin, Up to 24 months|Peak Serum Levels of Chemokines: IL-8, C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand-10 (CXCL-10), and Monocyte Chemotactic Protein-1 (MCP-1), Up to 24 months|Blood Levels of Axicabtagene Ciloleucel Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells Over Time, Up to 24 months
Participants who complete at minimum 24 months follow up will be transitioned to a separate long-term follow-up study (study KT-US-982-5968) to complete the remainder of the 15-year follow-up assessments.
