A Randomised Study Comparing Tissue Conservation in Conventional Versus Mohs' Surgery of Basal Cell Carcinoma
We have compared to types of surgery to assess which one leaves the smaller surgical defect.
Carcinoma, Basal Cell
PROCEDURE: standard surgery|PROCEDURE: Mohs micrographic surgery
defect size after surgery, immediately after surgery
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of a nodular basal cell carcinoma of less than 1 centimetre and 1 centimetre away from eyes, nose and ears were either randomized to undergo Mohs Micrographic Surgery or standard surgical excision. After the tumour had been removed the defect was measured.
