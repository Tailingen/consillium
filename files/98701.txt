The Recombinant Humanized Anti-TIGIT Monoclonal Antibody (JS006) Monotherapy and in Combination With Toripalimab in Patients With Advanced Tumor
This is an open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JS006 as Monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab in patients with advanced tumors who have failed standard therapies or who have no standard therapy. It is planned to enroll 69-176 patients into the study.
Advanced Tumors
DRUG: JS006 as Monotherapy|DRUG: JS006 in combination with Toripalimab
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of JS006 as Monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab in patients with advanced tumors, Incidence and severity of dose limiting toxicity (DLT), adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and immune-related adverse events (irAEs); abnormal changes with clinical significance in the laboratory and other tests, 2 years|Determing the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose for JS006 as Monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab in patients with advanced tumors, Maximum tolerated dose: Dose Limitted Toxictiy events occurred at a rate less than 1/3 of the maximum tolerated dose.

Phase II recommended dose: safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy data of dose escalation will be integrated. When the Maximum tolerated dose(MTD) is determined, the Maximum tolerated dose(MTD) is usually used as the Phase II recommended dose(RP2D), or the dose lower than the Maximum tolerated dose(MTD) is selected as the Phase II recommended dose(RP2D) based on the comprehensive data., 2 years
Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile: JS006, JS006 concentrations in individual subjects at different time points after dosing of JS006., 2 years|To determine the immunogenicity of JS006 as monotherapy and in combination with toripalimab in patients with advanced tumors, Immunogenicity: incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) and/or neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) of JS006 and toripalimab., 2 years|Within 1 hour before the first administration to 90 Â±7 days after the last administration., Peripheral blood immune cell subset and receptor occupancy of TIGIT, 2 years|Objective response rate (ORR), The percentage of cases with remission (PR + CR) after treatment was assessable., 2 years|Duration of response (DOR), The time from the first assessment of CR or PR to the first assessment of PD or death due to any cause., 2 years|Disease control rate (DCR), The percentage of cases with remission (PR + CR) and stable lesions (SD) after treatment was assessable., 2 years|Time to response (TTR), time from the start of treatment to progression of diease., 2 years|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from the start of treatment to progression of disease or death., 2 years|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as time from the start of treatment until death due to any reason., 2 years
PD-L1 expression, The relationship between efficacy and potential biomarkers in tumor tissue: CD155 expression in tumor tissue., 2 years|Tumor mutation burden (TMB), The relationship between efficacy and potential biomarkers in tumor tissue: whole exome sequencing (WES) for tumor mutation burden (TMB) in tumor tissue., 2 years|Tumor microsatellite instability (MSI), The relationship between efficacy and potential biomarkers in tumor tissue: whole exome sequencing (WES) for tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) in tumor tissue., 2 years|Immune cell surface receptors, Immune cell surface receptors testing in peripheral blood, 2 years
