Zandelisib (ME-401) in Subjects With Follicular Lymphoma or Marginal Zone Lymphoma After Failure of Two or More Prior Therapies (TIDAL)
This is the study of the PI3Kδ inhibitor Zandelisib (ME-401) in subjects with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma after failure of at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy
Follicular Lymphoma (FL)|Non Hodgkin Lymphoma|Marginal Zone Lymphoma
DRUG: Zandelisib (ME-401)
Objective Response Rate (ORR) of ME-401 in Relapsed or Refractory FL or MZL, ORR is measured as the proportion of subjects achieving the best response rating of CR or PR prior to first PD, 3 years 9 months
Duration of Response (DOR), Duration of Response will be measured as the time from documentation from CR or PR to time of disease progression, 3 years 9 months|Complete Response (CR) Rate, Complete response rate will be measured by the number of subjects that achieve CR, 3 years 9 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS), Progression-free survival will be measurement of time from initiation of treatment (Day 1) until disease progression or death, 3 years 9 months|Overall Survival, Overall survival will be measured as the time from initiation of treatment (Day 1) until death, 2 years|Overall Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), The incidence of TEAEs is measured by the proportion of subjects with at least one TEAE., 3 years 9 months|PK of ME-401, The PK of ME-401 will be determined by the peak plasma concentration (Cmax), 3 years 9 months
This is a global, multicenter open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 study of the PI3Kδ inhibitor Zandelisib (ME-401) in subjects with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma after failure of at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy which must have included an anti-CD20 antibody and chemotherapy with an alkylating agent or a purine analogue.

Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled and treated with Zandelisib (ME-401) on the intermittent schedule.
