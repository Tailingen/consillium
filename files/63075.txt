Phase II Study of Systemic Screening in Pathologic Node Positive Breast Cancer
The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency of systemic metastasis in node positive breast cancer following chemotherapy and surgery. Participants will be asked to spend about 6 months in this study. Participants will undergo a computed tomography (CT) screening of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis at baseline prior to adjuvant radiation therapy and another CT screening of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis at 6 months if the baseline CT is found to be negative.
