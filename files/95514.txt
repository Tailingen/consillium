A Study to Determine Enzalutamide Long-term Safety and Efficacy After Anti-androgen Therapy for CRPC
This is a prospective observational study to evaluate effectiveness and safety of Enzalutamide for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) patients who decided to administer Enzalutamide after anti-androgen therapy.

CRPC Patients who are observed PSA or disease progression after anti-androgen therapy and decided to administrate Enzalutamide will dose the Enzalutamide 160 mg orally once daily and observed the practical treatment. Total research term is for 4 years, consists of 2-year case registration terms and 2-year observational terms.
Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as time from date of initial dose until date of death from any cause. In the case of any new chemotherapy added or changed to another treatment to prostate cancer, the conducted date will be applied. When patient is no longer traceable, the final confirmed date as alive will be applied to OS., 50 months
Prostate Specific Antigen-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), Prostate specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival is defined as time from date of initial dose until the date of first confirmed PSA progression (an increase in PSA of \>= 25% and \>= 2 ng/ml above the nadir after initial dose) or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first. In the case of any new chemotherapy added or changed to another treatment to prostate cancer, the conducted date will be applied., 50 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as time from date of initial dose until the date of first confirmed progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first. Progression is defined as followed:① A growth of primary lesion or appearance of neopathy by image diagnosis, aggravation of general condition・PS decrease or noticable weight loss which investigator assess as progression. ②Unmeasurable or difficult to measure lesion which newly appeared or investigator assess as obvious aggravation. ③ In the case of any new chemotherapy added or changed to another treatment to prostate cancer, 50 months|Time to Treatment Failure (TTTF), TTTF is defined as time from date of initial dose until the date of any new chemotherapy added or changed to another treatment to prostate cancer., 50 months|Time-to-PSA-progression (TTPP), TTPP is defined as time from date of initial dose until the date of first confirmed PSA progression (an increase in PSA of \>= 25% and \>= 2 ng/ml above the nadir after initial dose). In the case of any new chemotherapy added or changed to another treatment to prostate cancer, the conducted date will be applied., 50 months|PSA response rate, PSA response rate is defined as ratio of patients who have an decrease in PSA of \>= 50% above baseline since initial dose., 50 months|Time to First Symptomatic Skeletal Events (TTFS), TTFS is defined as time from date of initial dose until the date of first confirmed skeletal-related event. In the case of any new chemotherapy added or changed to another treatment to prostate cancer, the conducted date will be applied. Symptomatic Skeletal Events (SSE) defined as followed: ・Operation of EBRT External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) to mitigate skeletal events ・New appearance of symptomatic pathological fracture ・Appearance of spinal cord compression ・Orthopedic intervention related to tumor, 50 months|The state of administration, The state of administration is assessed by Relative Dose Intensity (RDI). RDI is calculated by dosage and dosing period. RDI calculation formula =∑ (daily dosage ×dosing days) / (160mg ×total dosing number of days). ∑ means all total dose which adds up in different dosage. Total number of days mean treatment term of this trial., 2 years|Safety assessment, Safety assessment by the incidence and severity of adverse events as assessed by Japanese version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.00, 50 months
