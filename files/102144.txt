Efficacy of metfOrmin in PrevenTIng Glucocorticoid-induced Diabetes in Patients With Brain Metastases
This is a monocentric, open label, randomized Phase II study in patients with brain metastasis from melanoma, lung or breast cancer, who require treatment with high-dose dexamethasone, as defined as a minimum of 8 mg daily based on the clinician judgment, for at least three weeks, with or without radiation therapy. The aim is to investigate the metformin efficacy in preventing the onset of glucocorticoid-induced diabetes and other metabolic perturbations in patients with brain metastases from melanoma, lung or breast cancer.

Metformin in preventing precocious (14 days) dexamethasone-induced diabetes, To evaluate the efficacy of metformin in preventing precocious (14 days) dexamethasone-induced diabetes, as defined as fasting plasma glucose levels ≥ 126 mg/dl, in patients with brain metastases from melanoma, lung or breast cancer., 14 days
Dexamethasone-induced diabetes at 30 days, To study the efficacy of metformin in preventing dexamethasone-induced diabetes at 7 and 30 days after dexamethasone initiation, as defined as fasting plasma glucose levels ≥ 126 mg/dl, in patients with brain metastases from melanoma, lung or breast, 30 days|Short-term mortality, To evaluate the efficacy of metformin in modifying short-term mortality (3 months) in patients taking high-dose dexamethasone, 90 days|Brain local control rate of disease, To evaluate the efficacy of metformin in modifying the local disease control rate (brain) in patients treated with radiation therapy (RT) plus dexamethasone at 1 month, 30 days|Patient ECOG performance status (PS), To test the impact of metformin on precocious modifycation of patient ECOG Performance Status (PS) at 1 month after initiation of dexamethasone therapy., 30 days|Patient Quality of Life (QoL), Patient QoL will be evaluated through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) C-30 version 3.0. The EORTC QLQ.C30 instrument will be scored according to the EORTC guidelines., 30 days|Absolute counts of immune cell populations, To investigate the potential impact of metformin on absolute counts of immune cell populations, 2 years|Relative counts of immune cell populations, To investigate the potential impact of metformin on relative counts and activation status of activated antitumor lymphocytes, 2 years|Activation status of immune cell populations, To investigate the potential impact of metformin on activated antitumor lymphocytes, 2 years|Plasma lipids profile, To study the effect of metformin in modifying the plasma lipid profile at 14 days after treatment initiation, 14 days|Plasma lipids profile, To study the effect of metformin in modifying the plasma lipid profile at 30 days after treatment initiation, 30 days|Systemic inflammatory parameters, To investigate the effect of metformin on systemic plasma cytokines (G-CSF, GM-CSF, CCL2, VEGFA), 2 years|GC-induced changes in gut microbiota populations, To evaluate the impact of high-dose GCs on gut microbiota populations (30 days), 30 days|Metformin-induced changes in gut microbiota populations, To evaluate the impact of metformin on gut microbiota populations (30 days), 30 days|Amino acid profile, To study the effect of metformin in modifying the plasma amino acid profile at 14 days after treatment initiation, 14 days
The study will be conducted in approximately 110 adult patients. aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of oral metformin in preventing GC-induced alterations of systemic metabolism, and in particular GC-induced diabetes. Other clinical objectives of the study consist in investigating the impact of metformin on precocious mortality, deterioration of ECOG PS and local (brain) disease control rate at one month. As an exploratory analysis, the effect of dexamethasone plus/minus metformin on other metabolites or growth factors (including amino acids, fatty acids, ketone bodies, IGF-1), as well as on the number, activation status and metabolism of peripheral blood immune cell populations will be evaluated
