Induction Chemo-Nivo in Unresectable Stage III NSCLC
The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate, safety, and effectiveness of a combination therapy in patients with lung cancer.
Lung Cancer, Nonsmall Cell|Lung Cancer Stage III
COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Nivolumab and Chemotherapy|DRUG: Nivolumab|PROCEDURE: Post Induction Surgery|RADIATION: Post Induction XRT
Response Rate After Induction, post induction radiographic response by cat scan, 9 weeks
Change in Toxicity, To assess safety, investigators will evaluate the rate of toxicity as defined by the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) scoring system., through study completion, up to 18 months|Percent of Participants Receiving Surgery, Rate of converting non-surgical stage III(A-C) to surgically resectable disease, date of surgery, approximately 10 weeks|Pathologic Complete Response (pCR), Number of participants with Pathologic Complete Response. Pathologic complete response (pCR) is defined by a surgical pathology specimen, post surgery, approximately 10 weeks|Major Pathological Response (MPR), MPR rate, defined as number of participants with â‰¤ 10% residual tumor in lung and lymph nodes, post surgery, approximately 10 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of death, 2 years|Change in Patient-reported Quality of Life as Measured by FACT-TOI, patient-reported Quality of Life as measured by FACT-TOI (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Trial Outcome Index); defined as the sum of the scores of the Physical Well-Being (PWB), Functional Well-Being (FWB), and LCS. PWB, FWB, and LCS (lung cancer scale) scores obtained from 7-item questionnaires from the FACT-L (Version 4.0). Questions are on a 5-point scale from 0-4, where 0 = "not at all" and 4 = "very much." Scores range from 0 to 84; higher score indicates better physical aspects of quality of life (QoL)., through study completion, up to 18 months
The purpose of this study is to determine the response rate, safety, and effectiveness of a combination therapy in patients with lung cancer.
