Decitabine Versus Supportive Care in Adults With Advanced-stage MDS
To compare the safety and efficacy profiles of decitabine to those of supportive care in adults with advanced-stage myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
DRUG: decitabine (5-aza-2'deoxycytidine)
This experimental (investigational) study is intended to answer the question of whether decitabine is any better than supportive care alone in delaying progression (worsening) of the disease, prolonging survival or improving the overall quality of life for MDS patients who are not candidates for bone marrow transplant (BMT).
