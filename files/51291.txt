A Phase I Study of SHR-4712 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open label, first-in-human study to evaluate safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), Pharmacodynamics (PD), immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity of SHR-4712 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients will treat with SHR-4712 until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
