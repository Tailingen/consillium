Study for Safety and Efficacy Evaluation of Imatinib Mesylate in Children With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Philadelphia Chromosome-positive (Ph+)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, through molecular response and event-free survival, about the use of Imatinib in conjunction with chemotherapy after BFM "like" Induction in children with ALL Ph+.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Philadelphia Chromosome-positive (Ph+)
DRUG: Imatinib Mesylate
Evaluate the efficacy, through molecular response and event-free survival, about the use of Imatinib in conjunction with chemotherapy after BFM "like" Induction in children with ALL Ph+., Cytogenetic and molecular response will be evaluate at the end of Induction I (D33), before each consolidation block (HR 1, 2 and 3), before re-induction, before maintenanceand at the end of therapy., Up to 24 months.
Evaluate toxicity and tolerability in the administration of Imatinib in conjunction with chemotherapy in children with ALL Ph+., Toxicity and tolerability will be verified in every visit according through:

* Adverse events during the study.
* Laboratory exams.
* Vital signs and body weight.
* Physical evaluation.
* Concomitant medication., Up to 24 months
