A Phase II, Single-Arm Trial of Poziotinib as Salvage Treatment in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Who Has HER2 or EGFR Mutation or Activated AR or EGFR Pathway
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable disease and is needed to improve effective therapeutic strategies including targeted agents.

Poziotinib is a panHER tyrosin kinase inhibitor (TKI) that showed stable activity with feasible toxicity for MBC patients as a salvage treatment strategy after failure of anthracycline and taxane in phase I trial. Poziotinib has rational benefit compared with other salvage agents, especially for patients with HER2 overexpression breast cancers. Additionally, a recent report showed that possible rational background for patients with HER2 mutation-positive breast cancers.

Based on this rationale, the investigators are to conduct phase II single-arm study of poziotinib for patients with MBC who showed refractoriness to conventional treatments as salvage treatment.
