Effectiveness of Ultrasound-Aided Articulation Therapy for Children with Speech Sound Disorders
The study is a prospective randomized controlled procedure to investigate the effect of ultrasound in articulation training and also the effect of treatment intensity in this mode of therapy. Targeted subjects are children with brain tumor or cleft palate with articulation errors which visualization of lingual movement using ultrasound may facilitate their acquisition of the sounds misarticulated. Subjects would be randomized to two groups of high and low treatment intensity, with stratification to the groups by disorders, age and gender whenever possible. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group or a waitlist control group in a 1:1 ratio.
