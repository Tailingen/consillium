PyL in Patients With High Risk and Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer
The standard of care imaging of prostate cancer metastases recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan, may be suboptimal. PyL is a novel PET tracer designed to detect prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expressed on prostate cancer cells. PyL PET/CT may provide improved evaluation of clinically significant metastases in patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: DCFPyL PET/CT
Detection of unsuspected metastases in high risk prostate cancer, Determine the rate of detection of unsuspected metastases in patients with high risk prostate cancer and planned prostatectomy or radiation therapy., up to 4 weeks|Detection of unsuspected metastases in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, Determine the rate of detection of unsuspected metastases in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, yet no evidence of disease on CT/bone scan., up to 4 weeks
This will be a phase II clinical trial to assess the clinical value of PyL for detection of disease in pateints with:

1. High risk prostate cancer and planned prostatectomy or radiation therapy (arm 1) and
2. Biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (arm 2) but without evidence of disease of standard of care imaging (CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and bone scan).

In both cohorts, PyL PET/CT will be obtained and evaluated by a nuclear radiologist trained in novel PET radiotracers, including PyL. Lesions suspicious for disease of PyL that were unsuspected on standard of care imaging will be selected for biopsy for pathologic confirmation if feasible . Pathology will be used as the reference standard for confirming malignancy.
