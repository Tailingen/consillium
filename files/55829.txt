TCRx_T Cells for Advanced or Recurrent Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer After Failure of First Chemotherapy
To observe and determine the safety, tolerability, cellular pharmacokinetics and efficacy of TCRx T cells in patients with advanced or recurrent gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer after failure of first chemotherapy.
Gastric Cancer|Gastroesophageal-junction Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Tcrx T cell
tumor volume, RECIST 1.1, about 2 years|Overall Survival, The time from randomization to death due to any reason., about 2 years
AEs, CTCAE5.0, about 2 years
1. Sign the informed consent for clinical trials
2. Subject screening
3. Extract the blood of the subjects and isolate the PBMC
4. Find a patient-specific tumor-specific TCR sequence combination, which is a multi-targeted tumor-specific combination.
5. Transfer of personalized tumor-specific TCRs into patient autologous CD8 T cells by gene editing
6. Large-scale culture and expansion of gene-edited T cells
7. T cell viability, infection efficiency and microbial detection in hospital
8. Calculate the number of cells in the patient's body according to TCRx T
9. Injecting TCRx T cells back into the subject
10. Within 7 days after the injection, the subject's post-dose reaction should be closely observed in the hospital
11. After the first injection, continue to reinfuse TCRx T cells up to 4 times according to the treatment effect and the incidence of adverse events, and be hospitalized after each injection to closely monitor possible adverse events
