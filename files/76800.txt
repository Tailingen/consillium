Circumscribed choroidal haemangioma (CCH) is an uncommon, potentially congenital benign vascular hamartomas which typically manifests as an elevated mass with reddish-orange pigmentation located posteriorly to the equator, mostly in the macular and peripapillary region. Despite its benign nature, cystoid macular edema (CME) or SRF due to the exudations from the exudative CCH can cause visual impairment. Diagnosis is often suspected clinically, and multimodal imaging is useful for the differential diagnosis of CCH from other malignant tumors such as melanoma. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a rapid, non-invasive, new imaging technology which could provide the capillary density (CD) of superficial and deep capillary plexus as well as the CD of choriocapillaris of the superficial, the latter two of which could not be seen on conventional FA or ICGA. However, little knowledge is known about the parafoveal microvasculature changes in eyes with exudative CCH on OCTA. Therefore, it is necessary to quantitative evaluation of parafoveal microvasculature changes in eyes with exudative CCH compared with healthy eyes without any disease. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cross-sectional, case-control study to use OCTA to quantitative evaluation of parafoveal microvasculature changes in Eyes with exudative CCH compared with age- and gender-controlled healthy eyes.
