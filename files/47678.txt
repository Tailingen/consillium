A Study to Learn About PF-07921585 Alone or With Other Anti-cancer Medicines in People With Cancer
The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and effects of the study medicine (called PF-07921585) in people with cancer that has advanced or spread to other parts of the body.

This study is seeking participants who have any of the following cancer types:

* non-small cell lung cancer
* colorectal cancer
* bladder cancer
* melanoma (a type of skin cancer)
* kidney cancer
* head and neck cancer Participants will receive the study medicine PF-07921585 alone or in combination with another study medicine called sasanlimab at the study clinic.

PF-07921585 will be given as an infusion into a vein or as shots under the skin, once every 3 weeks. Sasanlimab will be given as shots under the skin, also once every 3 weeks.

The experiences of participants receiving the study medicine will be studied to help see if the study medicine is safe and effective. Participants may receive study medicine for up to 2 years, depending on how the cancer responds to the study treatment. Participants may continue receiving study medicine after 2 years if there are any benefits from the study treatment. Participants will attend visits once every 3 weeks with the first 9 weeks having more frequent visits, to check the safety of the study treatment.

Serious adverse event (SAE) are AEs resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 or 90 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of PF-07921585 or after 90 days after the last dose of sasanlimab|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Laboratory Abnormalities (Parts 1 and 2), Laboratory abnormalities as characterized by type, frequency, severity (as graded by NCI CTCAE version 5.0), and timing., Baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of PF-07921585 or after 90 days after the last dose of sasanlimab|Objective Response Rate - Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (Part 3), Percentage of participants with objective response based assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1. 1 (RECIST 1.1).

CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm). No new lesions. PR was defined as \>=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short aixs was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions., Date of first dose up to 2 years

The study contains 3 parts:

Part 1: dose escalation of PF-07921585 as single agent to determine the monotherapy recommended dose for further study.

Part 2: dose escalation of PF-07921585 in combination with the anti-PD 1 inhibitor sasanlimab and potentially other anti-cancer agents, in order to determine the recommended dose for expansion of the combination.

Part 3: dose optimization/ expansion will evaluate PF-07921585 in combination with sasanlimab, and potentially other anti-cancer agents. After identification of the recommended dose for expansion in Part 2, participants with select solid tumors will be enrolled into 3-4 cohorts as follows:

* Cohort 1: Melanoma
* Cohort 2: Microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer
* Cohort 3: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
* Cohort 4: Solid tumor, tumor types and clinical setting to be determined based on emerging data.
