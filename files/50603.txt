A Clinical Trial of SIBP-A13 Injection in the Treatment of Advanced Malignant Solid Tumor Patients.
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of SIBP-A13 and determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) and phase II recommended dose (RP2D).

This study is an open, multi-dose increasing single and multiple doses increasing, dose expanding, and indication expanding study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, and explore potential biomarkers of SIBP-A13 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

This study is divided into three stages and is planned to be set up six dose groups, including 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 mg/kg. The first stage is the dose escalation stage, with a planned enrollment of 16-36 participants. The second stage is the dose expansion stage, where two doses are selected to enter the dose expansion phase. 6-9 late-stage solid tumor participants are enrolled in each dose group for dose expansion, and 12-18 participants are planned to be enrolled in the dose expansion phase. The third stage is the indication expansion stage, where phase II recommended dose (RP2D) is preliminarily determined based on the escalation and expansion of dosage in the early stage. Using RP2D for indication expansion, we plan to expand three indication cohorts, with at least 30 participants selected for each cohort.
