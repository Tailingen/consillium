Cachexia|Weight Loss|Gastrointestinal Cancer
OTHER: EXCAP©®
Number of patients that adhered to the exercise conditions of the study, Measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) in patients with advanced GI malignancies, 3 Months
Porportion of subjects with improved cachexia-related symptoms 3 months, The Functional Assessment of Anoreix/Cachexia Therapy subscale is a 39-item questionnaire that measures general aspects of quality of life as well as specific anorexia/cachexia-related concerns. This will be collected at pre- and post intervention, 3 Months
In this study the investigator would like to better understand how cachexia may improve or worsen, and how exercise may impact this process. The investigator would like to see whether a progressive resistance exercise program (EXCAP©®, Exercise for Cancer Patients) can improve symptoms in patients with gastrointestinal cancers with weight loss and cachexia. The investigator would also like to find out if this exercise intervention improves physical performance, day-to-day function, quality of life, and how exercise may affect different markers in the blood over time.
