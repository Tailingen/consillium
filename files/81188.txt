A Study Comparing Imatinib and Imatinib/Pegylated Interferon in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in imatinib induced CHR are randomized between imatinib 400 mg daily and imatinib 400 mg daily + PegIntron 30 ug weekly.

Primary endpoint: To compare at 12 months between the treatment arms the rate of Major Molecular Response (=99,9% tumour reduction) at 12 months
Health Care Quality|Health Care Evaluation
DRUG: imatinib and pegylated interferon
Comparison of rate Major Molecular Response between treatment arms, Molecular response, 2004 - 2009
Comparison of complete cytogenetic response between the treatment arms at 12 months, Cytogenetic response, 2004 - 2009|Comparison rate complete cytogenetic response between the treatment arms at 12 months, Hematologic response, 2004 - 2009
130 patients registered, 112 randomized. 56 pats in each treatment arm. 12 months study duration. Rate of Major Molecular Response was at 12 months 53 vs 82 % (p=0.002) in favour of the combination arm.
