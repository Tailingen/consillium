Genomic Markers for Measuring Breast Cancer Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
The primary aim of the study is to identify genomic markers (circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), transcriptomic markers) as biomarkers of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) among patients with invasive breast cancer.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Genomic Markers (CTC/ctDNA)
Pathologic complete response (pCR), Evaluating the degree of absence of residual cancer cells, Up to 60 months
Time to distant breast cancer recurrence (months), Evaluating the time until a recurrence event has occurred in the breast., Up to 60 months|Time to any recurrence (months), Evaluating the time until a local, regional, or distant recurrence event has occurred., Up to 60 months|Time to death, Evaluating time to cancer-related death, Up to 60 months
The study aims to evaluate genetic markers (i.e. CTCs and ctDNA) in breast tumors to predict therapy response and metastatic risk. We aim to investigate genomic markers of treatment response and outcomes in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The role of CTCs and ctDNA in predicting response to NAC will also be investigated.
