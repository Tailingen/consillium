Safety and Efficacy Study of Intravesical Instillation of TARA-002 in Adults With High-grade Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer
TARA-002-101-Ph2 is an open-label study to investigate the safety and anti-tumor activity of intravesical instillation of TARA-002 in adults 18 years of age or older with high-grade CIS NMIBC (± Ta/T1).

The purpose of this Phase 2 study (TARA-002-101-Ph2) is to further assess the safety and anti-tumor activity of TARA-002 at the RP2D which has been established in the Phase 1a dose finding study (TARA-002-101-Ph1a).

This Phase 2 study includes participants with CIS NMIBC (± Ta/T1) with active disease (defined as disease present at last tumor evaluation prior to signing ICF).

Participants will be enrolled into one of 2 cohorts:

Cohort A:

* Participants with CIS (± Ta/T1) who are BCG naive, or
* Participants with CIS (± Ta/T1) who are BCG exposed and have not received intravesical BCG for at least 24 months prior to the most recent CIS diagnosis

Cohort B:

* Participants with persistent or recurrent CIS (± Ta/T1) who are BCG unresponsive within 12 months of completion of adequate BCG therapy (minimum 5/6 doses induction and 2/3 doses maintenance or 2/6 doses reinduction)
