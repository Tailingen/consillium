177Lu-PSMA as a Systemic Adjuvant Treatment in Patients With High and Very High Risk Prostate Cancer
Single-center, non-commercial phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate 177Lu-PSMA as a systemic adjuvant treatment in patients with high and very high risk prostate cancer after radical treatment using locoregional teleradiotherapy and hormone therapy
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan
Treatment effectiveness, Assessment of treatment failure - the assesment of biochemical progression ratio, defined as a rise of PSA by 2 ng/mL or more above the nadir, proven by a consecutive examination performed at least 4 weeks later, 2 and 5 years after end of treatment
Biochemical progression-free survival, Comparative assessment of biochemical progression-free survival time defined as an increase in tPSA (prostate specific antigen) in the blood above the nadir (the lowest PSA value after completion of treatment) by 2 ng/mL or more, confirmed in the next test performed no earlier than after 4 weeks, During the intervention and follow up period (assessed up to 5 years)|Radiological progression-free survival, Comparative assessment of radiological progression-free survival defined according to PCWG3 criteria, During the intervention and follow up period (assessed up to 5 years)|Time until the next therapeutic intervention, Comparative assessment of the time until the next therapeutic intervention, During the intervention and follow up period (assessed up to 5 years)|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events according to CTCAE v 5.0, Comparative assessment of safety and tolerability of treatment according to CTCAE v 5.0, During the intervention and follow up period (assessed up to 5 years)|Quliaty of life, Comparison of EORTC QLQ-PR25 quality of life indicators between study groups, During the intervention and follow up period (assessed up to 5 years)
The intervention will consist of a single administration of 177Lu-PSMA in the research arm. Both the study and control groups will receive standard hormone therapy.

The study population includes 200 adult men with high-risk or very high-risk prostate cancer, with no signs of cancer dissemination in radiological examinations after completion of radiotherapy and continued hormone therapy

Participation time in the Study:

intervention phase - 1 day; observation phase - 5 years
