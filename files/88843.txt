PROtein, Leucine and Vitamin D Supplementation In Patients With GYnecologic Cancer Receiving Platinum-based Chemotherapy
Open clinical trial addressing the effect of a nutritional support based on whey proteins, leucine and vitamin D on muscle mass and multiple anticancer treatment-related endpoints in patients with gynecologic cancer receiving first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (adjuvant or curative). A comparison to matched historical controls will be performed to address potential evidence of efficacy to be investigated in a subsequent randomized trial.
