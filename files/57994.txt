LAM Pilot Study With Imatinib Mesylate
This is a phase 1 clinical trial comparing imatinib mesylate to placebo for individuals with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
DRUG: Imatinib Mesylate 400Mg Capsule|DRUG: Placebo - Capsule
Serum VEGF-D, Change in the square root of the intrasubject plasma VEGF-D, Before and 1 month after initiation of monotherapy imatinib mesylate or placebo
Adverse Events, Adverse event and Serious Adverse Event numbers using the CTCAE Version 4.03 definitions, 3 months
Lung Function, FEV1 % predicted change, 2 months|SGRQ, Saint Georges Respiratory Questionnaire change, 2 months
This is a double blind, adjusted parallel design, randomized clinical trial comparing imatinib mesylate 400 mg daily or matching placebo on the primary outcome of log transformed serum VEGF-D level in patients with LAM.

Sirolimus using patients will have co-administration of Imatinib mesylate or placebo for 28 days prior to sirolimus discontinuation.

The duration of 400 mg imatinib mesylate or placebo will be 56 days, a dose reduction is allowed for toxicity.

The primary endpoint will be the change in the log transformed VEGF-D one month after monotherapy imatinib mesylate or placebo.

Total trial duration is 2 months of drug administration.
