A Study of IMM-6-415 in RAS/RAF Mutant Solid Tumors
This is a FIH, ascending dose study to characterize the safety, tolerability, optimal dose and preliminary anti-tumor activity of IMM-6-415 in participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring RAS or RAF oncogenic mutations.

The dose exploration will identify the candidate recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMM-6-415 to further explore the anti-tumor activity of IMM-6-415 as monotherapy in Phase 2a tumor-specific cohorts. Patients will be self-administering IMM-6-415 on a daily basis for up to 16 cycles (21-day cycles). During the first 2 cycles, PK and PD will be assessed. Solid tumor types with RAS/RAF mutations are eligible.
