Patients with esophageal cancer to be treated with concurrent preoperative proton therapy along with carboplatin and paclitaxel.
Esophageal Cancer
RADIATION: 18F-FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose) PET|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Number of Adverse Events, 3 years
1. To identify the maximally tolerated radiation dose (MTD) of dose-escalated proton radiotherapy in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel in the preoperative setting for esophageal cancer.
2. To estimate pathologic response rates by esophagectomy surgical specimens after escalated doses of chemoradiotherapy.
3. To assess the utility of circulating tumor cells and tumor vesicles as biomarkers to predict treatment response to chemoradiotherapy
