Predictive Tools in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy
The ITHACA study aims to improve the treatment of head and neck cancer by developing a predictive tool that helps doctors personalize care for each patient. This tool uses information such as medical history, imaging, and radiotherapy data to predict the risk of cancer recurrence, overall survival, and the likelihood of side effects.

Patients with head and neck cancer face significant challenges, including managing the side effects of treatments like radiotherapy. By tailoring treatment schedules and doses, and using advanced imaging techniques, we hope to reduce complications and improve survival outcomes. The study is designed to help doctors choose the best treatment for each patient, while minimizing the side effects that impact important functions like swallowing and breathing.

Patients participating in the study will have their medical data collected, including:

Tumor characteristics (size, location, stage). Treatment details (radiotherapy and chemotherapy). Imaging information using tools like PET-CT and MRI to track the response to treatment and detect any signs of cancer recurrence.

Side effects and overall health data. This information will be used to develop and test a new model that predicts outcomes for each patient based on their unique data.

The study includes adults (18 years and older) diagnosed with head and neck cancer, who are undergoing or have completed radiotherapy. Patients will be followed over time to monitor their response to treatment and any side effects.

Cancer Recurrence, The main focus is the probability of recurrence of head and neck cancer after the completion of radiotherapy. This will be assessed at various intervals, specifically at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months post-treatment, using imaging techniques such as PET-CT, MRI, and CT, along with clinical evaluations., From enrollment to 36 months post-treatment
