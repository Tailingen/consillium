Prevalence of HRR-related Genes Mutations and Prognosis in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Patients in Real World Setting
The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of tissue homologous recombination repair (HRR)-related gene mutations (positive/negative/Variant of uncertain significance (VUS)), clinical outcome such as prostate-specific antigen-progression free survival (PSA-PFS), overall survivals (OS) and treatment pattern in mCRPC patients.

\<Methods\> Study design: multi-center, prospective cohort study

Data Source(s):

In this study, 155 patients (expected recruitment patients: maximum 205 patients) will be enrolled from approximately 20\~30 sites in Japan. Study Population: mCRPC patients who diagnosed between 2014 and 2018. Exposure(s): N.A Outcome(s): Prevalence of tissue HRR-related gene mutations, clinical outcomes such as Over survival and PSA-PFS, Treatment pattern

Sample Size Estimations:

The target population is 155 patients based on the prevalence of HRR-related genes (BRCA1, BRCA2 and ATM) which is reported in previous global study (PROfound study).

Statistical Analysis:

This study is not intended to verify specific hypotheses, and the results are evaluated descriptively. There is no plan of interim analyses before the final analysis.
Prostatic Neoplasms
Prevalence of tissue HRR-related gene mutations, Calculate number and prevalence of each HRR-related gene mutation status (Positive/Negative/VUS), respectively. Prevalence will be accompanied by 95% Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals., Baseline
Proportion of each treatment pattern, The number (%) of patients by treatment pattern in 1st line treatment, 2nd line, and 3rd line treatment after diagnosed as mCRPC, respectively, will be calculated., From index date(diagnosed as mCRPC) patients to December 31 2020
Patient's characteristics including stratified by tissue HRR-related gene mutations in mCRPC patients, Patient's characteristics will be summarized., Baseline|PSA50 response, PSA50 response will be analysed based on baseline and nadir PSA value in each treatment., From index date(diagnosed as mCRPC) to december 31 2020
