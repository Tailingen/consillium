A Study of HRXG-K-1939 and Adebrelimab in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of HRXG-K-1939 in combination with Adebrelimab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 \[anti-PD-L1\] antibody) in patients with advanced solid tumors. HRXG-K-1939 will be administered to patients in a dose escalation regimen to determine a recommended dose for expansion.
