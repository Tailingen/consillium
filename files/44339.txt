A Study of ABT-263 as Single Agent in Women With Platinum Resistant/Refractory Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
ABT-263 as single agent in women with platinum resistant/refractory recurrent ovarian cancer.
Platinum-resistant or Refractory Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: ABT-263
The primary endpoint is the progression-free survival (PFS) in the whole cohort of patients with a recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer., the time to progression (or death from any cause) from date of randomization until date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause,whichever came first, assessed up to 12 months. Evaluation at interim and final analyses.
Bim expression level, Bim expression level expressed by immunohistochemistry on biopsy of relapsing tumor at inclusion, biopsy sample before initiation of treatment by ABT-263 and assessment within 6 months after end of inclusions|Response rate, - Response rate defined by a complete response (CR), a partial response (PR) or a stable disease (SD) according to the RECIST v1.1, evaluated every 6 weeks during treatment to progression or death for any cause.(during average 12 months)]|Overall survival (OS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 48 months.|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events according to the NCI CTC AE version 4.0, Toxicities, From date of treatment start until end of study participation (during average 12 months)]|Peak Plasma Concentration of ABT-263, 8-hour post-dose PK on D1 of C1 & 2. Dosage will be done within 12 months after end of inclusions|Residual concentration of ABT-263, Pre-dose 0 and cycles 3, 4, 6 . Dosage will be done within 12 months after end of inclusions
