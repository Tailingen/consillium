Oral Cell DNA Adducts in Smokers
DNA adducts in the oral mucosa cells of 100 smokers from 3 ethnic groups - Native Hawaiians, Whites, and Japanese Americans with differing risks for lung cancer upon cigarette smoking will be quantified. DNA adducts of tobacco smoke carcinogens will be quantified using both targeted and untargeted approaches.

Concentration of γ-OH-Acr-dGuo, a Major Acrolein-DNA Adduct, Acrolein-DNA adduct (8R/S)-3-(2'-deoxyribos-1'-yl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahy- dro-8-hydroxypyrimido\[1,2-a\]purine-10(3H)-one. Model adjusted for age, sex and race/ethnicity, Baseline
εdAdo, Per 10^9 Nucleotides, Lipid peroxidation-related adduct 1,N6-etheno-dAdo etheno-DNA adducts from peroxidation of lipids. Model adjusted for age, sex and race/ethnicity, Baseline
Using high resolution mass spectrometry, quantify known DNA adducts in oral mucosa cells of 100 smokers from each ethnic group - Native Hawaiians, Whites, and Japanese Americans. DNA adducts of tobacco-specific compounds, formaldehyde, and acrolein will be quantified.

2. Analyze the urine of 100 smokers and 100 non-smokers from each of these groups for mercapturic acids of acrolein and crotonaldehyde, as well as total nicotine equivalents and total NNAL (smokers only). These data will provide critical information relevant to the high risk of Native Hawaiians for lung cancer, and in relationship to the DNA adduct measurements of Specific Aim 1.
