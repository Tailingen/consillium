Improving Breast Health Knowledge Among Women Using a Gamified Metaverse-Based Platform
This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Mammoverse, a gamified metaverse-based educational platform, in improving breast health knowledge among women in China. Participants were randomly assigned to either a gamified or non-gamified version of the platform. Both groups received identical educational content, but only the gamified group experienced interactive game elements such as avatars, progress feedback, and rewards. Knowledge was assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 4-week follow-up. The study found that the gamified platform significantly improved knowledge retention and participant engagement compared to the non-gamified version.

This ClinicalTrials.gov registration reflects only the randomized controlled trial (RCT) portion of a broader mixed-methods study that was approved by the University of Malaya Research Ethics Committee (Ref: UM.TNC2/UMREC_3967). The full study protocol includes three methodological approaches, and this registration pertains specifically to the RCT component involving the Mammoverse platform. Other study components are not included in this registration.
Health Education|Breast Neoplasms
BEHAVIORAL: Gamified Mammoverse Platform|BEHAVIORAL: Standard Mammoverse Platform
Change in Breast Health Knowledge Score from Baseline to 4 Weeks Post-Intervention, Assessed using an 18-item adapted Breast Health Literacy Questionnaire. Scores range from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater knowledge. Main comparison is between baseline and 4-week follow-up., Baseline and 4 weeks post-intervention
Change in Breast Health Knowledge Score from Baseline to Immediately Post-Intervention, Same questionnaire used to assess immediate knowledge gain after the intervention., Baseline and immediately post-intervention
Knowledge Retention from Immediately Post-Intervention to 4 Weeks Post, Change in knowledge scores to evaluate retention over 4 weeks., Immediately post-intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention
Mammoverse is a 3D metaverse environment designed to promote breast health knowledge through immersive and interactive learning. The gamified version included user avatars, badges, tasks, and personalized feedback to increase motivation and engagement. The study recruited 72 women aged 18 and above, and used a pre-post-follow-up design. Outcome measures were based on an adapted 18-item Breast Health Literacy Questionnaire. The trial was conducted entirely online, with ethics approval from the University of Malaya Research Ethics Committee.
