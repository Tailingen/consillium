Improvement of Compliance for High Doses of EPA Amongst Patients With Colorectal Cancer
Several studies indicate beneficial effects of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) on cancer cachexia. However, compliance is generally low. This case control study is conducted in order to investigate if compliance depends upon the physical properties of the supplement (capsules vs. drinks). In order to further investigate how compliance can be improved, a possible correlation between sideeffects and rate of increased polyunsaturated fatty acid concentration in blood is also tested

Compliance, Number of Capsules and bottles counted, 4 weeks
Erythrocyte concentration of EPA, Concentration measured on isolated erythrocytes, 4 weeks
Patients with abdominal cancer in active chemotherapeutic were allocated to either EPA in an oral nutritional drink (commercial) or capsules with fish oil. The dose of EPA was the same in both groups, and diets were adjusted as iso-caloric. Compliance to the fish oil treatment was the primary outcome. Blood concentrations of EPA secondary.
