Bintrafusp Alfa Before Surgery for the Treatment of Untreated Resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This phase II trial studies how well bintrafusp alfa before surgery works in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer for which the patient has not received treatment in the past (untreated) and that can be removed by surgery (resectable). Immunotherapy with bintrafusp alfa may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving bintrafusp alfa before surgery may help lower the risk of the cancer coming back after surgery.

Major Pathologic Response (MPR), MPR will be defined as =\< 10% viable tumor cells in the resected specimen using the methods described by Pataer et al. Will estimate the MPR rate with a 95% credible interval (CI) assuming that the MPR rate follows a prior beta distribution (0.5, 0.5) with one patient worth of information., At time of surgery
Incidence of Adverse Events, Assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5., Up to 1 year|Peri-operative Morbidity and Mortality, Up to 1 year|Response Rates to Induction, Assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1., Up to 5 years post-treatment|Recurrence-free Survival, Will be computed using the Kaplan-Meier method., At 12 months|Recurrence-free Survival, Will be computed using the Kaplan-Meier method., At 18 months|Recurrence-free Survival, Will be computed using the Kaplan-Meier method., At 24 months|Overall Survival, Will be computed using the Kaplan-Meier method., At 12 months|Overall Survival, Will be computed using the Kaplan-Meier method., At 18 months|Overall Survival, Will be computed using the Kaplan-Meier method., At 24 months|Complete Resection (RO) Rate, Complete resection (R0) rate is defined as number of Participants that successfully underwent surgical resection with microscopically clear surgical margins., At time of surgery|Number of Participants With Pathologic Complete Response, Pathologic complete response (pCR) in resected tumor specimens. pCR is defined as the absence of any viable residual tumor at the time of surgical resection in the primary lung lesion and lymph nodes, by central (core) pathology review., At time of surgery|CD8+ TILs in Resected Tumor Tissue, Quantification of CD8+ TILs will be assessed by counting the cells positive for staining with an anti-CD8 antibody by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence in five random square areas (1 mm\^2 each) in both intratumoral and peritumoral compartments using an automated system., At time of surgery
Biomarker Analysis, Multivariate analysis will be used to explore the role of biomarkers in predicting pathologic response to treatment, in an exploratory way., Up to 5 years post-treatment
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To evaluate the rate of major pathologic response (MPR).

OUTLINE:

Patients receive bintrafusp alfa intravenously (IV) on days 1, 15, and 29 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Within 4-6 weeks after last dose of bintrafusp alfa, patients undergo surgery at the discretion of the treating surgeon. Within 8 weeks after surgery, patients may receive chemotherapy or undergo radiation therapy at the discretion of the treating physician.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 5 years.
