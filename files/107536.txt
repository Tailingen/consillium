A Study of Pertuzumab in Combination With Trastuzumab (Herceptin) and a Taxane in First-Line Treatment in Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 (HER2)-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer
This multicenter, open-label, single-arm, Phase IIIb study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin) and a taxane (docetaxel, paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) in first-line treatment in participants with metastatic or locally recurrent HER2-positive breast cancer. Participants will receive pertuzumab intravenously (IV) and trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV plus a taxane in cycles of 3 weeks each until predefined study end, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, disease progression, or death, whichever occurs first.

Overview of the Number of Participants With at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event, Severity Determined According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE v4.0), Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were adverse events (AEs) that started or worsened in severity on or after the first administration of study drug, up to and including 28 days after the last dose. The investigator graded all AEs for severity per NCI-CTCAE v4.0; if not listed, the AE was assessed as follows: Grade 1 = mild; Grade 2 = moderate; Grade 3 = severe; Grade 4 = life-threatening/disabling; Grade 5 = death.
