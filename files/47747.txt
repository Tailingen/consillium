Staging of Superficial EAC Using VLE
This study is being done to see if the NvisionVLE Imaging System can accurately determine the diagnostic performance of staging of T1 esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Volumetric laser endomicroscopy (VLE) is an imaging platform that uses infrared light to generate cross-sectional views of the human esophagus with microscopic resolution. VLE has been used to detect dysplasia associated with Barrett's esophagus (BE) but its use in cancer staging has not been previously explored. The investigators propose that VLE can accurately and comprehensively stage T1 EAC.

VLE scans will be analyzed using an automated computer algorithm to measure degree of signal attenuation over areas demarcated for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). The signal attenuation cut-off established will be used to classify cancers as superficial versus deep. EMR specimens will be reviewed histopathologically for grade of tumor differentiation, depth of invasion, and presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion. Depth of tumor invasion will be measured and used to classify cancers as superficial versus deep.
