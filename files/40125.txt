A Study Exploring Efficacy of SIBP04 in Subjects With Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This trial is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, multicenter phase III clinical study. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of SIBP04 in patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-squamous Non-small-cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: SIBP04|DRUG: Avastin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the best ORR from the first medication to the 18th week, initially evaluated by the investigator, and finally evaluated by a third-party independent blinded imaging, including cases of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., up to 18th week.
Progression-free survival(PFS), PFS is defined as the time between randomization and disease progression or death(The date when event happened first)., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 18 weeks.|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time between randomization and patient death from all causes, with the date of last contact as the cut-off date if the patient is lost to follow-up., From date of randomization until the date of event-occurring or last visit, assessed up to 30 weeks.|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first evaluation of a tumor as CR or PR to the first evaluation of disease progression or death., From date of the first evaluation of a tumor as CR or PR until the date of the first evaluation of a patient's state as disease progression or death, assessed up to 30 weeks.|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR was defined as the percentage of the total evaluable cases with remission or disease stabilization after treatment (That is, cases of CR, PR and stable disease(SD))., up to 18th week.
The number of adverse events (AE), Total number of any spontaneously reported and all directly observed adverse events., The last 1 day of 18th weeks after randomization.|The number of serious adverse events (SAE), That is serious adverse events, any serious adverse events that occurred to the subject during the study period., The last 1 day of 30th weeks after randomization.|The incidence of anti-drug antibodies(ADAs), Evaluate the immunogenicity of the SIBP04 group and the bevacizumab group., The last 1 day of 18th weeks after randomization.|The titer of ADAs, Evaluate the immunogenicity of the SIBP04 group and the bevacizumab group., The last 1 day of 18th weeks after randomization.|The incidence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), Evaluate the immunogenicity of the SIBP04 group and the bevacizumab group., The last 1 day of 18th weeks after randomization.|The trough concentration, The trough concentration is a pharmacokinetic evaluation index., The last 1 day of 18th weeks after randomization.
This trial is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled, multicenter phase III clinical study. The study was divided into three stages: screening stage, treatment stage (combined chemotherapy stage, single drug maintenance treatment stage, visit after treatment) and follow-up stage (survival follow-up after disease progression). To evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of SIBP04 in patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
