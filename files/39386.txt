A Phase 1, Open-Label, Dose-Escalation Study of NEV801, Administered to Patients With Advanced Cancers
This study is a first-in-human, multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation trial to be conducted in 2 sequential parts:

* Part A (Dose Escalation) in subjects with advanced malignancies
* Part B (Dose Confirmation) in subjects with tumor type(s) to be determined by results of Part A
Advanced Cancer|Solid Tumors
DRUG: NEV801
Maximum Tolerated Dose, 12 months
Observe any antitumor effects of NEV801, 24 months
In Part A, subjects will be treated with a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion of NEV801 on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of continuous 28-day cycles. The starting dose of NEV801 will be 20 mg/m2/dose, and the NEV801 dose will be escalated in successive cohorts of 3 subjects per dose level. In Part B, up to 3 expansion cohorts of up to 12 subjects each, defined by tumor type, will be enrolled at or below the MTD (i.e., the RP2D) of NEV801. In both parts, subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not experience progressive disease may continue to receive NEV801 at the discretion of the Investigator for up to 12 cycles. Subjects who tolerate the drug and experience clinical benefit will be eligible for further treatment in an extension protocol or through another means to be determined by the Sponsor.
