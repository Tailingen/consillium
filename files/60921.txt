Prospective Surveillance for Very Early Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Hepatocellular carcinoma is one the leading cause of increasing cancer-specific mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma provides opportunity for curative therapeutic approaches and relatively favorable prognosis. Herein, we intended to establish a biosignature for early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and stratification of risk population for intensive follow-up by implementing biannual follow-up investigation and collecting peripheral blood samples for screening.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
Hepatocellular carcinoma, Development of hepatocellular carcinoma, July 2018 to July 2022|Overall survival, Death, July 2018 to July 2022|Liver-related disease progression, HBV and cirrhosis progression, July 2018 to July 2022
Non-hepatocellular carcinoma malignant neoplasm, Development of other primary liver cancer, such as Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma., July 2018 to July 2022
Patients will be recruited for 1 year and be follow-up for 3 years. Patients will make active hospital visit for collection of blood samples, which will be analyzed to develop a biosignature at the end of the study to detect very early hepatocellular carcinoma and stratify risk population for intensive follow-up.
