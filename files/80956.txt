CD30 CAR-T in the Treatment of CD30 Positive Relapsed/Refractory Lymphoma
The is a prospective, open-label, dose-climbing clinical study assessing the efficacy and safety of CD30 CAR-T in the treatment of r/r CD30+ lymphoma. Plan to recruit 15 subjects with r/r CD30+ lymphomaã€‚
Lymphoma, B-Cell
DRUG: chimeric antigen receptor gene modified T cells
Overall response rate, Including complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR), 6 months|To evaluate safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of autologous CD30 CAR-T and establish the recommended Phase dose, Incidence of DLTs and occurrence of study related adverse events, 28 days
Disease-free survival, DFS was calculated from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death, progression of the disease, relapse or gene recurrence, whichever came first, or last visit., 3years|Overall Survival, OS was calculated from the first CAR-T cell infusion to death or last follow-up, 3 years
The copy number of CD30 CAR-T cells, The copy number of CD30 CAR-T cells amplified in peripheral blood after administration, 12 months
The goal of this clinical trial is to explore the effect of CD30 CAR-T on CD30 positive relapsed/refractory lymphoma. The main questions it aims to answer are:

To evaluate the safety of autologous CD30 CAR-T therapy in CD30-positive relapsed/refractory lymphoma; To evaluate the efficacy of autologous CD30 CAR-T therapy for CD30-positive relapsed/refractory lymphoma; To evaluate the metabolism of CD30 CAR-T cells in vivo; Preliminary evaluation of the correlation between CAR T cell dose and clinical efficacy.
