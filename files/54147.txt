Improving Lung Cancer Screening Adherence by Overcoming Barriers for Vulnerable Populations
This study investigates multi-level barriers to lung cancer screening uptake and adherence to lung cancer screening. Identifying cost- and convenience-related barriers to lung cancer screening may help researchers develop targeted strategies to facilitate screening adherence specifically among vulnerable populations.

Associations between health insurance availability and financial burdens as factors in lung cancer screening adherence, Individual-level insurance status will be analyzed for association with lung cancer screening adherence. Descriptive analyses of neighborhood factors will be conducted to characterize residential computed tomography (CT)s. Multilevel logistic regression models examining the relationship between screening adherence and each neighborhood factor (i.e., one per model for each CT) and will be adjusted for important individual-level covariates, such as patient age, sex, and smoking status. To address the dependence of the neighborhood factors on race in predicting screening adherence, the modeling results will be focused on interaction terms to examine interactions between race and neighborhood factors., Up to study completion; 15 months|Individual-level cost-related factors associated with screening adherence, Will use generalized linear mixed effects logistic regression to model the longitudinal adherence to lung cancer screening as a function of cost-related variables, race, and their interactions. The model will be used to estimate odds ratios representing how adherence associated with financial variables depends on race at each follow-up CT scan., Up to study completion; 15 months|Convenience-related factors that impact lung cancer screening adherence, Will assess convenience-related factors that may affect lung cancer screening uptake and adherence. Survey items will address technology and internet accessibility; preferred methods for patient communication; effectiveness of patient navigation; and identification of logistical barriers along each step of the screening workflow including referral, eligibility assessment, scheduling, shared decision-making (SDM) visit, low dose CT (LDCT), results review, and follow-up instructions., Up to study completion; 15 months
