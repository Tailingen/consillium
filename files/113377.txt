Portal Vein Thrombosis Associated With Unresectable Pancreatic Cancers : a Prospective Multicentric Cohort Study
Little is known concerning the management of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in digestive cancers other than hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC). The use of anticoagulant treatment (ACT), screening of oesophageal varices (OV) and oesogatric varices (OGV), and primary prophylaxis of OV (treatment with beta-blocker (BB) and / or OV ligation) if necessary are not clearly defined. The autopsy series by Ogren et al. (World J Gastroenterol. 2006) found an incidence of PVT in cancer patients of 1%, with 44% of digestive cancers other than HCC as a common etiology, mostly pancreatic adenocarcinoma (42%).

We reported a retrospective French study that included 118 patients with digestive cancers other than HCC, including 50% locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with PVT complications. A total of 38% of patients had radiological signs of portal hypertension (PHT) and 51% had ACT. Only 1% of patients were screened for VO (n = 7). In addition, 19% (n = 22) presented gastrointestinal bleeding. Among the causes of death, 17% (n = 12) were due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Overall survival (OS) was statistically associated with a metastatic disease (HR = 2.83 \[95% CI 1.47-5.43\], p \<0.01) and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR = 1.68 \[95% CI 1.01-2.78\], p = 0.04).

Bleeding complications from PHT are not uncommon in patients with digestive cancer, especially in patients with pancreatic cancer with PVT; but above all they can be responsible for death. No data existed before our first study (Regnault et al. Dig Liv Dis 2018). However, these data must be validated in a prospective multicentric study with standardized follow-up. In order to obtain precise and homogeneous data, we have chosen to target pancreatic cancers as these tumors are the most common causes of PVT.
