Acetyl-L-carnitine in Combination With a Cisplatin-containing Chemotherapy as First Line Treatment of Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
Study objectives Primary: To compare toxicity free survival of patients treated with ALC (acetylcarnitine) plus cisplatin-containing chemotherapy (CHT) versus those treated with placebo plus cisplatin-containing chemotherapy.

Secondary: To compare progression free survival, overall survival, the compliance to treatment, the number of episodes of grade 3-4 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, neurotoxicity, as well as the proportion of patients experiencing grade 2-3-4 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, neuropathic pain intensity, the clinical signs and/or symptoms (such as burning, numbness, itching, etc.) of the sensorial neuropathy between the two treatment arms. Study design Multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III, superiority study in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer).

Patients to be screened for study inclusion are those for which the decision to start a cisplatin-containing treatment has been already taken in the context of the clinical practice. The type of cisplatin-based treatment is not fixed, but each single investigator is free to choose for each single patient among those already approved for first line treatment of advanced or metastatic NSCLC.

Patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomized with a 1 : 1 ratio to receive ALC + cisplatin-containing CHT or Placebo + cisplatin-containing CHT until patient refusal, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death. The study will be conducted in Italy in approximately 20 investigational centers in order to recruit 650-675 subjects over a 30-month period.

Both efficacy and safety data will be collected. Follow-up will be according to the clinical practice. Data capture will continue, for each patient, until death or study closure.
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Acetylcarnitine|DRUG: Placebo
Toxicity Free Survival, The primary efficacy endpoint is toxicity-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation up to the occurrence of related to treatment grade 2-3-4 NCI-CTCAE neurotoxicity, progression, second primary malignancy, death from any cause, whichever comes first. Subjects who have not experienced related to treatment grade 2-3-4 toxicity, and not progressed or died while on study will be censored at their last assessment date., participants will be followed for the duration of chemotherapy and for at least 1 yaer after the completation of treatment, an expected average of 18 months
Progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation up to the occurrence of progression, second primary malignancy, death from any cause, whichever comes first. Subjects who have not progressed or died while on study will be censored at their last assessment date, participants will be followed for the duration of chemotherapy and for at least 1 yaer after the completation of treatment, an expected average of 18 months|Overall survival, defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause. Subjects not reported as having died at the end of the study will be censored at the date they were last known to be alive, participants will be followed for the duration of chemotherapy and for at least 1 yaer after the completation of treatment, an expected average of 18 months|Neuropathic pain, Occurrence of neuropathic pain is defined as the presence of at least 4 of the 10 clinical signs/symptoms listed in the DN4-Questionnaire Neuropathic pain intensity is defined as the intensity of pain reported by patients (current, average and worst during the last week) during scheduled visit as assessed by a self-administered questionnaire (BPI), participants will be followed for the duration of chemotherapy and for at least 1 yaer after the completation of treatment, an expected average of 18 months
