Assessing Insulin Sensitivity and Diabetes Risk in Childhood Cancer Survivors Treated With Abdominal Irradiation
The purpose of this study is to better understand the risk factors and causes of diabetes in people who received radiation to the abdomen as children. The investigators hope this information will allow them to improve how they screen people at risk for diabetes and how they treat patients in the future.
