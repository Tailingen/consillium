Robotic Assisted Surgery in Upper Aerodigestive Tract Surgery
To evaluate the use of the daVinci Robotic System for better visibility and access of head and neck lesions and decreased amount of surgery time.
Head and Neck Cancer|Oropharyngeal Cancer|Hypopharyngeal Cancer|Upper Aerodigestive Tract Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: da Vinci® Robotic System
Number of Participants With Adequate Exposure and Access to Oropharyngeal and Hypopharyngeal Head and Neck Lesions, Number of participants with adequate exposure and access for use of the da Vinci® Robotic System in oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal head and neck lesions, Intraoperatively average of 2 hours
Assessment of Patients Safety by Evaluating the Number of Participants Who Experienced Known Complications From the Use of the da Vinci® Robotic System During Surgery, Experienced a Need for Conversion to Open Surgery or Required Additional Surgery., Assessment of patient safety evaluating the number of participants who experienced known complications from the use of the da Vinci® Robotic System during surgery, who experienced a need for conversion to open surgery during the procedure, or who required additional surgery for re-excision of the lesion due to positive margins, 3 - 24 months postoperatively
This trial is a single institution non-randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the da Vinci® Robotic Surgical System. This study will evaluate the use of the daVinci Robotic System for better visibility and access of head and neck lesions and decreased amount of surgery time. This is a robotic system used by surgeons to perform surgery in a less invasive manner.
