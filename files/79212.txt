A Study of B1962, a PD-L1/VEGF Bispecific Antibody Fusion Protein, for Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-tumor activity of B1962, a PD-L1/VEGF bispecific antibody fusion protein, as a single agent in adult subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The study consists of two parts: a once-weekly (QW) dosing phase and a biweekly (Q2W) dosing phase, which will explore the possibility of Q2W dosing of B1962 based on the PK data obtained in the QW phase. The study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for B1962 as a single agent.
