Induction Preoperative Chemotherapy for Patients With Locally Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to increase survival of patients with locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer using two consequent induction preoperative chemotherapy regimens.
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Paclitaxel, Carboplatinum, Doxorubicin, Endoxan, Capecitabine
The pathological complete response rate to two consequent induction preoperative chemotherapy regimens, After 18 weeks of induction chemotherapy
Disease-free survival, 3 years
Number of patients with 3/4 Grade CTC adverse events to assess toxicity and tolerability of the chemotherapy regimens, After 18 weeks os induction chemotherapy
Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, patients with triple-negative breast cancer have a lower recurrence-free and overall survival, regardless of disease stage at diagnosis. That's why new approaches to treatment of this aggressive breast cancer subtype are extremely anticipated.

One of the ways to improve the results of treatment of locally advanced triple-negative breast cancer is intensification of induction preoperative chemotherapy regimens. Elevation of the rate of pathological complete responses after completion of intensification induction preoperative chemotherapy enables to decrease the stage and increase survival of this aggressive breast cancer subtype. We hope to achieve more clinical and pathological treatment responses than with standard chemotherapy regimens and therefore to improve treatment outcomes of this extremely adverse group of patients.
