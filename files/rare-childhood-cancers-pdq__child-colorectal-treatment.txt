About This PDQ Summary
Incidence
Carcinoma of the large bowel is rare in children and adolescents.[
1
] Colorectal cancer is seen in 0.5 cases per 100,000 people younger than 20 years in the United States annually.[
2
] Fewer than 100 cases are diagnosed in children each year in the United States.[
3
] From 1973 to 2006, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)  Program database recorded 174 cases of colorectal cancer in patients younger than 19 years.[
4
]
Colorectal carcinoma accounts for about 5% of all malignancies in people aged 15 to 29 years.[
2
] An analysis of SEER data identified 5,350 adolescents and young adults between the ages of 15 and 39 years with colorectal cancer from 2010 to 2015.[

Inflammatory Bowel Disease Associated With Colorectal Cancer
A register-based nationwide cohort study was conducted in Sweden and Denmark to assess the risk of colorectal cancer related to childhood-onset Crohn disease (n = 6,937) and ulcerative colitis (n = 8,514). Patients with Crohn disease were monitored until a median age of 27 years, and patients with ulcerative colitis were monitored until age 29 years.[
1
]
During the follow-up period, 25  patients with Crohn disease (0.36%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, versus 43 reference individuals (0.06%).
During the  follow-up period, 113 patients with ulcerative colitis (1.33%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, versus 45 reference individuals (0.05%).
The hazard ratio (HR) for colorectal cancer was 6.46 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.95–10.6) in patients with Crohn disease and 32.5 (95% CI, 23.0–45.9) in patients with ulcerative colitis. The HR increased with decreasing age of diagnosis.
The relative risk of colorectal cancer is very high in both childhood-onset Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, and age at diagnosis is an additional risk factor.
These factors are potentially important when implementing a colorectal cancer surveillance program for patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

[PUBMED Abstract]
Genetic Syndromes Associated With Colorectal Cancer
About 20% to 30% of adult patients with colorectal cancer have a significant history of familial cancer; of these, about 5% have a well-defined genetic syndrome.[
1
] Hereditary colorectal cancer has two well-described forms:[
2
,
3
]
Polyposis (including familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP]  and attenuated FAP, which are caused by germline pathogenic variants in the
APC
gene, and
MUTYH
-associated polyposis, which is caused by germline pathogenic variants in the
MUTYH
gene).
Familial polyposis is inherited as a dominant trait, which confers a high
degree of risk.  Early diagnosis and surgical removal of the colon eliminates
the risk of developing carcinomas of the large bowel.[
4
,
5
]  Some colorectal
carcinomas in young people, however, may be associated with a variant of the
APC
gene, which also is associated with an
increased risk of brain tumors and hepatoblastoma.[
6
]  FAP
syndrome is caused by a gene variant on chromosome 5q, which normally
suppresses proliferation of cells lining the intestine and later development of
polyps.[
7
] A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase I trial in children aged 10 to 14 years with FAP reported that celecoxib at a dose of 16 mg/kg per day is safe for up to 3 months. At this dose, there was a significant decrease in the number of polyps detected by colonoscopy.[
8
][
Level of evidence B3
] The role of celecoxib in the management of FAP in children is not clear.
Lynch syndrome (often referred to as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), which is caused by germline pathogenic variants in DNA mismatch repair genes (
MLH1
,
MSH2
,
MSH6
, and
PMS2
) and
EPCAM
.
Despite the increased risk of multiple malignancies in families with Lynch syndrome, the risk of malignant neoplasms during childhood in those families does not seem to be increased when compared with the risk in children from families with colorectal carcinoma that is not associated with Lynch syndrome.[
9
]
Other colorectal cancer syndromes and their associated genes include oligopolyposis (
POLE
,
POLD1
),[
3
]
NTHL1
,[
10
] juvenile polyposis syndrome (
BMPR1A
,
SMAD4
), Cowden syndrome (
PTEN
), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (
STK11
).[
2
] For more information about these syndromes, see
Genetics of Colorectal Cancer
Another tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 18 is associated with
progression of polyps to malignant tumors. Multiple colon
carcinomas have been associated with neurofibromatosis type I and
several other rare syndromes.[
11
]
In a cohort study of 201 patients with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency, 59 developed colorectal cancer at a median age of 20.1 years (range, 13.9–24.9 years). The cumulative incidence of gastrointestinal cancers by age 20 years was 42% (95% confidence interval, 30%–54%).[
12
]
The incidence of these genetic syndromes in children is not well defined, but several studies have examined it, as follows:
In one review, 16% of patients younger than 40 years had a predisposing factor for the development of colorectal cancer.[
13
]
A later study documented immunohistochemical evidence of mismatch repair deficiency in 31% of colorectal carcinoma samples in patients aged 30 years or younger.[
14
]
A retrospective review of patients younger than 18 years in Germany identified 31 patients with colorectal carcinoma.[
15
]  Eleven of the 26 patients who were tested for a genetic predisposition syndrome tested positive (eight cases of Lynch syndrome, one patient with FAP, and two patients with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency). When compared with the patients without a genetic predisposition syndrome, the 11 patients with a genetic predisposition syndrome presented with more localized disease, allowing complete surgical resection and improved outcome (100% survival rate).

Clinical Presentation
Colorectal tumors can occur in any location in the large bowel. Large series and reviews suggest that ascending and descending colon tumors are each seen in approximately 30% of cases, with rectal tumors occurring in approximately 25% of cases.[
1
-
3
]
Right-sided tumors (cecum to transverse colon) were diagnosed in 28.6% of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cases. The proportion of right-sided colorectal cancers differed significantly by age group at diagnosis (38.3% of AYA patients aged 15–19 years vs. 27.3% of AYA patients aged 35–39 years).  The incidence of mucinous adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma histopathological subtypes was higher in younger patients.
Tumors of the ascending colon (right colon) may cause more subtle symptoms but are often associated with the following:
Abdominal mass.
Weight loss.
Decreased appetite.
Blood in the stool.
Iron-deficiency anemia.
Signs and symptoms in children with descending colon tumors include the following:
Abdominal pain (most common).
Rectal bleeding.
Change in bowel habits.
Weight loss.
Nausea and vomiting.
The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis was about 3 months in one series.[
4
,
5
]
Changes in bowel habits may be associated with tumors of the rectum or lower colon.
Any tumor that causes complete obstruction of the large bowel can cause bowel perforation and spread of the tumor cells within the abdominal cavity.

Diagnostic Evaluation
Diagnostic studies include the following:[
1
,
2
]
Examination of the stool for blood.
Studies of liver and kidney function.
Measurement of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).
Various medical imaging studies, including direct examination using colonoscopy to detect polyps in the large bowel. Other conventional radiographic studies include barium enema or video-capsule endoscopy followed by computed tomography of the chest and bone scans.[

[PUBMED Abstract]
Histology and Genomic Alterations
There is a higher incidence of mucinous adenocarcinoma in pediatric and adolescent patients (40%–50%), with many lesions of the signet ring cell type.[
1
-
5
] In comparison, only about 15% of adult lesions involve this histology. Tumors with mucinous histology arise from the surface of the bowel, usually at the site of an adenomatous polyp.[
5
] The tumor may extend into the muscle layer surrounding the bowel, or the tumor may perforate the bowel entirely and seed through the spaces around the bowel, including intra-abdominal fat, lymph nodes, liver, ovaries, and the surface of other loops of bowel. A high incidence of metastasis involving the pelvis, ovaries, or both may be present in girls.[
6
]
The tumors of younger patients with the mucinous histological variant may not respond well to chemotherapy. In the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population with this histology, there is a higher incidence of signet ring cells, microsatellite instability, and variants in the mismatch repair genes.[
5
,
7
,
8
]
Colorectal cancers in younger patients with noninherited sporadic tumors often lack
KRAS
variants and other cytogenetic anomalies seen in older patients.[
9
] A genomic study used exome and RNA sequencing to identify variant differences in colorectal carcinomas of  adults (n = 30), AYA patients (n = 30), and children (n = 2). Five of the identified genes (
MYCBP2
,
BRCA2
,
PHLPP1
,
TOPORS
, and
ATR
)  were more frequently altered in AYA patients. These genes contained a damaging variant and were identified through whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing. In addition, higher variant rates in DNA mismatch and DNA repair pathways, such as
MSH2
,
BRCA2
, and
RAD9B
, were more prevalent in AYA samples, but the results were not validated by RNA sequencing.[

Prognosis and Prognostic Factors
Several retrospective studies of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with colorectal cancer are summarized.
An analysis from the National Cancer Database, which tracks outcomes of patients with malignancies across 1,500 Commission on Cancer–accredited facilities, identified 531,462 patients with colon cancer between 2004 and 2016. There were 947 patients  aged 25 years or younger.[
1
]
Compared with patients older than 25 years, younger patients had more advanced disease (stage III: 44.4% vs. 33.4%; stage IV: 27.5% vs.15.3%) and higher rates of total colectomy (8.9% vs. 2.7%) and proctocolectomy (5.0% vs. 0.0%).
Stage-for-stage, the 5-year survival rates were higher in patients aged 25 years or younger than in those older than 25 years.
This study had several limitations. The data presented in this study are registry based, and not all data points were collected for all patients. In addition, only 30% of hospitals in the United States are accredited by the Commission on Cancer.
A retrospective analysis of patients examined at three tertiary referral hospitals in China between September 2000 and July 2019 identified 70 patients younger than  20 years with colorectal carcinoma.[
2
]
The most common primary tumor location was the left hemicolon (35.7%).
The prominent pathological types were mucinous adenocarcinoma (22.9%) and signet ring cell carcinoma (22.9%).
Nearly one-half (47.1%) of the patients presented with distant metastasis at diagnosis.
Of the patients who received additional tumor testing, 23.8% (5 of 21) had deficient mismatch repair protein expression and 71.4% (5 of 7) had microsatellite instability-high disease.
Another study from the National Cancer Database described the features and outcomes of 918 pediatric patients (aged <21 years), 157,577 young adult patients (aged 22–50 years), and 1,303,655 older adult patients (aged >50 years) with colorectal cancer.[
3
]
Signet ring, mucinous, and poorly differentiated histology were more commonly seen in pediatric patients.
Children and older patients had poorer 5-year overall survival rates than early-onset adults when adjusted for other covariates, such as stage and pathology.
Age younger than 21 years was a significant predictor of mortality caused by colon and rectal cancer.
As with other publications from this group, the data presented in this study are registry based, which underestimates several variables, including outpatient therapy and predisposing factors and symptoms. This limitation may explain why a specific course for inferior outcomes in patients younger than  21 years could not be identified.
A single-institution retrospective review compared 94 pediatric and young adult patients (aged <25 years) with 765 older patients.[
4
]
This study reported a worse prognosis (stage-for-stage) and a higher rate of peritoneal metastasis for the younger patients.
Nearly 30% of the pediatric patients in the cohort were known to have a predisposing cancer susceptibility diagnosis, most commonly Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, or Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
A pediatric oncology group in the Netherlands performed a retrospective analysis of adolescents and adults aged 25 years or younger with colorectal cancer.  They analyzed clinical data and molecular and genetic features of colorectal tumor tissues from 139 AYA patients (age, ≤25 years; median age, 23 years; 58% male), collected between 2000 and 2017.[
5
]
Mucinous and/or signet ring cell components were observed in 33% of tumor samples.
A genetic tumor-risk syndrome was confirmed in 39% of the patients.
Factors associated with shorter survival time included younger age at diagnosis, signet ring cell carcinoma histology, the absence of a genetic tumor-risk syndrome, and advanced stage of disease at diagnosis.
Survival is consistent with the advanced stage of disease observed in most children with colorectal cancer, with an overall mortality rate of approximately 70%. For patients with a complete surgical resection or for those with low-stage/localized disease, survival is significantly prolonged, with the potential for cure.[

Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[

]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as

and

Treatment of Childhood Colorectal Cancer
In This Section
Surgery
Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy
Other Agents
Most pediatric patients with colorectal cancer present with evidence of metastatic disease,[
1
] either as gross
tumor or as microscopic deposits in lymph nodes, on the surface of the bowel,
or on intra-abdominal organs.[
2
,
3
]
Treatment options for childhood colorectal cancer include the following:
Surgery
.
Radiation therapy and chemotherapy
.
Other agents
.
Surgery
Complete surgical excision is the most important prognostic factor and the primary goal of surgery, but it is often impossible. Removal of large
portions of tumor provides little benefit for those  with extensive
metastatic disease.[
4
] Most patients with microscopic metastatic disease
generally develop gross metastatic disease. Few individuals with metastatic
disease at diagnosis become long-term survivors.
Radiation Therapy and Chemotherapy
Current therapy includes the use of radiation for rectal and lower colon
tumors, in conjunction with chemotherapy using fluorouracil (5-FU) with
leucovorin.[
5
]  Other agents, including irinotecan, may be of value.[
1
][
Level of evidence C1
]
A review of nine clinical trials involving 138 patients younger than 40 years  demonstrated that the use of combination chemotherapy improved progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) in these patients. Furthermore, OS and response rates to chemotherapy were similar to those observed in older patients.[
6
][
Level of evidence B4
]
No significant benefit has been determined for interferon-alfa
given in conjunction with 5-FU/leucovorin.[
7
]
Other Agents
No prospective pediatric clinical trials have been conducted using checkpoint inhibitors. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted accelerated approval to  nivolumab for patients aged 12 years and older with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with combination fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. This approval was based on extrapolation of the results of the
CheckMate 142
trial. The trial showed an objective response rate of 31% and a disease control rate of 69% in patients with MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancers that had progressed after a regimen of fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan.[
8
]
Pembrolizumab has also been approved for adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient cancer, including colorectal cancer that has progressed after fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan therapy. This approval was based on the
KEYNOTE-164
trial, which demonstrated an objective response rate of 33% in patients with MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer.[
9
] The approval was also based on the  results of the
KEYNOTE-117
trial, which included 307 treatment-naive patients with MSI-H or mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer who were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab or a 5-FU–containing regimen. The trial showed that pembrolizumab was superior to chemotherapy, with respect to progression-free survival (median, 16.5 vs. 8.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.80;
P
= .0002).[
10
]
Other active agents used in adults include oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, panitumumab, cetuximab, aflibercept,  and regorafenib.[
