Efficacy and Safety of Induction Chemotherapy for Olfactory Neuroblastoma (ESICON)
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the induction chemotherapy efficacy in olfactory neuroblastoma. The main question it aims to answer is: wether olfactory neuroblastoma patients with different pathology subtypes apply to different induction chemotherapy schemes. Participants will be treated with different chemotherapy schemes, to evaluate the tumor remission rate and long term survival.
Olfactory Neuroblastoma
DRUG: Gemcitabine+Cisplatin(GP); Cyclophosphamide+Etoposide+Cisplatin(CEP)
Objective remission rate(ORR), According to RECIST1.1 criteria, complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR), 3 to 12 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy
Pathological complete remission(pCR) rate after induction chemotherapy., pCR rate refers to the probability that no tumor cells was found during pathological diagnosis of tumor sample of surgical treatment after induction chemotherapy, in all patients who have been enrolled in the group., about 4 weeks after surgical resection, up to 12 weeks|The rate of surgical pathology negative margin, During the surgery after induction chemotherapy, 4-6 surgical margins were retrieved for each patient. The rate of surgical pathology negative margin refers to the probability that pathological examination showed no tumor cells in all surgical margins, among all patients who have been enrolled in the group., about 4 weeks after surgical resection, up to 12 weeks|2-year overall survival (OS) rate, The 2-year OS rate refers to the proportion of alive patients 2 years after enrollment, analyzed using the Kaplan Meier method., 2 years (24 months)|Rate of treatment related side effects, Refers to the incident rate of side effects related to the prescribed treatment during the induction chemotherapy and the whole follow-up duration. Treatment-related side effects were evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5., 2 years (24 months)
This study included patients with olfactory neuroblastoma who were pathologically diagnosed and met the criteria. According to molecular profiles, two different induction chemotherapy schemes were used to evaluate the tumor remission rate.
