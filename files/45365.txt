This study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy in patients with advanced melanoma. Autologous TILs are expanded from tumor resections or biopsies and infused i.v. into the patient after NMA lymphodepletion treatment with hydroxychloroquine and cyclophosphamide.
