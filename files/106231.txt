Primary Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease (PPNAD) and the CARNEY Complex (CNC)
Cohort CNC-PPNAD will be investigated with clinical, genetic, biological and imaging work-up every year during 3 years. Cohort L-MC will be investigated clinically at inclusion and a PERKAR1A genotype will be performed.
Primary; Complex|Pigmented Nodular Adrenocortical Disease, Primary, 1|Periorificial Lentiginosis|Cardiac Myxoma
To assess the clinical manifestations of the CARNEY Complex (CNC) and/or the primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), 6 months
Genotype/phenotype correlation. To determine the frequency of PRKAR1A germline mutation in patients with isolated cardiac myxoma or isolated lentiginosis., 6 months
The primary aim is to assess the clinical manifestations of the CARNEY Complex (CNC) and/or the primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) in patients with CNC, isolated PPNAD or carriers of PRKAR1A and PPNAD1 (PDE11A4) germline mutation (Cohort CNC-PPNAD). In this cohort genotype/phenotype correlation will be studied. A second aim is to determine the frequency of PRKAR1A germline mutation in patients with isolated cardiac myxoma or isolated lentiginosis (Cohort L-MC).
