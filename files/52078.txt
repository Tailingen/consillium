The Culture of Advanced/Recurrent/Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Organoids and Drug Screening
The study aims to establish an organoids platform and apply them to screen drugs for advanced/recurrent/metastatic colorectal cancer patients.
Colorectal Cancer
Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival means the duration from enrollment to disease progression or death, 2 years|Overall Survival, Overall survival means the duration from enrollment to death due to any cause. The last follow-up time is calculated as the death time for subjects who lost follow-up, 3 years and 5 years
Diagnostic Indicators, The sensitivity and specificity of organoids derived from colorectal cancer of predicting chemotherapy response of patients., 2 years
The study was designed as a prospective, observational clinical trial in a single center. We establish organoids derived from patients with advanced/recurrent/metastatic colorectal cancer. Organoids will be validated with a combination of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis and histopathology. Drug screening assay will be performed on organoids with the chemotherapy and targeted agents, and the sensitivity and speciality will be compared with the clinical practice.
