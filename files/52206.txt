This is a clinical study of personalized self-DC vaccine targeting neo-antigen (Neo-DC vaccine) in the treatment of advanced solid tumors (especially head and neck cancer, non-driver gene sensitive mutation of non-small cell lung cancer). The investigators plan to enroll about 9 patients to explore the dose limited toxicity or recommended dose for future study of Neo-DC vaccine. The study is designed as 3 plus 3 model, and set two dose levels.
