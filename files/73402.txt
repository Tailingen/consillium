Cervical cancer screening uptake rate, The operational definition of screening uptake accounts for hybrid options that allow for either HPV self-sampling, or Pap and/or HPV testing by a clinician. We define screening uptake as:

1. receiving Pap and/or HPV testing by a clinician;
2. self-sampling HPV-negative or HPV16/18+; or
3. self-sampling positive for other high-risk HPV types (i.e., "HPV+ other") or unsatisfactory and returning for a follow-up Pap test to complete the screening episode. For women with "HPV+ other" or unsatisfactory test results on self-sampling, the screening uptake date will be the date of the follow-up Pap test; if the Pap test is not completed, the woman will not be considered screened., up to one-year (time-to-event) following intervention
