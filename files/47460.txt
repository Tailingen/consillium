A Study of Clinical Outcomes in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Patients Treated With Venetoclax in Greece
This study is being done to evaluate the clinical outcomes of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) participants treated with venetoclax as routine standard of care in Greece. The decision to treat with venetoclax is made by the participant's physician prior to being offered enrollment in this study.

The objectives of this study include determining overall response rate, assessing safety information, analyzing patient profiles and disease characteristics and participant quality of life.
