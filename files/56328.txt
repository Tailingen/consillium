A Study to Test How Well Different Doses of BI 3706674 Are Tolerated by People With Advanced Cancer in the Stomach and Oesophagus
This study is open to adults with advanced cancer in the stomach and oesophagus. This is a study for people for whom previous treatment was not successful or no treatment exists. In this study, BI 3706674 is given to humans for the first time.

The purpose of this study is to find a suitable dose of BI 3706674 that people with advanced cancer can tolerate when taken alone. Another purpose is to check whether BI 3706674 can make tumours shrink. BI 3706674 blocks growth signals and may prevent the tumour from growing.

Participants take BI 3706674 as a tablet when starting treatment. Different doses of BI 3706674 are tested during this study. If there is benefit for the participants and if they can tolerate it, the treatment is given up to the maximum duration of the study. During this time, participants visit the study site regularly. The total number of visits depends on how they respond to and tolerate the treatment. Doctors record any unwanted effects and regularly check the general health of the participants.
Solid Tumor, KRAS Mutation
DRUG: BI 3706674
Part A: Occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) evaluation period, up to 28 days|Part B: Occurrence of drug-related adverse events (AEs) ≥ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 during the on-treatment period, up to 3.5 years|Part C: Objective response (OR) based on central assessment, OR is defined as best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), where BOR is determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 from first treatment administration until the earliest of disease progression, death, or last evaluable tumour assessment before start of subsequent anticancer therapy, loss to follow-up or withdrawal of consent., up to 3.5 years
Part A: Occurrence of DLTs during the on-treatment period, up to 3.5 years|Part B: Occurrence of DLTs during the on-treatment period, up to 3.5 years|Part B: OR based on central assessment, OR is defined as best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), where BOR is determined according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 from first treatment administration until the earliest of disease progression, death, or last evaluable tumour assessment before start of subsequent anticancer therapy, loss to follow-up or withdrawal of consent., up to 3.5 years|Part B: Duration of objective response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first documented CR or PR until the earliest of disease progression or death among patients with objective response., up to 3.5 years|Part B: Tumour shrinkage, Tumour shrinkage is defined as the difference between the minimum post-baseline sum of diameters of target lesions (long axis for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) and the baseline sum of diameters of the same set of target lesions., up to 3.5 years|Part B: Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from first treatment administration until tumour progression according to RECIST version 1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier., up to 3.5 years|Part C: Duration of objective response, up to 3.5 years|Part C: Tumour shrinkage, up to 3.5 years|Part C: Progression-free survival (PFS), up to 3.5 years|All trial parts: Maximum measured concentration (Cmax) of BI 3706674 evaluated after the first dose in Cycle 1, up to 28 days|All trial parts: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve over a uniform dosing interval τ (AUCτ) of BI 3706674 evaluated after the first dose in Cycle 1, up to 28 days|Maximum measured concentration of BI 3706674 evaluated at steady state on Cycle 2 Day 1 (Cmax,ss), From Day 1 of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days) up to 3.5 years|All trial parts: Area under the plasma concentration-time curve over a uniform dosing interval τ of BI 3706674 evaluated at steady state on Cycle 2 Day 1 (AUCτ,ss), From Day 1 of Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days) up to 3.5 years|All trial parts: Occurrence of AEs during the on-treatment period, up to 3.5 years
