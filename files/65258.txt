Sodium Fluorescein-Guided Resection of Pediatric Neurosurgical Tumors
Sodium fluorescein, which has been shown to be useful for intraoperative guidance regarding the resection of adult neurosurgical tumors, can aid the resection of pediatric neurosurgical tumors.
Pediatric Neurosurgical Tumors
DRUG: Sodium Fluorescein|DEVICE: Microscopic Resection
Percent of Tumor Resected: Intracranial Lesions, For all patients, pre-operative imaging and post-operative imaging will be used to analyze the extent of resection of the tumors. In intracranial lesions, the use of volumetric imaging tools will be used to calculate the extent of tumor resection., Pre-op assessment to outpatient follow up, up to 6 weeks|Percent of Tumor Resected: Spinal Lesions, For all patients, pre-operative imaging and post-operative imaging will be used to analyze the extent of resection of the tumors. In spinal lesions, manual measurement will be used to determine the extent of resection., Pre-op assessment to outpatient follow up, up to 6 weeks
This study will be a prospective non-randomized cohort study with patients presenting to Children's Hospital Colorado for resection of a central nervous system tumor. This study will employ the use of sodium fluorescein and an FDA approved operative microscope equipped with excitation and barrier filters for monitoring with sufficient fluorescent enhancement and contrast. Fluorescein sodium is a small organic salt that accumulates in areas of diminished blood-brain barrier integrity and allows for determination of the margins between tumor and normal brain function.
