Construction and Validation of Risk Prediction Model for PICC Catheter Displacement
The occurrence of PICC catheter displacement is caused by many factors. In order to predict the risk of PICC and early warn high-risk patients, this study prospectively included patients with PICC catheter in a three Grade-A hospitals in June 2019, analyzed a variety of related factors, built a scientific and effective risk prediction model of PICC catheter displacement, and verified the goodness of fit and differential validity of the model.
