Carbon Ion Followed by Proton Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer With Pelvic Lymph Nodes Metastases
The present of clinically pelvic lymph node positive (cN1) represent one of the most important prognostic factors for recurrence and cancer-specific mortality of prostate cancer patients. Approximately 12% of prostate cancer patients present with cN1 disease at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, with the advent of more sensitive advance diagnostic imaging techniques, such as PSMA PET/CT, the likelihood that pelvic nodes will be found earlier and more frequently.

Unfortunately, The optimal treatment for patients with cN1 still remains unclear. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the cornerstone of prostate cancer with pelvic lymph node metastasis. Some retrospective and database studies have shown that addition of local radiotherapy (RT) to ADT improve the treatment outcome. The 2022 NCCN guideline recommend RT combined with 2 to 3 years ADT in patients with initially diagnosed cN1 prostate cancer who have a life expectancy greater than 5 years.
