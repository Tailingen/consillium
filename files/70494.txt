Neoadjuvant Gemcitabine and Cisplatin in Combination With Perioperative Pembrolizumab Versus Upfront Surgery for Patients With Primary Resectable and Borderline Resectable Perihilar and Distal Cholangiocarcinoma
Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (eCCA) is a rare and aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. ECCA can be further subcategorised in perihilar and distal cholangiocarcinoma (pCCA and dCCA). Surgical resection is the only potential cure, but only one-third of patients are eligible. Even among those deemed resectable, a significant portion (≈30%) experience disease progression before surgery, while another 30% are found unresectable during exploration. High recurrence rates and postoperative complications further limit survival, with 5-year overall survival ranging from 13% (R1 resection) to 40% (R0 resection). Given the long preoperative work-up period and lack of treatment during this phase, a neoadjuvant approach may improve outcomes by increasing R0 resections, reducing recurrence, and optimizing patient selection.

This multicenter, randomized phase 2B/3 trial aims to assess whether neoadjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin plus perioperative pembrolizumab improves event-free survival in patients with resectable and borderline resectable pCCA and dCCA.

Event Free Survival, An event is defined as the time from randomization to any progression of disease leading to unresectability, progression or recurrence of disease after surgery (all based on RECIST or pathology) or death from any cause., 18 months
Overall Survival (OS), Most important secondary endpoint: median OS defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. 2-, 3- and 5-years OS will also be reported., Median, 2-, 3-, 5- years OS
