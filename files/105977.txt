Cilengitide Together With Radiochemotherapy in Patients With Locally Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a two-center study which includes 24 patients maximum on 36 months : 24 months accrual - 12 months follow up.

Eligible patients are included according to a standard 3+3 design.

Patients included in the trial will be treated with a combination of radiochemotherapy (standard radiotherapy of 66 Gy, 2 Gy per daily fraction, and cisplatin and vinorelbine based chemotherapy).

Cilengitide will be administered alone as continuous infusion two weeks before the radiochemotherapy and will then be continued during radiochemotherapy as continuous infusion.

The dose levels investigated will be applied to the continuous administration (a maximum of 4 dose levels).

After the end of concomitant radiochemotherapy, cilengitide will be administered i.v. at a dose of 2000 mg twice weekly until the end of chemotherapy.

The dose of Cilengitide administered after radiotherapy will not be increased. 4 dose levels are defined:12, 18, 27 et 40 mg /hour.
