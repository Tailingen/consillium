Assessing the Clinical Utility of Adding Pentoxifylline to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Protocols in Breast Cancer Patients"
Breast cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, has spurred the investigation of novel therapeutic approaches. Pentoxifylline (PTX), a synthetic methylxanthine derivative, has shown promise in preclinical studies when combined with conventional anticancer drugs. This study aims to assess PTX's impact when added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocols in breast cancer patients, with the goal of improving treatment outcomes and reducing associated toxicities.
