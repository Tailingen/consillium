Phase I Dose Escalation Study of BAY94-9343 Given by Intravenous Infusion Every 3 Weeks in Japanese Subjects With Advanced Malignancies
The primary objectives of the Phase I study 15404 are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BAY94-9343 given once every 3 weeks in Japanese subjects with advanced, refractory solid tumors.

The secondary objectives are to investigate the efficacy, biomarkers and immunogenicity.
