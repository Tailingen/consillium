A Phase 1/2 Study of Lenalidomide in Combination With Bendamustine in Relapsed and Primary Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma
Management of patients with recurring Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) after stem cell transplantation failure represents a typical unmet medical need prompting active development and validation of new agents and treatment strategies. The LEBEN protocol combines two agents, lenalidomide and bendamustine, framing different targets on both tumor and microenvironmental cells of HL. These agents, while showing a low risk of overlapping extrahematologic toxicities, may hit the proliferation machinery of H-RS cells and/or their progenitors, synergistically inhibit tumor-related angiogenesis and interfere on cytokine-mediate circuitries operating in the microenvironment to support tumor cell survival.

A weekly schedule of bendamustine, at 60 mg/m2, is combined with the continuous administration of increasing dose of lenalidomide (10, 15, 20 e 25 mg dose levels in a 28-day cycle). Such schedule of Bendamustine is aimed at enhancing the antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory activity of continuous Lenalidomide, as studies have shown that low and protracted doses of alkylators induce a decrease in microvascular density of tumor tissues and inhibit mobilization and viability of circulating endothelial progenitors.

The Bayesian phase 1/2 dose finding method of Thall and Cook was employed. This method chooses doses based-on both response and toxicity, and accounts for the trade-off between these two outcomes.

Dose finding, as best trade-off between toxicity and efficacy according to the Bayesian phase I/II dose finding method of Thall and Cook, According to the Bayesian phase I/II dose finding method of Thall and Cook,a target efficacy-toxicity trade-off contour has been constructed by fitting a curve to target values of pE (probability ofEfficacy) and pT (probability of Toxicity) of 0.30 and 0.40, respectively and probability cut-offs pE (for Efficacy)and pT (for Toxicity) set at 0.10 and 0.10,respectively.The area underneath the target contour has desirable πE, πT pairs. Up to 36 patients can be treated in cohorts of size 3. The 'best' dose is defined as that giving the largest response-toxicity trade-off., Evaluation at day +56, i.g. after two cycles.
AE/SAE rate at completion of treatment, After course 6. i.g. about 6 months|Overall Rate Response, After 2, 4 and 6 cycles|Event Free Survival, From the time from study entry to any treatment failure including disease progression, or discontinuation of treatment for any reason|Time to Progression, From entry until documented lymphoma progression or death as a result of lymphoma.|Response Duration, From the time when criteria for response (i.g. CR or PR) are met, for which the event is the first documentation of relapse or progression.
