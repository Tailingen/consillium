The Performance of Multi-tracer Multimodality PET in Lymphoma
Investigating the performance of Multi-tracer Multimodality PET in lymphoma
Positron-Emission Tomography
SUVmax, Standardized uptake value of 68Ga/ 18F-NOTA-FAPI 04 for target lesion of subject or suspected tumor in each time point window (SUV), 150 days
In this study investigators evaluated Nodal and Extranodal Lymphoma Lesions uptake by different molecular probe such as FDG, FAPI-04 via multimodality PET (PET/CT and PET/MR). Our Previous studies have shown that uptake of FAPI-04 on PET may be an indicator of lymphoma lesions. The combination of PET with CT/MR allows for depicting metabolic, functional and morphological properties of tumor lesions at the same time, which is therefore an alternative attractive pairing for diagnosis, staging and prognosis of lymphoma.
