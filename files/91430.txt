Study of Alimta and Epirubicin Administered in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a non-randomized Phase 2 portion of a study testing ALIMTA and epirubicin in combination for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Epirubicin is a well-established drug for the therapy of breast cancer. Both ALIMTA and epirubicin have been combined with other drugs but they have not yet been combined with each other. It is expected that the patient will benefit from the different mechanisms of action of the two drugs.
