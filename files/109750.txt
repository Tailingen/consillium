The Efficacy and Safety of FE 200486 in Treatment of Patients Suffering From Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this trial was to select a dose of degarelix (FE 200486). Three groups of patients were treated for six months on different doses. The patients had blood samples taken and measured for Testosterone in order to determine the most efficient dose to provide fast and sustained castration. The patients came to the clinic for 16 visits and dependent on the blood sample results they were invited to return for additional blood samples on a two weekly basis.
