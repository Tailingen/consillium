This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group Phase 3 study in cancer subjects requiring treatment with background opioids for pain due to bone metastasis.

Approximately 144 subjects will be randomized to one of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (approximately 72 subjects per group). Subjects will receive a total of 3 subcutaneous injections, separated by 8 weeks in addition to background opioids administered throughout the study.

Treatment groups will include: 1. Placebo SC (matching tanezumab SC) in addition to background opioid therapy. 2. Tanezumab 20 mg SC in addition to background opioid therapy.

The study consists of three periods: Pre-Treatment (up to 37 days), Double-Blind Treatment (24 weeks) and Safety Follow-up (24 weeks).
