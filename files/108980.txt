A Feasibility Trial of Avastin (Bevacizumab) in Combination With Concomitant Chemoradiation (Cisplatin and Vinorelbine) in Patients With Locally Advanced Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.
This single arm study will assess the feasibility of use, safety and tolerability of Avastin(bevacizumab) in combination with chemoradiation therapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.An initial cohort of patients will receive Avastin 7.5mg/kg iv every 3 weeks, in combination with concurrent thoracic radiation for 6.6 weeks and chemotherapy (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 iv and vinorelbine 15mg/m2 iv administered according to a standard treatment protocol). If no dose-limiting toxicities are observed, a second cohort of patients will receive Avastin at a dose of 15mg/kg iv every 3 weeks, in combination with a similar treatment regimen to that of the first cohort. After 5 cycles of combination treatment, Avastin monotherapy will be administered for a further 4 cycles. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is \<100 individuals.
