Safety/Efficacy Study of Imprime PGG With Cetuximab in Patients With Recurrent/Progressive Colorectal Carcinoma
Phase 1b, safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy, multicenter, dose-escalating Study of Imprime PGG™ Injection dosed in combination with Cetuximab and concomitant irinotecan therapy. Enrolled patients will have a confirmed diagnosis of recurrent or progressive colorectal carcinoma following treatment with a 5-fluorouracil-containing regimen.
Recurrent Colorectal Carcinoma|Progressive Colorectal Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Imprime PGG 2 mg/kg|BIOLOGICAL: Imprime PGG 4 mg/kg|BIOLOGICAL: Cetuximab|DRUG: Irinotecan|BIOLOGICAL: Imprime PGG 6mg/kg
Safety and Maximum Tolerated Dosage of Imprime PGG When Used in Combination With Cetuximab With or Without Irinotecan Therapy, Safety and maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) of Imprime PGG was determined by the Adverse Events Task Force based on the drug-related adverse events experienced by subjects that met the criteria for a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) within a timeframe of the first 3 weeks of treatment and 1 week follow-up.

If one in the initial three subjects for a dose group experienced a DLT, three additional subjects were enrolled in that dose group. If two or more subjects in the expanded dose group experienced a DLT, the study was to be stopped and the MTD was defined as the dose prior to the dose at which the DLT was observed. If a DLT occurred in the first dose group (2 mg/kg Imprime PGG), the protocol allowed for the next group to be dosed at a reduced dose of 1 mg/kg Imprime PGG.

The dose groups described above were: Dose Group 1 (Imprime PGG 2 mg/kg), Dose Group 2 (Imprime PGG 4 mg/kg), Dose Group 3 (Imprime PGG 6 mg/kg)., From the date of the first dose of study drug to disease progression or until development of a drug toxicity that precludes further protocol treatment, up to 15 months
Rate of Number of Participants With Tumor Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), Stable Disease (SD), or Progressive Disease (PD) in Each Study Arm, The best observed overall response rates were defined as the number of participants experiencing a best tumor response of either complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions), partial response (PR; \>=30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions), stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) based on RECIST criteria v1.0., From the date of the first dose of study drug to disease progression or last objective evaluation of the tumor before treatment discontinuation due to any reason, up to 15 months|Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per RECIST Criteria v1.0 in Each Study Arm, The overall response rate was defined as the number of participants experiencing a best tumor response of either complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or partial response (PR; \>=30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) based on RECIST criteria v.1.0. Overall response rate (ORR) = CR + PR., From the date of the first dose of study drug to disease progression or last objective evaluation of the tumor before treatment discontinuation due to any reason, up to 15 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR) Per RECIST Criteria v1.0 in Each Study Arm, The disease control rate was defined as the number of participants experiencing a best tumor response of either complete response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions), partial response (PR; \>=30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST criteria v.1.0. Disease control rate (DCR) = CR + PR + SD., From the date of the first dose of study drug to disease progression or last objective evaluation of the tumor before treatment discontinuation due to any reason, up to 15 months|Duration of Time-to-Progression (TTP) in Each Study Arm, Time-to-progression (TTP) was defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first documented progression (date of the CT scan where progression was first observed; or where progression was first observed if clinical assessment). Subjects who did not progress were censored at the last objective evaluation (the date of the last CT scan; or last observed clinical assessment)., The time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first documented progression or last objective evaluation of the tumor before treatment discontinuation due to any reason, up to 15 months|Duration of Overall Tumor Response in Each Study Arm, The duration of objective tumor response was defined as the time from the date of the first documented CT scan showing CR (disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (\>=30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions), whichever occurred first, to the date of the first documented progression (date of CT scan where PD was first observed; or where progression was first observed if based on a clinical assessment)., The time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first documented progression or last objective evaluation of the tumor before treatment discontinuation due to any reason, up to 15 months|Duration of Disease Control in Each Study Arm, Duration of stable disease (SD) was to be an efficacy variable, however, duration of disease control was used in place of duration of stable disease, as it is a more clinically meaning measure of the effectiveness of the treatment. Duration of disease control was defined as the time from the date of the first documented CT scan showing CR (disappearance of all target lesions), PR (\>=30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) or SD, whichever occurred first, to the date of the first documented progression (date of CT scan where PD was first observed; or where progression was first observed if based on a clinical assessment)., The time from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of first documented progression, or last objective evaluation of the tumor before treatment discontinuation due to any reason, up to 15 months
