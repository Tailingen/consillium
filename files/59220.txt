An Observational Study of Lung Cancer Related Symptoms and Disease Control Rate in Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving First-Line Platinum-Based Chemotherapy With or Without Avastin (Bevacizumab)
This prospective observational study will evaluate the evolution of lung cancer related symptoms and their correlation with the disease control rate (complete response, partial response and stable disease) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer initiating first-line treatment with standard platinum-based chemotherapy with or without Avastin (bevacizumab). Data will be collected from each patient at baseline and after 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy.
Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Change in lung cancer related symptoms (LCSS questionnaire), up to approximately 6 months (4-6 cycles of chemotherapy)|Correlation of lung cancer related symptoms and disease control rate (complete response, partial response, stable disease according to RECIST criteria), approximately 2 years
Frequency/severity of lung cancer related symptoms (LCSS questionnaire), approximately 2 years
