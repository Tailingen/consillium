Application of Amide Proton Transfer-weighted Imaging in Predicting Pathological Complete Response After Neoadjuvant Therapy of Rectal Cancer
The goal of this observational study is to learn about the amide proton transfer-weighted imaging for rectal cancer response assessment after neoadjuvant therapy. The main question it aims to answer is:

• Does amide proton transfer-weighted imaging predict the cancer response before surgery? Participants will underwent amide proton transfer-weighted imaging as part of their regular MRI examination.
