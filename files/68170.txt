A Study to Test the Safety of the Investigational Drug Larotrectinib in Adults That May Treat Cancer
This research study is done to test the safety of the drug larotrectinib in adult cancer patients. The drug may be used to treat cancer with a change in a particular gene (NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3), because it blocks the action of these genes in cancer cells. The study also investigates how the drug is absorbed and processed in the human body. This is the first study to test larotrectinib in humans with cancer, for whom no other effective therapy exists.
Solid Tumors Harboring NTRK Fusion
DRUG: Larotrectinib (Vitrakvi, BAY2757556)
Number of participants with adverse events, 25 months|Severity of adverse events, The severity of adverse events will be assesssed according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03., 25 months|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 25 months|Recommended dose for dose expansion, 25 months
Maximum concentration of larotrectinib in plasma (Cmax), Predose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after drug administration on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1|Time to maximum concentration of larotrectinib in plasma (Tmax), Predose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after drug administration on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1|Half-life of larotrectinib in plasma (t1/2), Predose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after drug administration on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1|Area under the concentration versus time curve of larotrectinib in plasma (AUC), Predose and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after drug administration on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) as appropriate, Up to 60 months|Duration of Response (DOR), Up to 60 months
The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: an initial dose escalation phase of larotrectinib in subjects with advanced solid tumors will be followed by an expansion phase in subjects with solid tumors having a NTRK fusion.

The objectives of the study are to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, recommended dose and efficacy of orally administered larotrectinib in patients with NTRK fusions.
