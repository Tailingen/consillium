CAR-monocytes for the Treatment of HER2 Overexpressing Solid Tumors
This is a first-in-human open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, and manufacturing feasibility of anti-HER2 CAR-monocytes (CT-0525) in participants with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors overexpressing HER2 whose disease has progressed on standard approved therapies.
HER2-positive
DRUG: CT-0525
Assess the safety and tolerability of CT-0525 by estimating the frequency and severity of adverse events in participants with HER2 overexpressing solid tumors., Frequency and severity of adverse events including, but not limited to, estimating frequency and severity of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)., Day 28|Assess the feasibility of manufacturing CT-0525., Percentage of products that pass release criteria among all manufactured products., Baseline
