A Study of Vantictumab (OMP-18R5) in Combination With Docetaxel in Patients With Previously Treated NSCLC
This is an open-label Phase 1b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of vantictumab when combined with docetaxel.
Solid Tumors
DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: vantictumab
Safety and tolerability of vantictumab in combination with docetaxel in patients with recurrent or advanced NSCLC. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined in patients treated with vantictumab in combination with weekly paclitaxel., Subjects will be treated and observed for DLT through the end of the first cycle (Days 0-28)
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of vantictumab when administered in combination with docetaxel to patients with recurrent or advanced NSCLC, Apparent half life, AUC, clearance, volume of distribution, Plasma sample for Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis to be obtained prior to the vantictumab infusion and before docetaxel infusion from Day 0 to treatment termination
Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been determined, up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of vantictumab combined with docetaxel. Up to approximately 34 patients may be enrolled into the study.
