Etirinotecan Pegol (NKTR-102) in NSCLC
This Phase 2 study is designed to characterize the objective response rate (defined as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)) of Etirinotecan pegol administered to subjects with metastatic and recurrent NSCLC after failure of 2nd line therapy. Up to 37 eligible subjects will receive the investigational drug q3 weeks until they are no longer benefiting.

Overall Objective Response Rate, The primary objective of this phase 2 trial is to estimate the objective response rate (Complete Response or Partial Response, as measured by RECIST version 1.1) for patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC being treated with etirinotecan pegol after failure of second-line therapy., 6 weeks
This is a Phase 2 study designed to characterize the objective response rate (defined as complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)) of Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102) administered to subjects with metastatic and recurrent NSCLC after failure of 2nd line therapy. Up to 37 eligible subjects will be enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania.

One cycle will be defined as 3 weeks. Patients will be followed clinically every week for the first cycle with laboratory parameters and physical exam. Response will be determined by RECIST version1.1 after 2 cycles of therapy. Patients with stable disease (SD), PR or CR will continue on treatment for up to six cycles. Those who are benefitting after six cycles will have the option of continuing on treatment. Patients with progressive disease will be taken off study and will be followed for OS data.
