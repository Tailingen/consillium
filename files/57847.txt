Characterization of the natural history of various forms of primordial dwarfism, Data will be collected at enrollment, and over time, to allow for analysis of associated concerns throughout the lifespan, 5 years
The goal of this registry is to collect information on individuals with forms of microcephalic primordial dwarfism. The registry will enable detailed natural history studies of MOPD II and associated conditions. The study team hopes that identification of risk factors will allow for preventative treatments and thus a better quality of life for individuals with these diagnoses.
