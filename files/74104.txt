Adjuvant Capecitabine Versus Observation Alone in Curatively Resected Stage IB Gastric Cancer((KCSG ST14-05): CATALYSIS
multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label phase III
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: capecitabine
recurrence-free survival, To demonstrate that capecitabine is superior to observation only (control arm) in terms of recurrence-free survival in curatively resected stage IB gastric cancer., 8 years
overall survival, To compare overall survival in the capecitabine arm compared with the control arm., 8 years|Safety profiles, Toxicity profiles will be assessed with the patient 28 +/- 3 days after the last intake of study medication is required. (treatment arm only), 8years
This is a prospective, randomized, open-label phase III study of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative resection in patients with pathologic stage IB (by AJCC 6th edition) gastric cancer with at least one additional risk factor (additional risk factors for recurrence include age \>65 years, male gender, presence of lymphovascular invasion, presence of perineural invasion). The superiority design will compare the efficacy and safety profiles of adjuvant capecitabine (Arm A) versus observation alone (Arm B).
