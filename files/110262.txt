A Study of Varlitinib in Japanese Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumours
The purpose of this study is to explore safety and efficacy of varlitinib administered as monotherapy in Japanese subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, and administered as combination with capecitabine in Japanese subjects with advanced or metastatic biliary tract cancer. Also to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of varlitinib, capecitabine and its metabolite.
