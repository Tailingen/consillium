Randomized Interval Assessment Trial of Lu177-Dotatate in Slowly Progressive G1-2 Advanced Midgut Neuroendocrine Tumors
This is a randomized Phase II/late phase I de-escalation clinical trial with approved investigational medicinal products in new use condition, low intervention.

Disease under study Patients with unresectable or metastatic, slowly progressive, well-differentiated (Grade1 and Grade2), somatostatin receptor-positive midgut neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).

It is planned to randomize 166 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of slowly progressive grade 1 or grade 2 advanced midgut neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) candidates to receive 177Lu-Dotatate targeted radioligand therapy (RLT). Patients are required to have SSTR+ disease, as evidenced on somatostatin receptor imaging. Patients will be randomized into two arms:

1. control arm: regimen 177Lu-Dotatate every 8 weeks (q8w)
2. experimental arm: regimen 177Lu-Dotatate every 16 weeks (q16w)

Research hypothesis: Less intensive somatostatin-receptor (SST) targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) (7.4 GBq/cycle 177Lu-Dotatate every 16 weeks x 4 cycles) is associated with less severe hematological toxicities and may mitigate the risk to develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) with similar antitumor efficacy in slowly growing gastrointestinal grade 1-2 NETs.

1. Rationale The main hypothesis is less intensive somatostatin-receptor (SST) targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) (7.4 GBq/cycle 177Lu-Dotatate every 16 weeks x 4 cycles) is associated with less severe hematological toxicities and may mitigate the risk to develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) with similar antitumor efficacy in slowly growing gastrointestinal grade 1-2 NETs.

5. Trial Design RIALTO is an a randomized, prospective, international, open-label, phase III - I trial comparing a less intensive RLT regimen 4 cycles of 177Lu-Dotatate (7·4 GBq/cycle) every 16 weeks) versus the conventional one (4 cycles of 177Lu-Dotatate (7·4 GBq/cycle) every 8 weeks)
6. Trial Population It is planned to randomize 166 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of slowly progressive grade 1 or grade 2 advanced midgut neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) candidates to receive 177Lu-Dotatate targeted radioligand therapy (RLT). Patients are required to have SSTR+ disease, as evidenced on somatostatin receptor imaging. Patients with a large SRI+ mesenteric mass with abdominal-dominant disease judged by the investigator to be a midgut NET will also be eligible. Patients will be randomized into two arms: control (regimen 177Lu-Dotatate every 8 weeks) and experimental (regimen 177Lu-Dotatate every 16 weeks).
7. Study Treatments

Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to experimental or control arms respectively:

Experimental arm:

1. Treatment with 177Lu-Dotatate (7.4 Gigabecquerel/cycle) during 30 min intravenous infusion every 16 weeks (q16w) x 4 cycles
2. Renal protection starting 30 minutes before targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) lasting 4 hours (iv amino acid solution of 14.4-20g of lysine and 14.9-20.7g of arginine in 1 to 2 liters of solution)
3. Long-acting standard doses of SSA (Lanreotide autogel 120 mg subcutaneous or Octreotide LAR 30 mg intramuscular, starting 24h after RLT every 4 weeks during RLT (q16w interval SSA administration should be adjusted to RLT administrations so that SSA is always given 24h after each RLT dose and at least 4 weeks prior to next RLT administration cycle) and q4w following last RLT administration until disease progression.

Control arm:

1. Treatment with 177Lu-Dotatate (7.4 Gigabecquerel/cycle) during 30 min intravenous infusion every 8 weeks (q8w) x 4 cycles
2. Renal protection starting 30 minutes before targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) lasting 4 hours (iv amino acid solution of 14.4-20g of lysine and 14.9-20.7g of arginine in 1 to 2 liters of solution);
3. Long-acting standard doses of SSA (Lanreotide autogel 120 mg subcutaneous or Octreotide LAR 30 mg intramuscular, starting 24h after RLT every 4 weeks during RLT (q8w interval SSA administration should be adjusted to RLT administrations so that SSA is always given 24h after each RLT dose and at least 4 weeks prior to next RLT administration cycle) and q4w following last RLT administration until disease progression
