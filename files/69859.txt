Predictive Value of Albumin - Bilirubin Score and CRP - Albumin - Lymphocyte Index for HCC Prognosis After Radical Resection
Evaluate the predictive value of the CALLY index and ALBI grading for the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after radical resection, so as to provide a reference for clinical treatment.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)|Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Prognosis
Recurrence - free survival period, It is the time interval from the patient's surgical resection to tumor recurrence or the end of follow - up. Early recurrence is defined as a tumor - free survival time of less than 2 years., Patients who underwent hepatocellular carcinoma resection from Jan 2018 to Jan 2025 were recruited. The time from resection to tumor recurrence or end of follow - up was measured, with calculation cutoff in Apr 2025 and a maximum of 88 months.
Overall Survival, The length of time from either the start of treatment or diagnosis until the death of the patient from any cause., Patients who underwent hepatocellular carcinoma resection from Jan 2018 to Jan 2025 were collected. Survival calculation was cutoff in Apr 2025. Measurement started from the initial radical resection until death, up to 88 months.
China bears a heavy burden of liver cancer. In 2022, there were 370,000 new cases and 320,000 deaths, ranking 4th in incidence and 2nd in mortality among malignant tumors. HCC, accounting for over 80% of primary liver cancer, also has high incidence and fatality rates. Radical resection, the main cure method, has a 5-year recurrence rate over 60%, so identifying recurrence risk factors is crucial. Previously, the Child - Pugh score was used for liver function evaluation, but its assessment of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy was subjective. Quantitative systems like MELD also had limitations. Over 80% of HCC develops from cirrhosis, and inflammatory and immunonutritional indices are important in cancer development. NLR, PLR, etc., show inconsistent predictive power, and the CALLY index, though better, needs improvement. Bilirubin is a key predictor, and ALBI grading can precisely quantify liver function, related to HCC recurrence and survival. This study combines ALBI and CALLY to create a four - dimensional system, expected to reflect HCC recurrence risk. As this combined prediction research is scarce, this study evaluates their predictive value for HCC patients after radical resection, guiding clinical treatment.
