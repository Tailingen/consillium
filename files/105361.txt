Validation of ICG-99mTc-nanoscan as Hybrid Tracer for Sentinel Node Biopsy
99mTc-nanocolloid, the world wide used hybrid tracer for dynamic sentinel node biopsy, has recently been replaced with 99mTc-nanoscan. The hybrid form (ICG-99mTc-nanoscan) has not yet been validated, to show the similarity between the lymphatic drainage pattern between ICG-99mTc-nanoscan and 99mTc-nanoscan.

Concordance between tracers, To demonstrate concordance between the SN visualization of 99mTc-nanoscan and ICG-99mTc-nanoscan on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT imaging, expecting an average of 3 sentinel nodes per patient. Discordance is defined as more than 1 sentinel node not detected coherently by the tracers., Measured at pre-operative imaging
Higher echelon nodes, Number of higher-echelon nodes visualized on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT imaging for both tracers (ICG-99mTc-Nanoscan and 99mTc-Nanoscan);, Measured at pre-operative imaging|Concordance between intraoperative fluorescence and radioactive findings, Number of the fluorescent nodes at time of excision;

- Number and radioactive signal intensity of the radioactive nodes at time of excision;, Measured at pre-operative imaging|Concordance between intraoperative fluorescence and radioactive findings, intensity of the fluorescent nodes at time of excision;, Measured at pre-operative imaging
The investigators want to set up this study in analogy with the comparison study which was conducted before the introduction of ICG-99mTc-Nanocolloid (99mTc-Nanocoll vs. ICG-99mTc-Nanocoll (NL26699.031.09 -N09DRF). In particular, the investigators want to validate that the hybrid ICG-99m Tc-Nanoscan shows the same preoperative gland involvement on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and that the intraoperative signal intensities remain the same. All this to maintain the level of current care.
