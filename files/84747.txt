A Study of Nivolumab in Combination With Ipilimumab in Chinese Participants With Previously Treated Advanced or Recurrent Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Nivolumab in combination with Ipilimumab in Chinese participants with previously treated late stage cancer.
