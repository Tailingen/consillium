Use of Shear Wave Elastography for Intraoperative Brain and Glioma Stiffness Measurements
This study investigates the role of intraoperative shear wave elastography ultrasound (ISWEU) in identifying healthy brain and tumor tissue stiffness differences. This data may be used to guide tumor resection in future patients.

OTHER: Non-Interventional Study
Feasibility of utilizing Intraoperative Shear Wave Elastography Ultrasound (ISWEU) measurements intraoperatively and in the human brain to measure tissue stiffness., After intraoperative measurement of brain stiffness using ISWEU, analysis will be conducted after each procedure by determining the tissue stiffness from different areas (tumor core, peritumoral brain zone, and non-cancerous brain tissue) and comparing the glioma stiffness between patients. Reviewers will determine whether ISWEU is feasible to be used as a tool to influence surgical decision., At baseline
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Determine the feasibility of utilizing ISWEU measurements intraoperatively and in the human brain to measure tissue stiffness.

OUTLINE: This is an observational study.

Patients undergo shear wave elastography ultrasound over 10-15 minutes during their standard of care surgery on study.
