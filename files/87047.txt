Multimodal Recurrence Scoring System for Stratifying Stage III Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma of Receiving Adjuvant Treatment
Whether patients with stage III clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) should receive adjuvant targeted therapy or not is still on debate. The investigators invented a multimodal recurrence scoring system that was successfully categorise patients with stage III clear cell renal cell carcinoma into high-risk and low-risk groups with Hazard Ratio (HR) of 6.21. Here the investigators randomly assign assay-defined high risk patients of locally advanced ccRCC into adjuvant targeted therapy group and observation group. Disease free survival and overall survival are the end points of observation.

DRUG: Sunitinib
Disease free survival, Disease free survival (DFS) was defined as the time interval (in years) from the date of randomization to the first date of recurrence or occurrence of a secondary malignancy or death., From the date of registration to up to 10 years
Overall survival, Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., From the date of registration to up to 10 years
