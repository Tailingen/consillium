Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacodynamics of Tislelizumab Monotherapy and Multiple Tislelizumab-based Immunotherapy Combinations in Participants With Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 2, umbrella study to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics of tislelizumab as monotherapy and in combination with investigational agents as neoadjuvant treatment in Chinese participants with resectable Stage II to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study is designed with the flexibility of adding treatment arms as new treatments become available or discontinuing treatment arms that demonstrate minimal clinical activity or unacceptable toxicity, and of modifying the participant population.

Major Pathological Response (MPR), MPR is defined as the proportion of participants with â‰¤ 10% residual viable tumor in the resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes as assessed by blinded independent pathology review (BIPR), Up to approximately 18 weeks after first dose
Pathological complete response (pCR), pCR is defined as the proportion of participants with absence of residual tumor in the resected primary tumor and all resected lymph nodes as assessed by the BIPR, Up to approximately 18 weeks after first dose|Event-free survival (EFS), EFS is defined as the time from randomization until any of the following events, whichever occurs first: radiographic disease progression that precludes definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, as assessed by investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, or death due to any cause, Up to approximately 2 years|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause, Up to approximately 2 years|Disease-free survival (DFS), DFS is defined as the time from the first date of no disease (ie, participants who underwent margin-negative \[R0\] resection) to local or distant recurrence, as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to approximately 2 years|Number of participants with adverse events, Number of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events, including serious adverse events and immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs), with severity determined according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0, Up to approximately 2 years|Proportion of participants who undergo surgical resection, Proportion of participants who undergo surgical resection within a scheduled period after receiving any dose of investigational agents, delayed or canceled surgery, duration of surgery and surgical approach, Up to approximately 18 weeks after first dose
