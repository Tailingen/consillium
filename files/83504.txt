Lymphoma, B-Cell
DRUG: Inotuzumab Ozogamicin (CMC-544)|DRUG: Rituximab (Rituxan)
Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT), A DLT was defined as the following drug-related adverse event which occurred during the first 28 days: 1) Any National Cancer Institute (NCI) Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity (except Grade 3 nausea or vomiting without optimal treatment), 2) Febrile neutropenia, 3) Grade 4 absolute neutrophil count lasting \>=7 days, 4) Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting \>=3 days, 5) Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia associated with a bleeding episode requiring platelet transfusion, 6)Delayed recovery (to grade \<=1 or baseline, except alopecia) from a drug-related toxicity that delayed the next dose \>2 weeks, Up to 28 days
Number of Participants With Objective Response: Evaluable Population, Number of participants with objective response of complete response (CR), complete response unconfirmed (CRu), or partial response (PR). Objective response included subjects with CR, CRu, and PR. Response criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) were based on the 1999 NCI International Workshop to standardize response criteria for NHL. Per the criteria for Lymph node masses: CR, normal size; CRu, normal or \>75% decrease in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters (SPD); PR, normal or \>=50% decrease in the SPD., Up to 8 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days)|Number of Participants With Objective Response: Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population, Number of participants with objective response of complete response (CR), complete response unconfirmed (CRu), or partial response (PR). Objective response included subjects with CR, CRu, and PR. Response criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) were based on the 1999 NCI International Workshop to standardize response criteria for NHL. Per the criteria for Lymph node masses: CR, normal size; CRu, normal or \>75% decrease in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters (SPD); PR, normal or \>=50% decrease in the SPD., Up to 8 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), The interval from the date of first administration of the test article until the first date on which relapsed disease, progressive disease (PD), or death was documented, censored at the last tumor evaluation date. Response criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) were based on the 1999 NCI International Workshop to standardize response criteria for NHL. Per the criteria for Lymph node masses: Relapse/PD, appearance of any new lesion or increased by \>=50% in the size., Up to 591 days
Maximum Observed Serum Concentration (Cmax) of CMC-544, Total Calicheamicin, and Anti-human CD22 Antibody (G544), CMC-544 is composed of G544, an anti-human CD22 antibody, linked to a potent cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic called calicheamicin. CD22 is expressed on the malignant cells of the majority of B-lymphocyte malignancies., Cycle 1, Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 at hour 0 (predose) and at hours 1 (before the end of infusion), 4, 48, 144,192, 312, 480, and 648 relative to the start of infusion of CMC-544|Serum Decay Half-Life (t1/2) of CMC-544, Total Calicheamicin, and G544, The time measured for the serum concentration to decrease by one half., Cycle 1, Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 at hour 0 (predose) and at hours 1 (before the end of infusion), 4, 48, 144,192, 312, 480, and 648 relative to the start of infusion of CMC-544|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Last Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast) of CMC-544, Total Calicheamicin, and G544, AUClast= Area under the serum concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to time of last measured concentration., Cycle 1, Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 at hour 0 (predose) and at hours 1 (before the end of infusion), 4, 48, 144,192, 312, 480, and 648 relative to the start of infusion of CMC-544|Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time (AUC∞) of CMC-544, Total Calicheamicin, and G544, AUC∞ = Area under the serum concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (∞). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - ∞)., Cycle 1, Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 at hour 0 (predose) and at hours 1 (before the end of infusion), 4, 48, 144,192, 312, 480, and 648 relative to the start of infusion of CMC-544|Clearance (CL) of CMC-544, Total Calicheamicin, and G544, The rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes., Cycle 1, Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 at hour 0 (predose) and at hours 1 (before the end of infusion), 4, 48, 144,192, 312, 480, and 648 relative to the start of infusion of CMC-544|Volume of Distribution (Vss) of CMC-544, Total Calicheamicin, and G544, The theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug., Cycle 1, Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 at hour 0 (predose) and at hours 1 (before the end of infusion), 4, 48, 144,192, 312, 480, and 648 relative to the start of infusion of CMC-544|Number of Participants With Positive Serum Antibody to Inotuzumab Ozogamicin (CMC-544), Antibody responses to CMC-544, Up to 8 Cycles (1 cycle = 28 days)|Number of Participants With Positive Serum Antibody to Rituximab, Antibody responses to rituximab, Up to 8 Cycles (1 cycle = 28 days)
