MRI Guided Focal Laser Ablation of Prostate Cancer
This clinical research study is designed to determine the ability of in bore MRI guided Focal Laser Ablation (MRgFLA) in patients with early stage carcinoma of prostate. The results will be evaluated by repeated MRI and prostate biopsy. Previous prospective development study demonstrated that FLA may be a viable option for men with low-intermediate risk prostate cancer. The vast majority of patients undergoing this treatment experienced minimal side effects with no peri-operative complications. Over 80% of patients treated with MRgFLA remain on AS and were able to avoid radical therapy at mean follow up duration of 3 years.

The proportion of study patients clinically free of clinically significant PCa (i.e. requires definitive treatment), Clinically significant PCa will be defined as recurrent/residual Gleason 3+4 or higher, and/or high-volume Gleason 6 disease found at 6-month biopsy., 6 months after treatment completion|The proportion of study patients clinically free of clinically significant PCa (i.e. requires definitive treatment), Clinically significant PCa will be defined as recurrent/residual Gleason 3+4 or higher, and/or high-volume Gleason 6 disease found at 24-month biopsy., 24 months after treatment completion
Treatment effect on patients' Quality of Life (QoL), the following validated self-reported urogenital functioning assessment instruments will be used before and following treatment at pre-specified interval, Validate Patient-Reported Questionnaire (International Prostate Symptom Score, scale from 0-7 mild, 8-19 moderate, 20-35 severe symptoms, higher values being worse, averages at different time points will be noted to assess improvement, decline or baseline) will be completed by participants throughout the study to assess Health Related Quality of Life., Baseline before treatment, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and at 24 months following treatment|Treatment effect on patients' Quality of Life (QoL), the following validated self-reported urogenital functioning assessment instruments will be used before and following treatment at pre-specified interval, Validate Patient-Reported Questionnaire (International Index of Erectile Function-15, higher scores are better, averages at each specified interval will be taken once all subjects reach the interval and study completion) will be completed by participants throughout the study to assess Health Related Quality of Life., Baseline before treatment, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months and at 24 months following treatment
Study Objectives are to evaluate the proportion of patients with low-intermediate risk prostate cancer undergoing focal laser ablation (MRgFLA) prostate treatment who will be free of clinically significant Prostate Cancer (PCa), when using a \> 5mm margins around the MR visible tumor in defining the ablation contour. The rationale of the study is to show that MRgFLA is a safe procedure that can significantly postpone or eliminate the need for patients with Low-Intermediate Risk prostate cancer to undergo a definitive treatment (i.e., Radical Prostatectomy or Radiation therapy) for their disease. Study population: patients with Low-Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer who are willing to take part in the study and meet study eligibility criteria. Primary Study Objective is to show that MRgFLA can significantly reduce the need for definitive treatment (e.g., Radical Prostatectomy, or Radiation therapy) and is a safe procedure for patients with Low-Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer defined in the current protocol as 1) Gleason score 6 and 7 (=3+4 or 4+3; No Grade 5 pattern), and 2) T1-T2, N0, M0.
