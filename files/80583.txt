A Study of NX-2127 in Adults With Relapsed/Refractory B-cell Malignancies
This is a first-in-human Phase 1a/1b multicenter, open-label oncology study designed to evaluate the safety and anti-cancer activity of NX-2127 in patients with advanced B-cell malignancies.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)|Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL)|Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM)|Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)|Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL)|Follicular Lymphoma (FL)|Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)|Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL)
DRUG: NX-2127
Number of Participants with Protocol Specified Dose-Limiting Toxicities, Phase 1a, Up to 24 months|To establish the MTD and/or recommended Phase 1b dosage(s) of NX-2127, Phase 1a, Up to 24 months|To evaluate the clinical activity of NX-2127 at the recommended Phase 1b dosage(s) based on overall response rate (ORR) as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1b, Up to 4 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events and Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities, Phase 1a/1b, Up to 5 years
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile of NX-2127: Maximum Serum Concentration, Phase 1a/1b - Sampling following the first dose, pre and post-dose at selected cycles, and at the end of treatment, Up to 5 years|Duration of response (DOR) as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1a/1b, Up to 5 years|Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1a/1b, Up to 5 years|Overall survival (OS) as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1b, Up to 4 years|To further evaluate the safety and tolerability of NX-2127 by collecting adverse events, treatment emergent adverse events, and incidence of all deaths, Phase 1b, Up to 4 years|Complete response (CR) rate / CR with incomplete marrow recovery as assessed by the Investigator, Phase 1a/1b, Up to 5 years
Phase 1a (Dose Escalation) will evaluate the safety and tolerability of NX-2127 in adult patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies, who have required and received at least 2 prior systemic therapies (or at least 1 prior therapy for patients with WM or PCNSL) and for which no other therapies are known to provide clinical benefit.

Phase 1b (Dose Optimization) will use a 2-stage design to further investigate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of NX-2127 in R/R B-cell malignancies based on the dosage(s) selected in Phase 1a.

Stage 1 will enroll approximately 10 participants per group based on B-cell lymphoma/leukemia indication at a specific dose selected from the first part of the study. The Sponsor may decide to open Stage 2 for any given group after review of safety and anti-tumor activity data from Stage 1.

In Stage 2, an additional 10 participants will be enrolled at the dose from Stage 1 as well as 20 additional participants at a second alternative dose. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 dose levels in Stage 2.
