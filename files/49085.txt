A Trial of a New Type of Photodynamic Therapy (VTP) in the Treatment of Patients With Cancer of the Esophagus Who Have Trouble Swallowing
The purpose of this study is to establish the highest dose of laser light for WST-11 VTP to treat obstruction from esophageal cancer that can be safely given.
Esophagogastric Cancer|Moderate to Severe Dysphagia
DRUG: WST 11-mediated VTP therapy
Maximum tolerated laser fluence rate, The maximally tolerated laser light fluence rate (mW/cm) of light exposure for VTP of malignant obstruction due to esophagogastric cancer will be measured by examining 6 fluence rates beginning with a fluence rate of 150 nW/cm, then increasing by 50mW/cm, up to a maximum of 400 mW/cm (150, 200, 250 300, 350, 400)., 60 days
The purpose of this study is to establish the highest dose of laser light for WST-11 VTP to treat obstruction from esophageal cancer that can be safely given.
