Adapted Physical Activity for Breast Cancer HER2 Positive Patient
The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a home-based adapted physical activity during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for HER2+ breast cancer.
HER2 Positive Breast Cancer
OTHER: Home-based Adapted Physical Activity
Rate of patients reaching international physical activity recommendations for post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy assessment, Time spent to physical activity and sedentariness will be evaluated by Recent Physical Activity Questionnaire (RPAQ), Change from baseline (T0: before neoadjuvant chemotherapy) at the 5 months (T1: end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy)
Longitudinal evolution of RPAQ score, Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy|Quality of life : Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30, Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy|Asthenia : Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20, Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy|Anthropometrics measurements, BMI, Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy|Anthropometrics measurements, Hip circumference (cm), Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy|Physical capacity : six-minutes walking distance test, Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy|Physical capacity : Voluntary muscular strength, Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy|Physical capacity : VO2max, This measure is optional, Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy|Lipid profile : total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy|Ventricular ejection fraction assessed by echocardiography or cardiac scintigraphy, Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy|Changes of cancer treatment, frequency of dose reduction (%), of postponement (%) or of treatment discontinuation (%), At each cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy : every three weeks during 5 months|Assessment of physical activity level using a validated smartphone application (eMouveRecherche), Including sedentariness time, Before (T0) and at the end (T1 : + 5 months) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy + before (T2 : + 8 months) and at the end (T3 : 20 month) of targeted therapy
After the assessment of their physical fitness, a home-based adapted physical activity program composed by aerobic and muscle strengthening exercises will be delivered to each patient. The aim of the intervention is to reach international recommendation in a progressive way during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
