A Study of Duvelisib Versus Gemcitabine or Bendamustine in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Nodal T Cell Lymphoma With T Follicular Helper (TFH) Phenotype
The study will evaluate the progression-free survival benefit of duvelisib monotherapy as compared to investigator's choice of gemcitabine or bendamustine in participants with relapsed/refractory nodal T cell lymphoma with TFH phenotype.
