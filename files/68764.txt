Prediction of Response to Treatment With Immunotherapy + Chemotherapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This study seeks to evaluate a multiparametric test including 6 immunohistochemical markers (PD-L1, CD8, FoxP3, PD1, CD163, CD15) to predict the cumulative incidence of death or progression on treatment with pembrolizumab+first line chemotherapy in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, regardless of the PD-L1 status and in the absence of ALK, ROS1 or EGFR alteration.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The dependent variable will be the cumulative incidence of death or progression under immunotherapy + chemotherapy at 1 year., Progression will be evaluated by CT imaging every 12 weeks and then every 9 weeks according to RECIST 1.1.

The independent variables will be the 6 immunohistochemical markers (PD-L1, CD8, FoxP3, PD1, CD163, CD15) evaluated prior to the first injection of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy from the diagnostic tissue material., At 1 year
Discrimination index (concordance index=C-statistics) of the multiparametric model and model including that of the PD-L1 test., Compare the discriminant power of the multiparametric model to that of the PD-L1 test alone., At 1 year
