Theoretically Informed Behavioral Intervention
The goal of this waitlist control clinical trial is to learn if the tailored LEARN 2 platform can prevent HIV-related comorbidities with shared risk factors in diverse sexual minority men ages 25 and older living with HIV. The main question\[s\] are:

1. Can the virtual environment improve quality of life among these participants?
2. Does the LEARN 2 platform effectively serve as prevention education for HIV comorbidity shared risk factors?

Researchers will compare participants receiving the LEARN2 virtual environment intervention to those in a waitlist control group to see if the intervention leads to improvements in quality of life and reductions in risk factors.

Participants will be asked to:

1. Engage with the virtual environment weekly.
2. Participate in virtual live health educator sessions.
3. Complete daily assessments of personal health behaviors through Ecological Momentary Assessment.

BEHAVIORAL: LEARN 2 Platform
Quality of Life scale, 29-item scale from the PROMISÂ® Profile 29 for adults. The quality- of-life questions include physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities, and pain intensity over the past 7 days. Each question, except for the pain intensity question, is measured on a 5-point scale., Baseline, 3 and 6 months
Diet, 1-item that has participants rate how healthy one's eating was that day and has been validated in EMA studies, Months 1, 3, and 5|Physical Activity, 3 items that assess the number of minutes of light, moderate, and heavy physical activity and has been validated in EMA studies., Months 1, 3, and 5|Sleep Quality, 1-item that assesses the quality of sleep for the previous night from 1(poor) to 8(extremely rested) and has been validated in EMA, Months 1, 3, and 5|Health Care Utilization, assesses perceived health needs, whether they have a plan to deal with those needs, and whether they saw a health care provider about those needs, Months 1, 3, and 5|Sexual Health, 4-items that assess whether participants had sex, type of sexual activity, and whether a condom was used, Months 1, 3, and 5|Smoking, 2-items used in EMA studies that assessed whether the participant smoked and how many cigarettes, Months 1, 3, and 5|Social Support, 3-item scale that assesses the among of emotional, informational, and tangible support received from their social network, Months 1, 3, and 5|Coping, 7-item scale where participants rate whether they used 7 different coping strategies which has been validated in EMA studies., Months 1, 3, and 5|LGBT Community Integration, 6-item measure designed to assess lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individual\&#39;s active concealment of their sexual minority status. Averaging the six study items produces the overall SOCS score., Months 1, 3, and 5
The goal of this waitlist control clinical trial is to determine the efficacy of the tailored LEARN 2 platform in preventing HIV-related comorbidities characterized by shared risk factors among diverse sexual minority men ages 25 and older living with HIV. The principal questions this study aims to address are:

1. Can engagement with the virtual environment enhance the quality of life for participants specifically in diverse sexual minority men?
2. Is the LEARN 2 platform effective in providing prevention education of shared risk factors associated with HIV comorbidities?

To evaluate these objectives, the investigators will conduct comparisons between participants allocated to the LEARN 2 virtual environment intervention and those assigned to a waitlist control group. This design will facilitate the assessment of whether participation in the LEARN 2 intervention correlates with significant improvements in quality of life metrics (behavioral and psychosocial) and a reduction in associated health risk factors.

Participants will be instructed to:

1. Engage with the virtual environment on a weekly basis, exploring tailored health content designed to address their specific needs.
2. Attend virtual live sessions with health educators, where they will receive real-time education on health issues relevant to their condition and associated lifestyle factors using the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 as a behavioral prevention framework.
3. Complete daily assessments of their personal health behaviors using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), capturing real-time data on behavioral trends that may influence their health outcomes.

This systematic approach aims to generate comprehensive data on the impact of the LEARN 2 intervention on both quality of life and the modulation of health-related behaviors among these at-risk populations.
