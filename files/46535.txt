Efficacy and Safety of Pemigatinib in Participants With Solid Tumors With FGFR Mutations or Translocations (FIGHT-208)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pemigatinib in participants with previously treated locally advanced/metastatic or surgically unresectable solid tumors harboring activating FGFR mutations or translocations.
