Conventional Laparoscopic APR Versus Laparoscopic APR With Transabdominal Individualized Levator Transection
This study is designed to compare the short-term and long-term benefits between conventional laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection (APR) and laparoscopic APR with transabdominal individualized levator transection (TILT).
Rectal Cancer
PROCEDURE: LAPR|PROCEDURE: LAPR-TILT
3-year local recurrence, 3 years post operation
3-year overall survival, 3 years post operation|3-year disease-free survival, 3 years post operation
Operative time for perineal dissection, 1 month post operation|Numbers of days to remove the urinary catheter after surgery, 1 month post operation|Circumferential Resection Margin (+) rate, circumferential resection margin positive rate, 1 month post operation|Perforation rate, intraoperative perforation rate, 1 month post operation
In the field of surgical treatment for low rectal cancer, the traditional APR is trapped by the so-called "surgical waist" and associated oncological problems, whereas the spread of extra-levator abdominoperineal resection (ELAPR) is still hindered by its high risk of wound complications and neurovascular injuries. Owing to the advancement of laparoscopic techniques, the investigators developed a laparoscopic APR with TILT procedure. During the procedure, a controlled incision of levators into the ischiorectal fat was performed transabdominally under direct vision; the meeting plane is therefore lowered and the perineal dissection is simplified without changing body position. This technique offers individualized transection of levator muscles, minimizes the risk of wound complications and prevents surgical waist to ensure oncological safety. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the short-term and long-term benefits of this modified procedure.
