A Study of the Value of Hybrid PET/MR and PET/CT in Prostate Cancer
According to the latest data from the China National Cancer Center, prostate cancer has become the most common tumor in the urinary system since 2008. However, conventional imaging techniques including transrectal ultrasound , computed tomography and bone scintigraphy are not sensitive or specific. About 40% of resectable lesions cannot be detected by these techniques. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) provides a valuable tool for the diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer. Recently, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) as a new novel positron tracer has shown to be effective to detect primary lesions, recurrent and metastatic lesions of prostate cancer. In this prospective study, the investigators will use the most advanced imaging equipments, integrated PET/MR, and PET/CT with prostate cancer-specific imaging agent 68Ga-PSMA and conventional imaging agent \[F-18\]fluorodeoxyglucose to image patients with or suspected of prostate cancer, the aim is to explore the value of hybrid PET/MR and PET/CT in prostate cancer.

DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 68Ga-PSMA-11 and/or 18F-FDG PET/MR, PET/CT
Sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga- PSMA, 18F-FDG PET/MR, PET/CT for initial diagnosis and staging, For patient without any treatment, Initial diagnosis and staging results of 68Ga- PSMA, 18F-FDG PET/MR, PET/CT will be compared to pathology, clinical and follow-up result. Evaluation of the concordance between 68Ga-PSMA PET/MR and PET/CT, the differences between 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDG., up to 2 years
Sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga- PSMA, 18F-FDG PET/MR, PET/CT for recurrence detection, For patient with a history of prostate cancer, results of 68Ga- PSMA, 18F-FDG PET/MR, PET/CT will be compared to pathology, clinical and follow-up result. Evaluation of the concordance between 68Ga-PSMA PET/MR and PET/CT, the differences between 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDG., up to 2 years|Sensitivity of 68Ga-PSMA PET/MR, PET/CT for different PSA levels, different lesion sites, For patient with a history of prostate cancer and suspected of recurrence, evaluate Sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga- PSMA, 18F-FDG PET/MR, PET/CT for different PSA levels, different lesion sites, up to 2 years

For patients suspected of or diagnosed with prostate cancer, the investigators aim to evaluate the roles of integrated PET/MR and PET/CT in differential diagnosis, detecting primary and metastatic lesions, guilding biopsy, staging and determining treatment plan prior to treatment; for the patients with a history of prostate cancer, the aim is to evaluate the value of integrated PET/MR and PET/CT for treatment response assessment, detection of recurrences and metastatic lesions.
