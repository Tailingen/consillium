A Study Comparing Maintenance Subcutaneous Rituximab With Observation Only in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Indolent Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Who Had Responded to Rituximab-based Immunochemotherapy Induction and 2-year Maintenance With Subcutaneous Rituximab
This multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered rituximab in comparison with observation only as maintenance therapy in participants with relapsed or refractory indolent Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). All participants will receive induction therapy with rituximab (375 milligrams per square meter \[mg/m\^2\] intravenously \[IV\] in Cycle 1, then 1400 mg subcutaneous \[SC\] every 3-4 weeks) plus standard chemotherapy for 6-8 months; followed by 24 months of maintenance I period with rituximab (1400 mg SC every 8 weeks). Participants completing therapy and showing partial or complete response will be randomized to receive either rituximab (1400 mg SC every 8 weeks) or observation with no treatment during maintenance II period and will be followed for at least 15 months. Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or end of study, whichever occurs first.
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
DRUG: Chemotherapy (Induction Period)|DRUG: Rituximab
Maintenance II: Progression-free Survival (PFS) Using 1999 International Working Group (Cheson) Response Criteria for Lymphoma or by the Recommendations for Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, Progression free survival from randomization (PFSrand) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. One participant died in Induction before randomization and one participant died in Maintenance II Observation arm due to an SAE and were not considered in the analysis as no death page was completed. The Observation arm did not include one participant with AE outcome of death reported retrospectively 2 months after discontinuation from study (censored as having no event on Day 456 post-randomization)., From randomization (Maintenance II) up to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 24 months)
Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), Serious AEs, and Infusion/Administration-related Reactions (IRRs/ARRs), An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. Not all AEs were followed up for the randomized Observation arm. Only Serious AEs and AE grade 3-5 (obtained retrospectively) were collected for this arm. Therefore arms are not comparable overall., From day of first rituximab induction dose up to day of disease progression, or discontinuation of treatment for any reason (up to approximately 87 months)|Event-free Survival (Time to Treatment Failure) Using 1999 International Working Group (Cheson) Response Criteria for Lymphoma or by the Recommendations for Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, Event-Free Survival was measured from the day of first rituximab Induction dose through Maintenance I and Maintenance II rituximab arm until the date of any treatment failure, including disease progression, or discontinuation of treatment for any reason (e.g. disease progression, toxicity, patient preference, initiation of new anti-lymphoma treatment, or death). Treatment discontinuation was considered as an event and was not applicable to the randomized observation arm., From day of first rituximab induction dose up to day of any treatment failure, including disease progression, or discontinuation of treatment for any reason (up to approximately 87 months)|Time to Next Lymphoma Treatment (TNLT), Time to next lymphoma treatment (TNLT) is defined as the time from date of first rituximab induction dose to the date date of first documented intake of any new antilymphoma treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, etc.)., From day of first rituximab induction dose up to any new lymphoma treatment (up to approximately 87 months)|Overall Survival, Overall survival from first induction treatment (OSRegist) is defined as the time from date of first rituximab induction dose to the date of death, irrespective of cause. One participant died in Induction before randomization and one participant died in Maintenance II Observation arm due to an SAE and were not considered in the analysis as no death page was completed., From day of first rituximab induction dose up to death (up to approximately 87 months)|Maintenance II: Overall Survival, Overall survival from randomization (OSrand) is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of death, irrespective of cause., From randomization (Maintenance II) up to death (up to approximately 24 months)|Percentage of Participants With Partial or Complete Tumor Response (PR/CR) Assessment at End of Induction Using 1999 International Working Group Response Criteria for Lymphoma or by the Recommendations for Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of responders at the end of the Induction period. A responder is defined as a participant experiencing either CR or PR tumor response according to the Cheson response criteria for indolent lymphoma or the recommendations for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia., From day of first rituximab induction dose up to end of induction period (up to approximately 8 months)|Maintenance I: Percentage of Participants With Conversion of PR to CR Using 1999 International Working Group (Cheson) Response Criteria for Lymphoma or by the Recommendations for Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, From day of first rituximab induction dose up to end of Maintenance I period (up to approximately 32 months)|Progression-free Survival (PFS) Using 1999 International Working Group (Cheson) Response Criteria for Lymphoma or by the Recommendations for Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia, Progression free survival from first induction treatment (PFSregist) is defined as the time from date of first rituximab induction dose to the date of first documented disease progression or death by any cause, whichever occurs first., From day of first rituximab induction dose up to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first (up to approximately 87 months)
