JS001sc or JS001 Plus Chemotherapy is Indicated for Relapsed or Metastatic First-Line Non-Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer（NSCLC）
This is a multicenter, open-Lable, randomized, phase III clinical study to compare the pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy, and safety of Toripalimab injection (subcutaneous) (JS001sc) and Toripalimab injection (JS001) in combination with standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic Non-Squamous Non small cell lung cancer
Recurrent Metastatic Non-Squamous Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: JS001sc (360mg Subcutaneous injection) and pemetrexed/platinum-containing chemotherapy|DRUG: JS001 (240mg intravenous infusion) and pemetrexed/platinum-containing chemotherapy
Observed serum Ctrough at Cycle 1, Measured valley concentration at the end of cycle 1 (Ctrough), the end of Cycle 1 (Each cycle is 21 days)|Model-predicted area under the concentration-time curve(AUC) from 0 to 21 days at Cycle 1, The area under the drug time curve of cycle 1 simulated by a population pharmacokinetic model, the end of Cycle 1 (Each cycle is 21 days)
Objective response rate (ORR), Comparison of Objective response rate (ORR) between JS001sc and JS001 in first-line patients with relapsed or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, up to 2years|Progression-free survival (PFS), Comparison of first-line Progression-free survival (PFS) between JS001sc and JS001 in patients treated with relapsed or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, up to 2years|6-month progression-free survival(PFS) rate, The 6-month progression-free survival(PFS) rate in first-line patients treated with relapsed or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC was compared between JS001sc and JS001, up to 6-month|Disease control rate (DCR), Comparison of first-line Disease control rate (DCR) between JS001sc and JS001 in patients with relapsed or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, up to 2years|Duration of response (DoR), Comparison of first-line Duration of response (DoR) between JS001sc and JS001 in patients treated with relapsed or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, up to 2years|Safety: adverse events (AEs), The safety of JS001sc and JS001 as first-line treatment in subjects with relapsed or metastatic non-squamous-scale NSCLC was compared by adverse event rate (percentage of participants with treaty-related adverse events assessed by CTCAEv5.0) and abnormal laboratory parameters., up to 2years
A randomized, open-label,multicenter, phase III clinical study was designed to enroll 356 participants with recurrent or metastatic Non-Squamous Non small cell lung cancer without EGFR sensitive mutations or ALK fusion. They will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups:Group A: JS001sc+ platinum-based chemotherapy；JS001sc, 360 mg, was administered subcutaneously (SC) once every 3 weeks (Q3W)；Chemotherapy: pemetrexed + carboplatin/cisplatin, Q3W, up to 4 cycles, non-progressive subjects pemetrexed monotherapy maintenance therapy. Group B: JS001+ platinum-based chemotherapy；JS001, 240 mg, IV, Q3W；Chemotherapy: pemetrexed + carboplatin/cisplatin, Q3W, up to 4 cycles, non-progressive subjects pemetrexed monotherapy maintenance therapy. Both groups were treated until treatment termination criteria were met.
