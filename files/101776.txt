A Trial Comparing the Efficacy and Tolerability of Faslodex With Nolvadex in Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Faslodex (fulvestrant) to Nolvadex (tamoxifen) as first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Patients will be treated until disease progression or until the investigator has determined that treatment is not in the best interest of the patient, whichever occurs first.

Time to disease progression (TTP), It is considered that these results indicate that adequate data were available for obtaining clinically meaningful information for the primary efficacy endpoint of time to disease progression, At the time of data cut-off for this trial, the median overall duration of follow-up was 441 days, with a total of 434 (73.9%) randomised patients, including 47 patients from Japanese centres having progressed.
Objective response rate (ORR), It is considered that these results indicate that adequate data were available for obtaining clinically meaningful information for the primary efficacy endpoint of time to disease progression, At the time of data cut-off for this trial, the median overall duration of follow-up was 441 days, with a total of 434 (73.9%) randomised patients, including 47 patients from Japanese centres having progressed.|Duration of response (DoR), At the time of data cut-off for this trial, the median overall duration of follow-up was 441 days, with a total of 434 (73.9%) randomised patients, including 47 patients from Japanese centres having progressed.|Time to treatment failure (TTF), At the time of data cut-off for this trial, the median overall duration of follow-up was 441 days, with a total of 434 (73.9%) randomised patients, including 47 patients from Japanese centres having progressed.|Overall survival (OS), At the time of data cut-off for this trial, the median overall duration of follow-up was 441 days, with a total of 434 (73.9%) randomised patients, including 47 patients from Japanese centres having progressed.|Quality of Life (QOL) and Tolerability., At the time of data cut-off for this trial, the median overall duration of follow-up was 441 days, with a total of 434 (73.9%) randomised patients, including 47 patients from Japanese centres having progressed.
