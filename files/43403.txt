DARA RVD For High Risk SMM
The purpose of this research study is to learn whether the combination of daratumumab SC ( Darzalex Faspro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (Velcade) and dexamethasone works in treating smoldering multiple myeloma and preventing progression to active or symptomatic multiple myeloma.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Daratumumab (also called Darzalex Faspro)
* Bortezomib (also called Velcade)
* Lenalidomide (also called Revlimid)
* Dexamethasone
High-risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma|Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Daratumumab|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Lenalidomide|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Proportion of high risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) patients who are MRD negative (MRD-), MRD negative disease (MRD-) is defined as zero residual sequence cells detected at a level of one million cells. At time of final analysis, the 2-year MRD- rate will be summarized as a proportion with a 90% exact binomial confidence interval, 2 years
Objective Response Rate, (partial response or better according to the modified IMWG criteria) and the proportion of patients with a MRD, CR, PR or MR will be reported by Arm with 90% exact binominal confidence interval (CI)., 2 Years|Duration of Response, time from objective response to disease progression or death, or date last known progression-free and alive for those who have not progressed or died). The Kaplan-Meier method will be used., 2 Years|Progression-free survival, (time from protocol therapy initiation to the disease progression or death from any cause, censored at date last known progression free for those who have not progressed or died). The Kaplan-Meier method will be used., 2 Years|Number of Participants with Treatment Related Adverse Events as Assessed by CTCAE v4.0, For toxicity reporting, all adverse events and laboratory abnormalities will be graded and analyzed using CTCAE version 4, 2 Years
The purpose of this research study is to learn whether the combination of daratumumab (Darzalex Faspro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (Velcade) and dexamethasone works in treating smoldering multiple myeloma and preventing progression to active or symptomatic multiple myeloma.

This combination of drugs are considered "investigational" which means it has not been approved in this combination for smoldering myeloma by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations and follow up visits

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Daratumumab (also called Darzalex Faspro)
* Bortezomib (also called Velcade)
* Lenalidomide (also called Revlimid)
* Dexamethasone

Participants may be treated for up to 24 months and will be followed for up to 3 years.

It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.

This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the effectiveness of an investigational drug(s). The investigational drugs used in this research study are daratumumab (Darzalex Faspro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (Velcade) and dexamethasone. "Investigational" means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of daratumumab (Darzalex Faspro), lenalidomide (Revlimid), bortezomib (Velcade) and dexamethasone as a treatment regimen for the specific disease.
