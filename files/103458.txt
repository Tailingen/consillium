Solid Tumors
DRUG: MK2206 every other day|DRUG: MK2206 once weekly
Characterize safety and tolerability of MK2206 by monitoring incidence of protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Day 1 - Day 28 (Cycle 1)
Assess pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of MK2206 by determining parameters: AUC, Cmax, and Tmax, Day 1 - Day 28 (Cycle 1)
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and anti-tumor activity of MK2206 when administered with Every Other Day (QOD) and Once Weekly (QW) dosing schedules.
