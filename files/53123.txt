Oscillatory Activity in Basal Ganglia Circuits During Normal and Pathological Movement
The expression of hypokinetic and hyperkinetic motor symptoms is accompanied by pathological synchronous oscillations of neuronal activity in this cortico-subcortical network with a wide frequency range.

The purpose of this research is to study cortico-subcortical oscillations and their synchronization in two pathologies emblematic of hypokinetic (Parkinson's disease) and hyperkinetic (epilepsies) phenomena using a simple motor task and comparing different situations.

PROCEDURE: High Resolution Electroencephalogram (EEG-HR)|PROCEDURE: Stereo-electro-encephalography (SEEG)

In order to define the link between the characteristics of the oscillations (frequency, amplitude, phase relation) within this cortico-subcortical network and movement (normal or pathological) in humans, a simple motor task of gripping/pulling a lever has been designed.

The local field potentials (LFPs) will be collected during the same motor task in :

i) patients with Parkinson's disease, using a high-resolution electroencephalogram (EEG) and the PERCEPT(TM) system (Medtronic) equipped with a "sensing" function for deep LFP recordings and in EEG-HR (for high resolution) for cortical recordings

ii) patients with focal drug-resistant epilepsy, during a pre-surgical assessment by stereo-electro-encephalography (SEEG). The SEEG allows the recording of both the cortex and the subcortical regions in a concomitant manner, and a direct correlation can be studied.
