A Study of Pemetrexed Maintenance With or Without ADXS11-001 Immunotherapy in Patients With Human Papillomavirus Positive (HPV+), NSCLC Following First-Line Induction Chemotherapy
* Open label
* Enrollment in the order of confirmation of eligibility and HPV+ tumor status
* Prospective stratification based on 3 factors, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status, performance status and first-line induction chemotherapy outcome;
* Randomization (2:1 ratio): (82 patients receiving the combination of pemetrexed plus ADXS11-001 vs. 42 patients receiving pemetrexed alone)
* Treatment Arm: Pemetrexed plus ADXS11-001 immunotherapy
* Control Arm: Pemetrexed only
* Positive control: pemetrexed chemotherapy
