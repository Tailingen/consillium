A Study to Evaluate Whether Participants With Melanoma Prefer Subcutaneous vs Intravenous Administration of Nivolumab and Nivolumab + Relatlimab Fixed-dose Combinations
The purpose of this study is to assess the patient's preference for nivolumab subcutaneous (SC) or nivolumab + relatlimab fixed-dose combination (FDC) SC and provide patient experience data by route of administration. This study will also generate safety data which will further characterize the safety profile of patients switching the route of administration from intravenous (IV) to SC.
