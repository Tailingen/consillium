Lenalidomide With or Without Dexamethasone in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Lenalidomide and dexamethasone may stop the growth of multiple myeloma by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lenalidomide works with or without dexamethasone in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm
DRUG: dexamethasone|DRUG: lenalidomide
Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate at 12 Months, PFS rate at 12 months is defined as the percentage of participants who are alive and progression-free at 12 months. Progression is exclusively defined as a patient with progressive disease while receiving treatment with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone. Progression was defined as any one or more of the following: An increase of 25% from lowest confirmed response in:

* Serum M-component (absolute increase \>= 0.5g/dl)
* Urine M-component (absolute increase \>= 200mg/24hour
* Difference between involved and uninvolved Free Light Chain levels (absolute increase \>= 10mg/dl
* Bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute increase of \>=10%), 12 months from registration
Confirmed Response Rate, Confirmed response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a response that was confirmed on 2 consecutive evaluations during treatment

* Complete Response(CR): Complete disappearance of M-protein from serum \& urine on immunofixation, normalization of Free Light Chain (FLC) ratio \& \<5% plasma cells in bone marrow (BM)
* Very Good Partial Response(VGPR): \>=90% reduction in serum M-component; Urine M-Component \<100 mg per 24 hours; \<=5% plasma cells in BM
* Partial Response PR): \>= 50% reduction in serum M-Component and/or Urine M-Component \>= 90% reduction or \<200 mg per 24 hours; or \>= 50% decrease in difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels, Up to 18 cycles from registration|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from registration to death of any cause. Participants were followed for a maximum of 3 years from randomization. The median OS with 95% CI was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method, Time from registration to death (up to 3 years)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from registration to progression or death due to any cause. The median PFS with 95%CI was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method.

Progression was defined as any one or more of the following:An increase of 25% from lowest confirmed response in:

* Serum M-component (absolute increase \>= 0.5g/dl)
* Urine M-component (absolute increase \>= 200mg/24hour
* Difference between involved and uninvolved Free Light Chain levels (absolute increase \>= 10mg/dl
* Bone marrow plasma cell percentage (absolute increase of \>=10%), Time from registration to progression or death (up to 3 years)|Number of Participants Who Experienced at Least One Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Event at Least Possibly Related to Treatment (Toxicity), The number of participants who experienced toxicity (defined as at least one grade 3 or higher adverse event at least possibly related to treatment) is reported below., Duration on treatment (up to 18 cycles from registration)
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To assess the progression-free survival at 1 year in patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide alone or in combination with dexamethasone added for disease progression or lack or partial response.

Secondary

* To assess the response rate of this regimen in these patients.
* To assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

Tertiary

* To examine the effect of lenalidomide alone on tumor specific immunity and global parameters of immune function.
* To examine the effect of dexamethasone addition in patients requiring steroids.
* To correlate changes in parameters of immune response and measures of disease response.
* To examine the antiangiogenic activity of lenalidomide alone and in combination with dexamethasone.
* To examine the effect of lenalidomide alone on tumor cell survival and proliferation.

OUTLINE: Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of second disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning in course 4, patients experiencing stable or progressive disease also receive concurrent oral dexamethasone once daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and for all subsequent courses.

Blood and bone marrow samples are collected periodically for pharmacological and correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for parameters of immune activation, cell proliferation and apoptosis, and circulating tumor cells and endothelial cells via flow cytometry; global impact of therapy on immune cell subsets via immunophenotype analysis; and angiogenesis via CD34 staining.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.
