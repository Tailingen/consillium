Safety, Efficacy, and Tolerability of BOS172738 in Patients With Advanced Rearranged During Transfection (RET) Gene-Altered Tumors
This study will be conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of BOS172738 when administered to patients with advanced solid tumors with rearranged during transfection (RET) gene alterations and also to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BOS172738.
