A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Evidence of Antitumor Activity of FHND5071 as a Single Agent in Adult Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label dose-escalation study to determine the MTD and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and assess the DLT of FHND5071. The safety, tolerability, and PK of FHND5071 will be assessed in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.

The total number of evaluable subjects in the study will depend upon the number of dose-escalations necessary. It is estimated that approximately 24 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the dose-escalation part of this study. This multicenter study will be conducted in the United States.

Dose-escalation of FHND5071 will follow two sequential parts:

1. a modified accelerated titration design in single subject cohorts with a starting dose level of 40 mg, where the FHND5071 dose would be doubled in each dose cohort until the subject in a current cohort experience a Grade ≥2 adverse event that is at least possibly related to FHND5071 in the opinion of the Investigator and the Medical Monitor;
2. a modified 3+3 escalation design in cohort of 3-6 subjects, where the FHND5071 dose would be escalated in ≤100% increments determined by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) until 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 subjects experience a DLT. In both parts of dose escalation, FHND5071 will be administered orally once daily (QD) in 28-day treatment cycles.

Escalation cohorts may explore alternative doses or different schedules, if deemed appropriate by the Safety Review Committee.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: FHND5071
Number of Participants Reporting One or More Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, An Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant., Baseline to 28 days after first dose of FHND5071 administration
