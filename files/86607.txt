Ublituximab + TGR-1202 Compared to Obinutuzumab + Chlorambucil in Participants With Untreated and Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
This study evaluates the combination of ublituximab, a novel monoclonal antibody, and TGR-1202, a novel PI3K delta inhibitor compared to obinutuzumab and chlorambucil, and compared to ublituximab or TGR-1202 alone in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) participants.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: Obinutuzumab|BIOLOGICAL: Ublituximab|DRUG: TGR-1202|DRUG: Chlorambucil
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) Criteria, PFS was defined as the interval from enrollment to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression (PD) or death from any cause. PD was appearance of new nodes \>1.5 centimetres (cm) in the longest diameter (LD) and \>1.0 in longest perpendicular diameter (LPD), new or recurrent hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, new or reappearance of an unequivocal extra-nodal lesion, ≥50% increase from the nadir in the sum of products of diameters (SPD) of target lesions, ≥50% increase in the LD of an individual node or extra-nodal mass, splenic/hepatic enlargement of ≥50% from nadir, unequivocal increase in the size of non-target disease, transformation to a more aggressive histology, decrease in platelet count or Hgb, \>50% decrease from the highest on-study platelet count, \>20 grams per Liter (g/L) decrease from the highest on-study hemoglobin (Hgb)., From enrolment to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression (PD) or death (Up to 87 months)
Overall Response Rate (ORR) Per iwCLL Criteria, ORR=percent of participants who achieve complete response (CR), complete response with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi), partial response (PR) or nodular partial response (nPR).CR: No evidence of new disease; Absolute lymphocyte count(ALC)\<4x10\^9/liter(L);Regression of all target nodal masses to ≤1.5cm in LD;Normal spleen,liver size;Regression to normal of all nodal non-target disease and disappearance of all detectable;Non-nodal,non-target disease;Morphologically negative bone marrow;No lymphoid nodules;ANC \>1.5x10\^9/L,platelets≥100x10\^9/L,Hgb≥110 g/L.PR:No evidence of new disease; Response in 2 of following if abnormal at baseline: ALC\<4x10\^9/L or ≥50% decrease from baseline in sum of products of target nodal lesions;splenomegaly; hepatomegaly;≥50% decrease from baseline in CLL marrow infiltrate/B-lymphoid nodules;response in any 1: ANC\>1.5x10\^9/L, platelets\>100x10\^9/L,Hgb\>110g/L or ≥50% increase over baseline in any of these.CRi:for CR except with ANC\<1000/µL and/or platelets\<100., Up to 87 months|Complete Response (CR) Rate, The CR rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or complete response with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi). CR: No evidence of new disease; Absolute lymphocyte count(ALC)\<4x10\^9/L; Regression of all target nodal masses to ≤1.5 cm in LD; Normal spleen,liver size; Regression to normal of all nodal non-target disease and disappearance of all detectable; Non-nodal, non-target disease; Morphologically negative bone marrow; No lymphoid nodules; ANC\>1.5x10\^9/L,platelets≥100x10\^9/L,hemoglobin (Hgb)≥110 g/L. CRi was as for CR except with ANC \<1000/µL and/or platelets \<100,000/µL., Up to 87 months|Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Negativity Rate, MRD negativity rate is defined as the percentage of participants who are MRD negative. If a participant was determined to be MRD negative by peripheral blood, a bone marrow aspirate was obtained to assess MRD in the bone marrow., From Cycle 6 until Cycle 15 (cycle length=28 days) up to approximately 81.5 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the interval from the first documentation of CR, CRi, PR, or nPR to the earlier of the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause., From first documentation of response to study treatment till disease progression/death (up to approximately 87 months)|Number of Participants Experiencing at Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. TEAE is any AE that occur after first dosing of study medication and through the end of the study or through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, or is considered treatment-related regardless of the start date of the event, or is present before first dosing of study medication but worsens in intensity or the investigator subsequently considers treatment-related., From first dose of study treatment up to end of study (up to approximately 87 months)
