NP-G2-044 as Monotherapy and Combination Therapy in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumor Malignancies
Multicenter, open-label study in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamics of continuously dosed NP-G2-044 monotherapy and NP-G2-044 in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy.
