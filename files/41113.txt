IDP-023 g-NK Cells Plus Ocrelizumab in Patients With Progressive Multiple Sclerosis
This is an open label, Phase 1b, multiple ascending dose, and dose-expansion study of IDP-023 administered in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and ocrelizumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and biologic activity on autoreactive immune cells in patients with refractory progressive multiple sclerosis.

IDP-023 is an off-the-shelf product made from allogeneic g-natural killer (NK) cells, which are a natural subset of NK cells that develop over the course of an immune response in people who have been exposed to the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). These cells may be particularly effective at targeting and killing the cells that cause the immune system to attack the nervous system in multiple sclerosis (MS). By killing these harmful cells, g-NK cells may help to slow down or potentially stop the progression of MS. When combined with other approved treatments like ocrelizumab, g-NK cells might offer even greater beneﬁt for people with MS.

This is an open label, Phase 1b, multiple ascending dose, and dose-expansion study of IDP- 023 administered in combination with IL-2 and ocrelizumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and biologic activity on autoreactive immune cells in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) or non-active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS).

The study is divided into Part 1, a dose escalation phase, and Part 2, an expansion phase.

Part 1 (Escalation Period): The primary objectives of Part 1 are to deﬁne the safety of different dose levels of IDP-023 in combination with IL-2 and ocrelizumab and to deﬁne the recommended cell dose that will be used for Part 2 (recommended Part 2 dose; RP2D).

Part 2 (Expansion Period): The objective of the Part 2 expansion phase is to assess the biologic activity of IDP-023 in combination with IL-2 and ocrelizumab on autoreactive immune cells in PPMS.
