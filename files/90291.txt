Study of Continuous OSI-906 Dosing
Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation study to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) on both Once Daily (QD) and Twice Daily (BID) schedules.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: OSI-906
Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for both the once daily (QD) and twice daily (BID) dosing schedules and establish a recommended phase 2 dose of oral OSI-906, 21 days
Safety profile; Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile; Pharmacodynamic relationships and preliminary antitumor activity, 2.5 years
Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation.

The study will open with the QD schedule, with initiation of the BID schedule occurring after observation of clinically significant related toxicity â‰¥ grade 2 in the QD schedule.

Dosing will be initiated on Day 1 with daily dosing (either QD or BID) continuing for 21 days.

Once the recommended phase 2 dose has been determined for the BID schedule, 2 expansion cohorts will be opened: 1) Biomarker Expansion Cohort in patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer and 2) Diabetic Expansion Cohort in patients with advanced solid tumors who have active Type 2 diabetes mellitus not requiring insulin or insulinotropic therapy.
