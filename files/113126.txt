R-MINE+X in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
Based on the modified R-MINE of mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome, the corresponding targeted drug (X) was added according to the genotyping detected by second-generation gene sequencing (NGS) to explore the effectiveness and safety of R-MINE+X in the treatment of recurrent/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Mitoxantrone hydrochloride liposome|DRUG: Isophosphamide|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: X: Orelabrutinib|DRUG: X: Chidamide|DRUG: X: Penpulimab|DRUG: X: Lenalidomide
Objective Response Rate(ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) after 4 cycles of R-MINE+X chemotherapy, up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy(each cycle is 21 days)
Complete remission rate(CRR), Complete remission rate(CRR) after 4 cycles of R-MINE+X chemotherapy, up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy(each cycle is 21 days)|Duration of remission(DOR), Time from reaching CR or PR for the first time to disease progression, up to 4 cycles of chemotherapy(each cycle is 21 days)|Progression-Free-Survival rate, from date of inclusion to date of progression, relapse, or death from any cause, 1 year|Overall survival rate, from the date of inclusion to date of death, irrespective of cause, 1 year|Adverse events (AE), The safety of the drug was evaluated by NCI-CTC AE 5.0 standard, From the first day of medication to 28 days after the last dose
Compared with traditional mitoxantrone, mitoxantrone liposomes can significantly prolong the survival time of patients and reduce the cardiotoxicity and non-hematological toxicity of anthracycline drugs. At present, there are no studies on the efficacy and safety of R-MINE+X regimen based on molecular typing in the treatment of R/R DLBCL. Therefore, based on NGS, R/R DLBCL was divided into different molecular types (MCD subtype, BN2 subtype, EZB subtype, A53 subtype and other subtype), and on this basis, different molecular types of targeted drugs (X: MCD/BN2 subtype - BTK inhibitor, EZB subtype - Chidamide, A53 subtype - PD-1 monoclonal antibody and other type - lenalidomide) were used to treat R/R DLBCL. The main purpose was to observe the effectiveness and safety of the program in R/R DLBCL.
