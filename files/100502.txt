Prospective Hyperthermia Database in Cancer Patients (HT Register)
This monocentric study registry records all cancer patients at the Charit√© which are treated with hyperthermia to examine the therapeutic use of hyperthermia in cancer patients in the general application and to obtain an accurate risk-benefit balance

After confinement in this database are the patients prospectively in order to complications, disease status and survival status tracked.

Furthermore there is the possibility in the course of this study to an optional take part in translational accompanying research with the aim of prognostic factors for response to hyperthermia treatment.
