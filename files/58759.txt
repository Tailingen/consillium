Safety and Efficacy of Fourth-Generation CAR-T in the Treatment of Hematologic Malignancies
This is a single center, open-label, dose-escalation/expansion clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Fourth-Generation CAR-T, and determine the recommended dose of the CAR T-cells for patients with Multiple Myeloma，B-cell lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies.
Multiple Myeloma|B-cell Lymphoma|Hematological Malignancy
BIOLOGICAL: CAR-T
Number of patients with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), For DLT evaluation, severity (grade) is classified according to common terminology criteria for adverse events version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03)., Within 30 days of receiving CAR T-cells transfusion therapy|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), At least 6 subjects in the MTD dose group must complete the DLT assessment., Within 30 days of receiving CAR T-cells transfusion therapy|Adverse Event, Safety will be assessed by adverse events (AEs), which include clinically significant abnormalities identified during medical tests (e.g. laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, imaging examinations or physical examinations). AEs will be coded by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MeDRA) and their severity will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 4.03)., Minimum 2 years after CAR T-cells infusion (Day 1)|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), To determine after all subjects in the Phase 1 dose-escalation study completed DLT observation, Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Objective response rate (ORR), The definition of ORR is the proportion of subjects achieving sCR, CR, VGPR, or PR confirmed by efficacy reassessment after a minimum interval of three months. ORR is calculated as (sCR+CR+VGPR+PR) divided by the total number of cases of Multiple Myeloma, or (CR+PR) divided by the total number of cases of B-cell lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies, multiplied by 100%., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
Stringent complete response rate (sCRR), The definition of sCRR is the proportion of subjects achieving sCR confirmed by efficacy re-assessment after a minimum interval of three months. Efficacy assessment for multiple myeloma only., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Progression-free Survival (PFS), The time interval from the first administration of the investigational drug to the first observation of disease progression is calculated, considering the date of entry for patients who died for reasons other than disease progression before progression occurred., Through study completion, an average of 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is the time from the start of cell infusion to the death of the subject., Through study completion, an average of 2 years
This is a single center, open-label, dose-escalation/expansion clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Fourth-Generation CAR-T in the Treatment of Multiple Myeloma，B-cell lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies.. -Prior to Fourth-Generation CAR-T cells infusion, subjects will receive lymphodepleting therapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. After infusion, the investigators will observe the characteristics of dose limited toxicity (DLT), and determine the maximum tolerable agent MTD and RP2D were confirmed. To provide basis for the dosage and treatment plan of cell products in follow-up clinical trials. Meanwhile, subjects will be followed for side effects and effect of the CAR-T.
