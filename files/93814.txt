Clinical Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of TQB2440 Injection/Perjeta® Combined With Trastuzumab and Docetaxel in the Treatment of Patients With Early or Locally Advanced Breast Cancer.
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-controlled Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TQB2440 injection/Perjeta® combined with trastuzumab and docetaxel in patients with early or locally advanced ER/ PR-negative HER2-positive breast cancer. The trial is scheduled to enroll 412 participants. The sample size was estimated based on 20 treatment cycles and 6 recurrence visits.
