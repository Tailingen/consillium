Domatinostat in Combination With Avelumab in Patients With Advanced Merkel Cell Carcinoma Progressing on Anti-PD-(L)1
This phase II trial studies how well domatinostat (4SC-202) works in combination with avelumab in adult patients with advanced unresectable and/or metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma that have progressed on a previous therapy with an anti-PD-(L)1 antibody
