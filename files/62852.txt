Nivolumab Combined With Ipilimumab Followed by Nivolumab Monotherapy as First-Line Treatment for Patients With Advanced Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of combination treatment of Nivolumab with Ipilimumab followed by Nivolumab monotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced Melanoma.
Melanoma
DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab
Incidence of Participants With High-Grade (CTCAE v4.0 Grade 3-5) Treatment-Related Select Adverse Events, Incidence of participants with high-grade (CTCAE v4.0 grade 3-5) treatment-related, select adverse events of potentially immune-mediated etiology including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, renal, hepatic, endocrine, infusion-related, or hypersensitivity, From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 37 months)
Incidence of Participants With All High-Grade (Grades 3-5) Select Adverse Events, Incidence of participants with high-grade (grade 3-5) select adverse events including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, renal, hepatic, infusion-related, or hypersensitivity, From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 37 months)|Median Time to Onset (Grades 3-4) of Select Adverse Events, Median time to onset (grades 3-4) of select adverse events including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, renal, hepatic, endocrine, infusion-related, or hypersensitivity, From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 37 months)|Median Time to Resolution (Grades 3-4) of Select Adverse Events, Median time to resolution (Grades 3-4) of select adverse events including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, renal, hepatic, endocrine, infusion-related, or hypersensitivity, From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 37 months)|Time to Resolution of an Adverse Event (AE), Resolution of an adverse event (AE) is defined as a participant experiencing complete resolution or improvement to the baseline of any grade AE including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, renal, hepatic, endocrine, infusion-related, or hypersensitivity, From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 37 months)|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival is defined from the time of first dosing date to the date of death. A participant who has not died will be censored at the last known date alive, Up to approximately 37 months|Incidence of Participants With Adverse Events, The assessment of safety is measured by the incidence of participants who experienced any grade of adverse events (AEs), treatment-related AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and deaths, From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 37 months)|Incidence of Participants With Select Adverse Events, The assessment of safety is measured by the incidence of participants who experienced any grade of select adverse events including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, renal, hepatic, endocrine, infusion-related, or hypersensitivity, From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 37 months)|Incidence of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities - Liver, Safety assessment is measured by the incidence of participants who experienced a liver laboratory abnormality in Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Upper Limit of Normal (ULN), From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 37 months)|Incidence of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities - Thyroid, Safety assessment is measured by the incidence of participants who experienced a thyroid laboratory abnormality in Free T3 (FT3), Free T4 (FT4), Lower Limit of Normal (LLN), From first dose to 30 days after last dose (up to approximately 37 months)|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of all treated participants, Up to approximately 37 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression free survival per investigator assessment is defined as radiological evidence of progression, significant clinical symptomatic progression, or the need to introduce a non-study drug therapy., Up to approximately 37 months
