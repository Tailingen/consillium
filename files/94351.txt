CD8+ T Cell Imaging During Pre-surgery Immunotherapy in People With Melanoma
Combination treatment with nivolumab and ipilimumab before surgery may help people with melanoma because the drugs are designed to help the immune system target and destroy cancer cells (immunotherapy), which may shrink the cancer and prevent recurrence after surgery. Treatment given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study is to find out whether neoadjuvant therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab can kill melanoma tumors before surgery and prevent disease from coming back after surgery. This study also explores a new, experimental PET scan that images the immune system to see if it is related to treatment outcomes.
Melanoma|Melanoma Stage III
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: PET Scan|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Ipilimumab|PROCEDURE: Surgical Resection of Melanoma
Major pathologic responses/MPR, Participants' disease will be assessed for MPR as per previously established criteria for neoadjuvant trials (near complete response ≤10% viable; complete response 0% viable). Pathologic response (≤50% viable) will also be estimated., up to 2 years
