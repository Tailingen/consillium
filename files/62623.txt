A Study to Evaluate Glofitamab as Single Agent Administered After Pretreatment With Obinutuzumab in Chinese Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma
This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of glofitamab as a single agent following a fixed single dose of obinutuzumab in Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who have failed two or more lines of systemic therapy.
