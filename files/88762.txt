VEGFR/PDGFR Dual Kinase Inhibitor X-82 and Everolimus for Treating Patients With Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
This study is to evaluate the combination of an investigational drug X-82 with everolimus in the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
Adenocarcinoma|Pancreatic Neoplasms
DRUG: X-82|DRUG: Everolimus
Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities - Phase I, Tolerability of X-82 in combination with everolimus will be determined by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0), Completion of 1st cycle for all patients in Phase I portion of study (completed in approximately 20 months)|Overall Toxicities - Phase I, -Toxicities will be graded by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0), 30 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 13 months)|Recommended Phase II Dose of X-82, Completion of 1st cycle for all patients in Phase I portion of study (completed in approximately 20 months)|Objective Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response) - Phase II, Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.

Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 12 months)
Disease Stabilization Rate - Phase II, * Disease stabilization rate is defined as the proportion of patients achieving a best overall response of complete response, partial response, or stable disease.
* Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm.
* Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
* Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 12 months)|Progression Free Survival (PFS) - Phase II, * PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
* Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase., Up to 3 years|Overall Survival - Phase II, Start of the treatment until death., Up to 3 years|Number of Participants With Toxicity - Phase II, Toxicity will be graded by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4.0), Through 30 days after completion of treatment (estimated to be 13 months)
