Streamlining Radioembolization for Small HCC
In patients who has no sign suggesting high lung shunt fraction (TIPS, hepatic vein invasion, hepatic vein enhancement on arterial phase, dysmorphic intratumoral vessel, tumor size \< 5cm), radioembolization is performed without MAA scan with SIR-Spheres. This prospective registry will prove that the selection criteria is accurate and streamlining radioembolization is feasible and safe.
