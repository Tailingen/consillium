REPOSE is an international multicenter, open-label, single arm phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of repotrectinib in patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC with BM.

Upon meeting all selection criteria, a total of 20 participants confirmed ROS1 rearrangement will be enrolled. Participants who have received prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or other non-ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) are eligible.

Patients will continue study treatment until end of treatment (EoT) defined as the date of disease progression, death, or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason. After study treatment discontinuation, all participants will undergo a safety visit (at 28 ± 7 days after last treatment dose) in order to follow up toxicities and changes in concomitant medication. Patients discontinuing the study treatment at any time will enter a post-treatment follow-up period during which survival and subsequent anticancer therapy information will be collected every 3 months (± 7 days) from the safety visit until death, lost to follow-up, elective withdrawal from the study, or the end of study (EoS), whichever occurs first. Patients who discontinue treatment without evidence of disease progression will be also followed for tumor assessments until documented progression, elective withdrawal from the study, the start of new anti-cancer treatment, or the EoS.

EoS is estimated to occur approximately 13 months after the last patient included in the study initiates repotrectinib treatment, unless consent withdrawal, patient is lost to follow-up, death, or premature termination of the study. EoS is defined as the last data collection point at the last participant's safety visit and will occur after the study treatment termination of the last patient in the study.

The main objective of REPOSE study is to determine the efficacy of repotrectinib at any timepoint during the study period as determined locally by best central nervous system (CNS) response, that is in terms of intracranial objective response rate (IC-ORR).
