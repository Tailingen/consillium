Study of Gastroduodenal Metallic Stent vs Gastrojejunostomy
Selection of the optimal treatment for gastric outlet obstruction in patients with radically unresectable gastric cancer remains controversial because previous studies comparing the two procedures had a small sample size as well as they included various etiologies such as gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, duodenal cancer and pancreaticobiliary cancer in selecting the patient population. Therefore, to establish the standard of care for patients with radically unresectable gastric cancer with gastric outlet obstruction, a larger prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial using a single type of stent is warranted.
