Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the most malignant tumors. It is easy to metastasize at an early stage, has a high mortality rate, and its incidence is increasing year by year. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combined application of Anlotinib Hydrochloride Capsules and Toripalimab in the treatment of unresectable stage III and stage IV acral malignant melanoma confirmed by pathology.
