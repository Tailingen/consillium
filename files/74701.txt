Ipilimumab Induction in Patients With Melanoma Brain Metastases Receiving Stereotactic Radiosurgery
This is a study to test the efficacy of using standard immune therapy for melanoma prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (ipilimumab induction), as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery followed by immune therapy. The study's hypothesis is that ipilimumab induction is as good as or better than controlling brain metastases as compared to stereotactic radiosurgery followed by immune therapy.
Metastatic Melanoma|Brain Metastases
DRUG: Ipilimumab|PROCEDURE: Stereotactic Radiosurgery
Local Control Rate, The number of patients in each arm who are free from progression in the index (radiated) lesions in the brain at 6 months.

Immune related response criteria was used to assess response to treatment. Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD) in this trial is defined as an increase in tumor burden ≥25% relative to nadir (minimum recorded tumor burden), with confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 weeks from the date first documented., 6 months
Overall Survival Rate, Number of participants alive at 5 years after enrollment., Up to 5 years|Regional (Intracranial) Control Rate, The proportion of patients in each arm who are free from progression in the index (radiated) lesions and free from new brain metastases at 6 months., 6 months|Intracranial Response Rate, Response of treated (irradiated) brain metastases to combination therapy with ipilimumab and stereotactic radiosurgery using immune-related response criteria., Up to 12 months|Time to Progression, Time to progression in the brain due to treated metastases or new brain metastases. Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST) was used to assess response. Progression was defined as an increase in tumor burden ≥25% relative to nadir (minimum recorded tumor burden), with confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than 4 wk from the date first documented., From date of enrollment to up to 2 years
Imaging Correlates on Dynamic-contrast Enhanced MRI of the Brain, Exploratory endpoints: Interval changes in dynamic MRI parameters such as perfusion, blood volume, vascular permeability (Ktrans), and diffusion tensor imaging; the change in 3D tumor volume., 6 months|Immune Correlates, Exploratory endpoints: Interval changes in immune markers in the blood, 6 months
This is a randomized Phase II selection study investigating the use of ipilimumab induction prior to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), versus no induction, for melanoma brain metastases. Participants will be randomized to Arm A "Induction" (two doses of ipilimumab prior to SRS, two doses of ipilimumab after SRS) versus Arm B "No induction" (SRS first, followed by 4 doses of ipilimumab). Participants will undergo multiple dynamic contrast-enhanced MRIs of the brain and submit blood samples for immune testing.
