Neoadjuvant Cadonilimab Combined With Perioperative Oxaliplatin Plus S1 for Diffuse or Mixed Type of Locally Advanced Gastric/Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma
This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant cadonilimab in combination with perioperative SOX chemotherapy, compared to perioperative SOX chemotherapy alone, in patients with diffuse or mixed-type locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. The main questions it seeks to answer are:

1. Is neoadjuvant cadonilimab plus SOX chemotherapy superior to neoadjuvant placebo plus SOX chemotherapy in terms of the pathological complete response (pCR) rate at the time of surgery?
2. To evaluate and compare the 3-year OS rate in patients receiving neoadjuvant cadonilimab plus SOX chemotherapy versus patients receiving placebo plus neoadjuvant SOX chemotherapy regimen.

Participants will be divided into two groups:

1. Experimental group: Participants will receive intravenous cadonilimab (10 mg/kg) in combination with the SOX regimen (oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² and S-1, with the initial dose determined based on body surface area).
2. Control group: Participants will receive a placebo in combination with the SOX regimen.

After completing 3-4 cycles of treatment, patients in both the experimental and control groups will undergo radical surgery with D2 or D2+ lymphadenectomy. Following surgery, patients will receive 4 cycles of adjuvant SOX chemotherapy at 70% of the standard dosage, administered every 21 days, starting within 3-6 weeks post-surgery.

Pathological complete response (pCR) rate, The pCR is defined as no invasive disease within an entirely submitted and evaluated gross lesion, and histologically negative nodes as assessed by BIPR based on Becker regression criteria. pCR rate is defined as the proportion of participants having pCR., From enrollment to surgical treatment, it is expected to require 4 months.|3-year survival rate (3-year OS rate), 3-year OS rate is defined as the proportion of patients alive at 3 years after randomization estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Participants without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last known alive., 3 years
