This is an open-label, Phase 1/2, first-in-human (FIH), multiple ascending dose and dose-expansion study of TT-816 administered as monotherapy and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. Phase 1 will define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of TT-816 and of combination therapy that can be advanced to Phase 2. Phase 2 will define the preliminary efficacy of these regimens in the setting of advanced solid tumors with high unmet medical needs including Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Ovarian Cancer and Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC).
