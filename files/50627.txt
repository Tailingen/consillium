Prophylactic Antibiotic Use in Transarterial Chemoembolization for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study aims to determine the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic use for TACE and occurrence of postoperative liver abscess.

There would be two comparison groups. Current standard of care treatment at PKLI\&RC (as per local guidelines) would be given to all patients receiving TACE for the intervention group or 'antibiotic group' (i.e., Inj. Ceftriaxone 1g, intravenous × stat). While no antibiotic would be given to the 'no antibiotic group'.
Antibiotic Prophylaxis
DRUG: Ceftriaxone Sodium
Leukocytosis, Predominantly neutrophilic leukocytosis ( \> 11 ×109/L) with fever ( \> 38 °C) in upto 48 hours post-TACE, 2 days|Liver abscess, Occurrence of liver abscess as diagnosed by imaging within 30 days of the procedure, 30 days|Liver abscess and intervention, Liver abscess requiring an intervention (e.g., percutaneous transhepatic abscess drainage (PTAD), percutaneous transhepatic abscess puncture or liver abscess incision) within 30 days of TACE, 30 days
Liver cancer especially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the top five most common carcinomas in the world. According to the latest Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE) standards of practice guidelines (2021), routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended. However, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended in cases where there is a high risk of developing a liver abscess. These include biliary obstruction or the presence of a bilioenteric anastomosis. This study aims to determine the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic use for TACE and occurrence of postoperative liver abscess.
