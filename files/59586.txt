Mediastinal Lymph Node Dissection Versus Spared Mediastinal Lymph Node Dissection in Stage I GGN NSCLC
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. Lobectomy or sub-lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection is the standard surgery. About 50% lung nodules are pure ground-glass or part-solid nodules. Non-solid nodules rarely develop mediastinal lymph node metastasis. The present study is a prospective, multicenter and randomized clinical trial, comparing the overall survival and disease-free survival of whether performing mediastinal lymph node dissection in non-small cell lung cancer with ground-glass nodule CT features.
Lung Neoplasms|Lymph Node Excision
PROCEDURE: Systemic mediastinal lymph node dissection|PROCEDURE: Spared mediastinal lymph node dissection
Overall survival, Overall survival is defined as days from randomization to death from any cause, and it was censored at the last day when the patient was alive., 5 years
Relapse-free survival, RFS time is defined as days from randomization to relapse or death for any patient., 5 years|Proportion of local recurrence, Proportion of local recurrence in any kind of recurrences., 5 years|Duration of hospitalization, Duration of hospitalization around surgery., 1-60 days|Duration of chest drainage tube placement, Duration of chest drainage tube placement after surgery., 1-60 days|Operation time, Time duration of surgery., 20-180 minutes.|Blood loss, Blood loss during surgery., 1-60 days
The study is a non-inferior statistical comparison, with 681 patients in each group. The anticipated enroll period is 3 years, followed by observation period of 5 years.
