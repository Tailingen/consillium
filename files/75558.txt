A Dose Escalation Study of Iniparib as a Single Agent and in Combination in Solid Tumors
Primary Objective:

* To assess the safety and the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of iniparib as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapeutic regimens in patients with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy.

Secondary Objectives:

* To assess the antitumor effect of iniparib (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\]) Version 1.1 in patients with measurable disease.
* To characterize iniparib (and its metabolites, if possible) pharmacokinetics.

Based on data generated by Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.

The duration of the study for an individual patient will include a period to assess eligibility (screening period) of up to 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period of at least 1 cycle (3 weeks or 4 weeks depending on regimen) of study treatment, and an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the last administration of study drug. However, treatment may continue until precluded by toxicity, progression, or death.
