Padeliporfin VTP Treatment for Unresectable Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma
This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, open label light dose escalation phase I trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Padeliporfin vascular targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) applied via endovascular fiber placement within a dilatation catheter, through the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in patients with stage III, locally advanced (LA) unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The investigators will evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of Padeliporfin VTP administered endovascularly using light dose escalation.

COMBINATION_PRODUCT: Padeliporfin Vascular Targeted Photodynamic (VTP) therapy
Safety of endovascularly applied Padeliporfin VTP ablation, Safety of endovascularly applied Padeliporfin VTP ablation will be assessed using the CTCAE version 5.0. All adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) for being included in analyses., Day 30|Determination of the Maximum Tolerated Light Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 light dose (RP2D) in Part A, MTD is defined as the dose level associated with \<33% of DLT-evaluable patients experiencing a DLT. If the MTD is reached, the RP2D will be defined as MTD. If the MTD is not reached, the RP2D will be selected based on integrated evaluation of safety and clinical benefit for all dose levels tested., Day 30
Descriptive features of treatment response to ablation in tumor tissue based on pre- and post -VTP CT scans, Rate of resectability and downstaging (as per NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines V1, May 4, 2023), Day 2|Tumor Response by CT scans, Based on CT scan according to RECIST 1.1, Day 30|Tumor Response by CT scans, Based on CT scan according to RECIST 1.1, Day 60
Exploratory endpoints, Rate of resectability and downstaging will be evaluated by determining the percentage of patients who were initially deemed to have unresectable LA PDAC and following Padeliporfin VTP treatment, were subsequently deemed to have borderline resectable or resectable disease, 60 days
This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, open label light dose escalation phase I trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of Padeliporfin vascular targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) applied via endovascular fiber placement within a dilatation catheter, through the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in patients with stage III, locally advanced (LA) unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with SMA solid tumor encasement \>180Â°. The investigators will evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of Padeliporfin VTP administered endovascularly using light dose escalation.

Study Intervention: Patients enrolled in the study will undergo endovascular VTP, using Padeliporfin (WST-11) activated via endovascular fiber placement through the SMA, with intravenous administration of Padeliporfin at a fixed dose of 4 mg/kg of padeliporfin di-potassium, followed by total of 10 min illumination at 753 nm.

For light dose escalation (Part A), a 3+3 dose-escalation schema will be used. In a subsequent expansion phase (Part B), the optimal light dose as per light dose escalation, will be used in an additional cohort of patients to further evaluate preliminary efficacy.
