Meningioma and Embolism Thrombosis Risk & Investigation of Coagulation
Despite being generally benign tumors, meningiomas are associated with an increased risk for thrombembolic complications after surgical resection. The molecular mechanisms underlying this circumstance are still unknown.

In this prospective observational trial, the investigators aim to evaluate the changes in coagulation and platelet function caused by tumor resection.

Blood samples are obtained by patients undergoing meningioma resection before and immediately after resection to detect said changes.

As a control cohort, blood samples are obtained from patients undergoing resection for glioma.
