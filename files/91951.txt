Study of GNX102 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
GNX102 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb), an engineered biotechnology product, developed by GlycoNex that targets certain cancer cells by binding with high affinity to specific structures on cancer cells. Specifically, GNX102 binds to novel glycan structures caused by glycosylation changes in tumors.

Patients with epithelial origin cancers that have a likelihood of GNX102 targeted antigen expression based on previous studies, including colorectal, hepatocellular, non-small cell lung, gastric, breast, pancreatic, cutaneous, acral, or mucosal melanoma, esophageal, prostate, and epithelial uterine cancers, can be screened for enrollment in the study.
