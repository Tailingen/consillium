Metastatic Tumor Cell Trap Device in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer
M-Trap is an implantable medical device designed to capture disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). It is intended for use in advanced-stage ovarian cancer patients. The study objective is to assess the safety and the performance of the M-Trap device.
Ovarian Cancer Stage IIIC|Ovarian Cancer Stage IV
DEVICE: M-Trap
Safety: Number of Participants With Freedom From Device and Procedure-related Major Adverse Events, The primary objective is to demonstrate that the safety of M-Trap, as measured by freedom from device- and procedure-related major adverse events through 6-months post-implantation, is non-inferior to historical controls (Patankar 2015). Freedom from device and procedure-related major adverse events is defined as severe complications based on Clavian Class IV complications, through 6-months post-implantation, including shock, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, prolonged intubation, unplanned reintubation, or adverse events leading to removal of the device, including infection, seroma formation, mesh migration, bowel obstruction, adhesions, and local cancer progression through the abdominal wall at M-Trap suture sites., 6 months|Safety: Number of Participants With Freedom From Device and Procedure-related Major Adverse Events, An additional analysis was performed to assess safety of M-Trap in comparison to historical controls at a comparable 30 day timepoint, as measured by freedom from device- and procedure-related major adverse events through 30 days post-implantation. Freedom from device and procedure-related major adverse events is defined as severe complications based on Clavian Class IV complications, through 30-days post-implantation, including shock, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, prolonged intubation, unplanned reintubation, or adverse events leading to removal of the device, including infection, seroma formation, mesh migration, bowel obstruction, adhesions, and local cancer progression through the abdominal wall at M-Trap suture sites, adjusted based on the breakdown of the historical control population by number of extended procedures, 30 days|Performance: Number of Participants With Histological Evidence of Tumor Cell Capture, Histological evidence of tumor cell capture in at least one device in patients who underwent successful device removal, Time of device removal, an average of 13.3 months
Safety: Number of Participants With Device-related Long-term Adverse Event Reporting, Device-related long-term adverse events and serious adverse events reported through 18 months, 18 months|Safety: Number of Participants With Procedure-related Long-term Adverse Event Reporting, Procedure-related long-term adverse events and serious adverse events reported through 18 months, 18 months|Performance: Disease Focalization Score Categorized as I, I or II, I or II or III, and I or II or III or IV by Recurrence Status, Disease focalization score - Disease focalization scores of I, II, III, IV, or V were assigned by the evaluating clinician, representing the approximate percentage 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, or 0%, respectively, of recurrent tumor contained in the M-Trap device. Results are presented as described in secondary objective: patient count of score I; score I or II; score I, II or III; score I, II, III or IV; or No focalization., Time of recurrence, an average of 14.5 months
Number of Devices Implanted, Number of devices implanted at conclusion of debulking surgery., Immediately post-procedure|Disease Focalization Score by Recurrence Status, Disease focalization score - Disease focalization scores of I, II, III, IV, or V were assigned by the evaluating clinician, representing the approximate percentage 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, or 0%, respectively, of recurrent tumor contained in the M-Trap device, Time of recurrence, an average of 14.5 months|Number of Participants With Reasons for Device Removal, Reason that device removal was planned, regardless of whether or not it was completed., Time of device removal, an average of 13.3 months
