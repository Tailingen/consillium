A Study of DB-1310 in Advanced/Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a dose-escalation and dose-expansion Phase 1/2a trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DB-1310 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.

This is a multicenter, open-label, multiple-dose, FIH Phase 1/2a study. Phase 1 adopts the standard "3+3" design to identify: the MTD and/or RP2D of DB-1310 as monotherapy, the RCD_A of DB-1310 in combination with trastuzumab or approved trastuzumab biosimilar and the RCD_B of DB-1310 in combination with Osimertinib; Phase 2a is a dose expansion phase to confirm the safety, tolerability and explore efficacy in selected malignant solid tumors treated with DB-1310 as monotherapy or in combination with trastuzumab or approved trastuzumab biosimilar or in combination with Osimertinib.
