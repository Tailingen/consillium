Investigating Patient Characteristics of Intermediate Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients Treated With Nexavar and Their Distribution to Different Treatment Groups as Well as Determining Effectiveness and Safety
The study aims to investigate patient characteristics of intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with Nexavar and their distribution to different treatment groups as well as determining efficacy and safety parameters.
Carcinoma, Hepatocellular
DRUG: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)
Distribution of intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with Nexavar to different treatment groups will be evaluated by the relative frequency of patients in each treatment group., up to 54 months|Characteristics of patients with intermediate stage HCC (BCLC-B) treated with Nexavar will be determined by evaluating demographic data, medical history, previous treatment of HCC, specific concomitant conditions (amongst others)., up to 54 months
Overall Survival is measured as the time interval from start of Nexavar therapy to the date of death, due to any reason., up to 54 months|Time to progression is defined as the time interval from start of Nexavar therapy to the date of diagnosed progression., up to 54 months|Progression free survival is measured as the time interval from the start of Nexavar treatment to diagnosed (radiological or clinical) progression or death, whichever comes first., up to 54 months|Time to treatment failure is defined as the time interval from start of Nexavar therapy to the date of diagnosed progression or permanent discontinuation due to toxicity., up to 54 months|Duration of Nexavar treatment is measured as the time interval from start of Nexavar therapy to the date of permanent discontinuation of Nexavar therapy (regardless of the reason for discontinuation)., up to 54 months|Tumor status at different visits will be evaluated according to radiological or clinical evaluation. The best overall response will be analyzed providing absolute and relative frequencies of the tumor status categories., up to 54 months|Further possible prognostic factors will be evaluated., up to 54 months|Safety variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics based on adverse events collection., up to 54 months
