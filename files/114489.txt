Plasma-Adapted First-Line Pembro In NSCLC
This research study is studying to see if a blood test, collected at different times during the treatment of metastatic non-small lung cancer, can be used to detect early response in patients being treated with pembrolizumab and use that information to determine whether patients should continue treatment with pembrolizumab or switch treatment to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Pembrolizumab
* Platinum doublet chemotherapy, which may include the following:

  * Carboplatin and pemetrexed
  * Carboplatin and paclitaxel

The name of the blood test:

- InVision (Inivata, Ltd.)
NSCLC Stage IV|Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: PEMETREXED|DRUG: CARBOPLATIN|DRUG: PACLITAXEL|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: InVision
6-month Progression Free Survival rate, Kaplan-Meier method, 6 Months
Early Plasma Response, Early plasma response is defined as ≥50% reduction in plasma ctDNA max AF between Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 for patients with high shed \[≥0.5% max AF\] at Cycle 1 Day 1, or persistent low shed \[\<0.5% max AF\] for patients with low shed at Cycle 1 Day 1., 42 Days (each cycle is 21 days)|Progression Free Survival, Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate event-time distributions and medians for time-to-event data, he time from registration to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause or 30 Months|Overall Survival, Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate event-time distributions and medians for time-to-event data, time from registration to death from any cause, and patients who are thought to be alive at the time of final analysis will be censored at the last date of contact or 30 months|Feasibility-adherence to protocol therapy for 4 cycles, Feasibility is defined as a patient's adherence to protocol therapy for 4 cycles, 84 Days (each cycle is 21 days)
This is an open label, single institution, prospective pilot study.

The purpose of this research study is to determine if a blood test, collected at different times during treatment, can be used to detect early response in patients being treated with pembrolizumab for lung cancer and use that information to determine whether patients should continue treatment with pembrolizumab or switch treatment to pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy.

-The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including evaluations approximately every 3 weeks.

The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

* Pembrolizumab
* Platinum doublet chemotherapy, which may include the following:

  * Carboplatin and pemetrexed
  * Carboplatin and paclitaxel

The name of the blood test:

* InVision- Inivata

  * This blood test that will help study how participants respond to the study treatment. ---
  * Blood will be collected for this test at a few time points, both before and after participants receive treatment on study.
* Participants will be on the research study for up to 12 months.
* It is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.
