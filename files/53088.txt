A Phase 2 Study of Tarlatamab in Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
The main aim of this study is to:

* evaluate safety and efficacy (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 \[RECIST 1.1\] by investigator) of 2 dose levels of tarlatamab for Part 1 only
* evaluate anti-tumor activity of tarlatamab as determined by objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR) for Part 1 and 2
* evaluate safety of reduced mandatory monitoring period in Cycle 1 at selected dose of tarlatamab for Part 3
