Research on the Accurate Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Tumors and the Development of Kits
Bladder cancer is the second most prevalent urological malignancy worldwide, with a high incidence and poor patient prognosis. Achieving early diagnosis and intervention for bladder cancer is one of the most important ways to improve clinical management and patient prognosis. Tumor exosomes can be released into biological fluids at an early stage of a tumor, and many studies have shown that exosomal RNA can be used as a reliable biomarker to diagnose tumors in a non-invasive way. Based on the clinical needs for early diagnosis of bladder cancer, we aim to screen several early diagnostic markers with potential predictive value, establish an early diagnostic model for bladder cancer, and validate the validity and reliability of this diagnostic model through a large-scale clinical cohort to complement the diagnosis of early-stage cancers and to improve the rate of early diagnosis of cancer.

RT-qPCR, Urine exosomal RNA, Urine exosomes were enriched for RT-qPCR within 4 hours after the samples were collected.
In response to the clinical demand for accurate early diagnosis of bladder cancer, this project aims to gradually conduct in-depth research on precise early diagnosis of bladder cancer. This includes establishing key techniques for efficient and convenient enrichment of exosomes, identifying potential exosome biomarkers for bladder cancer based on bladder cancer transcriptome sequencing data, and conducting large-scale clinical cohort studies.
