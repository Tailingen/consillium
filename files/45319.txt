To Evaluate IAH0968 in Combination With CAPEOX in HER2-positive Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The Phase IIa of this clinical study, a dose-escalation study of IAH0968 in combination with CAPEOX, is designed for safety and tolerability in subjects with HER2-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Phase IIb/III is an operational seamless adaptive design consisting of two phases. Phase I (Phase IIb) was designed to initially evaluate the efficacy and safety of IAH0968+CAPEOX in HER2-positive subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer, using PFS.

The Phase IIa of this clinical study, a dose-escalation study of IAH0968 in combination with CAPEOX regimen, was designed to evaluate Safety and tolerability of IAH0968+CAPEOX regimen in subjects with HER2-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

Phase IIb/III uses an operational seamless adaptive design and consists of two phases. Phase I (Phase IIb) aims to initially evaluate the efficacy and safety of IAH0968+CAPEOX in HER2-positive subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer by PFS. Phase II (Phase III) was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IAH0968+CAPEOX versus placebo +CAPEOX in HER2-positive subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer using PFS.
