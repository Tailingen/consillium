This is a multicenter, open-label Phase I trial and the aim of this trial is to evaluate the drug-drug interaction and safety with SHR3162 combined with Abiraterone in Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients. The trial is a dose-escalation and -expansion study. Approximately 35\~38 patients in will receive fixed- dose of orally Abiraterone and only one of two dose levels of orally SHR3162. The Primary endpoints are incidence of adverse events(AE) and PK characteristics. The secondary endpoints are efficacy and recommended phase 2 dose(RP2D).
