A Clinical Study to Observe How Well That BAT8006 Works on Patients With Platinum Resistance Ovarian Cancer
This is a Phase 1b/2, open-label, 2-part, global study designed to investigate the anti-tumor activity as well as the safety and efficacy of BAT8006 in subjects with platinum resistance ovarian cancer

Part 1 is a Dose Finding Study. The RP2D will be confirmed in Part 1, and this RP2D will be further evaluated in Part 2. In Part 1, PK samples will be collected and analyzed to support the determination of RP2D. Three dose cohorts are planned. Subjects will be assigned to these three dosages in parallel.

Part 2 will expose subjects at the RP2D confirmed in Part 1.
