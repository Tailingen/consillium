A Pilot Study of Ultrasound-guided Vacuum-assisted Excision of Breast Cancers
This study is looking into whether the procedure called Vacuum Assisted Excision (VAE) is a safe method for the removal of small and medium sized invasive breast cancers in patients who are unfit or have refused to have surgery to remove cancer.

Recruitment Target: 20
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Vacuum-assisted excision
Greatest dimension of the Cancer, The proportion of participants in whom the greatest dimension of the cancer on imaging at 1 year post-vacuum assisted excision (VAE) is ≤50% of its pre-VAE size., 1 year
Recruitment Uptake, Proportion of eligible women offered the study who consent to participate., 12 months|Procedure Times, Time taken for each VAE procedure., 12 months|Procedure pain and acceptability, 11-point numerical rating pain score - with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst pain imaginable, 12 months|Complication rate of VAE, Proportion of women who have significant bleeding after the procedure (defined as bleeding requiring \> 20 minutes manual compression to control and/or a haematoma requiring aspiration or surgical evacuation) or infection at the VAE site (defined as requiring antibiotic treatment and/or an abscess requiring aspiration or surgery)., 12 months|Proportion of Cancer removed, Proportion of women in whom the cancer appears to be completely removed as judged on ultrasound at the end of the VAE procedure, 12 months|Residual Cancer after VAE, Proportion of participants in whom the greatest dimension of the cancer on imaging at 2 years post-VAE is less ≤ 50% of its pre-VAE size., 2 years post VAE|Requirement of salvage surgery, Proportion of participants who undergo surgery to the ipsilateral breast within 2 years of the VAE procedure because of continued growth of the tumour., 2 years post VAE|Histopathology of cavity walls, Proportion of participants with positive and negative cavity wall biopsies respectively who have tumour visible on imaging at 1 and 2 years., Imaging at 1 year and 2 years.|proportion willing to undergo the procedure again if necessary., proportion willing to undergo the procedure again if necessary based on yes or no question, 12 months
