Pain Outcomes Following Intralesional Corticosteroid Injections
Corticosteroid therapy, including intralesional and topical applications, has many indications within the fields of Dermatology, Plastic Surgery, and Orthopedics. However, these injections can be quite painful, which leads many patients to discontinue treatment.

Often, the injection involves a mixture of local anesthetic and corticosteroids despite a lack of evidence that the use of lidocaine improves pain. Due to the acidic pH, the lidocaine component of the injection can actually cause a significant burning sensation during the procedure. Lidocaine does not have anti-inflammatory properties and does not treat the underlying pathology. By including another medication, lidocaine also adds cost and risk to the procedure.

The purpose of this study is to see if removing lidocaine from intralesional injections decreases the pain of injection.
