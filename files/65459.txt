Study of ZG006 in Participants With Small Cell Lung Cancer or Neuroendocrine Carcinoma
This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ clinical study of ZG006 for the treatment of participants with small cell lung cancer or neuroendocrine carcinoma who had no standard treatment available, or were intolerant to standard treatment.
