Recombinant Human Adenovirus Type 5 Injection Combined With PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody and Nab-paclitaxel in the Treatment of Patients With Liver Metastases From Malignant Melanoma
This study is the first to explore the efficacy and safety of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 injection combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody and nab-paclitaxel in the treatment of patients with liver metastases of melanoma, in order to provide a new method for the clinical treatment of melanoma. The model also provides reference and basis for other tumor treatments.
