Efficacy Study of CPC634 (CriPec® Docetaxel) in Platinum Resistant Ovarian Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether CPC634 (CriPec® docetaxel) is effective in the treatment of patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who are resistant to prior platinum-based chemotherapy

DRUG: CPC634 (CriPec® docetaxel)
Objective Response Rate (ORR), To determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 of CPC634 (CriPec® docetaxel) monotherapy in subjects with ovarian cancer who are resistant to prior platinum-based therapy., At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)
Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (safety and tolerability), To evaluate the incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (safety and tolerability) of CPC634 (CriPec® docetaxel) according to NCI-CTCAE criteria (version 5.0), At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Progression free survival, Progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months based on RECIST version 1.1. and combined assessment using Gynecological Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) definitions for CA-125, After 6 months|GCIG CA-125 response criteria, GCIG CA-125 response criteria defined as at least a 50% reduction in CA-125 levels from a pretreatment sample confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days, At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Duration of response (DOR), Duration of response (DOR) based on RECIST version 1.1 and combined assessment using GCIG definitions for CA-125, At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Time to progression (TTP), Time from treatment assignment to time of progressive disease per RECIST version 1.1., After 6 months|Disease control rate (DCR), Disease control rate (DCR) will be determined based on the percentage of subjects who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) with treatment of CriPec® docetaxel, At the end of Cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)
This Phase IIa exploratory 2-stage trial assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CPC634 (CriPec® docetaxel) administered IV, Q3W to 25 subjects (13 in Stage 1 and 12 in Stage 2) with ovarian cancer that is resistant to prior platinum-based therapy. Subjects will be treated continuously every 21 days at 60 mg/m2, which is the RP2D of CPC634 (CriPec® docetaxel) that was determined in the Phase I CT-CL01, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason.
