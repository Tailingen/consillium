Gut Microbiota, Anastomotic Leak and Colorectal Cancer
This is a prospective study evaluating the relation between the gut microbiota composition, intestinal healing after colorectal surgery and colorectal cancer behavior.

Our hypothesis is that the gut microbiota composition could predict poor intestinal healing in colorectal surgery, and that the gut microbiota might have an impact on colorectal cancer clinical behavior and may predict disease outcomes.
