Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation in Patients With Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
Previous reports suggest benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment for borderline resectable pancreas cancer. This study is a multicenter prospective randomized phase II/III study of neoadjuvant chemoradiation with gemcitabine in patients with borderline resectable pancreas cancer. The study is designed in 2 arms, one with upfront surgery and the other with neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.

This study is a multicenter prospective randomized phase II/III study of neoadjuvant chemoradiation with gemcitabine in patients with borderline resectable pancreas cancer. The study is designed in 2 arms, one with upfront surgery and the other with neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.

This phase 2/3 multicenter randomized controlled trial was designed to enroll 110 patients with BRPC who were randomly assigned to gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation treatment (54 Gray external beam radiation) followed by surgery or upfront surgery followed by chemoradiation treatment from four large-volume centers in Korea. The primary endpoint was the 2-year survival rate (2-YSR). Interim analysis was planned at the time of 50% case enrollment.
