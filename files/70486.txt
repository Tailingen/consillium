Using Thoracic Ultrasound to Predict Pleurodesis Success in Malignant Pleural Effusions: a Pilot Study
The observational pilot study at the Churchill Hospital, funded by Oxford Respiratory Trials Unit, will assess the feasibility and efficacy of thoracic ultrasound (TUS) assessment in patients undergoing talc pleurodesis via intercostal chest drain (ICD) for recurrent symptomatic malignant pleural effusions (MPE). Participants will undergo TUS pre and post pleurodesis on up to four occasions. We hypothesise that a TUS scoring system will be able to predict short and long-term pleurodesis success earlier than current conventional medical practice allows. This study may ultimately allow the proposal of a treatment algorithm to manage patients with MPE in a more efficient manner.
