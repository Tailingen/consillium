Mapping of Sentinel Lymph Node Drainage Using SPECT (SUSPECT) (SUSPECT)
This study aims to explore the feasibility, safety and outcome of a non-invasive sentinel node mapping (SNM) to individually tailor the elective nodal irradiation (ENI) to the ipsilateral neck only and to exclude the contralateral negative neck from the irradiation fields when there is no draining sentinel node. Subsequently the dose to the salivary glands, mucosal area and the swallowing and chewing muscles and structures involved in voicing and articulation will significantly be reduced
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: radiation in Squamous Head and Neck Cancer
Feasibility and safety of single side radiation therapy measured by physical examination and toxicity measurement by CTCAE 4.03 at 12 weeks, mapping of sentinel lymph node drainage to indentify groups at low risk of the probability of contra regionale failure is to be estimated to be 2% at 2 years. A recurrrence rate of \>15% will be assumed unacceptable, 12 weeks
