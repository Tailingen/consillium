Study of DLL3-CAR-NK Cells in the Treatment of Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I clinical trial aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DLL3-CAR-NK cells treatment for relapsed and refractory extensive small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).
SCLC, Extensive Stage
BIOLOGICAL: DLL3-CAR-NK cells
The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), 1 year|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 1 year
This study is a multicenter, single arm, open-label, non randomized, single dose, dose escalation, phase I clinical trial on relapsed and refractory ES-SCLC. The phase I clinical trial will be conducted according to the principle of "3 + 3". Three dose groups will be set up, namely group A: 1.0 × 10\^7, group B: 1.0 × 10\^8, and group C: 1.0 × 10\^9 DLL3-CAR-NK cells. 9-18 subjects will be enrolled in the groups and given a single infusion of DLL3-CAR-NK cells injection in order to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), evaluate the safety and efficacy of the cell infusion. It well be recommend dose for phase II clinical study (recommended phase II dose, RP2D).
