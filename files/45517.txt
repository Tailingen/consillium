Total Tumor Mapping (TTM) for Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
At present there is no validated prognostic tool for patients with resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC) to determine how best to tailor individual therapy. This study is to see if tumor features in blood and imaging prior to surgery correspond with tumor heterogeneity in the specimen after surgery.

DRUG: Pimonidazole|PROCEDURE: Surgical Resection
Radiosensitivity Index and Degree of Pimonidazole Staining, Relationship between PET/CT, MRI or pancreas protocol CT features and the pathological correlations of radiation sensitivity and hypoxia, as measured by the radiosensitivity index (RSI) and degree of pimonidazole staining in resectable pancreatic cancer., Up to 14 weeks
Correlative Biomarkers, Investigators will quantitiatively compare correlative biomarkers with the degree of pimonidazole staining and RSI. These biomarkers will include radiomic features from the preoperative imaging tests, serum CA 19-9, and histological markers for biological hypoxia, GLUT-1, and CA-IX. Data from all of these biomarkers will be available as continuous variables. The association between RSI (or % pimonidazole-positive pixels) and biomarkers will be assessed using the Spearman correlation analysis., Up to 14 weeks
This study is to prospectively determine whether there is a predictive relationship in RPC between pre-operative radiomic imaging features and pathologic tumor heterogeneity, delineated by gene-expression-based RSI and histologic measures of hypoxia measured by Glut-1 and CA-IX as well as the degree of pimonidazole staining.
