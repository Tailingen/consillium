Brigatinib Post Definitive Chemo-radiotherapy in Patients with ALK-fusion Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
BOUNCE is an international multicentre randomised phase II trial. The trial treatment consists of brigatinib 180 mg once daily p.o., with seven day lead-in at 90 mg once daily, for 3 years or until progression of disease. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) for brigatinib consolidation, compared to observation/durvalumab, in patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC and ALK-rearrangement who completed definitive chemo-radiotherapy without disease progression.
NSCLC, Stage III|ALK-rearrangement
DRUG: Brigatinib|DRUG: Durvalumab
Progression-free survival, according to RECIST v1.1, evaluated in the ITT cohort. PFS will be compared between the two arms., defined as the time from the date of randomisation until documented progression (according to RECIST v1.1) or death, if progression is not documented, From the date of enrolment until last tumour assessment (approximately 45-48 months after enrolment of the first patient)
Overall survival, Defined as the time from the date of randomisation until death from any cause, From the date of enrolment until last tumour assessment (approximately 45-48 months after enrolment of the first patient)|CNS-relapse-free survival, Defined as the time from the date of randomisation until documented CNS-relapse, at the first disease progression, according to RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, if CNS-relapse is not documented, From the date of enrolment until last tumour assessment (approximately 45-48 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Patterns of disease progression, Defined as the site of first progression after randomisation: None, locoregional, distant (bone, brain, liver, etc.) or both locoregional and distant., From the date of enrolment until last tumour assessment (approximately 45-48 months after enrolment of the first patient)|Toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0, All safety parameters from enrolment will be summarised in tables to evaluate the toxicity/safety profile of the protocol treatment based on:

* Adverse events according to CTCAE v5.0 (any-cause as well as treatment-related) including adverse events leading to dose interruptions, withdrawal of protocol treatment, and death
* Severe, serious, and selected adverse events
* Deaths
* Laboratory parameters and abnormalities, and vital signs., From the date of enrolment until last tumour assessment (approximately 45-48 months after enrolment of the first patient)
