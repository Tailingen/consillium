Donor Derived CD19 CAR-T Cells in the Treatment of R/R B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
A Clinical Study on the Safety and Effectiveness of donor derived CD19 CAR-T Cells in the treatment of R/R B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BIOLOGICAL: CD19 B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Targeted CAR T-cells injection
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), Adverse events assessed according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0 criteria, Up to 28 days after Treatment|Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events \[Safety and Tolerability\], Up to 2 years after Treatment
Duration of remission ,DOR, The time from CR/CRi and PR to disease relapsed or death due to disease progression after CAR-T infusion, Up to 1 years after CAR-T infusion|Overall survival, OS, After transplantation until death from any cause., Up to 2 years after Treatment|Event-free survival (EFS), defined as the time from the date of receiving the infusion to the date of treatment failure (failure to achieve CR/CRh/CRi/MLFS/PR after both efficacy assessments), or relapse (hematologic relapse or extramedullary relapse after CR/CRh/CRi), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. When an EFS event was "Ineffective Therapy", the primary analysis of EFS was performed on a 1-day basis (ie, time to treatment received as the event). For a more comprehensive assessment, sensitivity analyses could be performed using the actual date of treatment failure, end of treatment, or start of next-line anti-leukemia therapy as the end of EFS for treatment failure, respectively., Up to 1 years after CAR-T infusion
In this study, 15 patients with relapsed refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were proposed to undergo CD19 CAR-T Cells therapy. Under the premise that its safety has been clarified in previous studies, further observation and evaluation of the effectiveness of CD19 CAR-T Cells therapy for relapsed refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; At the same time, on the basis of expanding the sample size, more safety data on CD19 CAR-T Cells treatment for relapsed refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were accumulated.
