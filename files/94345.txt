Selective IMRT for Locally Advanced Head and Neck Carcinoma With Concurrent Panitumumab
This is a non-randomized phase II study of targeted radiotherapy (RT) administered concurrently with panitumumab in patients with locally advanced squamous carcinoma of the head and neck.
Head and Neck Cancer
DRUG: Panitumumab|RADIATION: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy
Recurrence Rate of Locally Advanced Head & Neck Cancer, Imaging for recurrence via CT scan will occur at 8 weeks (+/-5 days) post-RT, and will be repeated at 6, 9, 12, and 24 months from start of treatment., 2 Years
Patterns of Failure, Evaluate locoregional recurrences to see if they arise in regions that were spared vs. treated, and assess long-term control after salvage therapy., 2 Years|Time to Relapse, Imaging for recurrence via CT scan will occur at 8 weeks (+/-5 days) post-RT, and will be repeated at 6, 9, 12, and 24 months from start of treatment., first day of therapy to the first sign of progressive disease|Morbidity of Treatment, Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v4., From screening until 30 days after treatment
This is a non-randomized phase II trial of targeted radiotherapy (RT) administered concurrently with panitumumab in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This protocol addresses patients with medical comorbidities that make them poor candidates for concurrent chemotherapy. Radiotherapy treatment will be directed at disease visible on diagnostic imaging modalities and the ipsilateral hemi-neck, sparing elective regions in the contralateral N0 hemi-neck with less than 20% chance of microscopic involvement. We explore the following hypothesis: Can acceptable locoregional disease control be obtained with less treatment-related morbidity by focusing RT on regions of gross disease, sparing regions with a low risk of harboring subclinical disease from elective RT?
