Relation Between Tumor-draining Lymph Nodes Metastasis Pattern and Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Neoadjuvant Immunotherapy Effectiveness
The goal of this retrospective cohort analysis is to discover the impact of the involvement extent of tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) in patients who received neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy. The main question it aims to answer is the role of TDLN in the prediction of treatment effectiveness. Researches will compare tumor-draining lymph nodes metastasis (mTDLNs) group and non-draining lymph nodes metastasis (mNDLNs) group to see whether different metastatic patterns of mediastinal lymph nodes can indicate the treatment effectiveness.
