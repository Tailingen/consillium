Avastin+ GemAOD As First-Line Treatment in NK/T Cell Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avastin combined with gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, pegaspargase and dexamethasone(Avastin+ GemAOD) as first-line treatment in patients with untreated natural killer(NK)/T cell lymphoma
Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type
BIOLOGICAL: Avastin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Pegaspargase|DRUG: Dexamethasone
Overall Response Rate(ORR), 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle,Efficacy was evaluated every two cycles, every 6 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)
Progress Free Survival(PFS), up to end of follow-up-phase (approximately 5 years)|Overall Survival(OS), up to the date of death (approximately 5 years)|The tolerance and the side effects of the treatment, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle,Toxicity was evaluated every cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)
Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) DNA copies, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)|lymphocyte count, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)|Monocyte Count, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)|C reactive protein, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)|Plasma β2-microglobulin, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)|Urinary microglobulin β2, 21 days(3 weeks) for one cycle, every 3 weeks,up to completion of treatment(approximately 6 months)
Recent study showed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was associated with a poorer outcome in patients with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,and Avastin impacted on tumor endothelial cells to make standard chemotherapy work better for T cell lymphoma. Many researches on Gemcitabine combined with Oxaliplatin for treatments of recurrent and refractory Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showed patients could benefit from the combination treatment . Pegaspargase plays an important role for treatment of NK/T cell lymphoma. Dexamethasone is used in combination with other agents for the treatment of lymphomas which may be implicated in the development or growth of some cancers.So we explored to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Avastin combined with gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, pegaspargase and dexamethasone(Avastin+ GemAOD) as first-line treatment in patients with untreated NK/T cell lymphoma
