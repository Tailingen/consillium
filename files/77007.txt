Metronomic Oral Chemotherapy With Cyclophosphamide, Capecitabine and Vinorelbine in Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
This is a phase II study assessing the activity and safety of metronomic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and capecitabine and vinorelbine in advanced breast cancer patient in four different cohort of patients:

1. Untreated (na誰ve) patients with endocrine responsive disease
2. Pretreated patients with endocrine responsive disease
3. Untreated (na誰ve) patients with triple negative disease
4. Pretreated patients with triple negative disease The primary endpoint will be the progression-free survival
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: Vinorelbine|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Time to progression (TTP), the time between the first study dose administration and the date of progression of the disease or cancer-related death, whichever occurs first, 28 days
This is an institutional, monocentric, open-label, phase II study of oral "metronomic" Vinorelbine plus Capecitabine and Cyclophosphamide (VEX) in patients with advanced breast cancer .

Patients will receive the combination regimen as follow:

Cyclophosphamide 50 mg daily Capecitabine 500 mg, thrice daily Vinorelbine 40 mg orally thrice a week

Four independent cohorts of patients will be evaluated in the study:

1. Untreated (na誰ve) patients with endocrine responsive disease
2. Pretreated patients with endocrine responsive disease
3. Untreated (na誰ve) patients with triple negative disease
4. Pretreated patients with triple negative disease Combination will be administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The primary endpoint will be to assess the Time to progression (TTP) of VEX combination in the four different cohorts
