Infusion of Donor Lymphocytes Depleted of CD25+ Regulatory T-cells in Patients With Relapsed Hematologic Malignancies
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cell depletion in a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) product with the use of the CliniMACS machine. Previously, patients with hematologic malignancies who have relapsed after transplant have been given infusions of donor white blood cells calsed donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) as a way to boost their immune function and fight cancer. Information from other research studies suggests that lowering the number of a certain type of white blood cell called CD25+ Tregs in the DLI may allow for a greater effect. In this research study, we are looking for the appropriate dose of DLI depleted of the CD25+ Treg white blood cells that can be given safely.

* The original marrow/stem cell donor will undergo one or two white blood cell collection procedures called leukopheresis. The cells collected from the first leukopheresis will be sent to the laboratory where the amount of white blood cells collected will be measured. If the number of cells collected at the first leukopheresis is not enough, the donor will have a second leukopheresis procedure.
* Once enough lymphocytes are collected from the donor, the CliniMACS CD25 Reagent System device will reduce the number of CD25+ Tregs. The CD25+ depleted donor lymphocytes will then be infused to the participant intravenously. Participants will be observed for about one hour after the infusion.
* One, two, four and eight weeks after the DLI, participants will return to the clinic for follow-up visits. At each visit a physical exam, questions about the participants general health, and blood tests will be performed.
