Trastuzumab Emtansine (T-DM1) in HER2-positive Breast Cancer Patients With Progressive Disease After TKIs or HP Therapy
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in the treatment of patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer after TKIs or HP therapy. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* The objective response rate of patients receiving T-DM1 therapy with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer after TKIs or HP therapy.
* The adverse events and prognosis of patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer who receive the T-DM1 therapy.
* Changes of anti-tumor immunity during T-DM1 therapy in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.

Participants will receive T-DM1 treatment (3.6mg/kg, d1/21, IVD) until progressive diseases or intolerable adverse effects occurs.
