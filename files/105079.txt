Comparison of Colonoscopy Adenoma Detection Yield
A Prospective Randomized Comparison of colonoscopy Adenoma Detection Yield of (i) Standard Colonoscopy (SC), (ii) artificial intelligence (Discovery) aided colonoscopy, and (iii) artificial intelligence (Discovery) and permanently mounted balloon (G-EYE®) aided colonoscopy.
Adenoma Colon
DEVICE: Standard Colonoscopy|DEVICE: Discovery aided colonoscopy|DEVICE: Discovery and G-EYE
Adenoma detection yield, adenoma detection yield, represented by Adenoma Per Colonoscopy (APC), of Standard Colonoscopy, compared with APC of Discovery aided colonoscopy and further compared with APC of Discovery \& G-EYE® aided colonoscopy, Upon histology results (up to 30 days)
Adenoma Detection Rate (Discovery + G-EYE vs. Standard Colonoscopy), Adenoma Detection Rate of Discovery and G-EYE® aided colonoscopy compared to Adenoma Detection Rate of Standard Colonoscopy, Upon histology results (up to 30 days)|Adenoma Detection Rate (Discovery vs. Standard Colonosocopy), Adenoma Detection Rate of Discovery aided colonoscopy compared to Adenoma Detection Rate of Standard Colonoscopy, Upon histology results (up to 30 days)|Adenoma Per Colonoscopy (Discovery vs. Discovery + G-EYE), Adenoma Per Colonoscopy of Discovery aided colonoscopy compared to Adenoma Per Colonoscopy of Discovery and G-EYE® aided colonoscopy, Upon histology results (up to 30 days)
Multi-center, three-arm, randomized, controlled, open-label study.

Total of up to 1320 patients will be randomized, including up to 10% for subject drop-out, 440 to each of the three following arms (groups):

Group 1 (1st arm): patients will receive standard colonoscopy (SC) Group 2 (2nd arm): patients will receive colonoscopy aided by the Discovery artificial intelligence software (DC) Group 3 (3rd arm): patients will receive colonoscopy aided by the Discovery artificial intelligence software and the G-EYE® balloon (GDC) The purpose of this study is to compare between the diagnostic yield of Standard Colonoscopy, Discovery aided colonoscopy, and Discovery \& G-EYE® aided colonoscopy.
