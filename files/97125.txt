Collection of Samples From Patients With MDS
The purpose of this study is to collect information and bone marrow, blood, saliva, cheek cells and skin to be used in the laboratory to assist the sponsor in identifying a new way of treating MDS.
Myelodysplastic Syndromes(MDS)
Genomics of patients with MDS, To sequence the exome and transcriptome obtained from MDS hematopoietic cells and the exome from non-hematopoietic cells (e.g. fibroblasts)., 2 years
Identification of patients' MDS-specific variant, To select variants by comparing MDS versus non-MDS cell exome sequences. MDS-specific variant sequences are defined as those that differ between the two and are not common polymorphisms. We will also compare myeloid and lymphoid hematopoietic cells and assess the number of myeloid-specific vs myeloid and lymphoid MDS-related variants, 2 years|Immunogenic mutant neoantigen peptide selection, To select putative mutation-driven neoantigen-related peptides, which represent the sequences obtained from Aim 2, according to their ability to bind to the patient's MHC using PersImmune's licensed and proprietary algorithms., 2 years|Peptide Immunogenicity confirmation and donor T cell stimulation, To test the neoantigen peptides for their in vitro immunogenicity for autologous T lymphocytes., 2 years|Peptide immunogenicity confirmation and donor T cell stimulation, To test the potency and specificity of neoantigen peptide-stimulated T cells for the patient's MDS cells that express the defined neoantigens., 2 years|Data analysis and interpretation, To create a database summarizing the data obtained., 2 years
Goals of the study:

The purpose of this study is to collect the blood and marrow samples, and non-involved fibroblasts, that are required to identify the unique, personalized array of mutation-driven neoantigens that are expressed by the subject's MDS cells and to assess the feasibility of immunizing and expanding one or more of the patient's T cells ex vivo for investigation of their use as adoptive cellular immunotherapy.
