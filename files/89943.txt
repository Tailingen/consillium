Defining ctDNA Metrics in Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD)
The purpose of this study is to find out if there is a benefit to giving rituximab with etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH) in participants who have high-risk B-cell PTLD in their 2nd phase of treatment (consolidation) while those with low-risk disease will be spared of chemotherapy and treated with rituximab consolidation alone.

This study is also being done to find out about the usefulness of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), a novel blood test which, has been shown to help guide treatment decisions in other types of lymphoma. The goal is to answer the question if ctDNA is a viable and informative tool in treating PTLD with the hope that in the future it may be used to individualize study treatment for participants with PTLD in a way that limits study treatment toxicity without losing the effectiveness of the treatment plan.
Lymphoma|Lymphoma, B-Cell
DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DEVICE: CAPP-seq
Number of participants with Complete Response (CR) rate of 60% or higher, to determine the rate of early molecular response to induction rituximab as well as correlate the experience of undetectable measurable residual disease at mid-consolidation and end of treatment, Up to 3 years
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) rate, to determine the rate of early molecular response to induction rituximab, Up to 3 years|Event Free Survival rate, EFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to the time of any treatment failure including disease progression, death, and treatment discontinuation for any reason (e.g., adverse effects or withdrawal)., Up to 3 years|Duration of Overall Response (OR), Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started)., Up to 3 years|Duration of stable disease, Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements., Up to 3 years|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) rate, PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first., Up to 3 years|Early Molecular Response (EMR) rate, EMR is defined as at least a 2-log fold reduction in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels between the start and completion of induction therapy., Up to 3 years|Measurable Residual Disease (MRD) rate, MRD refers to the quantity of ctDNA that can be detected at any given time point following the start of treatment. Undetectable MRD (uMRD) will refer to quantities of ctDNA that fall below the threshold of detection for the CAPP-Seq assay. MRD will be determined by ctDNA assay at both mid-consolidation (between cycles 6 and 7) and EOT (within 8 weeks of C8D1)., 8 weeks
This is a multi-center, phase 2, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of dose modified R-EPOCH in high-risk, treatment na√Øve CD20+ posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) patients. The purpose of this study is to define the benefit of rituximab with etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (R-EPOCH) in patients who have high-risk B cell PTLD while those with low-risk disease will be spared of chemotherapy and treated with rituximab alone. Concurrently this study also seeks to evaluate the usefulness of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), a novel blood test which has been shown to improve a physician's ability to prognosticate and guide treatment decisions in other types of lymphoma. The goal is to demonstrate that ctDNA is a viable and informative tool in treating PTLD with the hope that in the future it may be used to individualize treatment for patients with PTLD in a way that limits treatment toxicity without losing the effectiveness of the treatment plan.
