MORAb-004 in Treating Young Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of MORAb-004 in treating young patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as MORAb-004, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them

BIOLOGICAL: anti-endosialin/TEM1 monoclonal antibody MORAb-004|OTHER: pharmacological study|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
MTD, defined as the maximum dose at which fewer than one-third of patients experience dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) graded according to the revised National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, Up to 4 weeks|Incidence of toxicities, graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.0, A descriptive summary of all toxicities will be reported., Up to 3 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of MORAb-004 (anti-endosialin/TEM1 monoclonal antibody MORAb-004) administered as an intravenous infusion every week to children with refractory solid tumors.

II. To define and describe the toxicities of MORAb-004 administered on this schedule.

III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of MORAb-004 in children with refractory cancer.

IV. To monitor for the development of human anti-human antibody (HAHA) in children receiving MORAb-004.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of MORAb-004 within the confines of a phase 1 study.

II. To examine tumor endothelial marker-1 (TEM-1) and PDGFRB levels in tissue and plasma samples as potential biomarkers of MORAb-004 activity.

III. To correlate baseline expression of TEM-1 and PDGFRB (in issue and plasma)with clinical parameters including disease response in an exploratory manner.

OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

Patients receive anti-endosialin/TEM1 monoclonal antibody MORAb-004 intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
