Blood Brain Barrier Disruption (BBBD) Using MRgFUS in the Treatment of Her2-positive Breast Cancer Brain Metastases
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of BBB disruption using the ExAblate 4000-system Type 2 in patients with Her-2 positive breast cancer metastases in the brain.
Breast Cancer|Brain Metastases
DEVICE: ExAblate BBBD
Adverse events, Rate of adverse events following each treatment through end of study, Throughout the study, approximately 10 months.
Feasibility of BBBD, The extent of BBB opening will be determined by the degree of contrast enhancement seen on post-procedure MRI with contrast agent, Immediately after each BBBD procedure
The goal of this prospective, single arm, non-randomized study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of using the Exablate Model 4000 Type 2 "Neuro-System" as a tool to serially disrupt the blood brain barrier in a temporary and localized fashion in patients with breast cancer and brain metastases. Up to 10 patients will be recruited at Sunnybrook. Patients will be consented, screened, undergo up to 6 study Exablate BBBD treatment cycles, every 2-3 weeks based on their trastuzumab regimen. Follow-up will continue through 12 weeks following the last BBBD post-treatment and the subject's participation in the study will be complete.

Data will be collected to establish the basic safety of this type of treatment as the basis for later studies to evaluate clinical efficacy.
