Inception, Validation and Clinical Utility of a Score to Assess the Completeness of Caecal Visualisation
CCIS is a novel score, created specifically to evaluate the completeness of caecal visualized. It can be applied to a single or multiple images. To create the CCIS, the caecum was divided into eight parts: the appendiceal orifice (AO), the tri-radiate fold part 1 (TF-1), 2 (TF-2), 3 (TF-3) and four outer quadrants (OQ 1-4). The ileo-caecal valve (ICV) is a reference point but is not part of the score. The quadrant adjacent to the ICV is labelled OQ1. The three other quadrants are labelled clockwise from this quadrant. The tri-radiate folds are also labelled clockwise with TF1 representing the triangle side that is majority-contained within OQ1. TF2 and TF3 are then labelled clockwise from TF1.

VALIDATE A NOVEL SCORE FOR THE COMPLETENESS OF CAECAL INTUBATION, To create the CCIS, the caecum is divided into eight parts: the appendiceal orifice (AO), the tri-radiate fold part 1 (TF-1), 2 (TF-2), 3 (TF-3) and four outer quadrants (OQ 1-4). The ileo-cacecal valve (ICV) is a reference point but is not part of the score. The quadrant adjacent to the valve is labelled OQ1. The three other quadrants are labelled clockwise from this quadrant. For every component of the CCIS that is completely visualized on the image, one point is gained with a maximum possible CCIS of 8 and a minimum of 0. Participants were asked to answer the same six questions for each image-set.

* Is this an image of the caecum?
* What is the Boston Bowel Preparation score for this segment of the colon?
* What is your subjective first impression (yes/no) regarding completeness of caecal intubation?
* What subjective percentage do you believe was assessed?
* What is the CCIS score for this image-set?
* Using the online tool, which components of the CCIS were seen, 4 weeks
