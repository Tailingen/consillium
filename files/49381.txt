Phase Ib/II Trial of Interleukin-2 and PD-1 Checkpoint Inhibitor, Nivolumab In Metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Cancer
This will be a single arm, multi-site phase Ib/II clinical trial of standard doses of High Dose Interleukin-2 (HD IL2) (600,000 IU/kg/dose intravenously during two 5-day cycles 9 days apart) in IL-2 eligible clear cell metastatic RCC (Renal Cell Carcinoma) subjects in combination with Nivolumab.

Investigators hypothesize that concurrent PD-1 inhibition synergistically enhances the anti-tumor immune response to HD IL-2 in metastatic clear cell RCC. Investigators postulate that the combination of the two therapies would result in an increase in the overall response rate, complete response rate, and improved survival outcomes compared to either of the individual therapies.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Interleukin-2|DRUG: Nivolumab
The Number of Patients With Grade 3 and Grade 4 Adverse Events of Interest, This is the primary outcome for the Phase Ib portion of the trial. Events of interest are possibly immune-mediated and occur only after at least one dose of Nivolumab has been administered. Immune-mediated events of interest do not include those that are known to occur during high dose IL-2 monotherapy and are reversible. Grade assessed per CTCAE version 4.0., 28 days from the first dose of Nivolumab|The Number of Patients That Respond to Treatment, This is the primary outcome for the Phase II portion of the trial. Includes complete response (CR) + partial response (PR), measured by computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1., 12 Weeks
Number of Grade 3-5 Adverse Events of Interest, Events of interest are possibly immune-mediated and occur only after at least one dose of Nivolumab has been administered. Immune-mediated events of interest do not include those that are known to occur during high dose IL-2 monotherapy and are reversible. Grade assessed per CTCAE version 4.0., For the duration of the therapy plus 60 days post treatment|Overall Survival at 24 Months, Overall survival at 24 months following the first dose of study therapy; 24 month estimates were reported using the product limit method of Kaplan and Meier along with 95% confidence intervals., 24 Months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 24 Months, PFS is defined as the time from start of study therapy with Nivolumab until progression or death; up to 24 months. Progressive disease is defined as At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions., 24 Months
