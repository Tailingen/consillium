Gene Expression Profiles in Predicting Survival of Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
RATIONALE: Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict survival of patients with head and neck cancer.

PURPOSE: This laboratory study is assessing gene expression profiles in predicting survival of patients with head and neck cancer.
Head and Neck Cancer
GENETIC: microarray analysis|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
Identification of gene expression profiles used to predict survival as assessed by DNA microarray analysis, at time of surgical resection
OBJECTIVES:

* Identify gene expression profiles associated with survival by DNA microarray assay analysis using RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated on clinical trial RTOG-9501.

OUTLINE: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed by DNA microarray analysis for gene expression profiling.
