Split Course Adaptive Radiation Therapy With Pembrolizumab With/Without Chemotherapy for Treating Stage IV Lung Cancer
This phase I/II trial tests the safety and efficacy of split-course adaptive radiation therapy in combination with immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with stage IV lung cancer or lung cancer that that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced). Radiation therapy is a standard cancer treatment that uses high energy rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Split-course adaptive radiation therapy uses patient disease response to alter the intensity of the radiation therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, cemiplimab, atezolizumab or nivolumab may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs like carboplatin, pemetrexed, and paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving split-course adaptive radiation therapy with standard treatments like immunotherapy and chemotherapy may be more effective at treating stage IV or locally advanced lung cancer than giving them alone.

OUTLINE:

Patients are assigned to 1 of 11 standard treatment regimens, in combination with radiation therapy, as determined by the tumor histology and PD-L1 status.

Patients with non-squamous histology and any PD-L1 status are assigned to arms 1-4.

Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive pemetrexed and pembrolizumab on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo radiation therapy on day 1 of each cycle over 5 treatment fractions.

ARM II: Patients receive carboplatin, pemetrexed and cemiplimab-rwlc on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive pemetrexed and cemiplimab-rwlc on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo radiation therapy on day 1 of each cycle over 5 treatment fractions.
