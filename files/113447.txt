Colorectal Cancer|Neoplasm Metastasis
DRUG: Tarceva (OSI-774)|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Oxaliplatin
To determine the response rate of OSI-774 when given in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine in patients with previously-treated locally advanced, locally recurrent, or metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma
To assess overall survival, progression-free survival, time to progression and duration of response|To evaluate the toxicities of the combination of OSI-774, oxaliplatin and capecitabine in this population of patients with colorectal cancer
Patients will be treated with OSI-774 (orally) daily, oxaliplatin (intravenously) every 3 weeks, and capecitabine (orally) twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period. This will constitute a 21-day treatment cycle. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
