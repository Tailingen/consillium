BAY1436032 in Patients With Mutant IDH1(mIDH1) Advanced Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
To determine the maximum tolerated and / or recommended Phase II dose of oral mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) inhibitor BAY1436032 and to characterize its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical efficacy in patients with mIDH1-R132X advanced acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
DRUG: BAY1436032
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or RP2D of BAY1436032, If the MTD is not reached during dose escalation, the primary variable will be the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BAY1436032, Within first 4 weeks of first dose|Number of participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of, As a measure of safety and tolerability, Up to 12 weeks
Objective efficacy response, Response assessment for AML in this study will be based on the modified Cheson criteria. The following categories are used to capture the investigator's AML response evaluation:

* Complete remission (CR)
* Morphologic CR with CRh (morphologic CR with incomplete hematological recovery) and the response category CRp (morphologic CR with incomplete platelet recovery)
* Partial remission (PR)
* Response categories for morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), stable disease and progressive disease
* Progressive disease, Up to 12 weeks|Duration of response, Efficacy data, Up to 12 weeks|Event-free survival (EFS), EFS defined as time from start of treatment to treatment failure, relapse, or death due to any cause., Up to 12 weeks|Change of 2 hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) level obtained at baseline and post-baseline, Assess pharmacodynamic (PD) effects and evidence of clinical efficacy associated with BAY 1436032 administration in patients. Change from baseline and percent change from baseline will be calculated., Up to 12 weeks|Cmax (maximum observed drug concentration in plasma after a single dose), As a secondary objective of this study evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAY 1436032 in patients.

PK parameters normalized for dose and / or dose and body weight will be calculated., Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 hour post-dose (each cycle is 28 days)|AUC(0-8) (AUC from time 0 to 8 h after a single dose), As a secondary objective of this study evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAY 1436032 in patients.

PK parameters normalized for dose and / or dose and body weight will be calculated., Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hour post-dose (each cycle is 28 days)|AUC(0-12) (AUC from time 0 to 12 h after a single dose), if feasible, Cycle 1 Day 1: Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hour post-dose (each cycle is 28 days)|Cmax,md (Cmax after multiple doses), As a secondary objective of this study evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAY 1436032 in patients.

PK parameters normalized for dose and / or dose and body weight will be calculated., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hour post-dose on Day 15; (each cycle is 28 days)|AUC(0-8)md (AUC from time 0 to 8 h after multiple doses), As a secondary objective of this study evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BAY 1436032 in patients.

PK parameters normalized for dose and / or dose and body weight will be calculated., Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hour post-dose on Day 15; (each cycle is 28 days)|AUC(0-12)md (AUC from time 0 to 12 h after multiple doses), if feasible, Pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hour post-dose on Day 15; (each cycle is 28 days)
