Pemigatinib Combined With PD-1 Inhibitor in Unresectable or Metastatic Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma
This is a Prospective, single-arm, phase II study with multicenter participation. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pemigatinib combined with PD-1 inhibitor as first-line treatment for patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

DRUG: Pemigatinib|DRUG: PD-1 Inhibitors
Objective Response Rate, The proportion of subjects who achieved complete response (CR; all target lesions disappeared) or partial response (PR; the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions decreased by ≥ 30%) according to the RECIST1.1 standard., 2 years
Progression-Free-Survival, From the first administration to progressive disease\[PD\] or death., 2 years|Duration of Response, the period of time from the days which achieved complete response\[CR\] or partial response\[PR\] to progressive disease\[PD\]. This outcome measure is only applied to the subjects with objective remission, 2 years|Disease Control Rate, The proportion of the sum of complete response\[CR\]、partial response\[PR\]、stable disease\[SD\] among the total cases., 2 years|Overall Survival, from the date of enrollment to Death, 2 years
The study will be divided into two phases. The first phase is the safety import phase, in which three subjects with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma will be enrolled to receive a Scheduled dose of pemigatinib for one course of treatment， If the initial three subjects didn't develop DLT during the 21-day observation period, the dose will be considered tolerable and the study will proceed to Part II, otherwise, the dose will be adjusted and the evaluation will continue according to the above criteria.

A total of 30 subjects will be enrolled in Phase II of the study, and all screening-qualified subjects will receive pemigatinib combined with PD-1 inhibitor. pemigatinib and PD-1 inhibitors will be administered at established doses according to a regimen until progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or informed consent form has been withdrawn. PD-1 inhibitors will be administered for a maximum of 24 months.
