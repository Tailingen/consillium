Study of REM-422 in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
The goal of this study is to determine the safety and antitumor effects of REM-422, a MYB mRNA degrader, in people with advanced Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC)
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma|Metastatic Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma|Recurrent Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma
DRUG: REM-422
Frequency and severity of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Frequency and severity of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be evaluated according to the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 and number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities will be assessed to determine Safety and Tolerability of REM-422, 18 months|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), Frequency and severity of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be evaluated according to the NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 and the number of participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities will be assessed, Assessed at the end of Cycle 1 for each participant
Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR will be evaluated using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1 following treatment with REM-422, 18 months|Median Progression Free Survival (mPFS), PFS will be evaluated using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1 following treatment with REM-422, 18 months|Duration of Response (DoR), DoR will be evaluated using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1 following treatment with REM-422, 18 months|Time to Response (mTTR), TTR will be evaluated using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1 following treatment with REM-422, 18 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), DCR will be evaluated using the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1 following treatment with REM-422, 18 months|Median Overall Survival (mOS), mOS will be evaluated after treatment with REM-422, 18 months|Determine pharmacokinetic profile (Cmax) of REM-422, Measure Maximal concentration (Cmax) of REM-422, 18 months|Determine pharmacokinetic profile (Cmin) of REM-422, Measure Minimal concentration (Cmin) of REM-422, 18 months|Determine pharmacokinetic profile (Tmax) of REM-422, Measure Time to peak drug concentration (Tmax) of REM-422, 18 months|Determine pharmacokinetic profile (AUC) of REM-422, Measure Area Under the Curve (AUC) of REM-422, 18 months
This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study investigating REM-422, a potent, selective, and oral small molecule mRNA degrader that reduces expression of the MYB transcription factor for patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC.

This study includes a Dose Escalation Phase and a Dose Expansion Phase. The purpose of the Dose Escalation Phase is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of REM-422 in patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC. The purpose of Dose Expansion is to further evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of the RP2D carried forward from Dose Escalation.

Participation in this study will continue until disease progression, therapy intolerance, or participant withdrawal.
