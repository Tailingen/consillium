Clinical Study of Fulvestrant Combined With Chidamide in the Treatment of Hormone Receptor-positive Advanced Breast Cancer Resistant to CDK4/6 Inhibitors
The trial used a multicenter, open, single-arm design in which patients were treated with Chidamide combined with Fulvestrant.The primary objective is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of Chidamide in combination with Fulvestrant.Patients included in the trial were advanced breast cancer progressing on first-line aromatase inhibitor + Cyclin-dependent kinases（CDK）4/6i rescue therapy.
