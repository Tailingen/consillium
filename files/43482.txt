A Study of Fedratinib in Japanese Subjects With DIPSS (Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System)- Intermediate or High-risk Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), Post-polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis (Post-PV MF), or Post-essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis (Post-ET MF)
The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

This is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, single arm, open-label study in Japanese subjects with DIPSS intermediate or high-risk PMF, post-PV or post-ET MF. The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1 part to determine safety and tolerability and a RP2D. The Phase 1 portion of the study will explore one or more drug doses for fedratinib (300 mg and 400 mg) using a mTPI-2 design. Following completion of dose escalation and determination of MTD and/or a RP2D, the study will progress into the Phase 2 part to further evaluate the efficacy and safety.

The study will consist of 3 periods: a Screening Period, a Treatment Period including a 30-day follow-up after last dose visit and a survival follow-up period.
Primary Myelofibrosis
DRUG: Fedratinib
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), is the highest dose that causes DLTs in not more than 33% of the subjects treated with fedratinib in the first cycle with at least 3 evaluable subjects treated at this dose., Up to Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), is a recommended Phase 2 dose that is determined as safe and tolerable by the Safety Review Committee based on the data from the first cycle with at least 3 evaluable subjects treated at each dose of the Phase 1 part., Up to Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Response Rate (RR), Proportion of subjects who have ≥ 35% SVR at end of Cycle 6 from baseline, Up to Cycle 6 (each cycle is 28 days)
Adverse Events (AEs), An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE., From ICF signature up until 30 days after last dose of IP|Pharmacokinetics - Cmax, Peak (maximum) plasma concentration of the drug, Up to Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics - AUC, Area under the plasma concentration curve, Up to Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Pharmacokinetics - Tmax, Time to maximum plasma concentration, Up to Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)|Symptom response rate (SRR), Proportion of subjects with ≥ 50% reduction in total symptom scores measured by MFSAF version 2.0 (Appendix C) at end of Cycle 6, Up to Cycle 6 (each cycle is 28 days)|Spleen volume response rate 25 (RR25), Proportion of subjects who have ≥ 25% reduction in spleen volume at the end of Cycle 6, Up to Cycle 6 (each cycle is 28 days)|Spleen Response Rate by Palpation (RRP), Proportion of subjects who have ≥ 50% reduction in spleen size by palpation at end of Cycle 6, Up to Cycle 6 (each cycle is 28 days)|Duration of spleen volume response (DR), Duration of ≥ 35% SVR by MRI/CT, Up to 4 years|Duration of spleen response by palpation (DRP), Time from the first documented palpable spleen response, according to the IWGMRT 2013 to the time of the first documented loss of response according to the IWG-MRT 2013., Up to 4 years|Duration of symptoms response (DSR), Duration of ≥ 50% reduction in total symptom scores measured by MFSAF version 2.0, Up to 4 years|Spleen and Disease Progression Free Survival (SDPFS), Time from the start of fedratinib treatment to death due to any reason or disease progression (modified IWGMRT 2013 including ≥ 25% increase in spleen volume by MRI/CT), Up to 4 years|Gastrointestinal adverse events, Incidence of subjects with Grade 3 or higher Gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting) according to CTCAE v5.0, From ICF signature to the 30-day follow-up after last dose of IP|Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) events, Occurrence of confirmed Wernicke encephalopathy events, From ICF signature to the 30-day follow-up after last dose of IP|Overall Survival (OS), Time from the start of fedratinib treatment to death due to any reason, Up to 4 years
The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.
