Collection of Information to Better Understand Young Onset Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this registry study is to create a database-a collection of information-for better understanding young onset colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer patients are considered to have young onset colorectal cancer if they are diagnosed with their cancer before the age of 50. Researchers will use the information from this database to learn more about how young onset colorectal cancer may be similar to or different from colorectal cancer that is diagnosed later in life. Researchers will also use information from the database for current and future research on young onset colorectal cancer.
