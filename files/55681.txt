Quality of Life of Patients With Glioblastoma (GBM) Treated With Tumor-Treating Fields
This purpose of this study is to describe the effect of Tumor Treating Fields (NovoTTF) on quality of life (QOL), including exercise, sleep quality, and mood, in patients with World Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV malignant glioma who have been prescribed and approved to receive Optune™. This is an observational, longitudinal study, meaning that information about QOL will be collected over time while the patient is using the NovoTTF device (for example, Optune™).
Malignant Glioma
DEVICE: NovoTTF
Change in physical activity between baseline and week 24, Mean change between baseline and week 24 in total physical activity (MET-h/wk) as measured by the Godin Leisure Time Questionnaire, Baseline, 24 weeks
Change in quality of life between baseline and week 24, Mean change from baseline at week 24 in subscales of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Brain (FACT-Br) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F), Baseline, 24 weeks|Change in sleep quality between baseline and week 24, Mean change from baseline at week 24 in sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Assessment (PSQI), Baseline, 24 weeks|Change in patient's mood state between baseline and week 24, Mean change from baseline at week 24 in mood as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Baseline, 24 weeks|Change in functional capacity between baseline and week 24, Mean change from baseline at week 24 in functional capacity as measured by the 6-minute walk test, Baseline, 24 weeks|Change from baseline in average daily number of steps taken at 8, 16, and 24 (±3) weeks, Mean change from baseline at week 8, 16, and 24 in the average daily number of steps as measured by the Fitbit among patients treated with Novo TTF, Baseline, 8, 16, 24 weeks
Patients will be provided with a Fitbit Charge HR™, which they will begin wearing immediately to collect baseline information. The study team will teach the patients how to use the Fitbit and the associated smart phone application. Patients will also set an account with a platform that will provide information from the Fitbit (number of steps, sleep behaviors, and exercise log) to the study team. Patients will also have blood drawn, do a 6-minute walk test, and complete questionnaires at clinic visits 1, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after receiving the Fitbit. At the end of the study, patients will return the Fitbit to the study team.
