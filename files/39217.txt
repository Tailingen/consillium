DRUG: Immuncell-LC
To assess progression-free survival (PFS), CT, PET-CT, MRI, up to 2 years
To assess the overall survival (OS), up to 2 years|To evaluate the Disease control rate, to determine response rate (CR, PR, SD rate) from the baseline to the late observation date using mRECIST, up to 2 years|To assess the changes of Alpha Feto Protein(AFP)figures from baseline to the last observation date, analysing the changes of AFP before and after combination Nexavar plus Immuncell-LC, up to 2 years|Number of participants with adverse events, up to 2 years
* primary outcome Compare clinical efficacy of group treated with cell therapeutic Immuncell-LC evaluated by progression free survival with that of untreated group
* secondary outcome compare clinical efficacy of group treated with Immuncell-LC, a drug for treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma evaluated by overall survival, disease control rate, changes of Alpha Feto Protein(AFP) figures from baseline to the last observation date and that of untreated group and evaluate adverse reactions, clinical pathological tests and its safety.
