Masitinib in Combination With Gemcitabine in Advanced/Metastatic Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Patients
The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with gemcitabine in refractory ovarian cancer patients.

DRUG: Masitinib|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Placebo
Overall survival (OS), Overall survival is defined as time in months from the randomization date to the date of death due to any cause. If a patient is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the date of last known date patient alive., From day of randomization to death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months
Overall Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) \[Time Frame: From day of randomization to disease progression or death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months\] Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from the randomization date until the date of earliest evidence of disease progression or death, for participants who progressed or died before subsequent cancer therapy. Disease progression will be assessed by CT scan according to RECIST criteria recommendations., From day of randomization to disease progression or death, assessed for a maximum of 60 months
Masitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is thought to promote survival via modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of masitinib in combination with gemcitabine as compared with single agent gemcitabine in advanced or metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer patients who are refractory to platinum treatment. This is an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, phase 2/3 study. The study's primary efficacy measure will be overall survival. Masitinib will be prescribed until disease progression (or treatment switch to next line of treatment), death, limiting toxicity or patient consent withdrawal. The study design is a two-stage adaptive design, meaning that it includes a prospectively planned opportunity for modification of one or more specified aspects of the study (for example patient enrollment).
