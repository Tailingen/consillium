Effectiveness of Bronchoscopic Interventions for Malignant Airway Obstruction
The goal of this clinical research study is learn about side effects and the success of bronchoscopies when performed in cancer patients with and without symptoms.

This is an investigational study.

Up to 110 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

BEHAVIORAL: Medical Data Collection
Time to Any Complication Requiring Treatment, Researchers will estimate the hazard function of time to any complications in the framework of competing risks while death is the competing risk.3 Researchers will graphically visualize the hazard function of time to any complications using Kernel smoothing method., 2 years
Quality-Adjusted Survival, Researchers will evaluate the relationship between covariates and quality-adjusted survival., 2 years
Early Intervention, Early intervention cases defined as those with anatomic narrowing and no or mild dyspnea (as measured by the Borg score)., 2 years|Late Intervention, Late intervention cases defined as those with moderate or severe dyspnea due to airway narrowing., 2 years
If participant agrees to take part in this study, researchers will collect information from participant's medical records.

Length of Study:

Researchers will continue to collect participant's medical information for up to 2 years.

Additional Information:

Participant's data will be kept in a database on a password-protected computer in a secure office. This information will only be available to the study doctors and staff.
