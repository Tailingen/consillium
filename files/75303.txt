Pharmacokinetics and Dynamics of Nebulized Dexmedetomidine
the aim of this study is to study the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of nebulized dexmetedomidine in children undergoing major abdominal cancer surgery.
Abdominal Cancer
DRUG: nebulized Dexmedetomidine
pharmacokinitics of dexmedetomidine, serum level of dexmedetomidine, at the basline and after the end of nebuization of the drug at 5 minutes,15 minutes,30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes and 120 minutes
sedation score, Ramsy sedation score

1 = Anxious or restless or both Unacceptable; increase sedation 2=Cooperative, orientated and tranquil Acceptable; no action necessary 3=Responding to commands Acceptable; no action necessary 4=Brisk response to stimulus Acceptable; no action necessary 5=Sluggish response to stimulus Unacceptable; monitor respiratory status and sedation level until stable at 2 or 3 6= No response to stimulus Unacceptable; monitor respiratory status and sedation level until stable at 2 or 3, baseline and after end of the drug adminstration by 30 mininute
Inhalation of nebulized drug is an alternative route of administration that is relatively easy to set up, does not require venpuncture, but is associated with high bioavailability of the administered drug. Information on the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine in the pediatric population is very limited, especially in children. To the best of investigators knowledge, there are no published reports on the pharmacokinetics of nebulized dexmedetomidine in children.
