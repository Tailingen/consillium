Huaier Granule in Patients With Stage I Primary Ovarian Fallopian Tube Cancer After Peritoneal Cancer
This study is an exploratory, single-center, prospective single-arm study to explore the efficacy of Huaier granules in the treatment of stage Ⅱ-Ⅳ primary ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and peritoneal cancer after satisfactory tumor reduction (R0/R1). Twenty-five patients with FIGOⅡ-Ⅳ ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer or tubal cancer confirmed by histopathology were enrolled and treated with Huaier granules. During the study period, the patients were followed up once at 3 months, and the medication was continued until progression or intolerability of toxicity.
