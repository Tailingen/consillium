Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block and Pain Management in Neurosurgery
Post craniotomy pain is defined as headache developed up to 7 days from a craniotomy, not otherwise explained. A moderate to severe pain affects from 60 to 84% of patients.

Sphenopalatine ganglion block has been successfully used in patients with chronic or acute headache, facial pain and for transsphenoidal pituitary and endoscopic sinus surgeries.

There are evidences that sphenopalatine ganglion block reduces vegetative responses to skull pin closure.

This study aim to investigate feasibility and efficacy of sphenopalatine ganglion block in reducing pain after a neurosurgical supratentorial craniotomy.
