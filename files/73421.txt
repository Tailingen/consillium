S9716: Combination Chemotherapy in Treating Patients With Merkel Cell Cancer
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil in treating patients with Merkel cell cancer.
Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Skin
DRUG: CMF regimen|DRUG: cyclophosphamide|DRUG: fluorouracil|DRUG: methotrexate
OBJECTIVES: I. Investigate the ability of the Southwest Oncology Group Melanoma Committee to enroll patients with unresectable Merkel cell carcinoma that is local-regional or metastatic. II. Determine the overall survival rate and objective response rate of these patients after treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to local-regional disease versus metastatic disease. Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, methotrexate IV, and fluorouracil IV on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicities. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 patients per stratum) will be accrued for this study.
