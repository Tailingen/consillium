ARCHER 1009 : A Study Of Dacomitinib (PF-00299804) Vs. Erlotinib In The Treatment Of Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized,double-blinded, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of treatment with PF-00299804 to treatment with erlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, previously treated with at least one prior regimen. Analyses of primary objective (Progression Free Survival) will be done in two co-primary populations as defined in the protocol.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Independent Radiologic Review., PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression as by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) v1.1 per Independent Radiologic Review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Objective progression was defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum is observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm or unequivocal progression of pre-existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesions., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, participants were followed up until progressive disease regardless of start of subsequent cancer therapy.|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Per Independent Radiologic Review in KRAS Wild-type (WT) Participants., PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression as by RECIST v1.1 per Independent Radiologic Review or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Objective progression was defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum is observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm or unequivocal progression of pre-existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of any new unequivocal malignant lesions. Tumor tissue from participants' original diagnostic biopsies or recently obtained biopsies were analyzed to determine KRAS status., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, participants were followed up until progressive disease regardless of start of subsequent cancer therapy.

A ≥10 point increase in score had to be maintained for ≥2 consecutive cycles for the symptom to be considered deteriorated. Participants were censored at the last time when they completed an assessment for pain, dyspnea, fatigue or cough if they had not deteriorated. A 10 point or higher change in the score is perceived by participants as clinically significant., Data taken from Cycle 1 day 1 to the end of treatment or withdrawal.|Mean and Difference in Mean in Functioning and Global Quality of Life (QOL) as Assessed by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), EORTC QLQ-C30: included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). Scores ranged from 0-100 where a higher score indicated a better level of quality of life. Overall scores present the mean score for that scale from all time-point data., Data taken from Cycle 1 day 1 to the end of treatment or withdrawal, averaged (mean) to provide overall scores.|Mean and Difference in Mean in QLQ-C30 Symptoms as Assessed by the EORTC-QLQ-C30., EORTC QLQ-C30: included functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties).

It consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and a visual analogue scale-the EQ VAS. The EQ-5D descriptive system measures a participants' health state on 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels, reflecting "no health problems," "moderate health problems," and "extreme health problems." The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)., Data taken from Cycle 1 day 1 to the end of treatment or withdrawal, averaged (mean) to provide overall scores.
