Use of Racotumomab in Patients With Pediatric Tumors Expressing N-glycolylated Gangliosides
This study will be carried out in children with diagnosis of cancer with tumors known to express N-glycolylated gangliosides. The disease must be resistant to conventional therapy. The acute toxicity and immune response will be evaluated.

The expression of N-glycolylated gangliosides in tumors has previously been investigated in the tumor sample bank at this Hospital. The expression of N-glycolyl GM3 was shown in neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, Wilm's tumor and retinoblastoma.

Gliomas and the aforementioned tumor types have a very bad prognosis when conventional treatment is ineffective.

New therapeutic strategies have thus been examined, and several immunotherapeutic approaches, including dendritic cell vaccines, peptide vaccines and anti-idiotype vaccines are currently being assessed.

Racotumomab is an anti-idiotype antibody capable of inducing anti-N-glycolyl GM3 antibodies in patients with melanoma, breast cancer and lung cancer.

Dose escalation studies have shown the safety of racotumomab in the 0.5 to 2 mg dose range. The 1 mg dose level was selected for the ensuing clinical studies.

This clinical trial in children involves three dose levels: 0.15 mg, 0.25 mg and 0.4 mg, owing to the difference in body surface between an adult (1.73 sq. m in average) and the candidate population for this study (0.55 to 0.7 sq. m).

DRUG: racotumomab
Selection of the higher safe dose level for ensuing clinical trials, One of the three dose levels assessed in this study will be selected for further clinical testing in children: 0.15 mg, 0,25 mg or 0.4 mg., Up to 1 year
Assess the immune response to racotumomab treatment, Active specific immunotherapy with racotumomab has shown to elicit antigen-specific immune responses in adult patients. The elicitation of anti-immunogen and anti-ganglioside antibodies will be assessed in serum samples prior and after racotumomab treatment., Up to 1 year
