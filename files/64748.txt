A Study of Vemurafenib and GDC-0973 (Cobimetinib) in Participants With BRAFV600E Mutation-Positive Metastatic Melanoma
This open-label, dose-escalation study of vemurafenib in combination with cobimetinib will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics in participants with BRAFV600 mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. Participants with previously untreated, BRAFV600E mutation-positive, locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic melanoma or those who have progressed on vemurafenib monotherapy immediately prior to enrolling in this trial are eligible. Participants will be assigned to different cohorts with escalating oral doses of vemurafenib and cobimetinib. This study consists of 2 stages, Stage 1 (Dose Escalation Stage \[DES\] and Cohort Expansion Stage \[CES\]) and the anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other discontinuation criterion is met.

Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response of Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version (V) 1.1, Tumor response of CR or PR is considered as objective response. CR: disappearance of all target lesions, reduction in short axis \<10 millimeters in pathological lymph nodes (target and non-target lesions); PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter.
