Accelerated Dose Schedule of Cytarabine Consolidation Therapy for Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Complete Remission
This phase 2, open label, non-randomized study will evaluate the safety of administering high dose cytarabine (HiDAC) consolidation therapy on days 1-3 of each cycle, as compared to standard administration on days 1, 3, and 5 of each cycle, in patients 61 years and older with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
