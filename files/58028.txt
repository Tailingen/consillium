A Real World Study to Evaluate Effectiveness of Avastin (Bevacizumab) for First Line Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer and Known KRAS Status
This non-interventional study will meta-analyze overall survival outcomes among the participants with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with available V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) status, who received firstline treatment with bevacizumab containing treatment regimen in routine clinical practice. The study leveraging secondary data from existing cohorts in the United Stats of America (USA), Germany, Australia, and Denmark.

Overall Survival (OS) in Participants With mCRC and a Documented KRAS Mutation who Received Bevacizumab-Containing Treatment or Chemotherapy Alone in Routine Clinical Practice, start of first-line therapy to death from any cause, or to last date known that participant is alive (retrospective data collection over approximately 9 years)
OS in Participants With mCRC and a Documented KRAS Wild Type Status who Received Bevacizumab-Containing Treatment or Anti-EGFR Treatment in Routine Clinical Practice, start of first-line therapy to death from any cause, or to last date known that participant is alive (retrospective data collection over approximately 9 years)
