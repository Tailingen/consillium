Nilotinib in TKI Resistant or Intolerant Patients With Metastatic Mucosal, Acral, or Chronically Sun Damaged Melanoma
Given the poor prognosis and limited treatment options available for patients with mucosal or acral/lentiginous melanomas who develop metastatic disease, genetic discoveries of KIT mutations in these cancers present the need to test multi-targeted kinase inhibitors with potent KIT inhibitory activity in this patient population. Imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have the potential to be effective in this patient population, but patients may develop resistance to treatment. Therefore, in this study, we propose to test nilotinib in patients with metastatic mucosal, acral, or chronically sun-damaged melanoma following treatment with another TKI.

4-month Progression-Free Survival Rate, 4-month progression-free survival rate was defined as the proportion of patients absent death or progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) before 4 months. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; Treatment continued for 12 months unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Relevant for this endpoint was disease status at 4 months.
Progression-Free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS) based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented disease progression (PD) requiring removal from the study or death. Per RECIST 1.0 criteria: progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment and long-term every 3 months until first progression, death or lost to follow-up. Mean treatment duration was 5.5 months (range 0-45; no/with CNS mets 7.4m/ 3m).|Overall Survival, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from study entry to death or date last known alive., Patients were followed long-term every 3 months until first progression, death or lost to follow-up. Median survival follow-up was 16.2 months (90%CI 11.7-17.7 months; no/with CNS mets 16.2m/ 11.7m).|Best Overall Response, Best overall response (BOR) on treatment was based on RECIST 1.0 criteria. For target lesions, complete response (CR) is complete disappearance of all target lesions and partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. CR or PR confirmation required within 4 weeks. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum LD of target lesions from smallest sum LD as reference or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable disease (SD) is neither meeting PR or PD. PD for the evaluation of non-target lesions is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. CR is disappearance of all non-target lesions., Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment and long-term every 3 months until first progression, death or lost to follow-up. Mean treatment duration was 5.5 months (range 0-45; no/with CNS mets 7.4m/ 3m).
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

\* To estimate the proportion of patients, with metastatic mucosal, acral, or chronically sun damaged melanomas, whose tumors have KIT aberrations, and who progressed or could not tolerate a KIT targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (e.g. including but not limited to imatinib mesylate, sunitinib, or dasatanib), who are alive and without progression of disease four months after beginning treatment with nilotinib.

Secondary

* To determine early evidence of biologic and clinical activity by best overall response rate.
* To estimate time to progression of disease and overall survival.
* To determine the tolerability of nilotinib.
* To evaluate the use of FDG-PET scanning in determining early biologic response to therapy.
* To correlate c-kit mutational status and amplification status with response to therapy.
* To evaluate the feasibility of nilotinib.
* To evaluate the tolerability of nilotinib in patients with brain metastases.
