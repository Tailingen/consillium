Clinical Trial of TQB2618 Injection Combined With TQB2450 Injection in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This project is a phase Ib clinical trial study evaluating the efficacy and safety of TQB2618 injection combined with TQB2450 injection in patients with advanced solid tumors, the trial plan to enroll 127 subjects, the trial design is a phase I.b dose exploration and cohort expansion clinical study, aiming to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TQB2618 injection combined with TQB2450 injection in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors, and to evaluate TQB2618 injection, Pharmacokinetic characteristics, receptor occupancy and immunogenicity characteristics of TQB2450 injection; Biomarker studies related to the mechanism of action, safety and/or pathological mechanism of efficacy have dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in Phase I, recommended dose in Phase II (RP2D), and objective response rate (ORR) in Phase II as the primary endpoints.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: TQB2618 injection and TQB2450 injection
Dose-limiting toxicity, The occurrence of severe toxicities during the first cycle of anti-cancer therapy, within the first treatment cycle for 21 days|Phase II recommended dose, Dose selection in the expansion phase, Through phase 1 completion, an average of half a year|Objective response rate, ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with progressive disease (PD) from first dose to first recorded or death from any cause of complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR) based on investigator records, Up to 12 months
Progression-free survival, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first recorded progressive disease (PD) or death from any cause., Up to 12 months|Disease control rate, The time when participants first achieved full or partial remission of disease progression., Up to 12 months|Duration of remission, The time from the start of the first evaluation of the tumor as Complete Response or Partial Response to the first assessment as Progressive Disease or death from any cause., Up to 12 months|Overall survival, OS is defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Participants who did not die at the end of the extended follow-up period, or who lost follow-up during the study, were reviewed on the last date known to be alive., Up to 18 months|Maximum plasma drug concentration, Maximum plasma drug concentration ia a pharmacokinetic parameter, 1 hour before and 30 minutes after TQB2450 injection administration; 30 minutes, 4, 8, 24, 48, 144, 312 hours after TQB2618 injection administration of cycle 1; 30 minutes after TQB2618 injection administration of cycle 2-8. Each cycle is 21 days.|Immunogenicity, Immunogenicity is evaluated by the detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) after administration, Each cycle is 21 days. 1 hour before administration of cycles 1, 2, 4, and 8, 1 hour before administration at the start of every 6 cycles thereafter; 30 and 90 days after the last dose.|Free Tim3 receptors on the surface of CD3+ T cells, TIM-3 receptor mass (RO) of TQB2618 on human immune cell membranes, before and 30 minutes after the end of administration of per cycle during cycles 1-8; when patients withdrawn from the group due to Progression Disease|Adverse events (AEs), Occurrence rate of all adverse events, Up to 28 days after last dose or the initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, whichever comes first
