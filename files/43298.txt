Demonstration of a Novel Approach Using Surface-Image Guidance to Improve Delivery of Breast Radiotherapy
The first goal of this project is to validate the superiority of semi-permanent marks used in conjunction with specialized light-based surface imaging (SIGRT) in an effort to phase out the use of permanent tattoos for the investigator's patients. The secondary goal of this project is to validate the superiority of specialized light-based surface imaging for daily radiation set-up compared to standard-of-care imaging methods using ionizing radiation, such as weekly port films or cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans during a radiation therapy course for breast cancer.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Temporary skin markings|OTHER: Surface imaging
Position measurement from Port films., Distance measured (centimeters) from the planned position of radiotherapy to the actual position of radiotherapy on weekly port films. Port films are x-rays of the treatment field which are done to ensure that the patient and the radiation machine are properly aligned to each other. Weekly port films will be obtained for the duration of radiation treatment, which will be from three to five weeks in length., Once weekly for 3 weeks up to 5 weeks
This study uses surface imaging for breast patients to standardize or normalize planning position \& minimize variability of port films thus reducing systematic error. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of using surface imaging to combine an ideally gated treatment planning CT and verification images timed to the breathing cycle, quantified as the total within-subject variation of the measured location relative to current methods of radiation delivery not using this approach. The secondary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of specialized light-based surface imaging for daily radiation set-up without tattoos compared to standard-of-care methods with regard to the total within-subject variation of the measured location determined by weekly port films during a course of radiation for breast cancer.
