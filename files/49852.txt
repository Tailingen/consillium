Study of Belzutifan (MK-6482) Plus Fulvestrant for ER+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer (MK-6482-029/LITESPARK-029)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of belzutifan (MK-6482) plus fulvestrant compared to everolimus plus endocrine therapy (ET) (investigator's choice of fulvestrant or exemestane) in adults with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) unresectable metastatic breast cancer. There is no formal hypothesis testing in this study.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Belzutifan|DRUG: Fulvestrant|DRUG: Everolimus|DRUG: Exemestane
Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) based on blinded independent central review (BICR) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Up to approximately 29 months
Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 6 months, PFS data will be cumulated to a certain cut-off date and the analysis will be performed via Kaplan-Meier approach to estimate the PFS rate at 6 months using the entire PFS data up to the cut-off date. The cut-off date is event-driven and estimated to be approximately 28 months., Up to approximately 29 months|Progression-free Survival (PFS) at 12 months, PFS data will be cumulated to a certain cut-off date and the analysis will be performed via Kaplan-Meier approach to estimate the PFS rate at 12 months using the entire PFS data up to the cut-off date. The cut-off date is event-driven and estimated to be approximately 28 months., Up to approximately 29 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause., Up to approximately 29 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have achieved confirmed Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to approximately 29 months|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants who have CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, or stable disease (SD: Neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study) for â‰¥24 weeks per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR., Up to approximately 29 months|Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 46 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due To an AE, An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention., Up to approximately 46 months
