Study of the Concentration-effect Relationship of Nivolumab in Patients With Kidney or Lung Cancer
To assess the relationship between progression free survival of patients treated with nivolumab for metastatic non small cell lung carcinoma or a metastatic renal cell carcinoma and nivolumab blood concentration.

Collection of standard data prospectively.
Kidney Cancer|Lung Cancer
OTHER: Pharmacokinetic of Nivolumab
Progression free survival, Association between nivolumab concentration and progression free survival : time from start of nivolumab treatment to progression, Up to one year
Overall survival, Association between nivolumab concentration and overall survival : time from start of nivolumab treatment to death, Up to one year|Target concentration, Determination of nivolumab concentration associated with clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease), 14 days|Side effects, Association between nivolumab residual concentration and side effects, 14 days|Nivolumab PK parameters : distribution volume, Nivolumab residual concentrations will be measured each 14 days until the end of the study (up to one year)., Baseline up to one year|Nivolumab PK parameters : clearance, Nivolumab residual concentrations will be measured each 14 days until the end of the study (up to one year)., Baseline up to one year
Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of non small cell lung carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Huge variability exists between patients treated by nivolumab in terms of efficacy and side effects. Like others monoclonal antibodies, a relation between concentration and effects of nivolumab may exist.

The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between blood concentration of nivolumab and progression free survival, overall survival and side effects on the one hand, and on the other to describe pharmacokinetic of nivolumab
