Chemoradiotherapy With Targeted Immunotherapy in Pediatric Lymphoma
The addition of targeted immunotherapy will be safe and well tolerated and facilitate the reduction of anthracycline exposure while preserving lymphoma disease control in children, adolescents and young adults (CAYA) with mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (MB-NHL) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).

Grade 3 and 4 Adverse Events related to polatuzumab vedotin, to evaluate the DLTs of polatuzumab vedotin (Pv) in combination with rituximab (RTX) containing French-American-British (FAB) chemoimmunotherapy, with reduced dose anthracycline to MB-NHL, 1 year|Grade 3 and 4 Adverse events related to nivolumab, To evaluate the DLTs of nivolumab to the backbone of reduced toxicity chemoimmunotherapy with brentuximab vedotin (Bv), vinblastine, dacarbazine and rituximab, with reduced dose anthracycline in intermediate and high risk cHL, 1 year
The primary objective is 1) to determine feasibility and safety, as defined by dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), of adding polatuzumab vedotin (Pv) in combination with rituximab (RTX) containing French-American-British (FAB) chemoimmunotherapy, with reduced dose anthracycline, in CAYA with intermediate and high risk newly diagnosed MB-NHL; 2) To define the feasibility and safety, as defined by DLTs, of the addition of nivolumab to the backbone of reduced toxicity chemoimmunotherapy with brentuximab vedotin (Bv), vinblastine, dacarbazine and rituximab, with reduced dose anthracycline, in CAYA with newly diagnosed intermediate and high risk cHL.
