The Effect of Breast Cancer and Breast Self-Examination
Background: Somali women face extremely high mortality and incidence rates for breast cancer (BC). One of the suggested techniques for screening for breast cancer early detection is breast self-examination, or BSE. Studies have revealed that Somalian women, however, lack sufficient understanding and practice about BC and BSE. In this study, female students at a university in Mogadishu, Somalia, had their knowledge, attitudes, health beliefs, and BSE practices evaluated with reference to the effects of health belief model-based health education addressing BC and BSE.

Methods: It was conducted as a randomized controlled study on 86 female university students in Mogadishu, Somalia, between September 2021 and June 2022. Randomization was used to assign participants to the intervention group (n = 43) and control group (n = 43). Data were gathered using two instruments: a self-administered questionnaire was the first tool used to gather information on individuals\&#39; sociodemographic and level of awareness about BC and BSE. The health belief model scale is the second instrument. A validated checklist and a modified structured questionnaire were used to gather data. Subsequently, the students in the experimental group took part in the three 90-minute training sessions that made up the program. The control group did not receive any intervention. Three months later, further student data were gathered. Data analysis was performed using IBM-SPSS software version 20, descriptive and inferential statistical tests (T-test, chi-square, repeated measures).

post intervention, After the training, a post-test was administered to the experimental and control groups. Data were collected with "Sociodemographic Questionnaire", "Champion's health Belief Model Scale". Sociodemographic Questionnaire: This survey includes questions such as the age of the students, the education level of the mother and father, family income level, and family history of breast cancer. There were also 7 questions about students' breast cancer and breast self-examination. Champion's health Belief Model Scale: The 42-item Champion Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS) was refined in subsequent research (1993, 1997, 1999) and was created by Victoria Champion in 1984 to assess women's attitudes and beliefs regarding breast cancer and breast self-examination. CHBMS has 6 subscales., 3 months
