Efficacy and Safety of QL1101 and Avastin® Respectively Combined With Paclitaxel and Carboplatin in the First-line Treatment of Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The objective of this study is to assess the similarity between QL1101 and Avastin® respectively combined with chemotherapy in terms of efficacy and safety in patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The study intends to include first-line patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and uses QL1101 combined with basic chemotherapy CP (paclitaxel + carboplatin). The regimen is consistent with the usage and dosage of Avastin® at home and abroad indicated for the treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.
Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: QL1101|DRUG: Avastin®|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Carboplatin
Objective response rate, The actual endpoint is best response seen during the study, 18 weeks
Disease control rate, DOR is defined as the time from the first tumor evaluation as CR or PR to the first evaluation as PD or death, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization and grouping to patient death due to various causes. For patients who are lost to follow-up, the date when they were contacted for the last time will be used as the cut off time., 18 months after enrollment and randomization of the last case|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization and grouping to PD or death., 18 months after enrollment and randomization of the last case|Treatment-emergent adverse events, Assessment following therapy with either QL1101 or avastin, 18 weeks
The study is a randomized, double-blind, positive drug-controlled, multi-center Phase III study. It is planned to enroll 512 treatment-naïve patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subjects are randomized into the QL1101 combined with paclitaxel/carboplatin or Avastin® combined with paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment group by a ratio of 1:1, and stratified by age (≥65 years, \<65 years), sex (male, female) and EGFR subtype (sensitive mutation type, wild type).
