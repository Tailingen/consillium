The Research of French PaRole OncO : A Peer Supported Program for Cancer Patients
Peer support is a valuable mode of accompaniment between individuals who are facing or have faced similar challenging life experiences. In this context, a patient advisor (PA) shares their experiential knowledge, derived from living with a disease, to offer emotional, experiential, and informational support to other patients. This PA intervention represents an innovative form of support for oncology patients, potentially addressing their needs more comprehensively throughout the care pathway by integrating psychosocial dimensions into the support approach.

The present pilot study aims to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of the peer-to-peer support program "PaRole OncO France" in the oncology setting. The study will focus on:

1. Evaluating clinical and psychosocial parameters
2. Utilizing an in-depth multiple case study approach This research seeks to provide insights into how peer support can enhance the overall care experience for oncology patients, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and a more holistic approach to cancer care.
