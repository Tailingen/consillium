Study of Autologous Tumor Lysate-pulsed D-CIK Combined With Chemotherapy for Gastric Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of chemotherapy combined with autologous tumor Lysate-pulsed dendritic with cytokine-induced killer cell (Ag-D-CIK) for gastric cancer.

DRUG: Chemotherapy|BIOLOGICAL: Ag-D-CIK
Progress-free survival, 3 years
Overall survival, 3 years|Quality of life (QOL), 3 years|Phenotypic analysis of T cells, The number of CD3+ (or CD8+ or CD4+ or CD56+) T cell, 1 years|Severity of adverse events, According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events（NCI-CTCAE), 1 years
40 patients with stage Ⅰ～Ⅲ Gastric Cancer,who had received surgery and kept their tumor tissue,will be randomly divided into group A（receive Ag-D-CIK treatment and chemotherapy) or group B（just receive chemotherapy),and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of Ag-D-CIK treatment (every 1 months) and 4 cycles of chemotherapy (every 2 weeks).Patients in group B will receive only 4 cycles chemotherapy（every 2 weeks).
