PROSENZA: Prospective Multi-Centre Study of Prognostic Factors in mCRPC Patients Treated With Enzalutamide.
PROSENZA is a prospective multicentre observational study in metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC), designed to explore prognostic biomarkers in patients undergoing treatment with enzalutamide
Advanced Prostate Cancer|Castration Resistant|Enzalutamide
To assess the prognostic value for overall survival of androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (AR-V7) and/or AR amplification in mCRPC patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months
To analyze the correlation between biochemical and/or radiological response with AR-V7 expression and/or AR amplification in mCRPC patients treated with Enzalutamide., Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To assess AR-V7 expression and/or AR amplification changes before and after enzalutamide treatment, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To explore the correlation between AR-V7 expression and AR amplification with other biomarkers as testosterone serum levels, PTEN loss or TMPRSS-ERG fusions in mCRPC patients treated with Enzalutamide, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To validate the prognostic value of classical nomograms designed to assess the outcomes of mCRPC patients in these patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months
To validate the independent prognostic value of the gene-expression signature from peripheral blood described by Olmos et al (Lancet Oncol 2012) on overall survival of mCRPC patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months|To correlate the presence of somatic and/or germinal mutations with the outcomes of these patients, Initially 48 months, currently 60 months
This study is a prospective biomarker study of patients with mCRPC undergoing treatment with enzalutamide as standard of care treatment. The participants will undergo serial pre- and post-therapy blood collection for biomarker analysis as part of the primary objective of the study.
