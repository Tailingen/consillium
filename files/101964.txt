This clinical trial will investigate the safety and activity of MEN1309 in patients with CD205-positive metastatic solid tumors and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma who have tried other types of treatment for cancer without adequate response (or the cancer came back). CD205 is a protein present in certain types of cancer.

This is a Phase I study, which means that it is designed to look at several dose levels of a study drug in small groups of patients to find the dose that is well-tolerated and suitable to be administered in subsequent clinical trials in patients. The clinical trial is also looking at the effectiveness of the study drug. This is the first time the study drug will be given in humans.

The clinical trial consists of two sequential parts:

* Part 1 involves patients with CD205-positive metastatic solid tumors and the main purpose of this part of the clinical trial is to determine the highest dose of the study drug that can be used safely in these type of cancers.
* Part 2 involves patients with CD205-positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and will test doses of MEN1309 which have demonstrated to be adequately tolerated in patients with solid tumors.

Patients participating to the clinical trial will take the study drug as intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks. The clinical trial includes four periods: a pre-screening period (to check if tumor is positive for CD205), a screening period (to check whether the participation to the clinical trial is right for patient), a treatment period (when patient receives the study drug), and a follow-up period (to check the health status of the patient after stopping study treatment).
