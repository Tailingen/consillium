A Trial of CMNa Combined With Definitive Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced ESCC
This is a perspective, multicenter,randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment with CMNa combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell esophageal carcinoma . Analyses of primary objective (ORR) will be done as defined in the protocol.
Esophageal Neoplasms
DRUG: Sodium Glycididazole|DRUG: Placebo
Objective response rate, 3 months
Overall survival, 36 months|Progression free survival, 36 months
The primary end point of this study is objective response rate.The secondary end point is OS, PFS and the safty of drug. The primary hypothesis is the CMNa will improve ORR and thus improve OS, PFS. Assuming bilateral a=0.05, statistical power of 80%.The total sample size is 104 cases.
