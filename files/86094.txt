Ultrasound Imaging in Finding Prostate Cancer in Patients Undergoing Surgery
This pilot clinical trial studies ultrasound imaging in finding prostate cancer in patients undergoing surgery. Diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound imaging, may help find and diagnose prostate cancer. This study will serve as an analysis of the Histo-Scanning technology for the purpose of determining its ability to identify sites of prostate cancer at the time of prostate ultrasound.
