A Registry of Sipuleucel-T Therapy in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to further quantify the risk of cerebrovascular events (CVEs) following sipuleucel-T (PROVENGEÂ®) therapy, and to follow all subjects for survival.
Advanced Prostate Cancer|Prostatic Neoplasms
BIOLOGICAL: sipuleucel-T
To Further Quantify the Risk of Cerebrovascular Events Following Sipuleucel-T Therapy for All Subjects, The incidence rate of CVEs (cardiovascular events) was estimated as the number of new events per 100 patient years of follow-up in the overall sample of men with advanced-stage or metastatic prostate cancer and in men with or without castration., Every 3 months for a minimum of 3 years
Survival, To quantify survival by estimating the median time of survival in all subjects using the Kaplan-Meier method., Every 3 months for a minimum of 3 years
Subjects will receive product as described in the sipuleucel-T approved label. The registry will be strictly observational and thus no additional clinical visits or laboratory tests will be conducted beyond normal clinical practice. Investigators will be asked to record information that becomes available in the normal course of clinical management.
