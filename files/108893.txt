Continuous Glucose Monitoring Profile Description Under Alpelisib treAtment in Patients With Advanced bREast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to describe the glycemic profile of postmenopausal women treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant using a continuous blood sugar monitoring device (FreeStyle Libre Pro) over 14 days
Breast Cancer|Diabetes
DEVICE: FreeStyle Libre Pro
Incidence rate of hyperglycemia, In percentage, measured before breakfast and diner (fasting blood glucose).

Hyperglycemia defined as follows:

* if diabetes de novo:

  * capillar or interstitial fasting blood glucose ≥ 1,50 g/L,
  * OR postprandial interstitial glucose ≥ 2 g/L
  * OR glucose monitoring indicator ≥ 6,5%
* if worsening pre-existing diabetes:

  * increased capillar or interstitial fasting blood glucose ≥ 0,50 g/L compared to average fasting blood glucose at J-3, J-2 and J-1
  * AND postprandial interstitial glucose ≥ + 1,00 g/L compared to average fasting blood glucose at J-3, J-2 et J-1 OR average blood glucose ≥ +0,50 g/L, Day 14
AAREN is a monocentric prospective study monitoring glycemic profile in patients treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant. Patients will wear a noninvasive glucose monitoring sensor, the Freestyle Libre Pro for a 14 day period. Forty patients will be enrolled.
