Patients Who Underwent Thyroid Ultrasonography at Our Institution Were Selected for Shear Wave Elastography of Thyroid Nodules, and the Maximum and Mean Values of the Modulus of Elasticity of the Nodules in Transverse and Longitudinal Sections Were Analyzed.
The objective of this observational study was to evaluate the effect of transverse and longitudinal sections on the measurement of thyroid nodule stiffness by shear wave elastography. The main questions it aims to answer are: (i) to compare the diagnostic efficacy of different section orientations of shear wave elastography for the diagnosis of benign and malignant thyroid nodules; (ii) to analyze the correlation between the two orientations of transverse and longitudinal sections of shear wave elastography; and (iii) to compare the reliability and consistency of the two orientations of transverse and longitudinal sections of shear wave elastography for the diagnosis of thyroid nodules. Participants will undergo routine ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland and shear wave elastography, and the measured modulus of elasticity of the nodules in both transverse and longitudinal sections will be recorded.

elastic modulus values, the maximum value of elastic modulus (Emax) and the average value of elastic modulus (Emean) of benign and malignant nodules in both longitudinal and transverse sections, The elastic modulus values of different sections were recorded immediately after the patients underwent routine ultrasound and shear wave elastography and the recorded results were saved.
