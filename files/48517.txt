Recruitment Rate -Feasibility, The study will be deemed feasible if \>/= 60% of eligible participants are enrolled, Up to 8 months|Retention Rate - Feasibility, The study will be deemed feasible if \>/=70% of participants complete the post-intervention questionnaire, at 12 weeks|Adherence - Feasibility, The study will be deemed feasible if average attendance is \>/=4 weeks of sessions (out of 6) for MONITOR arm, at 12 weeks
Participant Satisfaction with Overall Program- Acceptability, The study will be deemed acceptable based on the satisfaction score on follow-up survey. The follow-up survey uses open-ended and likert-style questions regarding 1) relevance and applicability of the MONITOR intervention content and objective/subjective data collection methods; 2) intervention length and timing; and 3) barriers/facilitators to participation and retention. On a 5-point Lkert-type scale, a(1) =strongly agree and e(5)=strongly disagree. Participant Satisfaction with Overall Program is determined by a score \>/=3 on a 5-point scale., at 12 weeks|Participant intent to continue using skills- Acceptability, The study will be deemed acceptable based on the satisfaction score on follow-up survey. The follow-up survey uses open-ended and likert-style questions regarding 1) relevance and applicability of the MONITOR intervention content and objective/subjective data collection methods; 2) intervention length and timing; and 3) barriers/facilitators to participation and retention. On a 5-point Lkert-type scale, a(1) =strongly agree and e(5)=strongly disagree. Participant intent to continue using skills- is determined by a score \>/=3 on a 5-point scale., at 12 weeks|Participant perception of utility of knowledge gained - Acceptability, The study will be deemed acceptable based on the satisfaction score on follow-up survey. The follow-up survey uses open-ended and likert-style questions regarding 1) relevance and applicability of the MONITOR intervention content and objective/subjective data collection methods; 2) intervention length and timing; and 3) barriers/facilitators to participation and retention.

Treatment Effect - Quality of Life, Quality of Life will be measured using the FACT-Hep questionnaire. Participants will take the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Hepatobiliary Cancer Symptom 8 Item Version (FHSI) questionnaire which uses a 5-point likert-type scale, 0=not at all and 4=Very much. A lower total score indicates better quality of life., at Baseline, and at 6 and 12 weeks
