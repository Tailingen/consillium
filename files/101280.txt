Non-Interventional Registry Study to Evaluate the Effectiveness of TheraSphere® in the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
The purpose of this registry study is to gather effectiveness, QoL, safety and procedural information on TheraSphere® for the treatment of participants with Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (iCC) and liver metastases for colon cancer (mCRC) in real world clinical practice settings in France.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
DEVICE: TheraSphere
Overall Survival (OS), OS will be calculated as the interval between treatment administration and the date of death for any cause, opposition to data collection, or study termination, whichever occurs first., Treatment (Day 1) up to participant's death, opposition to data collection, or study termination (up to Year 6)|QoL Measurements Using FACT-HEP Questionnaire Before and After Treatment, Quality of Life (QoL) will be assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-HEP) questionnaire prior to treatment on Day 1, every 2 to 4 months post treatment (follow up visits), and every standard of care (SOC) visit after Month 12 until the participant's death, opposition to data collection, study withdraw for any cause, or study termination. The FACT-Hep Questionnaire uses participant-reported outcome (PRO) scores. QoL scores of each domain at each time-point and their differences from baseline will be summarised. A deterioration in QoL is defined as a 7-point decline in the total score or death, whichever comes first. The time to deterioration in QoL will be calculated as the interval between first date of TheraSphere® treatment and deterioration in QoL. The higher the score, the better the QoL, with a range 0-180., Treatment (Day 1), every 2 to 4 months Post Treatment (maximum treatment time = up to Day 28), and SOC visits after Month 12 until up to participant's death, opposition to data collection, study withdraw for any cause, or study termination (up to Year 6)

TheraSphere is a radioembolic therapeutic device used in the treatment of liver cancers. The goal of the registry study is to collect prospectively: participant description, treatment goal, treatment description, treatment results, safety, quality of life and survival data to ultimately demonstrate that TheraSphere treatment meets the claims that led to the reimbursement in France. The registry study is also an opportunity to improve the proper use of the device by team training especially for the personalized dosimetry treatment approach.

Clinical data will be collected and held in a secured, validated system and can be downloaded by Biocomplatibles UK Ltd Data Management on an ongoing basis. Data verification will be performed by Biocompatibles UK Ltd Data Management and data validation checks will be created by the validated data system (with the Biocompatibles UK Ltd team performing User Acceptance Testing on them before they go live). Adverse Events and concomitant diseases will be coded according to the version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) agreed with Biocompatibles UK Ltd. Concomitant medications will be coded using the version of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Drug dictionary agreed with the validated data system.

Appropriate study plans implemented to manage all aspects of the trial to ensure quality and integrity of the data collection.
