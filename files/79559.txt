Efficacy, Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral LDE225 in Treatment of Patients With Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome (NBCCS)
This was a phase II, double-blind, randomized, proof-of-concept, dose-ranging trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of oral LDE225 in treatment of adult patients with NBCCS. This was an exploratory study designed to demonstrate preliminary efficacy of LDE225 in this indication. This study included a Screening period of approximately 4 weeks, treatment period duration of 12 weeks with initial follow-up of approximately 6-8 weeks followed by a long-term follow-up period.

Clinical Clearance Assessment of Main Target Basal Cell Carcinomas (BCCs), The clinical response of the main target (and secondary target, as appropriate) BCC(s) to treatment was evaluated using the following 6-point scale comparing the assessment at the visit to the clinical presentation at Baseline: 0 = Worsening, 1 = No change, 2 = Slight clearance (1-25% improvement), 3 = Moderate clearance (26-75% improvement), 4 = Marked clearance (76-99% improvement),5 = Complete clearance (100% improvement) Complete clearance was defined as no clinical residual signs of carcinoma, as evaluated by the Investigator at a post-Baseline visit, with the exception of post-inflammatory changes such as minimal residual erythema or residual hyper-pigmentation or hypo-pigmentation or residual scarring., Day 113
Histological Clearance Assessment of Main Target BCCs, The main (and secondary, if appropriate) target BCC tumor area(s) was/were excised surgically and sent to a central laboratory for histological examination., day 113|Measure: Disease Burden by BCC Tumor Counts, BCC tumor counts were performed separately for five body regions: head and neck, trunk back, trunk front (including axillae and groin), upper extremities and lower extremities (including buttocks). During the counting, the BCC tumors, were categorized upon inspection by their longest diameter measurement (\<10 mm, 10-19 mm, 20-29 mm, and \>+30mm), and also by the type of BCC (superficial, nodular, other). The counts for all of the BCC type and size categories were determined (or estimated if many small lesions) for each body region. The body region counts were summated to provide the overall BCC tumor count., Baseline, day 85, and day 113
