Chemoradiotherapy Followed by Surgery for Advanced Paranasal Sinus Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy pre-operatively in patients with advanced paranasal sinus cancer. The main objectives of this study are: 1) to measure the rate of complete response to preoperative chemoradiation and 2) to study the efficacy of combining preoperative chemoradiation and surgery in terms of local control of the cancer two years post treatment.
Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms
DRUG: cisplatin|PROCEDURE: targeted radiation therapy|PROCEDURE: tumor resection
Local control of cancer at two years post treatment|Response to preoperative chemoradiation
Estimation of the proportion of the inoperable tumors which become operable after chemoradiation|Identification of factors that are associated with inoperability|Estimation of the overall survival and cumulative incidence of death due to disease at 2 years|Determination of the acute and long-term toxicity, particularly ophthalmologic complications, and surgical morbidity associated with this regimen|Measurement of the accuracy of conventional imaging techniques (CT, MRI) compared with the addition of PET imaging in predicting the response to chemoradiation therapy.
