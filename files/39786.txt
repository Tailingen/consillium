This open-label, multicenter, phase 1b/2 trial is conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary activity in patients with advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. This trial includes two parts: the phase 1b dose escalation part and the phase 2 dose expansion part.

In the dose escalation part with a standard 3+3 design, IMM01 (1.0, 1.5, 2.0 mg/kg) was administered once a week and tislelizumab (200mg) was administered once every 3 weeks.

In the dose expansion part, IMM01 (the dose determined in the dose escalation part) was administered once a week and tislelizumab (200mg) was administered once every 3 weeks. And the cohorts includes HNSCC, NSCLC, SCLC, R/R cHL and others.
