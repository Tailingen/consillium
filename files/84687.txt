Efficacy and Safety of Niraparib Combined With Bevacizumab in Platinum Refractory/Resistant Recurrent Ovarian Cancer
Niraparib is an oral, potent and highly selective PARP1/2 inhibitor. It can be used as a single drug in HRD positive ovarian cancer patients for multi-line therapy. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor angiogenesis and is also recommended for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. Clinical studies showed that niraparib combined with bevacizumab could significantly prolong progression free survival of platinum sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. We intend to conduct a single-arm, prospective, open-label, phase II study to observe the efficacy and safety of niraparib combined with bevacizumab in the treatment of FIGO III/IV platinum refractory/resistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. The results are expected to provide more effective and precise treatment for platinum resistant recurrent/refractory ovarian cancer patients.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by RECIST1.1., at 6 months
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time in months from the date of first study drug administration to the date of first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death as assessed by RECIST1.1., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease control rate is defined as the proportion of participants achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST1.1., at 6 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first date of response until the date of first documented progression., Through study completion, an average of 1 year|Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, To further describe safety and assess toxicities encountered with the use of the proposed treatment regimen in participants., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
The study is a single-arm, prospective, open-label, phase II study to observe the efficacy and safety of niraparib combined with bevacizumab in the treatment of FIGO III/IV platinum refractory/resistant ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer.The primary end point is the objective response rate, and the secondary end points are progression free survival, duration of remission, disease control rate and safety. We also stratified analysis the level of tumor load, the status of BRCA and HRD on the efficacy and safety.
