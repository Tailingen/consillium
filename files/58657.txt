Tazemetostat and Pembrolizumab in Patients With Pembrolizumab- or Nivolumab-Resistant, Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous-Cell Carcinoma
The primary aim of the phase 1 portion of the trial is to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of tazemetostat in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic (RM) head and neck cancer.

The primary aim of the phase 2 portion of the trial is to establish the proportion of patients with pembrolizumab- or nivolumab-resistant, PD-L1 positive, RM head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who achieve an objective tumor response to tazemetostat and pembrolizumab.
Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Tazemetostat|DRUG: Pembrolizumab
Recommended phase 2 dose of tazemetostat in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab (Phase I only), Completion of cycle 1 for all phase I participants (estimated to be 9 months)|Objective response rate (ORR) assessed by iRECIST (Phase 2 only), -ORR: complete or partial response achieved as best response divided by those participants who have received a response evaluation (scan), Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 5 months)
Incidence of adverse events, -The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting., From start of treatment through 28 days post-treatment (estimated to be 6 months)|Duration of response (DOR), -Response duration will be measured from the time measurement criteria for CR/PR or iCR/iPR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded on study (including baseline)., Through completion of treatment (estimated to be 5 months)|Progression-free survival (PFS), -PFS is defined as the time from date of study enrollment to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. The patients alive, without progression, are censored at the last follow-up., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 17 months)|Overall survival (OS), -OS is defined as the time from the date of treatment to the date of death, censored at the last follow-up otherwise., Through completion of follow-up (estimated to be 17 months)
