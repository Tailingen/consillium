Cancer Vaccine Targeting Brachyury Protein in Tumors
Background:

- Cancer vaccines are being developed to help teach the body's immune system to attack and destroy cancer cells. A new vaccine being tested targets Brachyury protein. This protein is present in some tumor cells, and it can help tumor cells spread to other parts of the body. Researchers want to see whether the new Brachyury protein vaccine can help treat people with advanced carcinomas.

Objectives:

- To test the safety and effectiveness of a cancer vaccine that targets Brachyury protein in tumor cells.

Eligibility:

* Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced cancers that have not responded or are no longer responding to standard treatments.
* Because the vaccine is made with yeast, people with yeast allergies will not be eligible.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Imaging studies will be used to examine the cancer. Heart and thyroid function tests will be conducted. Blood and urine samples will also be collected.
* Participants will receive vaccine injections every 2 weeks, for a total of seven visits. After seven visits, if the cancer has shrunk or stopped growing, participants will continue to have the vaccine about once a month.
* Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Other tests will be given as directed by the study doctors. Some participants will have apheresis to collect additional blood cells for study.
* Participants will continue to receive the vaccine as long the tumor does not start growing again and there are no serious side effects....

A serious adverse event is an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that results in death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, hospitalization, disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect or important medical events that jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the previous outcomes mentioned. A non-serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence., 4 years and 25 days

Partial response is ≥30% decrease in the sum of greatest diameters/no new lesions. Progressive disease is ≥20% increase in the sum of greatest diameters/new lesions.

Background:

* Vaccines based on recombinant heat inactivated yeast have been shown to be immunogenic and well tolerated in animals and humans.
* Using a computer-based differential display analysis tool to conduct global comparison of expressed sequence tag (EST) clusters in the Unigene database, the gene encoding for the transcription factor Brachyury was identified as highly represented in tumor-derived libraries and rarely observed in normal tissue-derived libraries. By using reverse-transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), investigators in the LTIB have identified the overexpression of Brachyury in gastrointestinal, bladder, kidney, ovary, uterus, and testicular carcinomas. Similar studies also found over-expression of Brachyury mRNA in cell lines of lung, colon and prostate cancers, but not in the majority of normal tissues tested, with the exception of expression in the testis, thyroid and low levels of expression in B cells pooled from multiple normal donors.
* Brachyury is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, characterized by a highly conserved DNA-binding domain designated as T-domain. Data indicates that the transcription factor Brachyury confers on the tumor cells a mesenchymal phenotype, as well as migratory and invasive abilities and enhances tumor cell progression.
* A murine model of MC38 cells engineered to over express human Brachyury gene has demonstrated increased metastatic potential of Brachyury over-expressing MC38 cells.
* Brachyury specific T cells can lyse human cancer cells expressing Brachyury in an MHC restricted manner.
* GI-6301 (Yeast-Brachyury vaccine) has been tested in vitro and in the mouse model. These studies showed Brachyury-specific T cell responses and decreased metastasis in mice treated with vaccine.
* An ongoing study of a Hepatitis B vaccine (GS-4774) using the yeast platform (heat killed Saccharomyces cerevisiae) indicated safety of 80 YU dose (4 injection sites at 20 YU injections per site).

Objectives:

-The primary objectives are to:

* Determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of GI-6301 (Yeast-Brachyury vaccine) a heat-killed yeast-based vaccine
* Determine in an expanded cohort if a significant change in Brachyury specific T cells will be detectable post vaccine.

Eligibility:

* Adults with histologically proven metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors for which standard curative or palliative measures are no longer effective. Efforts will be made, as much as possible, to enroll patients with tumor types with known increased expression of Brachyury (such as lung, breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic or chordoma).
* Adequate organ function as defined by liver, kidney, and hematologic laboratory testing.
* Patients with acquired immune defects, systemic autoimmune disease, concurrent use of steroids, pericardial mass \> 1 cm, chronic infections, concurrent tricyclic antidepressant therapy, or allergy to yeast or yeast-based products will be excluded.

Design:

* This is an open label, phase I trial with sequential dose escalation cohorts of patients (3-6 patients per dose cohort) for 3 doses of GI-6301 (Yeast-Brachyury vaccine).
* GI-6301 (Yeast-Brachyury vaccine) will be administered subcutaneously at 4 sites biweekly for 7 visits (day 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85), then monthly until patients meet off-study criteria

(patients who have been on study for one year or more and have had stable disease or better (PR, CR) have the option to receive vaccine once every 3 months instead of monthly).

* All patients on a given dose level will have completed 28 days on-study without DLT before enrollment can begin on the next dose level or on the expansion phase (see statistical analysis section).
* Expansion Phase: 10 additional patients will be enrolled on the MTD dose level (or the highest dose level explored in the event that a true MTD is not reached), receiving the same treatment regimen, to assess for immunologic responses and clinical responses.
* Amended dose escalation: 10 patients will be enrolled at an additional dose level (80 YU per dose, 4 injection sites at 20 YU per site) to determine the safety of this dose level.
* Up to 33 total patients may be required to complete enrollment of this study.
