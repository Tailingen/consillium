A Study to Evaluate U3-1402 in Subjects With Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
This study is designed to primarily evaluate the safety and efficacy of U3-1402 in participants with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy and will explore clinical benefit according to human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) tumor expression level in otherwise refractory tumors.
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
DRUG: Patritumab Deruxtecan
Objective Response Rate (ORR) As Assessed By Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) Following Administration of U3-1402 In Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, ORR defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as assessed by blinded independent central review. CR was defined as a disappearance of all lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesion based on RECIST v1.1., From Baseline (Day 0) to data cut off (up to approximately 16.5 months)
Duration of Response (DoR) As Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) and Investigator Following Administration of U3-1402 In Participants With Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer, DoR defined as the time from the first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of disease progression or death due to any cause.

A TEAE was defined as an AE with a start or worsening date during the on-treatment period. An SAE was an AE that resulted in death, was life threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event., From Baseline (Day 0) to data cut off (up to approximately 16.5 months)|Number of Participants Who Are Anti-Drug Antibody (ADA)-Positive (Baseline and Post-Baseline), Blood samples were collected to assess the immunogenicity of U3-1402., At Baseline, and post-Baseline.

There will be 2 cohorts with enrollment in 2 parts. Participants will be treated on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (every 3 weeks) with U3-1402 5.6 mg/kg intravenous (IV). The estimated treatment period is approximately 8 months and the follow-up period is approximately 4 months.
