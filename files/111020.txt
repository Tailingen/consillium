A Study of Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of ATG-008 for Advanced Solid Tumors (BUNCH)
This is a single-arm and open-label study of ATG-008 for the Treatment of Patients With advanced Solid Tumors harboring NFE 2L2, STK11, RICTOR or other specific genetic alterationts
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: ATG-008 30 mg, orally, QD, each 4 week (28-day) a cycle
ORR, Percentage of subjects with PR, or CR, 19 months
DOR, Duration of time from first occurrence of CR or PR until the first date that disease progression is objectively documented, 19 months|DCR, Proportion of patients who achieve CR, PR, or SD for a minimum of 4 weeks, following the first dose of study drug (i.e., CR+PR+SD), 19 months|OS, Duration of time from the first dose of study drug until death due to any cause, 19 months|PFS, Duration of time from the first dose of study drug until progression or death due to any cause, 19 months
This is a single-arm and open-label study. Approximately 10-12 patients will be enrolled per each genetic alterration group in the study. ATG-008 is the monotherapy for advanced solid tumors with 30mg QD. The clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of ATG-008 will be evaluated. Addtionalal dose levels may apply after the efficacy/safety and tolerabitly of 30mg QD has been accessed by Sponosor and study steering committee.
