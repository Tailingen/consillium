Study of the Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of SM88 in Patients With Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of SM88 in patients with prostate cancer
Prostate Cancer|Rising Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)
DRUG: SM88 (Cohort 1)|DRUG: SM88 (Cohort 2)
The dose limiting toxicity (DLT), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or minimum effective optimum dose of SM88, when 2 dose levels of SM88 are evaluated., During 4 days of single dose PK evaluations \[Phase 1b only\], and six 4-week treatment cycles, we will determine if patients in consecutive cohorts experience any dose limiting toxicity to determine MTD, or a complete response with no DLTs observed to determine the optimum dose., Six months
Single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of tyrosine based isomer alone and as a component of SM88 in patients with prostate cancer., After a single dose of tyrosine based isomer alone on PK Day 1, and a single dose of SM88 on PK Day 3, the plasma concentrations of tyrosine isomers in patients with prostate cancer will be assayed., Six months|Multi-dose PK of the individual isomers of tyrosine., The plasma concentrations of tyrosine isomers associated with morning and evening doses of tyrosine isomers on PK Day 1, and also associated with morning and evening doses of SM88, in patients with prostate cancer will be assayed., Six months|Multi-dose steady state PK of all 4 components of SM88 in patients with prostate cancer., After approximately 2 weeks of daily dosing of SM88, the plasma concentrations of tyrosine isomers as well as the other 3 drugs of SM88 in patients with prostate cancer will be assayed., Six months|Safety and tolerability of SM88 in patients with prostate cancer., Changes from baseline in blood work results and incidence of adverse events associated with treatment of SM88 in patients with prostate cancer., Six months|Anti-cancer activities of SM88 in patients with prostate cancer., Changes from baseline in CTCs, and PSA level per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria and radiography per RECIST 1.1 criterial, stratified by circulating tumor cells (CTC) and other blood-based markers including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total alkaline phosphatase, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urine N-telopeptide, hemoglobin, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR)., Six Months|Correlation of toxicity and efficacy with cutaneous hyperpigmentation, The incident and severity (as assessed by CTCAE v4.0) of treatment-related adverse events and anticancer activities of SM88 are correlated with the degree of cutaneous pigmentation (measured by quantitative image analysis of subject skin color). The total number of subjects with adverse events and efficacy with changes in skin pigmentation during treatment will be reported in aggregate. We will evaluate cutaneous pigmentation as a biomarker in the treatment of prostate cancer by SM88 and stratify pigmentation and known risk factors for outcome analysis., Six Months|Radiographic progression-free-survival (rPFS), Duration of survival since treatment initiation with SM88 of study subjects who are without disease progression according to radiology, stratified by PSA level, CTC, and other blood-based markers (including LDH, total alkaline phosphatase, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urine N-telopeptide, hemoglobin, and NLR)., Six Months|PSA doubling time before, during and after SM88, PSA doubling time before, during and after SM88 treatment will be compared to evaluate disease progression rate associated with SM88 treatment., Six Months|Effect of SM88 on patient-reported outcomes including quality of life (as measured by the EORTC QLQ-30 and EORTC QLQ-PR25) in patients with prostate cancer., Changes from baseline in the Quality-of-Life, as measured by EORTC QLQ-30 and QLQ-PR25, stratified by PSA level, CTC, and other blood-based markers (including LDH, total alkaline phosphatase, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urine N-telopeptide, hemoglobin, and NLR in patients with prostate cancer)., Six Months|Effect of SM88 on performance status in patients with prostate cancer., Changes from baseline in the performance status (as measured by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score) in patients with prostate cancer., Six months
Cutaneous hyperpigmentation as a biomarker in the treatment of prostate cancer by SM88., Correlation between the anti-cancer activities of SM88 vs. the degree of cutaneous pigmentation (measured by quantitative image analysis of subject skin color). The total number of subjects with efficacy and changes in skin pigmentation during treatment will be reported in aggregate. We will evaluate cutaneous pigmentation as a biomarker for the efficacy of SM88 treatment in patients with prostate cancer., Six months|Collection of lymphocyte counts as a biomarker for efficacy., The efficacy of SM88 will be correlated with lymphocyte counts. The total number of subjects with efficacy and lymphocyte counts during treatment will be reported in aggregate. We will evaluate lymphocyte counts as a biomarker for the efficacy of SM88 treatment in patients with prostate cancer., Six months|Stratification of outcome with known risk factors for prostate cancer., Stratification of anticancer activities with known risk factors for prostate cancer., Six months|Duration of time when a subsequent therapy is needed after treatment with SM88., The duration in time for another therapy due to recurrence of disease., Six months
This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalating, dose-expansion study of SM88 in patients with prostate cancer. This study includes 2 phases, a dose-escalation phase that includes PK evaluation, and a dose-expansion phase.

During the first stage, at up to 2 institutions, up to 2 cohorts of 1 to 6 patients each will be enrolled.

During the second stage, the dose selected for evaluation from the Phase 1b will be administered for a total of 30 evaluable patients (inclusive of those treated at the same dose during the dose selection phase) for 6 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or until any of the treatment discontinuation criteria are met.
