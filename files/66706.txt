Fluciclovine (18F) Imaging of Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out what a new amino acid-based PET agent, fluciclovine (18F), can tell us about breast cancer biology (how it grows and develops), and quantify the differences in fluciclovine (18F) uptake between breast cancer subtypes. This will inform further work to investigate its use in breast cancer management.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Fluciclovine
Tumour standardised uptake values (SUV) in invasive breast cancer, classified by molecular type, on fluciclovine (18F) PET imaging., From PET/CT scan commencing approx 30 seconds after fluciclovine (18F) administration
Amino acid transporter (AAT) and related growth pathway expression levels quantitatively assessed by immunohistochemistry using the H-score method, and correlated to fluciclovine (18F) uptake (SUV)., From tumour samples taken during standard of care surgery 48 hours or greater after PET/CT scan|Tumour metabolite levels characterized by fold change compared to metabolite levels in the adjacent normal tissue, and correlated to fluciclovine (18F) uptake., From tumour samples taken during standard of care surgery 48 hours or greater after PET/CT scan
