Complete Mesocolon Excision vs Locoregional Lymphadenectomy in Sigmoid Colon Cancer (CMELL)
A randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing lymphadenectomy with extended inferior mesenteric artery ligation (complete mesocolon excision: which includes lymphoma tissue from the origin of the inferior mesenteric vein) with conventional locoregional lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for sigmoid cancer.
