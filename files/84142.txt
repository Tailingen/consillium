Trial of Nivolumab as a Novel Neoadjuvant Pre-Surgical Therapy for Locally Advanced Oral Cavity Cancer
The purpose of this study is to look at the effectiveness of nivolumab in patients with oral cavity cancer (OCC) who are about to undergo surgery.
Oral Cavity SCC
DRUG: Nivolumab
Objective response rate using pathological response, Objective response rate: the sum of patients with either a pCR defined as no invasive and no in situ residuals present in the surgical specimen or partial pathologic response defined at least a 30% reduction in the size of the lesion in the surgical specimen. The reduction in size will be determined by comparing the pretreatment clinical measurements (the sum of the greatest axial measurement obtained with calipers at the time of initial evaluation) with the final pathologic measurements., Time of surgery (day 36 or day 50)
Level of Treg cells in peripheral blood using immunostaining, 1. Levels of Treg cells in pre and post treatment peripheral blood will be evaluated using immunostaining for CD4 and flow cytometric analysis of Foxp3. Differences will be calculated (absolute change and percentage change) between pre and post treatment measures., Day 1 and time of surgery (day 36 or day 50)|Level of activated T-cells in peripheral blood, 2. Levels of activated T-cells in peripheral blood will be assessed using flow cytometry for expression of CD69, IFN γ, T-bet and ICOS in CD4+ cells. Differences will be calculated (absolute change and percentage change) between pre and post treatment measures., Day 1 and time of surgery (day 36 or day 50)|Level of immune stimulatory cytokines in peripheral blood, 3. Intratumoral immune activity assessed by levels of immune stimulatory cytokines including IL-2, IFN γ, and IL-12 or inhibitory cytokine, IL10 and TGF-beta, in OCSCC tumor lysates will be measured flow cytometrically by cytokine bead array. Differences will be calculated (absolute change and percentage change) between pre and post treatment measures., Day 1 and time of surgery (day 36 or day 50)|Expression of Th1 responses in CD4+ cells from peripheral blood, Expression of IL-2 (Th1 responses) in CD4+ cells from peripheral blood of patients following PD-1 inhibition therapy will be compared between pre-treatment peripheral blood samples and post-treatment samples from the same patient., Day 1 and time of surgery (day 36 or day 50)|Expression of Th2 responses in CD4+ cells from peripheral blood, Expression of IIL 10 (Th2 responses) in CD4+ cells from peripheral blood of patients following PD-1 inhibition therapy will be compared between pre-treatment peripheral blood samples and post-treatment samples from the same patient., Day 1 and time of surgery (day 36 or day 50)|Expression of CD8+ cells expressing granzyme B (ctolytic response) from peripheral blood, 2. Expression of CD8+ cells expressing granzyme B (cytolytic response) from peripheral blood of patients following PD-1 inhibition therapy will be compared between pre-treatment peripheral blood samples and post-treatment samples from the same patient., Day 1 and time of surgery (day 36 or day 50)
OCC patients who are scheduled for surgery will be given Nivolumab prior to surgery to see if there are any changes in surgical outcomes.
