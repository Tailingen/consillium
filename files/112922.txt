Polycythemia Vera
DRUG: P1101 (Ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft)|DRUG: Ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (P1101)
Compare efficacy, safety, and tolerability of P1101 utilizing 250-350-500 mcg compared to the current labeled dosing through assessing the proportion of subjects that are in a complete hematologic response at Week 24., CHR is defined as hematocrit (HCT) \<45%, white blood cell (WBC) count \<10 × 10\^9/L, platelets (PLT) ≤400 × 10\^9/L in the absence of phlebotomy in the previous 12 weeks., 24 weeks
Polycythemia vera (PV) is the most common type of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), with an annual reported incidence of up to 2.6/100,000. This is a long-term debilitating and life-threatening disease because it is associated with the risk of thrombosis, bleeding, and progression to myelofibrosis (MF) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML)

Ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (P1101), which gained US marketing authorization in November 2021, is the only interferon alfa approved for the treatment of PV.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (P1101) in US and Canadian PV patients, utilizing an optimized dosing regimen.
