DT-9081 Study in Participants with Advanced, Recurrent or Metastatic Solid Tumours
This is a Phase 1, multicentre, open-label, dose-escalation study to determine a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of DT-9081, followed by an expansion study of DT-9081 in participants with advanced, recurrent or metastatic solid tumours
Solid Tumor, Adult
DRUG: DT-9081 - dose escalation|DRUG: DT-9081 - expansion
Dose escalation: recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), The RP2D of DT-9081 is determined using pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety data of the dose escalation part of the study., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Dose escalation: safety assessment, Number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Dose escalation and expansion: safety assessment, Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) and treatment-related TEAEs., From the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug
Dose escalation: maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The MTD will be determined based on safety data., Cycle 1 (28 days)|Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), Maximum concentration that DT-9081 achieves in plasma, Day 28 for each dose|Preliminary anti-tumour activity, The preliminary anti-tumour activity will be determined based on the assessment of, but not limited to, the objective response rate (ORR). ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) at any time during the study according to RECIST v1.1 and immune RECIST (iRECIST)., From the first dose of study drug until the date of disease progression/recurrence, assessed up to 48 months
This first-in-human Phase 1, multicentre, open label study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy of DT-9081 in adult patients with advanced, recurrent or metastatic solid tumours who failed standard of care therapies.

This Phase 1 study consists of 2 parts. The first part is a dose-escalation using a modified 3+3 design with up to 8 dose escalation cohorts at increasing levels. The dose-escalation part aims at determining the recommended phase 2 dose. The second part is an expansion to validate the dose/schedule of administration as well as to assess preliminary efficacy of DT-9081.

Patients will be dosed orally once daily. The schedule might be adjusted in case of toxicities.
