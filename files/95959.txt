PD-1 Inhibitor Combined With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Subjects With Resectable Locally Advanced Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of compare the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitor and chemotherapy（treatment group） with chemoradiotherapy（control group） in neoadjuvant treatment of resectable thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Esophageal Neoplasms|Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: PD-1 inhibitor|DRUG: Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Radiation
Pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, Within 14 working days after surgery
R0 resection rate, Within 14 working days after surgery|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause., Up to 8 years|Disease Free Survival (DFS), The time from the first day of the date of surgery to local or distant recurrence, or death caused by any cause, whichever occurs first;, Up to 8 years
This is a randomized, open-label, phase II study of PD-1 inhibitor combined With neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in subjects With resectable locally advanced thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The patients will be divided into two groups(1:1). In the treatment group, PD-1 inhibitor ,albumin-bound paclitaxel and cisplatin will be given every 3 weeks for 2-4 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy. In the control gourp, albumin-bound paclitaxel and cisplatin will be given every 3 weeks for 2 cycles as neoadjuvant therapy.
