Measurable Residual Disease-Guided Post-Transplant Elranatamab Maintenance
This study evaluates an individualized approach combining highly active maintenance treatment with elranatamab with peripheral blood-based clonotypic measurable residual disease (MRD) testing in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The overall goal is to generate efficacy data for a personalized maintenance approach using bone marrow-based MRD testing (clonoSEQ) to guide post-autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (AHCT) maintenance with elranatamab for this patient population.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Elrantamab|DEVICE: clonoSEQ
Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as time to progression or death., Through completion of follow-up (up to 5 years)|Proportion of patients achieving MRD negativity at the 10^-5 threshold per the clonoSEQ assay, Through completion of end of study visit (up to 36 months)
Event-free survival (EFS), Composite of progression, death, or treatment intolerance (discontinuation due to toxicity), Through completion of follow-up (up to 5 years)|Time to next therapy, Time to next therapy (TTNT) is defined as the time to initiation of subsequent anti-myeloma therapy (excluding standard-of-care maintenance)., Through completion of follow-up (up to 5 years)|Maximum depth of response by IMWG criteria, Through completion of end of study visit (up to 36 months)|Proportion of patients achieving sustained MRD-negativity at the 10^-5 threshold per the clonoSEQ assay for at least 12 months, MRD negativity per the clonoSEQ assay will be defined as less than 1 myeloma cell per 10\^6 bone marrow cells evaluated (i.e. \<10-6), Through completion of end of study visit (up to 36 months)|Proportion of patients discontinuing therapy per MRD-guided protocol, Through completion of treatment (up to 36 months)|Time on treatment during study period, Through completion of treatment (up to 36 months)|Incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events by CTCAE v5, From start of treatment through 90 days after completion of treatment (up to 39 months)|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as time to death., Through completion of follow-up (up to 5 years)|Proportion of patients resuming therapy per MRD-guided protocol, Through completion of treatment (up to 36 months)
