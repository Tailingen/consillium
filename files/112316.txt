Demethylated Drug in the Treatment of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
The study is to observe the efficacy and toxicity of demethylating drug decitabine and cisplatin induced chemotherapy for 3 cycles followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of regionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma,followed up for 2 years, observing the 2-year survival rate and variation of degrees of methylation before and after treatment,providing clinical basis for the clinical study of stage II-III.

Recent studies and previous studies in the investigator's research group have found that nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a disease with hypermethylation changes, and epigenetic treatment has not yet been carried out in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In this study, Simon's two-stage design method was used to select 30 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, treated with demethylating drug decitabine 7mg/m2 d1-5 + cisplatin 80mg/m2 d1 induced chemotherapy for 3 cycles followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin 80mg/m2. observing the efficacy and toxicity of decitabine in the treatment of regionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma, followed up for 2 years, observing the 2-year survival rate,evluating the relationship between different degrees of methylation and survival before and after treatment,provide clinical basis for the clinical study of stage II-III.
