Safety and Tolerability of Combined Treatment With Nilotinib and Ruxolitinib in CML and Ph+ ALL Patients
In this study it was the rationale to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combined administration of nilotinib and increasing dose of ruxolitinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and patients with Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Nilotinib|DRUG: Ruxolitinib
Occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Occurrence of DLTs during cycle 1, Baseline, up to day 28 (equals first cycle)
Safety and tolerability profile of nilotinib and ruxolitinib administered in combination, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and/or Recommended Phase II Dose (RPIID) of ruxolitinib in combination with nilotinib. (timeframe, baseline up to month 12), Baseline, up to month 12|Trough levels of nilotinib and ruxolitinib administered in combination, Trough levels will be determined by measuring the minimum plasma concentration (Cmin)., Baseline, up to month 12|Clinical activity of nilotinib and ruxolitinib administered in combination, Chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase: assessment of molecular response: MMR (≤0.1% BCR-ABL) and MR4 (≤0.001% BCR-ABL) at 3, 6, 12 months; Advanced disease: assessment of cytogenetic response will be based on evaluating percentage of Ph+ metaphases, Baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months
In this study it was the rationale to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combined administration of nilotinib and increasing dose of ruxolitinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and patients with Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
