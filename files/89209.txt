Parenteral Fish Oil in Major Laparoscopic Abdominal Surgery
The aim of this study is to assess the effect of postoperative parenteral fish oil on clinical outcome and immune function after major laparoscopic abdominal surgery.
Gastric Tumor|Pancreatic Tumor|Liver Tumor
DRUG: MCT/LCT and fish oil|DRUG: MCT/LCT
infective complications, within the first 30 days after surgery
length of hospital stay, average of 2 weeks|plasma immunological markers, from 1 day before surgery to 7 days after surgery
Postoperative patients are randomized by a sealed envelope to receive either a 50:50 (vol/vol) mixture of an oil rich in medium-chain fatty acids and soybean oil (termed MCT/LCT) or a mixture of MCT/LCT and fish oil Omegaven for 7 days. Full blood count, biochemistry and coagulation are routinely assessed. Fresh blood samples are centrifuged into plasma, red blood cells and lymphocytes then stored at -80Â°C pending analysis.

The primary endpoint was numbers of infective complications.Secondary endpoints were other clinical outcomes, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality, along with plasma immunological markers.
