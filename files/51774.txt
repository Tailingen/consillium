Open-Label, Non-Randomization and Safety Run-In: Part 1 of the study is a Phase 2 clinical trial in 20 newly diagnosed patients who have Stage II-III breast cancer, with the primary cancer in place. Parts 2 and 3 of the Study are Phase 2 clinical trials in 20 platinum resistant refractory ovarian cancer (PRROC) and gastric cancer patients, respectively.

Also in all Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the study, there will be a safety run-in involving 3-6 patients. Specifically, the enrollment of patients in each of the 3 parts of the study will begin with 3 patients. If no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs, defined as toxicity ≥Grade 3) are observed in the first 3 patients during the first cycle, enrollment can continue for the remaining 17 patients. If 1 of the first 3 patients experiences a DLT, the enrollment will be expanded to a total of 6 subjects. If no more than 1 of 6 subjects experiences a DLT, enrollment can continue for the remaining 14 patients. If 2 or more of the first 2-6 subjects experience a DLT, enrollment may be paused. The study data will be reviewed to determine whether alternate dose levels or treatment schedules should be evaluated.
