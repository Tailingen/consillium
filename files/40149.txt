Vactosertib with Durvalumab in Urothelial Carcinoma Failing Checkpoint Inhibition
This is Phase 2, open label, non randomized single arm study to determine whether the administration of vactosertib with durvalumab will provide meaningful increases in the Overall Response Rate (ORR) in patients with urothelial cancers that fail to achieve a response with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 based regimens

This is a Phase 2, open-label, non-randomized, two-cohort multi center study with a safety run-in of 6 patients in Cohort 1. It is anticipated that a total of 48 patients will be enrolled.

Durvalumab will be administered with the standard regimen of 1500 mg intravenously (IV) every four weeks. Vactosertib will be administered at a dose of 300 mg PO BID for 5 days per week All treatment will be administered up to two years and the trial is anticipated to be completed over a period of 36 months.
