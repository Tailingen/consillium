Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Versus Placebo in Combination With Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy & Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy in the Treatment of Early-Stage Estrogen Receptor-Positive, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Negative (ER+/HER2-) Breast Cancer (MK-3475-756/KEYNOTE-756)
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) versus placebo in combination with neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) chemotherapy and adjuvant (post-surgery) endocrine therapy in the treatment of adults who have high-risk early-stage estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer.

The primary study hypotheses are: 1) pembrolizumab is superior to placebo, both in combination with the protocol-specified neoadjuvant anticancer therapy, as assessed by pathological Complete Response (pCR) rate defined by the local pathologist, and 2) pembrolizumab is superior to placebo (both in combination with the protocol-specified neoadjuvant and adjuvant anticancer therapies) as assessed by Event-Free Survival (EFS) as determined by the investigator. The study is considered to have met its primary objective if pembrolizumab is superior to placebo with respect to either pCR (ypT0/Tis ypN0) or EFS.

The percentage of participants with a pCR using the definition of ypT0/Tis will be presented for pembrolizumab versus placebo, both in combination with the protocol-specified neoadjuvant anticancer therapies., Up to approximately 7 months (Time of surgery)|pCR Rate Using the Definitions of ypT0/Tis ypN0, ypT0/Tis, and ypT0 ypN0 in Participants With a Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥1, pCR rates were calculated using the definitions of ypT0/Tis ypN0, ypT0/Tis, and ypT0 ypN0 after completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by AJCC staging criteria (8th edition) assessed by the local pathologist at the time of surgery. The percentage of participants with a pCR using the three definitions of ypT0/Tis ypN0, ypT0/Tis, and ypT0 ypN0 in participants with a CPS ≥1 (with a positive Programmed Cell Death-Ligand 1 \[PD-L1\] tumor status) will be presented for pembrolizumab versus placebo, both in combination with the protocol-specified neoadjuvant anticancer therapies., Up to approximately 7 months (Time of surgery)|EFS in Participants With a CPS ≥1, EFS is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression that: precludes surgery, results in a local or distant recurrence, results in a second primary malignancy, or death due to any cause whichever occurs first.
