Genomic Biomarker-guided Neoadjuvant Therapy for Prostate Cancer (SEGNO)
To evaluated the safety and efficacy of genomic biomarker-guided neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced and oligometastatic prostate cancer.

DRUG: Rezvilutamide|DRUG: Goserelin Microspheres for Injection|DRUG: Docetaxel|DRUG: Pamiparib|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Tislelizumab
Rate of clinical complete response (cCR), The rate of clinical complete response (cCR) as assessed using PSMA PET/CT and mp-MRI following 20 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy, 20 weeks|Rate of pathological minimal residual disease (pMRD), The rate of pathological minimal residual disease (defined as residual tumour 5 mm or less) as assessed on prostatectomy specimens following 24 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy, 24 weeks|Rate of complete pathologic response (pCR), The rate of complete pathologic response (pCR) as assessed on prostatectomy specimens following 24 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy, 24 weeks
Progression-free survival, Kaplan-Meier curves, 3 years|Overall survival, Kaplan-Meier curves, 3 years
According to the results of the genomic profile, patients will be assigned to 4 neoadjuvant therapy (NT) groups (Queue 1 to 4): Queue 1: No targetable actionable aberration; Queue 2: Homologous recombination repair (HRR) alterations (BRCA1/2); Queue 3: Homologous recombination repair alterations (except BRCA1/2 and CDK12); Queue 4: MSI-H/dMMR, TMBâ‰¥10mut/Mb or CDK12 alterations without other HRR alterations. A following PSMA PETCT for evaluating the efficacy of NT and radical prostatectomy (RP) plus pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) will be perform. The histopathological and survival data after RP plus PLND will also be evaluated.
