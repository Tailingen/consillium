A Study of Cemiplimab and Fianlimab in People With Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
The researchers are doing this study to find out whether it is practical (feasible) to give cemiplimab and fianlimab before a nephrectomy and whether it causes any delays with surgery in people with kidney cancer. The researchers will also look at whether cemiplimab and fianlimab given before a nephrectomy is a safe and effective treatment approach and if there is a change in the size of the tumor following immunotherapy prior to planned surgery.
