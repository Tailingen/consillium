Effect of Pexidartinib on the Way the Body Processes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 Substrates (Pharmacokinetics)
This study has two parts.

Part 1 will evaluate how pexidartinib affects the way the body processes CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrates using midazolam and tolbutamide, respectively, as probe agents.

Part 2 will test the efficacy and safety of pexidartinib treatment in various tumor types.

In Part 2, the same participants will continue to receive pexidartinib twice daily.

Participants will be allowed to continue using pexidartinib as long as the participant derives benefit.
