Veliparib in Combination With Gemcitabine and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in Patients With Pancreatic Cancer
This is a Phase I Study of veliparib (ABT-888) in combination with Gemcitabine and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in Patients with Locally Advanced, Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer.

Primary Objectives:

* Determine the maximum tolerable dose of veliparib in combination with gemcitabine and intensity modulated radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.
* Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of veliparib with gemcitabine and radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: Veliparib|DRUG: Gemcitabine|RADIATION: Intensity modulated radiation therapy
Maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of veliparib based on the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (Phase I), Days 1-70
Assessment of objective response rates measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response, From baseline to Week 26|Evaluation of pre-treatment biopsy specimens for levels of various DNA repair proteins, Baseline only|Change in PAR [Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation] levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, Baseline, Weekly for 6 weeks, and at Weeks 10, 18, and 26
Gemcitabine will be administered by intravenous infusion of 1000 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15 of the cycle. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be given to a total dose of 36 Gy in 15 fractions (2.4 Gy per fraction, one fraction per day, 5 fractions per week, Monday through Friday) beginning on day 1. Veliparib will be administered per a dose escalation schema. The starting dose of veliparib is 20 mg BID based upon safety/efficacy data available. Dose escalation will continue in 20 mg increments until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Intra-patient dose escalation will not be allowed.
