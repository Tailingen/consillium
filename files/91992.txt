Quality of Life Before and After Radiotherapy in Patients With Head and Neck Cancer
Worldwide, head and neck cancers (HNCs) are widespread (650,000 cases per year) and cause more than 330,000 deaths per year. Almost all cases, about 90%, are cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx.

In conventional clinical practice, HNCs are treated primarily with radiation therapy (RT), often used in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy. Like most anti-neoplastic therapies, RT carries significant adverse effects both acute and chronic. Both types of adverse effects have a significant impact on quality of life (QoL).

The aim of the study is to examine the worsening of QoL in patients with HNC before and after cancer therapy and to assess the extent that each factor has in its worsening.

RADIATION: Curative radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancers
University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire version 4.1, The UW-QOL v4.1 is a widely recognized questionnaire for reporting physical and socio-emotional dysfunction after HNC treatment and consists of short multifactorial questions specific to HNC and to assess the patient's perception of general QoL in the past 7 days. The questionnaire includes 12 questions to assess pain, appearance, activity, leisure, swallowing, chewing, speech, shoulder, taste, salivation, mood, and anxiety. There are two subdomains: physical and social-emotional. The physical function items are chewing, speech, swallowing, taste, saliva and appearance.
