Sodium Bicarbonate for Reducing Radiation-Induced Oral Mucositis in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.
To evaluate whether the use of 2.5% sodium bicarbonate mouthwash throughout the entire course of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma reduces the severity of radiation-induced oral mucositis and improves patient adherence to treatment.
Nasopharyngeal Cancinoma (NPC)
DRUG: Gargle with 2.5% sodium bicarbonate solution during radiotherapy|DRUG: Gargle with 0.9% sodium chloride solution during radiotherapy
The incidence of grade ≥2 oral mucositis, Oral mucositis grade was evaluated using RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) criteria, with intergroup differences analyzed by Chi-square test., from radiotherapy commencement until 14 days post-radiotherapy
The incidence of grade ≥3 oral mucositis, Oral mucositis grade was evaluated using RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) criteria, with intergroup differences analyzed by Chi-square test., from radiotherapy commencement until 14 days post-radiotherapy|The incidence of grade ≥1 oral mucositis, Oral mucositis grade was evaluated using RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) criteria, with intergroup differences analyzed by Chi-square test., from radiotherapy commencement until 14 days post-radiotherapy|Oral fungal detection rate, Fungal culture testing via oral swab should be performed when oral mucositis of grade ≥2 severity occurs., from radiotherapy commencement until 14 days post-radiotherapy|Rate of oral pH decline, Weekly electronic pH meter measurements were obtained pre-radiotherapy and during radiotherapy, with comparison of the decline rate from baseline to pH nadir., from radiotherapy commencement until 14 days post-radiotherapy
With the improvement in the prognosis of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-NPC) patients, an increasing number of studys have turned their attention to the treatment-related toxicities in NPC patients. Common toxic reactions during the treatment of NPC patients include radiation-induced oral mucositis, radiation-induced skin injury, dysphagia, xerostomia, and hearing loss, etc. Among them, radiation - induced oral mucositis is one of the most common and severe complications during radiotherapy for NPC patients. More than half of LA-NPC will experience grade 3 - 4 radiation-induced oral mucositis.

Current international guidelines, including those from NCCN, ESMO, and the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC), provisionally endorse sodium bicarbonate mouthwash as an adjunctive measure for RIOM management. The proposed mechanisms involve pH modulation of the oral cavity, microbial load reduction, and anti-inflammatory effects. Specifically: 1) NCCN guidelines incorporate sodium bicarbonate into multi-agent regimens with analgesics/anesthetics; 2) ESMO emphasizes its prophylactic potential in targeted therapy-associated mucositis; 3) MASCC consensus acknowledges its role in maintaining oral hygiene. However, these recommendations carry low evidence grades, with all guidelines explicitly highlighting the paucity of robust clinical data to substantiate efficacy claims.

To address this critical evidence gap, our research team proposes a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate mouthwash in mitigating RIOM severity throughout radiotherapy for LA-NPC. Given the current lack of high - level research evidence, the results of future research are expected to further confirm the effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate mouthwash in relieving radiation-induced oral mucositis during radiotherapy for NPC patients, improve the quality of life of NPC patients.
