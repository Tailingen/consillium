Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics of DR30206 in Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This study is to characterize the safety,tolerability, pharmacokinetics(PK),and preliminary anti-tumor activity of DR30206, in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors
Solid Tumor
DRUG: DR30206
PartA: Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), Dose-limiting describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment, 21 days following first dose|PartA: Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), As measured by number of participants experiencing dose related toxicity (DLT) in each escalating cohort, 21 days following first dose|PartA: Recommend dose of expansion(RDE), A Recommend dose of expansion will be determined based on safety data, 21 days following first dose|PartA+B: Adverse evens (AEs), The incidence and severity of AEs graded according to NCI-CTCAE v5.0, Up to 90 days after last dose|PartA+B: Serious adverse evens (SAEs), A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect, Up to 90 days after last dose|PartB: Objective response rate (ORR), Objective response rate (ORR) is the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on RECIST v1.1, Up to approximately 12 months|PartB: Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), A recommended phase 2 dose will be determined based on safety data, 21 days following first dose
This study is an open, phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of DR30206 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study is composed of two parts: part A is Dose escalation stage and part B is Dose expansion stage
