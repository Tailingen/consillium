GB1211 and Pembrolizumab Versus Pembrolizumab and Placebo in Patients With Metastatic Melanoma and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to determine the objective response of GB1211 and pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab and placebo in patients with advance metastatic melanoma or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Metastatic Melanoma|Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: GB1211|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo
Overall response rate based on disease imaging, Determine the response of Gal-3 inhibitor and pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab monotherapy (plus placebo) in patients with metastatic melanoma or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 63 weeks.
Evaluation of GAL-3 Expression, Compare Gal-3 expression in paired biopsies after GB1211 + pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy, Screening and Day 68|Evaluation of Predictive Biomarker, Characterize myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) expression over time as a predictive biomarker of response after GB1211 + pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy, Day 85|Frequency of Immune-mediated Adverse Events, Compare the frequency of immune-mediated adverse events after GB1211 + pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab + placebo, From the time of informed consent to week 63|Evaluation of Antiviral Immunity, Assess the biological activity of GB1211 + pembrolizumab and in comparison to pembrolizumab monotherapy by measuring CD4+T cells with a memory phenotype (CD3+CD4+Ki67+CD25+FoxP3-CCR7-CD45RA-CD27+CD28+/-)., Day 85|Evaluation of Antiviral Immunity, Assess the biological activity of GB1211 + pembrolizumab and in comparison to pembrolizumab monotherapy by measuring CD8+ T cells with effector phenotype (CD3+CD8+CD28-CD95+)., Day 85|Evaluation of Antiviral Immunity, Assess the biological activity of GB1211 + pembrolizumab and in comparison to pembrolizumab monotherapy by measuring tumor-specific T cells using autologous and/or HLA-matched tumor when available., Day 85
Eligible patients will be registered, stratified by diagnosis (melanoma versus oral, head and neck (OHN) cancer), and the number of prior systemic therapies, and randomized to receive either GB1211 + pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab + placebo.
