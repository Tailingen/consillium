TCR-engineered T Cells in Solid Tumors: IMA202-101
The study purpose is to establish the safety and tolerability of IMA202 product in patients with solid tumors that express melanoma-associated antigen 1 (MAGEA1).
Solid Tumor, Adult|Refractory Cancer|Recurrent Cancer|Cancer
DRUG: IMA202 Product|DEVICE: IMADetectÂ®
Incidence of adverse events (AE), up to 3 years post treatment
Persistence of T-cells, up to 3 years post treatment|Tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST), up to 12 months
SCREENING: Patient eligibility will be determined by HLA (human leukocyte antigen) screening and a biopsy for biomarker screening. If the patient is eligible, white blood cells will be taken during leukapheresis for the manufacture of the IMA202 product.

MANUFACTURING: IMA202 product will be made from the patient's white blood cells.

TREATMENT: Lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine will occur in the days before the IMA202 product infusion to improve the duration of time that IMA202 product stays in the body. The patient will be admitted to the hospital during the treatment.

After the IMA202 product infusion, a low dose of IL-2 will be given twice daily for a period of time.

Patients will be closely monitored for safety and for a total of 3 years post IMA202 infusion.
