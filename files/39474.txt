Improving Patient-reported Outcomes After Lung Cancer Surgery With Mobile Internet Platform
This study focuses on the significant impact of lung cancer in China, highlighted by its high incidence and mortality rates, influenced by factors like aging populations, smoking, and environmental issues. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the duration, severity, and factors affecting post-surgery symptoms like pain and coughing in patients. The research underlines the value of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in enhancing postoperative care and survival rates through improved symptom monitoring and patient engagement. Utilizing internet technology, specifically a platform integrated with WeChat, the study aims to improve patient management and follow-ups post-discharge. The objective is to use mobile internet technology to build a high-quality prospective database on postoperative lung cancer patient outcomes, analyzing factors affecting postoperative discomfort and assessing the role of interactive platforms in improving patient care.

complaints of discomfort, MDASI-LC score for complaints of discomfort at postoperative months 1, 3 and 4

Postoperative discomfort chief complaint MDASI-LC score:

Choose a number from 0 (asymptomatic) to 10 (the most severe level imaginable) for each item to indicate the severity of the symptoms.

The main complaints of postoperative discomfort include: pain, cough, shortness of breath (key points) Other factors include fatigue, nausea, insomnia, depression, memory loss, loss of appetite, drowsiness, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, numbness or stinging wounds, constipation, etc, 4 months

EQ5D scoring table for postoperative quality of life:

Q1: Activity ability A: Walking is not a problem; B: There are some walking problems; C: Bedridden and unable to get up.

Q2: Self care ability A: Can be completely self-care; B: There are some issues with taking a shower or dressing; C: Unable to take a shower or dress on their own.

Q3: Daily activities (such as work, study, household chores, family or leisure activities) A: There is no problem with daily activities; B: There are some issues with daily activities; C: Unable to perform daily activities Q4: Pain/discomfort A: No pain/discomfort; B: Moderate pain/discomfort; C: Extreme pain/discomfort Q5: Anxiety/Depression A: Not anxious/depressed; B: Mild anxiety/depression; C: Moderate anxiety/depression, 4 months|Pulmonary function-the absolute value of FEV1, Pulmonary function test results comparing different resection styles

Perform lung function tests during the study period, including the absolute value of FEV1, the percentage of FEV1 to expected values, etc, 4 months|Pulmonary function-the percentage of FEV1 to expected values, Pulmonary function test results comparing different resection styles

Perform lung function tests during the study period, including the absolute value of FEV1, the percentage of FEV1 to expected values, etc, 4 months|Change of breath sounds, Modelling of breath sounds after resection of different resection styles

By collecting postoperative respiratory sounds from different resection methods, converting the audio into digital signals for analysis, and then modeling and calculating, a large model of postoperative respiratory sounds from different resection methods is established to evaluate the postoperative respiratory sounds of patients., 4 months
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In China, it has become the malignancy with the highest incidence and mortality rates, exacerbated by aging populations, smoking, and environmental issues. Post-major lung surgery, patients often experience reduced quality of life due to symptoms like pain and coughing. However, the duration, severity, and factors influencing these symptoms during recovery are not fully understood. Notably, recent attention has been given to the direct collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for subjective symptom monitoring and improving patient care. Incorporating PRO monitoring in cancer patient follow-ups can reduce postoperative discomfort, enhance treatment tolerance and adherence, detect early relapses, and improve survival rates. Internet technology significantly expands information exchange frequency and efficiency. Management platforms based on internet mobile applications can enhance patient management compliance, enable intelligent follow-ups, and strengthen doctor-patient interaction. The investigators' hospital intends to utilize its internet hospital platform, integrated with WeChat (a Tencent application in China), for assisting in-patient management and post-discharge surveillance through automated multimedia material and PROs. WeChat, similar to Facebook and WhatsApp, is a multifunctional messenger app with over a billion active monthly users in China, effectively using an application already familiar to patients rather than introducing new ones.

This study aims to leverage mobile internet technology to transform traditional database construction, enhance the efficiency and accuracy of prospective database information collection, and establish a high-quality prospective database of postoperative lung cancer patient-reported outcomes. This will facilitate the analysis of factors influencing postoperative discomfort in patients and explore the role of interactive mobile internet technology platforms in improving postoperative PROs, thereby elevating the diagnostic and treatment standards in this field.
