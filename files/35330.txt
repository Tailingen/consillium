Safety and Effectiveness of BioTraceIO 360 for Planning, Monitoring and Assessment of Liver Tissue Ablation Procedures (PANORAMA2)
Pilot study planned to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the use of BioTraceIO 360 for Planning, Monitoring and Assessment of liver tissue ablation procedures

Single-center prospective single-arm clinical investigation.

Sample size - 10 subjects.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Metastatic Liver Cancer
DEVICE: BioTraceIO 360
Effectiveness, The percentage of patients for whom (1) probe(s) position suggestion provided by the BioTraceIO 360 device is in agreement with the planned probe(s) position, as determined by the physician without the use of the device, or (2) clinically feasible probe(s) positioning suggestion was provided by the BioTraceIO 360 device, in addition to the planned probe(s) position by the physician without the use of the device, 1 year|Safety, Incidence and severity of device-related adverse, 1 year
Planning Module, The proportion of subjects in whom the physician has made changes and/or reported increased confidence to the planned ablation procedure after using the BioTraceIO 360 Planning Module compared to without using it., 1 year|Monitoring Module, A non-validated qualitative assessment for the physician regarding confidence during the procedure without and with the use of BioTraceIO 360 Monitoring Module if they could have made clinical decisions based on the use of the device., 1 year|Assessment Module (1), A non-validated qualitative assessment on whether there were subjects, in whom the physician indicated that they would have changed the procedure and/or follow-up decision if they could have made clinical decisions based on the visualization of the tumor compared to the necrosis, using the BioTraceIO 360 Assessment Module at the end of the procedure., 1 year
Assessment Module (2), A non-validated qualitative assessment on whether there were subjects, for whom the BioTraceIO 360 Assessment Module indicated an incomplete ablation of the target tissue, compared to follow up 1-month post-procedure imaging., 1 year
