Thyroid Nodule Gene Sequencing in a Danish Population
This pilot study aims at describing the prevalence and distribution of molecular alterations in thyroid nodules of benign and malignant origin at the level of DNA and RNA in a Danish population.

Patients with thyroid nodules suspected of malignancy is included prospectively.

Tissue samples are collected for molecular analyses form surgical specimens and bloodsamples, and preoperative clincial features are registered.
