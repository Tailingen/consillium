A Study of Nivolumab-relatlimab Fixed-dose Combination Versus Regorafenib or TAS-102 in Participants With Later-lines of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
The purpose of this study is to evaluate relatlimab in combination with nivolumab, administered as a fixed-dose combination (nivolumab-relatlimab FDC, also referred to as BMS-986213) for the treatment of non-microsatellite instability high (MSI-H)/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) participants who failed at least 1 but no more than 4 prior lines of therapy for metastatic disease.
Colorectal Neoplasms
DRUG: Nivolumab-relatlimab FDC|DRUG: Regorafenib|DRUG: TAS-102
Overall survival (OS) in randomized participants with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 1, Up to 5 years after last participant randomized|OS in all randomized participants, Up to 5 years after last participant randomized
Objective response rate (ORR) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 in randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1, Up to 5 years after last participant randomized|ORR by BICR per RECIST v1.1 in all randomized participants, Up to 5 years after last participant randomized|Progression-free survival (PFS) by BICR per RECIST v1.1 in randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1, Up to 5 years after last participant randomized|PFS by BICR per RECIST v1.1 in all randomized participants, Up to 5 years after last participant randomized|Duration of response (DoR) by BICR per RECIST v1.1 in responders with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1, Up to 5 years after last participant randomized|DoR by BICR per RECIST v1.1 in all responders, Up to 5 years after last participant randomized|Number of participants with adverse events (AEs), Up to 135 days after participant's last dose|Number of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs), Up to 135 days after participant's last dose|Number of participants with immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs), Up to 135 days after participant's last dose|Number of participants with AEs leading to discontinuation, Up to 135 day's after participant's last dose|Number of participants with clinical laboratory abnormalities, Up to 135 days after participant's last dose|Time Until Definitive Deterioration-Physical Function (TUDD-PF): The time from randomization until definitive deterioration in the EORTC QLQ-C30 physical function scale score in randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1, The EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) consists of 30 questions incorporated into 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning), 3 multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a global health status / Quality of Life scale, and six single symptom items. All of the scale and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100, where a higher score represents a higher response level. High functional scores indicates more favorable outcomes and a higher score on the symptom domains indicates higher symptom burden/less favorable patient outcome., Up to follow up visit 2 (approximately 135 days after last dose)|TUDD-PF: The time from randomization until definitive deterioration in the EORTC QLQ-C30 physical function scale score in all randomized participants, Up to follow up visit 2 (approximately 135 days after last dose)|TUDD-QoL: The time from randomization until definitive deterioration in the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status/QoL scale score in randomized participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1, QoL = Quality of Life. The EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) consists of 30 questions incorporated into 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning), 3 multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a global health status / Quality of Life scale, and six single symptom items.
