Identification of EGFR-TKIs Sensitivity or Resistance Markers in NSCLC May Help in Optimal Patient Selection
The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate associations between EGFR and AKT DNA-polymorphisms involved in transcriptional regulation and overall survival in NSCLC patients treated with EGFR-TKIs.
NON-SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER
to evaluate the presence of EGFR- and AKT-DNA polymorphisms., At the end of enrollment
to correlate the biological characteristics with clinical characteristics and survival data of patients., At the end of enrollment
DNA will be isolated from blood samples or paraffin-embedded tumor specimens and than a mutation analysis and SNPs genotyping will be done.
