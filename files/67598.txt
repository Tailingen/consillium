CD22-CAR T Cells in Children and Young Adults With B Cell Malignancies
The primary purpose of this study is to test whether CD22-CAR T cells can be successfully made from immune cells collected from pediatric and young adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies (leukemia and lymphoma). Another purpose of this study is to test the safety and cancer killing ability of a cell therapy against a new cancer target (CD22).

Rate of successful manufacture of CD22 CAR T cells, The percentage of apheresis samples (fresh or frozen) that are successfully processed and expanded to manufacture CD22 CAR T cells that satisfy the target dose level and meet release specifications will be determined for each disease group (ALL or lymphoma)., 7-11 days after apheresis|Safe dose of CD22-CAR T cells in subjects with R/R B-cell malignancies, Incidence and severity of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) following chemotherapy preparative regimen and infusion of CD22 CAR T cells, as recorded and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, at target dose of 1 x 10\^6 transduced T cells/kg (Â± 20%)., 28 days after infusion
Clinical activity of CD22-CAR T cells in children and young adults with R/R CD22-expressing B-cell ALL and R/R lymphoma, Clinical activity will be assessed by modified International Working Group response criteria for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Results will be reported as best response (i.e. complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PR)) at Day 28 for adult subjects with ALL treated at the target dose., 28 days after infusion of CD22-CAR T cells|Clinical activity of CD22-CAR T cells in adults with R/R lymphoma, Clinical activity will be assessed by Lugano response criteria for lymphoma. Results will be reported as best response (i.e. complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PR)) at Month 3 for adult lymphoma/DLBCL subjects treated at Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) /recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)., 3 months after infusion of CD22-CAR T cells
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

* Determine the feasibility of manufacturing CD22 CAR T cells for administration to children and young adults with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CD22 expressing B-cell ALL or lymphoma using the Miltenyi CliniMACS Prodigy system.
* Determine the safety of an established dose of CD22-CAR T cells in children and young adults with R/R CD22 expressing B-cell malignancies.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

- Assess the clinical activity of CD22-CAR T cells in children and young adults with R/R CD22 expressing B-cell malignancies, including overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS).
