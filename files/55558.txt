A Safety and Efficacy Study Evaluating CTX110 in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Malignancies (CARBON)
This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of CTX110 in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies.
B-cell Malignancy|Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|B-cell Lymphoma|Adult B Cell ALL
BIOLOGICAL: CTX110
Phase 1 Part A (Dose Escalation), for all cohorts: Incidence of adverse events, defined as dose-limiting toxicities, From CTX110 infusion up to 28 days post-infusion|Phase 1 Part B (Cohort Expansion) and Phase 2: Objective response rate, From CTX110 infusion up to 60 months post-infusion
Duration of Response, Duration of Response (DOR) for subjects with objective response events, From date of first objective response until date of disease progression or death due to any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Duration of Clinical Benefit (DOCB), From date of first objective response until date of last disease progression or death, assessed up to 60 months|Treatment-Failure-Free Survival (TFFS), From date of first CTX110 infusion until date of last disease progression or death due to any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), From date of first CTX110 infusion until date of first disease progression or death due to any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Overall Survival (OS), From date of first CTX110 infusion until date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 60 months|Objective Response Rate (for B cell ALL), For B cell ALL, objective response rate (ORR) (complete remission + complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery) will be assessed., From CTX110 infusion up to 60 months post-infusion
The study may enroll up to 227 subjects in total. CTX110 is a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy comprised of allogeneic T cells prepared for the treatment of B cell malignancies. The cells are from healthy adult volunteer donors that are genetically modified ex vivo using CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/ CRISPR-associated protein 9) gene editing components (single guide RNA and Cas9 nuclease).
