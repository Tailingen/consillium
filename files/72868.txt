XACT ACE Observational Registry
Compile real world data on the use of the XACT ACE Robotic System
Tumors
DEVICE: Hands-free, user-controlled robotic system intended to assist in the planning and advancement of an instrument during CT guided percutaneous procedures. T
Proportion of successful procedures, To evaluate the proportion of procedures in which the instrument reached the pre-defined target based on the physician's determination and CT imaging confirmation., 1 hour|System accuracy, To evaluate system accuracy defined as the measured distance from the tip of the instrument to the target location at the end of the instrument insertion., 1 hour|Assessment of Safety, Incidence of intra- and post-procedural events, 2 hours post-procedure
The purpose of this observational post-market study is to compile real world data on the use of the XACT ACE Robotic System in subjects undergoing CT guided, minimally invasive percutaneous procedures.

The objectives are to 1) evaluate the proportion of procedures in which the instrument reached the pre-defined target, based on the physician's determination and CT imaging confirmation, 2) To evaluate system accuracy defined as the measured distance from the tip of the instrument to the target location at the at the end of the instrument insertion, and 3) Incidence of intra- and post-procedural adverse events.

Up to 500 patients will be enrolled in this multicenter, nonrandomized, single arm registry.
