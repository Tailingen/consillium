Post-operative Analgesia in Elective, Soft-tissue Hand Surgery
The purpose of this research study is to find out which combination of pain medications following surgery work the best and result in the fewest side effects.
Carpal Tunnel|Ganglion Cyst|Trigger Finger|De Quervain Disease
DRUG: Acetaminophen/Ibuprofen|DRUG: Acetaminophen/Hydrocodone
Efficacy Comparison of Pain Intensity Level, Subjects asked to fill out a patient diary recording their pain intensity level (on 100mm Visual Analog Scale) prior to taking study medication every 4 hours.

The daily average pain intensity levels are reported as a score on a scale of 0-100, with higher score meaning worse outcome.

The daily average pain levels were assessed daily for 1 week post-operatively, then compared between the 2 groups using a two-group Student's t-test., 1 week post-operatively
Efficacy Comparison of Pain Relief, Subjects asked to fill out a patient diary recording their pain relief (on a Likert scale) one hour after taking study medication every 4 hours.

Daily average pain relief scores are reported as a score on a scale of 0-3, with higher score meaning better outcome.

The daily average pain relief scores were assessed daily for 1 week post-operatively, then compared using generalized linear mixed-effects models, 1 week postoperatively
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind study comparing the efficacy of acetaminophen/hydrocodone (AH) to acetaminophen/ibuprofen (AIBU) in providing adequate post-operative pain relief in elective, soft tissue hand surgery patients.
