Roll Over StudY for Patients Who Have Completed a Previous Oncology Study With Durvalumab
The rationale of the ROSY-D study is to continue to provide study treatment for patients who have participated in a parent study with Durvalumab and who are continuing to derive clinical benefit from treatment at the end of such studies, as judged by the Investigator.

Number of participants with serious adverse events as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, To monitor safety and tolerability of continuous study treatment to patients who continue to benefit at the end of the clinical trial by measuring the primary outcome of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)., From baseline up to follow up at 90 days after the last dose of study drug.
ROSY-D is an open label, non-randomised, multicentre, international trial for patients who have completed a parent study using durvalumab and who are deriving clinical benefit from continued treatment as judged by the Investigator. Patients will be rolled-over from the parent study and will continue the study indefinitely, until they meet one of the treatment discontinuation criteria.
