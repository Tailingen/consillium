Colorectal Cancer|Colorectal Carcinoma|Colorectal Tumors|Neoplasms, Colorectal
DRUG: Panitumumab|DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Everolimus
Dose limiting toxicities, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)of everolimus, irinotecan and panitumumab when given in combination for patients with Kras WT mCRC, at end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 14 days)
Safety & toxicity, Safety and toxicity assessed weekly during the phase Ib component (as per NCI CTCAE version 3.0) and fortnightly during the phase II component, Approximately 24 weeks|Response rate, Objective tumour response as per RECIST criteria V1.0, Assessed every 6 weeks until disease progression|Progression free survival, Until disease progression, occurrence of new disease or death|Overall Survival, Assessed 3 monthly until death
This is an open label uncontrolled phase IB/II study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the efficacy of everolimus, irinotecan and panitumumab when given in combination for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and KRAS wild-type (WT). Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that have failed fluorouracil based first line therapy will be included. It is anticipated that approximately 50 patients will be enrolled over a period of 24 months
