PRGN-2009 in Combination with Pembrolizumab Versus Pembrolizumab in Patients with Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer
This randomized trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRGN-2009 in combination with pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab alone in patients with pembrolizumab-resistant recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.
Cervical Cancer|HPV-Related Carcinoma|HPV-Related Malignancy|Recurrent Cervical Carcinoma|Metastatic Cervical Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: PRGN-2009 plus Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab alone
Determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) following treatment with PRGN-2009 in combination with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone in patients with pembrolizumab-resistant recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer., The ORR will be calculated as the combination of subjects achieving a complete response or a partial response per RECIST v1.1.

ORR will be calculated and presented with 2-sided 95% confidence interval., 1 year
Safety of PRGN-2009 in combination with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone, Systemic toxicity will be assessed through the capture of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events ( TEAEs). The severity of the TEAEs will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0 scale., 1 year|Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) following treatment with PRGN-2009 in combination with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone, Duration of PFS and OS will be summarized using the Kaplan-Meier Product Limit estimator along with the corresponding two sided-95% Confidence intervals., 1 year|Best Overall Responses (BOR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST v1.1 following treatment with PRGN-2009 in combination with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone, The proportion of subjects with BOR and DCR will be summarized using descriptive statistics., 1 year|Time to Response and Duration of Responses following treatment with PRGN-2009 in combination with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone, TTR and DOR will be summarized using descriptive statistics., 1 year|Vector shedding following subcutaneous administration of PRGN-2009, Samples collected before and at specific intervals after treatment will be evaluated for presence of adenoviral vector., Up to 4 months
This is a randomized, two-arm study of PRGN-2009 in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who are pembrolizumab resistant. Patients meeting all eligibility criteria who consent to participate in the study will be randomized 1:1 to receive a combination of PRGN-2009, plus pembrolizumab, or to receive pembrolizumab alone.
