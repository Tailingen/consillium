Duke Spine Outcome Study (DSOS)
The primary goal of this registry is to increase the knowledge about spine tumors and other spine disorders to guide appropriate management strategies for the future. This registry will include the review of medical records, data collection for health related quality of life questionnaires, and collected tissues and samples.

The study will require obtaining spinal lesions (tumor, etc.), blood, and bone marrow samples (from non-lesional bone) from selected patients, which will be collected during your surgery.
