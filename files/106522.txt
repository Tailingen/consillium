Ablation Confirmation Study
Prospective, single-arm, multicenter study that will generate clinical data using the NEUWAVE MicroWave Ablation System with AC (Ablation Confirmation) software in patients undergoing ablation of a soft tissue liver lesion.

DEVICE: Microwave Ablation
Percentage of Lesions Where Probe Repositioning is Suggested, Day 0|Percentage of Lesions Where Re-ablation is Suggested, Day 0
Technical Success, Ablation of the target lesion(s) according to the protocol and covered completely with an adequate margin, as defined by the performing physician (that is, the ablation zone completely overlaps or encompasses the target lesion plus an adequate ablative margin), Day 0|Technique Efficacy, Ablation of the target lesion(s) according to the protocol and covered completely with an adequate margin, as defined by the performing physician (that is, the ablation zone completely overlaps or encompasses the target lesion plus an adequate ablative margin) as assessed by imaging at 6 weeks, 6 weeks|Hospital Resource Utilization, How many days patients remain in the hospital after the ablation procedure, 6 weeks
Prospective, single-arm, multicenter study that will generate clinical data on 100 adult patients using the NEUWAVE MicroWave Ablation System with AC (Ablation Confirmation) software in patients undergoing ablation of a soft tissue liver lesion. AC software is a computed tomography (CT) image processing software package available as an optional feature for use with the NEUWAVE Microwave Ablation System. AC imports images from CT scanners for display and processing during ablation procedures to assist physicians in identifying ablation targets, assessing optimal ablation probe placement, and confirming the adequacy of the ablation margin.

All ablations will be performed percutaneously by an interventional radiologist while the patient is under general anesthesia or deep conscious sedation.
