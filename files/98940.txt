Polar Wand Carbon Dioxide Cryotherapy for Barrett's Esophagus
The purpose of this pilot study is to provide an initial assessment of the feasibility, safety and efficacy of Polar Wand carbon dioxide cryotherapy for treatment of Barrett's low grade and high grade dysplasia by use in a small number of patients so as to support, or otherwise, the development of a full-scale trial.
Barrett's Esophagus
DEVICE: Polar Wand carbon dioxide cryotherapy
Reduction in Barrett's Histology Grade, Using the Modified Vienna Classification, The reduction of Barrett's segment length and histology classification will be measured at 12 months., 12 months
Reduction in Barrett's Segment Length, Using the Prague Classification, 6 and 12 months|Assessment of Complications, Specific complications are GI Bleeding and Perforation and Stricture and Ulceration, 12 months|Assessment of Post-ablation Symptoms, Specific symptoms (frequency and severity) are chest pain, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, nausea or vomiting, sore throat, 12 months|Reduction in Barrett's Histology Grade, Using the Modified Vienna Classification, The reduction of Barrett's segment length and histology classification will be measured at 6 months., 6 months
Prospective pilot study to be performed in 14 Barrett's Esophagus patients with low grade and high grade dysplasia, referred for standard of care treatment. Patients will receive treatments with carbon dioxide Polar Wand cryotherapy at 0, 2 and 4 months, followed by surveillance endoscopy with four quadrant biopsies throughout the entire Barrett's esophagus (BE)segment at 6 months, followed by endoscopy with additional treatments (if needed) at 8 and 10 months, followed by a final surveillance endoscopy at 12 months, with four quadrant biopsies throughout the entire initial BE segment length.
