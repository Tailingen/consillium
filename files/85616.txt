Temozolomide as Maintenance Therapy Following Induction Chemotherapy in Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
Temozolomide may delay progression in sequence with chemotherapy. This open-label, randomized,multicenter phase II trial was designed to evaluate the role of Temozolomide following 4 or 6 cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed estensive-stage SCLC.
