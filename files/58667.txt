A Single-arm, Open, Single-center Exploratory Study of Adebrelimab (SHR-1316) in Combination with Chemotherapy for the Perioperative Treatment of Locally Advanced Resectable Esophageal Squamous Carcinoma
This study is a prospective, observational clinical study. In this study, 30 patients with resectable locally advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma will be prospectively enrolled and treated with adebrelimab (SHR-1316) combined with nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin preoperatively and adebrelimab (SHR-1316) single-agent adjuvant therapy postoperatively, to observe the efficacy and safety of this treatment modality, and to provide clinical evidence for the use of PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in perioperative treatment of esophageal cancer.
