A Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Epacadostat Administered in Combination With Nivolumab in Select Advanced Cancers (ECHO-204)
This is a Phase 1/2, open label study. Phase 1 consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose-escalation assessment of the safety and tolerability of epacadostat administered with nivolumab in subjects with select advanced solid tumors and lymphomas. Part 2 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of epacadostat in combination with nivolumab and chemotherapy in subjects with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Phase 2 will include expansion cohorts in 7 tumor types, including melanoma, NSCLC, SCCHN, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

DLT included all TEAE of specified grades such as 1) Hematologic toxicities - any Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, ≥ Grade 3 hemolysis, thrombocytopenia and 2) Nonhematologic toxicities - Grade 4 AE, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, electrolyte abnormality, ≥ Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or total bilirubin elevation, Grade 2 AST/ALT with symptomatic liver inflammation, AST or ALT \> 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and concurrent total bilirubin \> 2 × ULN without initial findings of cholestasis, and any other ≥ Grade 3 toxicity. A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug and up to 100 days after last dose of study drug., Day 42|Phase 1, Part 2: Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT was defined as occurrence of any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) in Phase 1 Parts 1 and 2.

A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug and up to 100 days after last dose of study drug., Day 42|Phase 1, Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants With At Least One Treatment-Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug and up to 100 days after last dose of study drug., up to approximately 39 months|Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR) in Participants With Select Solid Tumors Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1 for Participants With Solid Tumors and Per Cheson Criteria for Participants With DLBCL, ORR was defined as the percentage of participants having a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by investigator assessment of radiographic disease per RECIST v1.1. CR per RECIST v 1.1 was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR per RECIST v 1.1 was defined as At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters. Data is reported as per dose received by the participants with a particular cancer type. CR per Cheson criteria was defined as complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms. PR per Cheson criteria was defined as at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses., From first dose up end of the study (up to approximately 6 years)|Phase 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease per RECIST v1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From first dose up end of the study (up to approximately 6 years)|Phase 2: Overall Survival (OS) Rate of Proportion With Glioblastoma, OS rate is defined as the proportion of participants alive 9 months after the start of treatment., Month 9
Phase 1, Part 2: ORR Per RECIST v1.1 and for Participants With Advanced or Metastatic SCCHN and Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC, ORR was defined as percentage of participants having CR or PR as determined by investigator assessment of radiographic disease per RECIST v1.1. CR per RECIST v 1.1 was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters., From first dose up end of the study (up to approximately 6 years)|Phase 1, Part 1: ORR Per RECIST v1.1 for Participants With Solid Tumors; Per Cheson Criteria for Participants With B-cell NHL; and Per RANO and mRANO Criteria for Participants With GBM, ORR was defined as percentage of participants having CR or PR as determined by investigator assessment of radiographic disease per RECIST v1.1. CR per RECIST v 1.1 was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters. Per Cheson criteria, CR: complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease-related symptoms. PR: at least a 50% decrease in SPD of up to 6 of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. Per RANO criteria, CR: Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non-measurable disease sustained.

CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as At least a 30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SOD of target lesions., From first dose up end of the study (up to approximately 6 years)|Phase 1, Part 2: PFS for Participants With Advanced or Metastatic SCCHN and Advanced or Metastatic NSCLC, PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., From first dose up end of the study (up to approximately 6 years)|Phase 2: Duration of Response, DOR is defined as the time from the first overall response contributing to an objective response (CR or PR) to the earlier of the participant's death and first overall response of PD. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SOD of target lesions., From first dose up end of the study (up to approximately 6 years)|Phase 2: Duration of Disease Control, Defined as CR, PR, and Stable Disease (SD), Duration of disease control is the time from the first dose to the first objective response of PD, or death, whichever occurs first, for participants who reported a best overall response of SD or better. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SOD of target lesions. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters., From first dose up end of the study (up to approximately 6 years)|Phase 2: Safety and Tolerability Measured by the Number of Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Fatal Treatment Emergent AEs, An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug and up to 100 days after last dose of study drug. Adverse events of grade 5 which result in death are called as fatal AEs., up to approximately 35 months
