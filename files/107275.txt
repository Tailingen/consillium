Role of Perfusion CT in Pancreatic Cancer
The purpose of this study is

1. to determine whether the perfusion parameters in the normal pancreas and the pancreas cancer (adenocarcinoma or neuroendocrine tumor) are different on perfusion CT
2. to determine whether initial perfusion parameters as well as perfusion parameter change in pancreas adenocarcinoma before and after chemotherapy are different between chemotherapy response group (CR, PR according to RECIST 1.1) and non response group (SD, PD according to RECIST 1.1).
Adenocarcinoma, Pancreas|Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of Pancreas
DRUG: iopromide|PROCEDURE: CT
Evaluation of the correlation between the initial perfusion parameters of the tumor and response of the chemotherapy, Initial perfusion parameters (blood volume, blood flow and permeability) are compared between CTx-responder and non-responders after 6 cycle of the scheduled chemotherapy, using RECIST 1.1 criteria., after 6 cycles of the planned chemotherapy
Correlation between change of perfusion parameters and the chemotherapy response, Perfusion parameters (blood volume, blood flow, and permeability) change between initial perfusion CT and second perfusion CT (which is taken after 2 cycle of the CTx) are compared between CTx-responder and non-responder after finishing 6 cycles of CTx according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., after 6 cycles of the chemotherapy|Perfusion parameters among different pancreas tumors, Perfusion parameters (blood volume, blood flow and permeability) are compared among the different types of the pancreas tumors to investigate perfusion parameters can help characterization of the tumors., within 2 months after finishing enrollment|comparison of perfusion parameters among the pancreas tumors and parenchyma, blood volume, blood flow and permeability are compared between the tumor and the pancreas parenchyma., within three weeks before pancreas tumor surgery
1. Performance of preoperative perfusion CT for preoperative staging is assessed by comparing with operative finding and histologic disease staging
2. Estimation of initial or change of pancreas cancer perfusion parameters and whether those can provide cut-off value for predicting response of chemotherapy in patients with pancreas adenocarcinoma
