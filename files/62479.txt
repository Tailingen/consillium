B001 in Patients With CD20 Positive B-cell Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma
It's the first-in-human study of Recombinant Humanized Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody for Injection (B001). The main purpose of this study is to explore the safety and tolerance of B001 for patients with CD20 positive B-cell non Hodgkin's lymphoma. It will also explore the PK/PD manner and ORR in this study.
