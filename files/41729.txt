This study evaluates the effect of the SMS intervention 'Connected2Care' on the attendance rate to cervical cancer screening follow-up appointments.
Cervical Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Connected to Care
Effect of SMS intervention on attendance rate to follow-up screening appointment, The effect measure of the intervention is the 14-month follow-up attendance rate for HPV positive women. The number of women in the intervention group that attend follow-up screening will be compared to the the number of women that attend follow-up screening in the control group., up to 14 months

Connected2Care is a non-blinded, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial. Tanzanian Women testing positive to HR HPV at inclusion are randomly assigned in an allocation ratio of 1:1 to the SMS intervention or the control group (standard care). In a period of 10 months, the intervention group will receive 15 one-directional health educative text messages and SMS-reminders for their appointment. The total sample size will be 700 with 350 women in each study arm. Primary outcome is attendance rate for follow-up. Secondary objectives are cost-effectiveness measured through incremental ratios and knowledge of cervical cancer by a 16-item true/false scale questionnaire at baseline and follow-up.
