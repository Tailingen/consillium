Evaluation of the PROSTia Test in Patients Undergoing Prostate Biopsy
The investigators are interested here in the contribution of a new prostate cancer screening method and, more specifically, in the new and somewhat futuristic approach of artificial intelligence in the development of new, more accurate algorithms that make it possible to rethink the benefits of mass generalisation of prostate biopsies.

Main objective The main objective of this research is to use artificial intelligence and an associated algorithm to identify new indicators that would make it possible to avoid a prostate biopsy in patients with an initial suspicion of prostate cancer.

.1. Outline of the study The lack of accuracy of the PSA test for prostate cancer screening leads to negative biopsies. The aim of this study is to determine whether the PROSTia test, a personalised medicine test using artificial intelligence (AI) by combining PSA, digital rectal examination (DRE) and 60 other qualitative data, could reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and to estimate its impact on the detection of clinically significant cancers.

PROSTia employs the Gradient Boosting technique to select the variables of interest and optimise model performance. This process entails the utilisation of successive decision trees to model the non-linear relationships between the input variables and cancer risk. The construction of each tree is predicated on the correction of errors identified in preceding trees, with a focus on cases that have been misclassified. This iterative process is instrumental in generating a robust and accurate model for the purpose of prostate cancer screening

2 Methodology

The result of the PROSTia test is a score on a scale of 0 to 2. A score greater than or equal to 1 is considered a positive result. A positive result means that the patient has a significant risk of developing prostate cancer in the next 12 years. The following statistical analyses are performed using a 95% confidence interval:

* Sensitivity
* Specificity
* Positive likelihood ratio
* Negative likelihood ratio
* Disease prevalence
* Positive predictive value
* Negative predictive value
* Accuracy

Sensitivity, specificity, disease prevalence, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy are expressed as percentages.

Confidence intervals for sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are Clopper-Pearson 'exact' confidence intervals.

Confidence intervals for likelihood ratios are calculated using the logarithmic method as described on page 109 of Altman et al. 2000. Confidence intervals for predictive values are standard logit confidence intervals according to Mercaldo et al. 2007, except when the predictive value is 0 or 100%, in which case a Clopper-Pearson confidence interval is reported.

3. Number of patients The investigators set the number of patients at 150. This is a synthetic comparative study of a single patient cohort (i.e. there is no intervention as such; the cohort is compared to what it would be if the PROSTia test had been available).

Here are the assumptions that led to this number. Primary endpoint: binary (presence vs absence of disease).

Expected proportions: 50% in the study population (p2 without PROSTia) and 70% with PROSTia (p1).

Significance level (α): set at 0.05 Desired power (1-β): set at 0.8

Effect size: (p1-p2) drop rate:

The investigators plan to increase the calculated sample size to account for dropouts. calculated to account for dropouts or non-compliance with certain questionnaires (5%).

The method used to calculate the sample size is that of Woodward (1992).
