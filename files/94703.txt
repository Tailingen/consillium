A Study of Cabozantinib (XL184) vs Everolimus in Subjects With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Cabozantinib (XL184) compared with Everolimus (Afinitor) on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in subjects with advanced renal cell cancer that has progressed after prior VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cabozantinib tablets|DRUG: Everolimus (Afinitor) tablets
Progression-free Survival (PFS), The primary analysis of PFS is the time from randomization to date of first documented tumor progression as determined by investigator (per RECIST 1.1 criteria) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate the median duration., PFS is measured from the date of randomization until the date of first documented disease progression or date of death from any cause as determined by the Independent Radiology Committee (IRC) per RECIST 1.1, assessed for up to 17 months.
Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. Participants that had not died were censored at last known date alive. Median OS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Interim analyses for OS occurred after 320 deaths (78% of the total OS events needed for final analysis)., OS was measured from the time of randomization until 320 deaths, approximately 28 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the number of participants with a best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by number of randomized participants. ORR was assessed by the Independent Radiology Committee (IRC) per RECIST 1.1 which was confirmed by a subsequent visit \>= 28 days later, and was analyzed in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population at the time of the primary analysis of Progression Free Survival (PFS). The data cutoff date was 22 May 2015., ORR was assessed at 8 weeks post-randomization, every 8 weeks for 12 months, and every 12 weeks until date of disease progression or death, up to May 2015 (approximately 21 months)
