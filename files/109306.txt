Efficacy & Safety of Olvi-Vec and Platinum-doublet + Bevacizumab Compared to Physician's Choice of Chemotherapy and Bevacizumab in Platinum-Resistant/Refractory Ovarian Cancer (PRROC) (OnPrime, GOG-3076)
The OnPrime study is a multi-center, randomized open-label phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Olvi-Vec followed by platinum-doublet chemotherapy and bevacizumab compared to the Active Comparator Arm with Physician's Choice of chemotherapy and bevacizumab in women diagnosed with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer (includes fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer). This Phase III trial builds on the efficacy and safety data reported in the previous Phase II VIRO-15 trial with promising objective response rate and progression-free survival observed in heavily pre-treated patients with platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer. The phase II results also showed that the intra-peritoneal route of delivery was efficient in generating tumor cell killing and immune activation, and led to clinical reversal of platinum-resistance or refractoriness in this difficult-to-treat patient population.

Olvi-Vec (olvimulogene nanivacirepvec, aka GL-ONC1, laboratory name: GLV-1h68) is an oncolytic vaccinia virus-based immunotherapy. This study is to test the hypothesis that the combination of Olvi-Vec followed by further chemotherapy is particularly effective against established tumors by virus-mediated immune activation and re-sensitization of tumor cells to chemotherapy. Participant population includes histologically confirmed non-resectable platinum-resistant/refractory ovarian cancer (PRROC). Determination of progression-free survival, safety and overall survival are key objectives. Participants randomized into the Experimental Arm will receive a single-cycle (2 infusions on two consecutive days) of Olvi-Vec through an intraperitoneal catheter. The catheter is then removed, and patients receive systemically administered platinum-doublet chemotherapy and bevacizumab. The control arm receives the Physician's Choice of chemotherapy and bevacizumab at the same dose and schedule. Biological samples will be obtained from some Experimental Arm participants for virus-shedding testing. Assessment of response to treatment in both arms will be by RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST as assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review. Maintenance/continued treatment with non-platinum chemotherapy and bevacizumab is dependent on a participant being clinically stable until confirmed progressive disease by iRECIST or can no longer tolerate therapy.

Dr. Robert W. Holloway (AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, FL) will serve as the National Principal Investigator for this Phase 3 study in PRROC.
