Study of Melphalan Flufenamide (Melflufen) + Dex With Bortezomib or Daratumumab in Patients With RRMM
This is an open-label Phase 1/2a study which will enroll patients that have relapsed or relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma to combination regimens of melflufen with currently approved agents. Patients will receive either melflufen+dexamethasone+bortezomib or melflufen+dexamethasone+daratumumab.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: Melphalan flufenamide (Melflufen)|DRUG: Dexamethasone|DRUG: Bortezomib|DRUG: Daratumumab
Phase 1: Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03.

DLT criteria that apply to Regimens A and B:

* Grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity preventing the administration of \> 1 dose of bortezomib or daratumumab during the 1st cycle.
* Grade 4 or greater non-hematologic toxicity.
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count \< 25,000 cells/ mm\^3) preventing the administration of \> 1 dose of bortezomib or daratumumab during the 1st cycle or with clinically significant bleeding during the 1st cycle.
* Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC \< 500 cells/mm\^3), lasting more than 7 days during the 1st cycle.
* Greater than 14 days' delay to meet the criteria for the start of a new cycle (Cycle 2) due to toxicity., Cycle 1: Day 1 to Day 28|Phase 2: Overall Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a best confirmed response of Partial Response (PR) or better., Until disease progression, death or initiation of subsequent therapy (a maximum of 194.3 weeks)
Best Response (BR), BR defined by International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria. BR= Complete Response (CR)/Stringent CR (sCR) defined as below negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and \< 5% plasma cells in bone marrow/plus normal free light chain (FLC) ratio and absence of clonal cells in bone marrow by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence, Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)= serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or \> 90% reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level \< 100 mg/24 hours, Partial Response (PR)= a \> 50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24 hours urinary M-protein by \> 90% or to \< 200 mg/24 hours, Minimal Response (MR), Stable Disease (SD)= not meeting the criteria for other response options, Progressive Disease (PD)= increase of \> 25% from lowest response value in serum/urine M-component or bone marrow plasma cell percentage, or non-evaluable., Until disease progression, death or initiation of subsequent therapy (a maximum of 194.3 weeks)|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined for participants with confirmed objective response (PR or better, which includes PR, VGPR, CR and sCR) as the time from the first documentation of objective response to the first documentation of objective progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Until disease progression, death or initiation of subsequent therapy (a maximum of 194.3 weeks)|Time to Response (TTR), Time from Cycle 1 Day 1 to a response of PR or better., Until disease progression, death or initiation of subsequent therapy (a maximum of 194.3 weeks)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time in months from date of initiation of therapy to the earlier of confirmed disease progression or death due to any cause., Until disease progression, death or initiation of subsequent therapy (a maximum of 194.3 weeks)|Overall Survival (OS), Time from the first dose of melflufen to death due to any cause., Up to 24 months following confirmed disease progression, or initiation of subsequent therapy (a maximum of 198.9 weeks)|Duration of Clinical Benefit (DOCB), DOCB was defined as time in months from the first evidence of confirmed assessment of sCR, CR, VGPR, PR or MR to first confirmed disease progression, or to death due to any cause., Until disease progression, death or initiation of subsequent therapy (a maximum of 194.3 weeks)|Time to Progression (TTP), TTP defined as time from first dose to first documented confirmed progression., Until disease progression, death or initiation of subsequent therapy (a maximum of 194.3 weeks)|Clinical Benefit Rate (≥ Minimal Response), ≥ Minimal response for participants included sCR, CR, VGPR, PR and MR., Until disease progression, death or initiation of subsequent therapy (a maximum of 194.3 weeks)|Time to Next Treatment (TTNT), Defined as time from date of initiation of therapy to start of next line of therapy., Until death or initiation of subsequent therapy (a maximum of 194.3 weeks)|Number of Participants Who Experienced a Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE), TEAEs were defined as adverse events (AEs) that started after the first dose of study medication was administered and within 30 days of the last administration of the study treatment or before start of subsequent anticancer treatment (whichever occurred first) or that worsened after the first dose of study medication was administered., Cycle 1 Day 1 up to a maximum of 198.9 weeks
