Comparison of Autogenic and Allogenic NK Immunotherapy on the Outcome of Recurrent Solid Tumors
The aim of this study is the efficacy of autogenic and allogenic natural killer (NK) immunotherapy on recurrent solid tumors.
Malignant Solid Tumour
BIOLOGICAL: NK immunotherapy
Relief degree of tumors, It will be evaluated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors（RECIST）, 3 months
Progress free survival（PFS）, 1 year|Overall survival（OS）, 3 years
By enrolling patients with multiple kinds of solid tumor adapted to enrolled criteria, this study will document for the first time the short/long term efficacy of auto/allogenic NK cells.The outcome will be evaluated according to local relief degree, progress free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
