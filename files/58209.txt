Ablative Radiotherapy to Consolidate Maximal Systemic Response in Metastatic Prostate Cancer (ANCHOR-Prostate)
A phase IIR cmRCT trial companion to PERa registry, investigating the merit of SABR consolidation in men with metastatic prostate cancer. 80 patients will be randomly selected to be offered experimental SABR based on PSMA-PET detected disease after maximal systemic response. The primary endpoint is the rate of FFS at 1 year. Patients will be stratified according to hormone sensitive vs resistant disease prior to randomisation.
