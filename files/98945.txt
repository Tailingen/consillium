A Study of SHR-1802 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumor
To assess the safety and tolerability of SHR-1802 combined with camrelizumab and famitinib in subjects with advanced solid tumor and to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)，recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and assess objective response rate (ORR) assessed by the investigator based on RECIST v1.1 criteria.
