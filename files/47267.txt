This is a global, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate whether treatment with daraxonrasib will improve progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) compared to docetaxel chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC who were previously treated. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daraxonrasib or docetaxel chemotherapy.
