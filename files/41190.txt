Evaluating Trifluridine/Tipiracil Based Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer - The Phase I/II TARC Trial
Seamless phase I/II trial with phase I part for determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Trifluridine/tipiracil, followed by a randomized phase II trial (randomization ratio 2:1) with an experimental arm with Trifluridine/tipiracil based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and a standard - calibration arm (internal control) with capecitabine CRT flanked by translational research in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer

This is a multicenter randomized seamless phase I/II trial with a phase I for determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Trifluridine/tipiracil, followed by a randomized phase II trial (randomization ratio 2:1) with an experimental arm with Trifluridine/tipiracil in combination with standard radiotherapy and a standard - calibration arm (internal control) with capecitabine CRT flanked by translational research, designed to assess the clinical performance and efficacy of Trifluridine/tipiracil compared to current standard capecitabine chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

The primary clinical objective in phase I is to determine the dosage and feasibility of Trifluridine/tipiracil based chemoradiation and in phase II whether Trifluridine/tipiracil with preoperative chemoradiation improves pathological complete remissions in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

The secondary objectives are to evaluate Trifluridine/tipiracil chemoradiation with respect to disease free survival, overall survival, local regional failure, pathological down-staging (ypT0-2N0) rate, tumour regression grade, histopathological R0 resection rate, neoadjuvant rectal score (NAR), and perioperative complication rate. Safety and toxicity, according to NCI CTC AE v5, quality of life and feasibility of the regimen are further secondary objectives that are to be evaluated.
