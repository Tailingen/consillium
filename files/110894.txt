Can Needle Size Improve Cancer Detection Rate of Transperineal MRI Target Prostate Biopsy Without Affecting Side Effects?
Differences in terms of diagnostic capability and side effects related to the needle caliber used for prostate biopsy sampling in patients with suspected prostate cancer
Prostate Cancer Diagnosis
DEVICE: different needle size for prostate biopsy
Total number of random and fusion-target biopsies with presence of prostate cancer, The primary outcome measure involves assessing the total number of biopsies, including both random and fusion-targeted approaches, that reveal the presence of prostate cancer., When histological report available|Number of random and fusion-target biopsies with clinically significant prostate cancer (defined as International Society of Urological Pathology >=2), The primary outcome measure focuses on the number and the detection rates of random and fusion-target biopsies revealing clinically significant prostate cancer aof clinically significant prostate cancer (defined as ISUP \>=2) between 16-gauge and 18-gauge biopsy needles., When histological report available
Neoplasia/core ratio for each random and fusion-target biopsy, Neoplasia/core ratio, indicates the ratio of neoplastic tissue to healthy tissue within biopsy cores obtained through both 16 and 18 gauge biopsies for prostate cancer diagnosis. By analyzing this ratio, investivators seek to identify differences in diagnosis across the two different sizes, When histological report available|Intra- and perioperative pain with 18G and 16G needles assessed using visual analog scale (VAS), The validated pain questionnaire employed in this study is designed to comprehensively assess the intra- and perioperative pain (following 7 days) experienced by patients undergoing prostate biopsy procedures with 18G and 16G needles. The visual analog scales "VAS" is a standardized validated questionnaire, a horizontal line, where one end represents "1 - no pain" and the other end represents "10 - worst possible pain." Patients are asked to mark on the line the point that best represents the intensity of their pain., 30 days|Number of hospitalizations at 30 and 60 days post-procedure, By tracking the number of hospitalizations occurring at both 30 and 60 days post-procedure among patients undergoing prostate biopsy within these specific time frames, researchers seek to assess the short-term post-procedural outcomes and potential complications associated with the biopsy procedure. These hospitalization data will provide information into the safety profile and healthcare utilization patterns following prostate biopsy, aiding in the optimization of patient care and risk management strategies., 60 days from biopsy|Number of intra- and perioperative complications associated with 18G and 16G needles, Intraoperative complications refer to adverse events occurring during the biopsy procedure itself, while perioperative complications encompass those arising in the immediate post-procedural period. These complications may include but are not limited to bleeding, infection, urinary retention, and vasovagal reactions. By documenting these complications, investigators will evaluate the safety profile and potential risks associated with each needle gauge, thereby informing clinical decision-making and optimizing patient outcomes., 30 days
To assess whether a larger caliber (16G) prostate biopsy needle increases the diagnostic capability of prostate neoplasia compared to a smaller caliber (18G) needle, while keeping perioperative complications constant.
