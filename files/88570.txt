Sintilimab in Combination with Chemotherapy ± Local Treatment for Om-G/GEJ
Gastric cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers globally, with poor prognosis. About 70% of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the median overall survival (OS) is only 3-4 months. Current treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy, have slightly improved survival, but most patients still experience disease progression during treatment, and those with PD-L1 CPS ≤5 do not benefit from immunotherapy.

Local radiotherapy, as a palliative treatment, can alleviate symptoms like bleeding, dysphagia, and pain, improving quality of life. Studies show that it significantly improves progression-free survival and may extend overall survival when added to chemotherapy. Therefore, combining local radiotherapy with immunochemotherapy may offer additional survival benefits for patients with advanced gastric cancer.

Progression free survival, defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first., Progression will be assessed based on imaging studies and clinical evaluation, using RECIST v1.1 criteria. Data will be summarized using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and hazard ratios will be calculated., From the date of randomization until tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 24 months
Overall Survival, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause., Overall Survival will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and compared between groups using a log-rank test. Median survival and survival rates at specific time points will be reported., From the date of randomization until death from any cause, assessed up to 36 months|Objective Response Rate, defined as the proportion of participants achieving a complete or partial response, as assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria., Responses will be evaluated through imaging and clinical assessments, with data reported as a percentage along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented objective response, assessed up to 12 months|Time to Progression, defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression, as assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria., Time to Progression will exclude cases of death that occur without documented disease progression. Kaplan-Meier estimates will be used for analysis., From the date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 24 months|Treatment Safety: Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events, as assessed by CTCAE v5.0., Treatment-related adverse events will be categorized based on their severity and relationship to treatment, with descriptive statistics used to summarize their frequency and types., From the date of randomization until the end of treatment, assessed up to 18 months|Time to Symptom Deterioration, based on patient-reported outcomes using validated quality of life instruments (e.g., EORTC QLQ-C30)., Time to Symptom Deterioration is defined as the time from randomization to the first clinically meaningful deterioration in symptom scores, determined by a predefined threshold. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to analyze the data., From the date of randomization until the first documented symptom deterioration, assessed up to 12 months
