In Vitro Evaluation of Immune Responses in Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)
This is an in vitro evaluation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma using patients' blood and tissue to evaluate immune responses related to identified tumor populations and dendritic/CD 8 cells.
Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma|Sezary Syndrome|Mycosis Fungoides
Functional capacity of dendritic cells in-vitro, Evaluate the feasibility of the preparation of dendritic cells (DCs), CD8 and Sezary cells (all CD4 positive) in vitro, obtained from the buffy coats or a skin biopsy from an area with tumor involvement of subjects with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and Sezary syndrome (leukemic stage of CTCL), At each cell collection
Evaluate antigen loading of dendritic cells, Functional DCs can be isolated and effectively loaded with the malignant cells by several methods (coculture and fusion), At each cell collection
This is an in vitro evaluation of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma using patients blood and tissue to evaluate immune responses related to identified tumor populations and dendritic/ CD 8 cells with the following objectives:

* Objective I: Evaluate the feasibility of the preparation of dendritic cells (DCs), CD8 and Sezary cells (all CD4 positive) in vitro, obtained from the buffy coats or a skin biopsy from an area with tumor involvement of subjects with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and Sezary syndrome (leukemic stage of CTCL) undergoing an approved FDA therapy, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP).
* Objective II: Evaluate antigen loading of the DCs.
* Objective III: Test the functional capacities of the DCs derived from CTCL subjects to overcome immune tolerance to the tumor cells ex-vivo, by using modified Elispot assay in conjunction with Granzyme B Elispot assay as a measurement of cytotoxicity.
