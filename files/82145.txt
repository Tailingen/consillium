Famitinib Plus Anti-PD1 Therapy for Advanced Urinary System Tumor, Advanced Gynecological Tumors
Phase II multi-chort, adaptive two-stage, open label, nonrandomized study. The aim of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210(Camrelizumab) in combination with a small-molecule multikinase inhibitor Famitinib in subjects with advanced RCC/UC/CC/EC and recurrent OC.

chort1: Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) chort2: Urothelial Carcinoma(UC) chort3: Ovarian Cancer (OC) chort4: Cervical Cancer (CC) chort5: Endometrial Cancer (EC)
