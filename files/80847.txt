PD-1 Knockout Engineered T Cells for Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
This study will evaluate the safety of PD-1 knockout engineered T cells in treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Blood samples will also be collected for research purposes.
Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|OTHER: PD-1 Knockout T Cells
Number of Participants With Adverse Events and/or Dose Limiting Toxicities as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Dose of PD-1 Knockout T Cells Using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0) in Patients, Dose Escalation - Approximately 6 months
Number of Patients With Overall Response, Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.", 3 months|Number of Patients With Disease Control at 8 Weeks, Response will be evaluated according to RECIST v1.1 for target lesions at Week 8：Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions; Partial Response (PR) ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD; Disease control = CR +PR+SD, 8 weeks|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, The time from the date of first edited T cell infusion to the date of disease progression or death due to any reason.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time interval from date of first edited T cell infusion to the date of death due to any reason, The duration from date of first edited T cell infusion to the date of death due to any reason|Number of Participants With Genes Mutations in Peripheral Blood Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA), Driver genes mutaion stauts of Participants in ctDNA from peripheral blood were assessed by next generation sequencing (NGS), to explore the positive rate of sepicif driver genes (e.g. EGFR, ALK, ROS1, etc.) and the relationship between gene mutation status and clinical response, Baseline|Interleukin-6 Change in the Peripheral Blood., Peripheral Interleukin-6 level at different timepoint (Baseline, 1 month and 3 month) was measured using rate nephelometry, Baseline, 1 month and 3 month|Interleukin-10 Change in the Peripheral Blood., Peripheral Interleukin-10 level at different timepoint (Baseline, 1 month and 3 month) was measured using chemiluminescence., Baseline, 1 month and 3 month|Tumor Necrosis Factor-a Change in the Peripheral Blood., Peripheral Tumor Necrosis Factor-a level at different timepoint (Baseline, 1 month and 3 month) was measured using chemiluminescence., Baseline, 1 month and 3 month
This is a dose-escalation study of ex-vivo knocked-out, expanded, and selected PD-1 knockout-T cells from autologous origin. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups to determine the maximal tolerant dose. After the lower number of cycles are considered tolerant, an arm of the next higher number of cycles will be open to next patients. Biomarkers and immunological markers are collected and analyzed as well.
