Efficacy and Safety of Ribociclib in Combination With NSAI Versus Physician's Choice of Chemotherapy Sequential Endocrine Therapy in HR+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer
Evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ribociclib in combination with NSAI versus physician's choice of chemotherapy sequential endocrine therapy in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer.
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: physician's choice of chemotherapy sequential Ribociclib combined with NSAI±OFS|DRUG: Ribociclib combined with NSAI±OFS
Progression Free Survival, Progression-free survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression as per local review and according to RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
Progression Free Survival2, Refers to the time from randomization to disease progression or death after a patient enters a clinical trial and receives second-line therapy., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Time to treatment failure, Time to treatment failure is defined as the time from the date of randomization/start of treatment to the earliest of date of progression, date of death due to any cause, change to other anti-cancer therapy, or date of discontinuation due to reasons other than 'Protocol violation' or 'Administrative problems'., From randomization to treatment failure or withdrawal from the trial; reasons for withdrawal can be patient request, disease progression, death, or adverse events, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Overall response rate (ORR), Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients whose best overall response is either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as per local review and according to RECIST 1.1., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Overall survival(OS), Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 100 months|Time To Response (TTR), Time to response is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the first documented response of either CR or PR, which must be subsequently confirmed, as defined by RECIST 1.1., From the date of randomization to the first documented response of either CR or PR, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Clinical benefit rate(CBR), Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, or PR or stable disease, lasting for a duration of at least 24 weeks, as defined by RECIST 1.1., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Change from baseline in the global health status/QOL scale score by using FACT-B questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B) will be collected to assess health-related QoL, health status, functioning, disease symptoms, side effects, and cancer-related pain.

Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the overall score at each scheduled assessment time point. Additionally, change from baseline at the time of each assessment will be summarized.

The distribution of time to definitive 10% deterioration in the global health status from FACT-B questionnaire will be assessed in the two treatment arms. Scores range from 0 to 4. no subscale. 0 score is the worst for social/family and functional wellbeing and 4 is the worst for physical, emotional wellbeing and additional concerns., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Frequency/severity of adverse events, lab abnormalities, Safety of ribociclib in combination with NSAI and OFS, and combination chemotherapies, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months
The main goal of this clinical trial is to compare in the efficacy of Ribociclib in combination with NSAI versus physician's choice of chemotherapy sequential endocrine therapy in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer and evaluate the PCR DFS,OS and safety of the subjects. The main question it aims is comparing the efficacy and safety of first-line application of CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with initial endocrine therapy versus sequential endocrine therapy after chemotherapy induction therapy in HR+/HER2-advanced breast cancer with rapidly progressive disease.

This study is planned to include 144 patients with HR+/HER2-advanced breast cancer with rapidly progressive disease between November 2023 and November 2025 who meet the entry criteria. A central dynamic randomisation system was used for 1:1 allocation to the repositories combined with NSAI treatment group and the physician's choice of chemotherapy sequential repositories combined with NSAI treatment group, with stratification factors including: level of HR expression, and presence of liver/lung metastases.
