The ADAPTA Study: ADjuvant chemotherAPy After Curative Intent resecTion of Ampullary Cancer.
Ampullary adenocarcinoma (AAC) is a rare gastrointestinal cancer with varying survival rates, particularly the aggressive pancreatobiliary (PB) subtype. Adjuvant therapy benefits only PB and mixed subtype patients, while prospective studies are required for validation. A study proposes tailored adjuvant treatments (CAPOX for intestinal subtype, FOLFIRINOX for PB and mixed subtypes) based on histopathology to enhance survival, also exploring molecular sub-studies for deeper insights.

Disease-free survival (3y), Disease-free survival (DFS) refers to the length of time after treatment for a disease in months, such as cancer, during which no signs or symptoms of the disease recur or progress. It is a crucial measure in assessing the effectiveness of a treatment regimen in preventing the return of the disease. In cancer contexts, DFS focuses on the period without disease recurrence or progression, highlighting the success of the treatment in controlling the illness., 3 years
Overall survival (3y), Overall survival (OS) is a critical medical outcome that measures the length of time in months from the start of treatment or diagnosis until a patient's death due to any cause. It provides a comprehensive view of the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention in extending a patient's life expectancy. OS is a fundamental endpoint in clinical trials and medical research, reflecting the real-world impact of medical strategies on patients' survival outcomes., 3 years|Disease-free survival (5y), Disease-free survival (DFS) refers to the length of time in months after treatment for a disease, such as cancer, during which no signs or symptoms of the disease recur or progress.

It encompasses various physical, emotional, social, and functional aspects of a patient's life, beyond just medical outcomes. QoL assessments provide valuable insights into how a treatment affects patients' daily functioning, emotional state, pain levels, social interactions, and overall sense of health and happiness. The questionnaires utilized in the ADAPTA study are the EQ-5D and the QLQ-C30., 3 years
Background:

Ampullary adenocarcinoma(AAC) is rare. 5-year survival rates of 30% to 70% are seen after resection. This broad range of survival could be explained by the morphological heterogeneity in the three subtypes of AAC (pancreatobiliary, intestinal and mixed subtype), which complicates the prediction of individual prognosis and clinical decision making with regard to adjuvant therapy. To date there are no prospective studies to elucidate whether adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in these patients.

Methods/design:

The ADAPTA study is a phase II prospective single arm multicenter cohort study including 200 patients with resected AAC (100 patients with intestinal subtype, and 100 with pancreatobiliary- and mixed subtype). All patients will be treated with CAPOX/ FOLFIRINOX respectively. Outcomes will be compared after propensity score matching to data of all patients in consecutive participating centers not treated according to the proposed regime.
