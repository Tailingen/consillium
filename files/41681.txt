Phase IB/II of CPX-351 for Relapse Prevention in AML
This is a phase IB/II study with a 3+3 dose de-escalation study design. Patients will continue maintenance treatment with CPX-351 for 6 cycles on D1 and D3, as long as patient remains in CR. The dose de-escalation will be one dose given on D1 only, every 28 days pending toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose will be used for the phase II expansion portion of the study.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Remission
DRUG: CPX-351
Maximum tolerate dose (Phase 1), Number of subjects with Dose Limiting toxicities will be used to determine the recommended phase II dose of CPX-351 to be used in the maintenance setting for newly diagnosed AML in complete remission., 1 cycle (28 day cycle)|Inicidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse events (Phase 2), To determine the safety, tolerability and toxicity of CPX-351 in the maintenance setting for newly diagnosed AML in complete remission by analyzing the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events reported., 6 cycles (28 day cycles)
Incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (Phase 1), To determine the safety, tolerability and toxicity of CPX-351 in the maintenance setting for newly diagnosed AML in complete remission by analyzing the incidence of treatment emergent adverse events reported., 6 cycles (28 day Cycle)|Overall Survival (Phase 1 and 2), Determine the efficacy of CPX-351 as maintenance treatment in newly diagnosed AML patients who have achieved remission after induction treatment as measured by overall survival of subjects., 1 year after end of treatment|Event free survival (Phase 1 and 2), Determine efficacy of CPX-351 as maintenance treatment in newly diagnosed AML patients who have achieved remission after induction treatment as measured by event free survival., 1 year after end of treatment|Relapse Free Survival (Phase 1 and 2), Determine efficacy of CPX-351 as maintenance treatment in newly diagnosed AML patients who have achieved remission after induction treatment as measured by relapse free survival., 1 year after end of treatment
