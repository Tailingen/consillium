The Study is Observational and Retrospective: Lifestyle, BMI and Activity Physical.
The goal of this observational-retrospective study is to learn about the long-term effects of a lifestyle intervention inclusive of dietary counselling and physical activity advice, on body weight in female breast cancer survivors who took the intervention in previous years compared to those who did not take it.

The main question it aims to answer is:

Participants are asked to answer online survey questions about their anthropomethry, clinical conditions, socio-economical status, dietary habits, physical activity levels, quality of life, sleep quality and pshycological distress.

Investigators will use data from 428 women with a 5-yr primary diagnosis of BC (stages I-III at ages â‰¥30 \<75 anni). Half of this sample (N=214) who followed integrated lifestyle treatment of behavioral modification of diet and physical activity conducted by Pascale Institute since 2016; the other half (N=214) will be patients who were eligible to participate but did not for logistic reasons.
