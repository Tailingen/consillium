A Phase II Study of Surgical Debulking With Peritonectomy and Biweekly Intraperitoneal 5FU With Systemic Oxaliplatin/5FU/Leucovorin in Patients With Pseudomyxoma Peritonei or Peritoneal Carcinomatosis
This study prospectively evaluates a multidisciplinary approach to patients with intraperitoneal carcinomatosis at Washington University. Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis or pseudomyxoma peritonei will undergo debulking surgery with peritonectomy and placement of adhesive barrier film followed by repeated delayed intraperitoneal chemotherapy with 5FU with systemic oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy on a biweekly schedule. A retrospective review of patients treated in a similar manner at our institution showed good tolerance and efficacy. This formal Phase II study is planned to determine the safety, toxicities and survival of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis and pseudomyxoma peritonei treated with this regimen.
Peritoneal Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Surgical debulking with peritonectomy|DRUG: Intraperitoneal 5FU|DRUG: FOLFOX
Safety and Tolerability of the Planned Treatment Regimen as Measured by Number of Participants With Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events, 30 days after end of treatment
Progression Rate, -Progressive disease - at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., Median follow-up was 32 months|Number of Participants Who Experience Surgical Complications Associated With This Regimen, Median follow-up was 32 months|Progression-free Survival, Median follow-up was 32 months|Overall Survival, Median follow-up was 32 months
