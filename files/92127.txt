Host Dendritic Cells in Allograft Patients
The purpose of this study is to assess preliminary efficacy and to determine the safety and feasibility of ex vivo generated dendritic cell (HDC) infusion with and without donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). We also wish to establish the feasibility of apheresis shipment as well as vaccine shipment and stability in the population.
