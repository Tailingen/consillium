Osteoarticular Tumor Characterization by Advanced Imaging
The purpose is to compare and evaluate multiple functional imaging methods (perfusion, diffusion, spectroscopy) for initial benign/malignant characterization of osteoarticular tumors and to determine which method or which association of methods could improve non invasive tissue characterization.

Secondary purposes are:

* to determine a possible correlation between some parameters and the histological grade (FNCLCC)
* to suggest a coherent diagnostic imaging approach for osteoarticular tumors.

The ancillary study will enroll patients needing radiological tumor follow-up. The purpose is to identify tools for evaluation of tumor activity and therapeutic response before modification of morpho-volumetric data.

Patients refered for the initial evaluation of suspected osteoarticular masses will be included in this study after signing an informed consent.

Histologic analysis will be used as a gold standard.

The following imaging techniques will be evaluated:

* contrast enhanced ultrasonography
* Low dose CT perfusion
* Magnetic resonance perfusion
* Diffusion weighted imaging
* Magnetic resonance proton spectroscopy
