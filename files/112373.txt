ENB Guided MWA Combined With VATS Versus Sequential Surgery for Synchronous Bilateral Multiple Primary Lung Nodules
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ENB guided MWA combined with VATS versus sequential surgery for synchronous bilateral multiple primary lung nodules. Participants will be divided into two group.One group will accepte treatment of ENB guided MWA combined with VATS,another will accepted sequential surgery.
Multiple Primary Lung Cancer
PROCEDURE: ENB guided MWA combined with VATS|PROCEDURE: sequential surgery
Total perioperative complication rates, Complications refer to operation-related adverse events during and after the operation according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification, including pulmonary infection, Broncho-pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory failure, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, persistent lung leak, arrhythmia, wound infection, death., From the time of treatment to one month after operation

Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. With the improvement of people's health awareness and the wide application of LDCT and HRCT, the incidence of multiple primary lung cancer is increasing, especially the synchronous bilateral multiple primary pulmonary nodules are the difficulties in the treatment of pulmonary nodules. Bilateral sequential surgery is associated with higher intraoperative risks, higher rates of postoperative complications, and lower postoperative quality of life. At present, a small number of recent retrospective studies have shown that microwave ablation(MWA) guided by electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy(ENB) combined with video-assisted thoracic surgery(VATS) treatment can effectively treat bilateral multiple primary pulmonary nodules, which not only has a low complication rate, but also can avoid secondary surgery.

Based on previous studies, the research plans to conduct a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ENB guided MWA combined with VATS versus sequential surgery for synchronous bilateral multiple primary lung nodules, as well as its potential value as a new treatment option for these participants.
