Major Pathologic Response (MPR) Rate, Major pathologic response (MPR) rate is defined as after neoadjuvant treatment, the percentage of residual tumor cells in the tumor bed â‰¤ 10%, regardless of the proportion of patients with residual tumor cells in lymph nodes, From start of treatment to 6 months
Pathologic Complete Response (pCR) Rate, Proportion of patients without residual tumor cells in tumor bed and lymph nodes after neoadjuvant therapy, From start of treatment to 6 months|R0 resection rate, The complete resection rate is the proportion of patients with complete resection, From start of treatment to 6 months|Objective remission rate(ORR), Objective response rate according to RECIST 1.1, approximately up to 12 months|Event-Free Survival (EFS), Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the length of time from enrollment to any of the following events: any progression of disease precluding surgery, progression or recurrence disease assessment per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 after surgery, or death due to any cause. Participants who don't undergo surgery for reason other than progression will be considered to have an event at progression or death., From enrollment to disease progression, reoccurrence, or death due to any cause.(Up to a median of 22 months)
