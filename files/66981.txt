Prevention of Progression of Duodenal Adenomas in Patients With Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
Duodenal carcinomas are the leading cause of mortality in patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) who underwent prophylactic colorectal surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine wether celecoxib combined with ursodeoxycholic acid is an effective chemoprevention strategy to influence the progression of duodenal adenomas to carcinomas in patients with FAP.
