Immunologic Targeting of ESR1 Receptor for Hormone Receptor Expressing Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a pilot study to determine feasibility and safety of the combination of Dendritic Cell (DC1) vaccines and elacestrant in patients with hormone positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer.
Breast Cancer Metastatic Breast Cancer|HER2-negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Elacestrant|BIOLOGICAL: DC1 native/mutated ESR1
Rate of Successful Completion, Feasibility: Defined as a patient's ability and willingness to complete the treatment regimen (8 weeks) to End of Treatment (EOT) (window of + 30 days from date of last study treatment).

Data collection will include rate of successful completion., Up to 2 years|Occurrence Rate, Feasibility: Defined as a patient's ability and willingness to complete the treatment regimen (8 weeks) to End of Treatment (EOT) (window of + 30 days from date of last study treatment).

Data collection will include occurrence rate for each reason stated for non-completion., Up to 2 years|Occurrence of Treatment Related Adverse Events, Number of participants with treatment related adverse events, per event category., Up to 2 years
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression Free Survival (PFS) is measured from the start of treatment until disease progression or death from any cause., Up to 2 years|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is measured by Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) + Stable Disease., Up to 2 years|Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate (ORR) is measured by Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)., Up to 2 years
Dose Limiting Toxicity, Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity; grade ≥ 3 hematologic toxicity thought be at least possibly related to vaccines.

Toxicity data will be reviewed after small groups of patients have been treated and observed for 30 days after the last vaccination.

The study will enroll a total number of 18 patients. Enrollment will be suspended if data suggest that the rate of unacceptable vaccine-related toxicity exceeds 25%., Up to 2 years
