Study of Apatinib Plus Etoposide Capsule as the Therapy of Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of Apatinib Plus Etoposide Capsule as the Therapy of Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer.
Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: Apatinib and Etoposide Capsule
Progression-free Survival (PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, up to 2 year
Overall survival(OS), From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 2 year|Objective Response Rate (ORR), From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, up to 1 year
Small cell lung cancer is a very aggressive cancer, often accompanied by distant metastases, with a poor prognosis. 5-year survival rate of less than 5%, untreated patients with an average survival of only 2-4 months. The investigators consider to add apatinib,a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGF,to the therapy of these patients. The investigators designed the study to explore the possibility of apatinib Plus Etoposide Capsule as the Therapy of Advanced Small Cell Lung Cancer.
