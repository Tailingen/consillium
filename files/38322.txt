Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment to Predict Toxic Events in Older Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma With Imbedded Pilot Study of Pre-Phase Therapy
This study will evaluate the ability of a largely self-administered geriatric assessment (GA) to predict toxicity in non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) patients ≥60 years old receiving chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy.
Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL)|Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)
DRUG: rituximab|DRUG: prednisone|BEHAVIORAL: Geriatric Assessment
Toxicity Assessment, Hospitalization during or within 30 days following chemotherapy Dose delay or reduction to a dose intensity ≤80% of the planned dose intensity. Dose reductions occurring prior to cycle 1 of chemotherapy will be counted as events. Discontinuation of chemotherapy due to toxicity Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity Grade 4 or higher hematologic toxicity. Using the NCI CTCAE v4.0 toxicity grading, 3 years
