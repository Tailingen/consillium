Safety of Catheter Lock With or Without Heparin in Implanted Central Venous Catheters
Long-term central venous access devices are considered as safe for the administration of medication as chemotherapy, but are also used for blood sampling. For years these catheters have been locked with a heparin solution in order to avoid occlusion. However, no scientific evidence supports heparin locking when the device is not in use. Advanced technology as needleless caps and valved catheters and port reservoirs confirms this trend to use 'saline only' for locking these devices. Therefore the investigators hypothesize is that there will be no difference in proportion of occlusions and catheter related bacteremia in long-term venous access devices locked with 'saline only' versus with heparin.
