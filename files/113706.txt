Sequential T and I With H101 Via HAI for BCLC C Stage HCC: A Prospective Single-Center Single-Arm Pilot Study
Indication: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C.

Study Objectives: This study aims to use a prospective single-center single-arm pilot approach to preliminarily obtain data on the recent efficacy and safety of sequential targeted and immunotherapy with recombinant human type 5 adenovirus (H101) administered via hepatic arterial infusion for BCLC stage C HCC. Additionally, it will explore changes in the patients\&#39; immune systems before and after treatment, providing a basis for formal research.

Study Content: The study will use a prospective single-center single-arm pilot design to preliminarily assess the efficacy of sequential targeted and immunotherapy with H101 via hepatic arterial infusion in BCLC stage C HCC. Primary efficacy endpoints include: Objective Response Rate (ORR). Secondary efficacy endpoints include: Disease Control Rate (DCR), Duration of Response (DOR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS) at 6 months and 12 months, Overall Survival (OS) at 6 months and 12 months, Median Progression-Free Survival (mPFS), Liver-specific PFS. Additionally, the study will collect data on safety and tolerability and will explore changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes before and after treatment.

Expected Objectives: Efficacy and Safety Assessment: To preliminarily gather data on the short-term efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sequential targeted and immunotherapy using hepatic arterial infusion of H101 in patients with BCLC stage C HCC. This includes assessing primary efficacy endpoints (e.g., objective response rate) and secondary efficacy endpoints (e.g., disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, etc.). Immune System Changes: To investigate the patterns of peripheral blood lymphocyte changes before and after treatment.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
DRUG: hepatic arterial infusion of recombinant human type 5 adenovirus
Objective response rate (ORR), The ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria., Generally, the ORR is assessed for each participant every two treatment cycles(each cycle is 3 weeks).
Disease control rate (DCR), The percentage of participants who achieve a BOR of CR, PR, or SD lasting at least 6 weeks, assessed according to RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST criteria., Generally, the DCR is assessed for each participant every two treatment cycles(each cycle is 3 weeks).|Duration of response (DoR), DoR is defined as the time from the first recorded objective response (assessed according to RECIST 1.1 and mRECIST criteria) to the first recorded progression of target tumors (assessed according to RECIST 1.1 or mRECIST criteria) or to the date of any earlier death for any reason., Generally, the DoR is assessed for each participant every two treatment cycles(each cycle is 3 weeks).|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the first study treatment date to the first recorded tumor progression (according to RECIST 1.1 or mRECIST criteria, regardless of whether the study is still ongoing) or to the time of any earlier death for any reason., Record the progression-freesurvival state of each participant at six months and twelve months after receiving the initial treatment.|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the first study treatment date to death from any cause., Record the survival state of each participant at six months and twelve months after receiving the initial treatment.
Number of peripheral blood lymphocytes, To understand the changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes before and after treatment., Peripheral blood lymphocyte will be conducted on Day 1±7 days before each of the first three cycles (each cycle is 3 weeks); thereafter, it will be checked every 6 weeks on Day 1±7 days until treatment end/withdrawal(no more than 12 months in total).
