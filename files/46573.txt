A 1/2 Phase Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Antitumor Activity of ASKB589 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is an open label Phase 1/2 study, the purpose of the trial is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of ASKB589 in patients suffering from advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Patients with gastric cancer/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer are preferred.
Malignant Solid Tumor
DRUG: ASKB589 Injection
Number of participants with adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. The number of participants who experience an AE will be presented., up to 21 days following last dose|Number of participants with serious adverse events (SAE) as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.) Results in death; b.) Is life-threatening; c.) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; d.) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; e.) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; f.) Other important medical events; h.) Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study) or i.) Is associated with an overdose. The number of participants who experience an SAE will be presented., up to 21 days following last dose|The incidence and case number of DLT (Dose Limiting Toxicity) during observation period, DLT is short for Dose Limiting Toxicity，dose-limiting describes side effects of a drug or other treatment that are serious enough to prevent an increase in dose or level of that treatment., up to 21 days following first dose|Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD）, The MTD was defined as the highest dose of ASKB589 not causing DLT in more than 33% of patients in the first treatment cycle., up to 21days following first dose|The recommended dose, The recommended dose will be determined during the dose escalation and dose expansion stage of the study., from date of treatment start until data cut-off, up to 2 years|Objective response rate, Evaluation of objective response rate assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1(RECIST 1.1), from date of treatment start until disease progression,date of death or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, up to 2 years
Pharmacokinetics:maximum Plasma Concentration [Cmax], Serum samples will be collected for Cmax analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Pharmacokinetics:time to maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), Serum samples will be collected for Tmax analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Pharmacokinetics:elimination rate constant（Kel）, Serum samples will be collected for Kel analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Pharmacokinetics:terminal elimination half life (T1/2), Serum samples will be collected for T1/2 analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Pharmacokinetics:apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F), Serum samples will be collected for Vz/F analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Pharmacokinetics:Area Under Curve (AUC), Serum samples will be collected for AUC analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Pharmacokinetics: Mean ResidenceTime（MRT）, Serum samples will be collected for MRT analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Pharmacokinetics: plasma clearance rate (CL), Serum samples will be collected for CL analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Pharmacokinetics: steady-state peak concentration (Css_max), Serum samples will be collected for Css_max analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Pharmacokinetics: time to steady-state peak concentration (Tss_max), Serum samples will be collected for Tss_max analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Pharmacokinetics: minimum value of steady plasma drug concentration（Css_min）, Serum samples will be collected for Css max analysis., Up to 21 days after injection|Evaluation of immunogenicity, Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), from date of treatment start until data cut-off, up to 2 years|Objective response rate（ORR）, Evaluation of objective response rate assessed by RECIST 1.1, from date of treatment start until disease progression,date of death or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, up to 2 years|disease control rate（DCR）, Evaluation of Disease control rate assessed by RECIST 1.1, from date of treatment start until disease progression,date of death or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, up to 2 years|Duration of Response（DOR）, Duration of response assessed by RECIST 1.1, from date of treatment start until disease progression,date of death or withdrawal from study,whichever came first, up to 2 years|Progression free survival（PFS）, Progression of tumor will be measured by RECIST v1.1, from date of treatment start until the date of disease progression or until death due to any causes, up to 2 years.|Overall survival（OS）, defined as the time from the date of treatment start until date of death due to any cause, from the date of treatment start until the documented date of death from any cause，up to 2 years.
