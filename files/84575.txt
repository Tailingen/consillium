External Beam Radiation Therapy and Cetuximab Followed by Irinotecan and Cetuximab for Children and Young Adults With Newly Diagnosed Diffuse Pontine Tumors and High-Grade Astrocytomas
Standard treatment for patients with diffuse pontine tumors is radiation therapy, but less than 10% of patients are cured. Adding standard chemotherapy has not improved the cure rate.

Standard treatment for high-grade astrocytomas is surgery and radiation. The surgeon removes as much of the tumor as she or he can. Radiation after that tries to kill any cancer cells that are left. Some patients also get chemotherapy. These are anti-cancer drugs. They can be given during or after radiation. Current standard treatments do not cure many patients.

In this study the doctors are adding a new medication called cetuximab to the treatment and will also use a chemotherapy medication (irinotecan) that has been promising for patients treated for recurrent disease.

OTHER: cetuximab in conjunction with external beam radiation therapy, followed by cetuximab and irinotecan
Number of Participants With High-grade Astrocytoma and Diffuse Pontine Tumors Achieving One Year Progression Free Survival., 1 year|Number of Participants Experiencing Toxicity, To determine the safety of cetuximab administered weekly in conjunction with involved field external beam radiation therapy for diffuse pontine tumors and high-grade astrocytomas, toxicities will be assessed via the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 3.0), 2 years
Time to Progression, 2 years|Number of Participants Who Have Undergone Tumor Analysis, Participant tumor analysis for potential associations between primary tumor tissue molecular markers and tumor response., 2 years|Number of Samples Demonstrating EGFR Copy Number Gain, Identify gene transcripts for putative cetuximab, 2 years|Number of Participant Tumors Analyzed for Potential Association Between Histology (Grade) With Protein and ELISA Measurements of Those Proteins., 2 years|Percentage of Participants With Development of Rash, Either Acneiform and/or Desquamation, The purpose is to investigate whether the rash associated with cetuximab is secondary to an inflammatory pathway initiated and mediated by the action of cetuximab on host cells., 2 years|Event Free Survival, up to 12 months|Overall Survival, Up to 43 months
