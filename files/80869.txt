A LAparoscopic and TransAnal Total Mesorectal Excision (TME) for Rectal Cancer Trial
All patients planned for an anterior resection due to rectal cancer with a total mesorectal excision are included. This is a feasibility study, thus no randomization will be performed.

Primary endpoint is clinical and pathologic examination of the specimen. Secondary end-points include clinical variables such as conversion rate, re-admission and/or re-operation due to any complication and health economy analyses.
Colorectal Neoplasm
Number of specimens with grade I specimen according to Quirke, Comparison with control group, 4 weeks postoperatively
Conversion rate, day of surgery|Re-admission, 30 days|Postoperative complications scored according to Clavien-Dindo within the first 12 months, 12 months
The design is comparative and prospective, we will compare specimens from patients operated at our institution during the last year with standard open or laparoscopic approach with patients operated with the new technique. Patients in the control arm will be patients operated prior to the commencement of the new technique or patients not eligible or possible to include in the study.

It is possible to obtain a macroscopically and microscopically adequate specimen after a combined approach with laparoscopic and transanal TME compared to open or laparoscopic conventional TME.
