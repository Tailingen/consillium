CMV-MVA Triplex Vac.Enhance Adap. NK Cell Recon. After Auto HSCT in pt Lymphoid Malig
This is a prospective, interventional study administering 2 doses of the experimental vaccine (CMV-MVA Triplex) to 20 evaluable patients (10 CMV-seropositive and 10 seronegative) undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for lymphoma or myeloma on days 28 and 56 post-HCT. The absolute number of adaptive NK cells (CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+) at various days will be compared.

Change in the absolute number of CMV-induced adaptive NK cells (CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+) between days 28 and 100 post-auto-HCT in patients with lymphoid malignancies., Change in the absolute number of CMV-induced adaptive NK cells (CD56dimCD57+NKG2C+) on day 28 (pre first vaccine) and day 100 (\~1 month after second vaccine) post-auto- HCT in patients with lymphoid malignancies., Day 28 and Day 100
Change in absolute Number of CMV-induced adaptive NK Cells, Change in absolute number of total NK and NK/T cells between days 28 (first vaccine) and day 100 (\~1 month after second vaccine) post-auto-HCT in patients with lymphoid malignancies (lymphoma and myeloma)., Day 28 and Day 100|Response to CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine in CMV seropositive vs. seronegative patients, Change in the absolute number of adaptive NK cells between day 28 post-transplant and day 100., Day 28 and Day 100|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Incidence of progression-free survival at 1 year in patients receiving CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine with historical controls, 1 Year|Response to CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine in lymphoma vs. myeloma patients, Change in the absolute number of adaptive NK cells between day 28 post-transplant and day 100., Day 28 and Day 100
