This study is a single-arm, multi-center, two-stage, phase II clinical trial conducted in China. This study adopts Simon's two-stage design, and the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria of the two stages were consistent. Six patients with high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasm will be enrolled in the first stage. If more than one complete or partial responses were seen at planned interim analysis, the additional 17 patients will be recruited in the second stage and a total of 23 patients will be treated.
