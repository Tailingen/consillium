The Opinion of Patients With Cancer on the Claeys-Leonetti Law, on Euthanasia and Determining Factors
The law of February 2nd 2016, known as Claeys-Leonetti, reformed the legislation of the end of life. It establishes in particular a right of the patient to deep and continuous sedation, makes advance directives binding but refuses access to euthanasia. It states that artificial hydration and nutrition are treatments and not cares, which means that they can be stopped once they are deemed unnecessary, disproportionate or have no other effect than artificial maintenance of life.

While a number of personalities from all walks of life were heard during the parliamentary debate, it was found that patients were not asked about main issues under discussion. Therefore, the investigators found it useful to collect their opinions in the context of individual interviews.

A feasibility study was carried out among 40 patients, which demonstrated the feasibility of such project. This study is the subject of an article which is currently submitted to the BMC Palliative Care Journal.

The main objective is to contribute to the elaboration of the legislation on the end of life, to its adaptation to the wishes of the patients. Patients with cancer and palliative care are directly affected by the legislation on end-of-life, and it seems legitimate that these legislative provisions correspond to their expectations. The aims also to help caregivers to act in accordance with their wishes.
