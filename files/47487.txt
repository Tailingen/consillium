A Clinical Research of CD70-targeted CAR-NKT Cells (CGC738) Therapy in RCC
This is a phase I, open-label, single-arm study conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety and PK of CGC738 in the treatment of advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
Advanced Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: CGC738
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is an AE that meets the following criteria and occurs within 28 days of CGC738 infusion.AE is graded according to CTCAE version 5.0., Day 28 after CGC738 infusion
ORR, Assess Objective response rate, Day 1 through week 56|DCR, Assess Disease control rate, Day 1 through week 56|AEs, Incidence of adverse events, Day 1 through week 56
This is a single-arm, open-label study. This study will include two parts, dose escalation phase (3+3 design) followed by a dose expansion phase. All eligible participants will receive a conditioning chemotherapy regimen of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by CAR-T cell injection.

Additional patients will be enrolled in the dose expansion phase to further characterize the safety profile and evaluate the efficacy of anti-CD70 CAR-T cell injection.
