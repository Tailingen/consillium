Keynatinib in Treated Patients With NSCLC and Brain Metastases
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Keynatinib capsules in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with brain metastasis or progression of brain metastasis after treatment with EGFR inhibitors. As well as, to evaluate the penetration rate of Keynatinib in the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and its PK characteristics, and the relationship between exposure levels with efficacy and safety.
