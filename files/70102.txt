Treatment of Relapsed and/or Chemotherapy Refractory B-cell Malignancy by Tandem CAR T Cells Targeting CD19 and CD20
RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to kill cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in treating patients with B-cell leukemia or lymphoma that is relapsed (after stem cell transplantation or intensive chemotherapy) or refractory to chemotherapy.

BIOLOGICAL: anti-CD19/20-CAR vector-transduced T cells
Occurrence of study related adverse events, defined as \>= Grade 3 signs/symptoms, laboratory toxicities, and clinical events) that are possibly, likely, or definitely related to study treatment, Until week 24
Anti-tumor responses to tanCART19/20 cell infusions, up to 96 weeks
In vivo existence of TanCART19/20, 2 years
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

To assess the efficacy of TanCAR19/20 T cells in relapsed or refractory NHL, defined as overall response rate (ORR).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TanCAR19/20 T cells. II. To evaluate time to response (TTR), duration of overall response (DOR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

III. To determine in vivo expansion and persistence of TanCAR19/20 T cells.

OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment. Patients receive anti-CD19/20-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)vector-transduced autologous T cells on day1 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 3 years.
