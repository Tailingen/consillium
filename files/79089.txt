Combined Immunochemotherapy Followed By Reduced Dose Radiation Therapy (RT) for Patients With Newly Diagnosed Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to find out if immunotherapy (rituximab) added to chemotherapy is a safe treatment for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a rare tumor. It is usually treated with chemotherapy and radiation. This combination prolongs survival, but about half of patients relapse. The investigators hope that the addition of rituximab will improve the control of the tumor.

The second goal of this study is to assess a lower dose of brain radiation. Brain radiation may cause memory loss or dementia. For patients over the age of 60, the risk of significant memory loss is 80-90%. The risk for younger patients is smaller but less clear. In this, study patients whose tumors are in remission after chemotherapy will be treated with a lower dose of brain radiation. We hope that this lower dose will be less toxic. However, it is also possible that using a lower dose of radiation will be less effective in controlling your tumor.
