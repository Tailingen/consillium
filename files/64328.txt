Carboplatin and Gemcitabine With Bevacizumab Every 2 Weeks for Stage IIIb/IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with carboplatin and gemcitabine combined with bevacizumab every two weeks will provide increased survival.
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
DRUG: Gemcitabine, Carboplatin, Bevacizumab
Time to Progression, Time to progression (progression free survival)is defined as the time from the start of treatment until first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause. For subjects who do not progress, time to progression will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment., From Enrollment Through 2 Years
Best Overall Response by Cycle, Number of patients and their best response recorded from the state of treatment until disease progression. Response was assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST): Complete Response-disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease=small changes that did not meet above criteria., After Cycle 4, Cycle 6 and Cycle 7 of Therapy|Duration of Response, For subjects who show a response, duration of response is defined to be the time from first documented evidence of response(30% decrease or complete disappearance of tumor) until the first documented sign of disease progression or death due to any cause. For subjects who do not progress or die, duration of response will be censored at the time of last tumor assessment., From Enrollment through Date of First Documented Disease Progression or Date of Death From Any Cause, Whichever Came First, Up to 100 Months|Overall Survival Time, Overall survival is defined as the time from the start of treatment until death due to whatever cause. For subjects alive at study completion, time to death will be censored at the time of last contact., Baseline to Death|Time to Best Response, Time to best response is defined as the time from the start of treatment until first documented evidence of tumor response (30% decrease or complete disappearance of tumor). For subjects who do not show a tumor response, the time will be censored at the time of last contact., From Enrollment to First Tumor Response
Treatment with Carboplatin and gemcitabine is one of the most active combination therapies used for first-line therapy of NSCLC. The optimum schedule for administration of carboplatin and gemcitabine is currently unknown.

The addition of bevacizumab to another comparable platinum combination showed an overall survival advantage and a significantly greater response rate and progression-free survival.
