Pulsed Dye Laser in Treating Patients With Post Radiation Dysphonia
This pilot trial studies pulsed dye laser in treating patients with post radiation dysphonia. Dysphonia, or vocal cord scarring, can include trouble with the voice when trying to talk, such as hoarseness, change in voice pitch, and poor voice quality, and it commonly happens after radiation therapy for laryngeal cancer. Pulsed dye laser may improve post radiation dysphonia.

PROCEDURE: laser therapy|OTHER: questionnaire administration
Videostroboscopy rates, Forced choice comparisons will be utilized in the pre and post treatment stroboscopy comparisons., Up to 6 months post-treatment|Change in Voice Handicap Index (VHI)-10 score, The VHI-10 form will be scored and then those numbers will be compared pre and post treatment for each individual., Baseline to 6 months post-treatment|Change in jitter, Laboratory based voice analysis will be performed with evaluations of aerodynamics and acoustics., Baseline and at 6 months post-treatment|Voice quality using the patient self-assessment questionnaire, The post treatment questionnaire form will be scored and then comparisons made for each individual question on the form across our study group. These values will be discrete variables., Up to 6 months post-treatment|Change in shimmer, Laboratory based voice analysis will be performed with evaluations of aerodynamics and acoustics., Baseline and at 6 months post-treatment|Change in noise to harmonic ratio, Laboratory based voice analysis will be performed with evaluations of aerodynamics and acoustics., Baseline and at 6 months post-treatment|Change in mean phonatory flow, Laboratory based voice analysis will be performed with evaluations of aerodynamics and acoustics., Baseline and at 6 months post-treatment
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the use of pulsed dye laser in treatment of the dysphonia that commonly results after radiation therapy for laryngeal carcinoma.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo pulsed dye laser monthly for three months.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.
