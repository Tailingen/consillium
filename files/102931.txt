Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Minnelide
To determine any increase of treatment emergent adverse events when Minnelide capsules are given in combination with paclitaxel., To observe any increase in the number of patients that experience Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥ 5 days or Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever and/or infection; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (or Grade 3 with bleeding); Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related non-hematological toxicity (Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that last \> 72 hours despite maximal treatment when Minnelide is given alone and in combination with paclitaxel compared to the incidence with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel., 24 months
Pharmacokinetics of Minnelide when given with paclitaxel, Area under the concentration curve (AUC) will be determine the exposure of Minnelide, 24 months|Plasma levels of Minnelide when given with paclitaxel, Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) will be measured to determine the effect of Minnelide when given with paclitaxel, 24 months
