Phase II AZD9291 Open Label Study in NSCLC After Previous EGFR TKI Therapy in EGFR and T790M Mutation Positive Tumours
A Phase II, Open Label, Single-arm Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of AZD9291 in Patients with Locally Advanced/Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer whose Disease has Progressed with Previous Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Therapy and whose Tumours are Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation and T790M Mutation Positive
Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: AZD9291
Objective Response Rate (ORR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions. ORR is the percentage of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR (according to independent review) that was confirmed at least 4 weeks later, prior to progression or further anti-cancer therapy., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from first dose until objective disease progression, up to approximately 11 months (at the time of analysis)
Duration of Response (DoR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions. DoR was defined as the time from the date of first documented response (CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed) until the date of documented progression (PD) or death in the absence of disease progression (by investigator assessment)., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from first dose until objective disease progression, up to approximately 11 months (at the time of analysis)|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions; Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as a response nor sufficient growth to qualify as progression; Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of \>=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of NTLs or a new lesion. DCR is the percentage of patients with best response of CR, PR or SD (according to independent review), prior to progression (PD) or further anti-cancer therapy., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from first dose until objective disease progression, up to approximately 11 months (at the time of analysis)|Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Progressive Disease (PD): \>= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of \>=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of NTLs or a new lesion. PFS is the time from date of first dose until the date of PD (by independent review) or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the patient withdrew from AZD9291 therapy or received another anti-cancer therapy prior to progression. Patients who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis were censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST 1.1 assessment., RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from first dose until objective disease progression, up to approximately 11 months (at the time of analysis)
This is a phase II, open label, single arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of AZD9291 (80 mg, orally, once daily) in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor mutation positive and T790M mutation positive NSCLC,who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent. Patients must agree to provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M mutation status following confirmed disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of AZD9291 by assessment of Objective Response Rate according to RECIST 1.1 by an Independent Central Review.
