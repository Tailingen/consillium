The ABC Study: Assessment of Breast Density Classification
The MARIA® breast imaging system is a CE-marked radiofrequency (RF) medical imaging device. The system employs an electromagnetic imaging technique that exploits the dielectric contrast between normal and cancerous tissues. It is the intention that MARIA® will be able to offer a breast density classifier to clinician's but for this project to be successful, data is required. This study will collect the data required for the classifier to be developed.
Breast Cancer
DEVICE: Bilateral MARIA scan
The creation of the required dataset to develop the breast density classification algorithm, Dataset of information containing ground truth breast density from mammogram, 12 months|The creation of that algorithm, Using the current breast density algorithm developed for MARIA to analyse the MARIA images and compare that to the mammographic ground truth, 12 months|The assessment of the performance of that algorithm to measure breast density when compared to the ground truth of the Boyd score, Analyse the values obtained from both the MARIA algorithm and the mammographic ground truth, and look for correlation using the Boyd percentage score of breast density., 12 months
Understand participant acceptability of the MARIA® scan, Using a specially-designed patient questionnaire, analyse feedback on the MARIA scan experience using a scale from Very acceptable-Acceptable-Neither acceptable or unacceptable-Unacceptable-Very unacceptable., 12 months
