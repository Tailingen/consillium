MR-Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Anal Cancer With EScalated-Treatment in a Risk-Optimized Approach
The proposed study is a phase II, single arm, open-label trial of MR-guided radiation therapy (RT) with risk stratified RT dose selection in patients with anal cancer. Based on previous data, a risk adaptive treatment approached is proposed in 4 groups: Low risk, standard risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA will be analyzed to identify novel biomarkers that predict chemoradiotherapy (CRT) response and toxicity.

The EORTC-C30 questionnaire is a 30 item instrument meant to assess some of the different aspects that define the quality of life of cancer patients., 5 years|Quality of life (QOL), Based on the completion of the European Organisation For Research And Treatment Of Cancer (EORTC-AN27) questionnaire. EORTC QLQ-ANL27 includes four quality of life domains: pain, bowel, sexual and stoma care problems and five single item (frequent urination, keeping clean, proximity to toilet, lower limb oedema, planning activities), 5 years
After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo a risk-stratified dose of treatment (radiation dose and chemotherapy number of cycles) based on predefined clinical and biological biomarkers for anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Radiotherapy will be delivered on the MR-Linac for image-guided-radiation therapy (IGRT). Patients will be followed for up to 5 years after radiotherapy and be required to complete questionnaires and clinic visits. Patients have the option to complete blood and tissue samples during the study.
