Hydralazine Valproate for Ovarian Cancer
The current standard for recurrent, persistent or metastatic cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer is palliative chemotherapy with either topotecan, liposomal doxorubicin or gemcitabine, however, the results need to be improved. Epigenetic aberrations play an important role in cancer progression by silencing growth regulatory genes and there is now evidence that inhibitors of DNA methylation and HDAC inhibition synergize the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy.

Objective. To determine the superiority of epigenetic therapy with hydralazine and valproate plus topotecan over placebo plus topotecan upon progression-free survival.

Hypothesis. Hydralazine and magnesium valproate associated to topotecan will increase progression-free survival from 6 to 9 months as compared with the same regimen of chemotherapy plus placebo.
Ovarian Cancer
DRUG: Hydralazine and magnesium valproate|DRUG: Placebo
Progression-Free Survival, 2-years
Safety, response, overall survival., 2-years
Randomized, double-blind phase III trial. A total of 211 patients (alpha 0.5, power 0.8)with cisplatin-resistant recurrent or persistent cancer will be randomized to topotecan + placebo or topotecan + hydralazine + valproate for 6 courses every 4 weeks. Patients will receive an oral dose of hydralazine of 182mg (rapid) or 83mg (slow) according to the acetylator phenotype in a single daily dose and magnesium valproate at an oral dose of 40mg/Kg t.i.d. Both drugs in a slow-release formulation. Experimental drugs or placebo will start from seven days before day 1 of chemotherapy until the end of the sixth course.
