Proton Chemoradiotherapy for High-Risk Soft Tissue Sarcomas
The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of temozolomide and radiation combination in the treatment intended of soft tissue sarcomas.

This study will also look at the tumor tissue that was removed during your initial biopsy and your final surgery for information that may help to treat soft tissue sarcoma in the future. In addition the investigators will examine a sample of your normal tissue (optional) from the inside of your mouth/cheek (to compare it to your tumor tissue) before starting treatment.
