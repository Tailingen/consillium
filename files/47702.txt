Hypofractionated Whole-breast Irradiation With Simultaneously Integrated Boost For Early-Stage Breast Cancer After Breast-conserving Surgery
The study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation with simultaneously integrated boost for early-stage breast cancer after breast conserving surgery in Chinese population.
