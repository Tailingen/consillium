MALE Mamm Organoids
It is believed that the use of organoids derived from male breast tumors can be of fundamental support for the definition of the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of the tumor. Furthermore, the development of such preclinical models could be of significant support for the identification of specific personalized and ad hoc therapeutic treatments for male pathology.
Breast Neoplasms, Male
Tumor tissue samples collected, Samples of tumor and peri-tumor tissue from the same patient, obtained at the time of surgery for the preparation of organoids to verify the functional correspondence of the organoid cultures obtained from the patients, with the tumors of origin. The organoids will be treated in vitro with doses equivalent to the plasma levels of the drugs administered to the patients, and the viability of the organoids will be assessed through ATPlite assays. Subsequently, the viability data will be compared with the response data of the patients., 36 months
The main objective of the project is to set up at least 5 organoid cultures of male breast cancer derived from patients who have undergone surgery. This study will allow to define the success rate in the generation of organoids.

A secondary objective is to verify the correspondence between the organoids generated and the tumor tissue of origin.

In this regard, broad-spectrum molecular investigations will be carried out, such as mutational analysis of DNA through Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), gene expression profiles through RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and small RNA sequencing, proteomic and metabolomic analysis of both the tumors of origin and the cultures of derived organoids (PDO).

Furthermore, to verify the functional correspondence of the organoids with the tumor of origin, in vitro viability tests will be carried out by treating the PDOs with the same drugs administered to the patients.
