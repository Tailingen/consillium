A Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacokinetic Study of BTCT4465A (Mosunetuzumab) as a Single Agent and Combined With Atezolizumab in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
This is a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of BTCT4465A (Mosunetuzumab) administered as a single agent and in combination with atezolizumab in participants with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL and CLL. The study will consist of a dose-escalation stage and an expansion stage where participants will be enrolled into indication-specific cohorts.
