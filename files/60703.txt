De Novo Sirolimus-based Immunosuppression After Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This study investigates whether sirolimus could decrease the rate of hepatoma recurrence after liver transplantation in high risk hepatoma patients.
Liver Carcinoma
DRUG: Sirolimus
Percentage of Participants Surviving at One and Four Years After Liver Transplant, Percent of Patients Surviving at One \& Four years after Liver Transplant was calculated, 1 & 4 years|Percentage of Participants Surviving With no Evidence of Recurrent Tumor at One and Four Years After Liver Transplant, Percentage of Participants Surviving with no Evidence of Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma at One and Four Years After Liver Transplant, 1 and 4 years
Sirolimus Toxicity/Intolerance, Sirolimus toxicity/intolerance requiring discontinuation of sirolimus, 1 year
A total of 70 patients with HCC (mean age: 54.6 years, female/male: 12/58) received a liver transplant and were included in the study. Immunosuppression included de novo sirolimus, low-dose calcineurin inhibitor for 6 to 12 months, with short-course (3 months) or no steroids.
