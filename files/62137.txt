A Study of ASP2215 in Combination With Induction and Consolidation Chemotherapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
The purpose of phase 1 part in this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended expansion dose (RED) of ASP2215 concomitant with cytarabine/idarubicin as induction chemotherapy based on the status of the onset of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in newly diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) subjects. Phase 1 part also evaluated safety and tolerability and characterized the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ASP2215 concomitant with induction and consolidation chemotherapy as well as evaluated the PK parameters of cytarabine concomitant with ASP2215.

The purpose of phase 2 part was to evaluate efficacy of ASP2215 in combination with induction therapy. Phase 2 cohort also evaluated safety and characterized the PK parameters of ASP2215 in combination with induction and consolidation therapy followed by maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML subjects.

This study was composed of Phase 1 part (the dose-evaluation part and the expansion part) and Phase 2 part.

In the dose-evaluation part of Phase 1 part, at least 3 subjects received ASP2215 at each dose (low, middle, and high) for determination of MTD and/or RED. Treatment of AML in Phase 1 part was composed of 3 periods of therapy: remission induction, consolidation, and maintenance. The decision of whether or not to proceed to the next dose was made based on the occurrence of DLT during Cycle 1 of the induction period.

In the expansion part of Phase 1 part, a maximum of 3 subjects received ASP2215 at RED that had been recommended in the dose-evaluation part and the safety was assessed based on the onset of DLTs during Cycle 1 of the induction and consolidation periods.

In Phase 2 part, Subjects received ASP2215 at the recommended dose established in Phase 1 part. The target population was limited to newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML.
