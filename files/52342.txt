Endostar Combined With Paclitaxel and Nedaplatin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Esophageal Cancer
This phase Ⅱ study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endostar combined with paclitaxel and nedaplatin as first-line therapy in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer.

The prognosis of recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer is poor. However, there is still no standard chemotherapy regimen recommended for this disease because of the lack of trails. Currently, anti-angiogenesis therapy had been proved to improve the survival successfully in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, glioma and kidney cancer. Recent studies showed that the high level of VEGF was negative correlated with the prognosis of esophageal cancer. Endostar, as a novel endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, was proved to significantly inhibited the proliferation and metastasis in esophageal cell lines and animal models. A retrospective study also reported the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy of paclitaxel liposome and recombinant human endostatin. Based on the basis above, we designed this phase Ⅱ study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of endostar combined with paclitaxel and nedaplatin as first-line therapy in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell cancer.
