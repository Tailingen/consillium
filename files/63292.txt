Adaptive, Image-guided, Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer in the Reduced Volumes of Elective Neck
Severe acute and late dysphagia is now considered as a dose-limiting toxicity of radio(chemo)therapy for head and neck cancer that significantly affects patients' quality of life. We propose to preserve swallowing function by:

* adapting (individualizing) treatment (intensity-modulated radiotherapy: IMRT) to per-treatment changes occurring in the tumor and surrounding organs and tissues;
* reducing the volumes of elective neck, that may result in significant decrease of severe acute and late dysphagia.
