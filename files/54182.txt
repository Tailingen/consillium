A Study of BBI608 Administered With Paclitaxel in Adult Patients With Advanced Malignancies
This is an open label, single arm phase 1 dose escalation study and phase 2 study of BBI608 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced malignancies.
Cancer
DRUG: BBI608|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Number of Participants With Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events, Assessment of safety of napabucasin administered in participants with advanced malignancies for whom weekly paclitaxel was an acceptable option by reporting of adverse events and serious adverse events, The time from the date of first treatment, while the patient is taking napabucasin, and for 30 days after stopping therapy, an average of 4 months.|Determination of the Recommended Phase 2 Dose by Assessing Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Determination of the Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of napabucasin when administered with paclitaxel in patients with advanced malignancies., 28 days
Determination of the Maximum Observed Concentration (Cmax) and Area Under the Plasma Concentration vs. Time Curve (AUClast), To determine the maximum concentration of napabucasin and the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve of napabucasin when administered in combination with weekly paclitaxel, Blood samples drawn on days 16 and 17 of the first study cycle|Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity of BBI608 When Administered in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Malignancies, To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity, specifically the objective response rate (ORR) of napabucasin administered in combination with paclitaxel. The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the proportion of participants with a complete response or partial response who have measurable disease at baseline imaging., From the date of first treatment, every 8 weeks, until the date of first documented objective disease progression, for an anticipated average of six months|The Objective Response Rate of Napabucasin Administered in Combination With Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Malignancies, Assessment of the objective response rate (ORR) of napabucasin administered in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced malignancies.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; The Objective Response Rate (ORR) is the proportion of participants with a complete response or partial response., From the date of first treatment, every 8 weeks, until the date of first documented objective disease progression, up to 60 months|Disease Control Rate, To determine the disease control rate (CDR) of napabucasin administered in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced malignancies.

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. The Disease Control Rate (DCR) is the proportion of patients whose best overall response is CR, PR or SD., From the date of first treatment, every 8 weeks, until the date of first documented objective disease progression, up to 60 months.|Progression Free Survival of Patients With Advanced Malignancies, The effect of napabucasin given in combination with paclitaxel on Progression Free Survival (PFS) of patients with advanced malignancies.

Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, The time from the date of first treatment to the date of first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, up to 60 months|Overall Survival of Patients With Advanced Malignancies, The effect of napabucasin given in combination with paclitaxel on Overall Survival (OS) of patients with advanced malignancies, 4 weeks after the patient has been off study treatment, every 3 months up to 18 months, then every 6 months thereafter until death, up to 118 months|Pharmacodynamics, To determine the response (increase or decrease) of biomarkers from biopsied tumors following the administration of napabucasin, Day 17 of cycle 1
This is an open label, multi-center, single arm phase 1 dose escalation study and phase 2 study of BBI608 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom weekly paclitaxel is an acceptable option.
