Pharmacodynamic Effects of Ribavirin in Patients With Tonsil and/or Base of Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Human papillomavirus (HPV-16) is an important factor in the development of many tonsil and/or base of tongue squamous cell cancers. Although HPV-16 is not thought to cause cancer by itself, it appears to contribute to the development of tonsil and/or base of tongue cancer in many patients. It is likely that treatment for many patients with tonsil and/or base of tongue cancer could be improved if effective therapy to control HPV-16 is developed. The investigators in this study want to learn if ribavirin shows evidence of activity against HPV-16.

Ribavirin is a pill therapy that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of the standard treatment for Hepatitis C. Laboratory experiments suggest that ribavirin might also be useful in the treatment of head and neck cancers. However, ribavirin has not yet been tested against head and neck cancer in patients. The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of ribavirin on tonsil and base tongue squamous cell cancer in patients.

The main purpose of this study is to see if ribavirin changes the expression of certain proteins related to HPV infection in the tumor. The study will also find out if ribavirin changes how the tumor appears in a PET/CT scan (positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan).
