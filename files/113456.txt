Study of SQZ-PBMC-HPV in Patients With HPV16+ Recurrent, Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a Phase 1 open-label, multicenter study of the safety and tolerability, immunogenic effects, antitumor activity, and pharmacodynamics of SQZ-PBMC-HPV as monotherapy and in combination with atezolizumab or other immune checkpoint inhibitors in HLA-A\*02+ patients with recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic human papillomavirus strain 16 positive (HPV16+) solid tumors. The study includes patients with anal, rectal, cervical, head and neck, penile, vulvar, or vaginal cancer.
