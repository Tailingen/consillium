In this study, carrilizumab combined with suvantinib in the second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with single arm, open, Exploratory clinical trials. The study plan enlists 60 patients with unresectable or recurrent disease confirmed by histopathology or cytology Or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma (including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, distal cholangiocarcinoma). Past acceptance of standard containing Systematic internal medicine anti-tumor therapy with gemcitabine regimen met the inclusion criteria of this study, and carrilizumab combined with cord was given Vantinib oral therapy. The specific treatment regimen was carrilizumab 200mg Q3W d1; Solventinib: 300mg, Orally, once a day, continuously. Treatment continues or until disease progression occurs or the patient becomes intolerant to the treatment regimen The efficacy was evaluated every 2 cycles. The main evaluation of carrilizumab combined with suvantinib in second-line treatment was advanced or Progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.
