Subjects received "anlotinib + paclitaxel/cisplatin" induction therapy for two cycles, and then received "anlotinib + concurrent chemoradiotherapy, sequential high-dose-rate intracavitary radiotherapy, sequential chemotherapy consolidation therapy" regimen:Induction regimen:Anlotinib: 10 mg, po, qd, d1-d14, q3w, 2 consecutive cycles Paclitaxel 175mg/m2 intravenous injection for 3 hours, d1 Cisplatin 75mg/m2, iv, divided into 3 days, q3w;Unable to tolerate, nedaplatin 75mg/m2, iv, d1 can be used instead;21 days as a cycle, a total of 2 cycles

Treatment programs:

Anlotinib: 10 mg, po, qd, d1-d14, q3w, 2 consecutive cycles；Cisplatin: 30-35 mg/m2, iv, d1, qw, 5 consecutive cycles；Pelvic external radiation therapy: once a day, 1.8-2 Gy/time, 5 days a week, for 5 consecutive weeks, a total of 45-50 Gy sequential；High dose rate intracavitary radiotherapy: 6 Gy/time, twice a week, 5 consecutive times, a total of 30 Gy/2.5 weeks, bioequivalent dose of 40 Gy sequential；Taxane drugs: including but not limited to paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel liposome, etc. The dosage regimen is determined by the investigator;Cisplatin 75mg/m2, iv, divided into 3 days, q3w;Unable to tolerate, nedaplatin 75mg/m2, iv, d1 can be used instead;2 cycles.A total of 36 patients will be included and this study will be conducted in the department of radiation and clinical oncology in The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.
