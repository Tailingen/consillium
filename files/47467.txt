An Observational Study to Evaluate the Clinical Utility of the Oncomine Precision Assay Within the Exactis Network
A Multi-centre Observational Study to Evaluate the Clinical Utility of Returning Genomic Aberration results Using the Oncomine Precision Assay in Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients within the Exactis Network
NSCLC
To compare the number of genomic aberrations detected by the Oncomine Precision Assay vs Standard of Care, Proportion of patients for whom an actionable genomic aberration is detected in at least one of the eight genes (ROS1, ERBB2, MET, BRAF, KRAS, RET, ALK, EGFR) using the Oncomine Precision Assay vs. study site's standard of care, 1 year
Clinical utility of returning genomic aberration results by quantifying the number of patients who received targeted therapy based on results returned from the Oncomine Precision Assay genomic aberration results in blood and/or tissue, 2 years|Clinical utility of returning genomic aberration results by quantifying the number of patients enrolled on a clinical trial based on results returned from the Oncomine Precision Assay in blood and/or tissue, 2 years
Exploratory - Analytical validity of Oncomine Precision Assay, Number of genomic aberrations concordant and discordant between tissue and blood using the Oncomine Precision Assay, 2 years|Exploratory- Sensitivity and specificity of mutation detection analysis of extracellular vesicles (EV) total nucleic acids, Compare the sensitivity and specificity of mutation detection in extracellular vesicles (EV) total nucleic acids and circulating tumor total nucleic acids, 2 years|Exploratory- Explore the response patterns to treatment based on EV RNAs, Small RNA extracted from plasma EV at baseline and at progression will be analyzed using RNA sequencing. Potential association between expression profiles and clinical parameters such as treatment response will be explored and candidate patterns predictive of treatment response will be tested using artificial intelligence algorithms., 2 years
This prospective multi-center observational study will evaluate the clinical utility of returning genomic aberration results in blood and/or tissue using the Oncomine Precision Assay in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Up to 100 patients with stage IIIb/IV NSCLC will consent to have their blood and tissue profiled on the Oncomine Precision Assay. A baseline plasma sample will be collected for all patients, of which up to 50 patients will have a tissue sample collected from pathology archives or planned biopsy or surgery.
