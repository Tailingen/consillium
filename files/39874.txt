Phase II Study of Bexarotene in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of bexarotene, a retinoic acid class drug, in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) that has returned after or is resistant to standard chemotherapy or are otherwise not eligible for conventional chemotherapy. Retinoic acids are a class of drugs related to Vitamin A, and have a wide range of effects within normal and malignant cells that affect cell growth and cell death.

DRUG: Bexarotene
Hematologic Response Rate of Bexarotene Monotherapy in Subjects With Relapsed/Refractory AML or Newly Diagnosed AML Who Are Unable to Receive Systemic Chemotherapy., Hematologic response will be assessed according to modified criteria of an international working group defined by Cheson et al, Report of an international working group to standardize response criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes. Blood, 1 December 2000, Vol. 96, No. 12, pp. 3671-3674, Two months after 17th patient has started treatment with Bexarotene, for up to 1 year
