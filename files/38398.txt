This is a multi-centre, randomized, open-label, controlled phase ле clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DP303c injection versus trastuzumab combined with vinorelbine/capecitabine in the treatment of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer. Patients will be treated with DP303c injection at 3.0 mg/kg or trastuzumab combined with vinorelbine/capecitabine every 3 weeks. Patients will continue to receive treatment until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, death, or any other reasons for treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs first.
