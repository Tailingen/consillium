A Perspective Study of the MRD-tailored Therapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma With Persistent Minimal Residual Disease After Initial Treatment
The aim of this study was to observe the rate of MRD conversion and the impact on survival in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients with persistent MRD positivity after induction and consolidation therapy (autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or consolidation of the original regimen) who were switched to high-intensity therapy, and to compare the rate of persistent MRD-negativity, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) between the two groups in comparison with NDMM patients who achieved MRD-negativity after the same induction and consolidation therapy.
Multiple Myeloma|Minimal Residual Disease
Adjusted treatment-adjusted MRD-negative rates, To explore the rate of conversion to MRD-negative after adjusting treatment in NDMM patients with persistent MRD-positive status., through study completion, up to 2 years
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), PFS were calculated from the enrollment to the first instance of disease progression, relapse, or death, through study completion, up to 2 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS were calculated from the time of enrollment to death or the last follow-up, through study completion, up to 2 years|Persistent MRD-negative rates and survival, Persistent MRD-negative rates and survival (including PFS and OS) in both groups compared to NDMM patients who achieved MRD-negativity after the same induction and consolidation therapy, through study completion, up to 2 years|Treatment related adverse event(TRAE), Toxicity and safety will be reported based on the adverse events, as graded by CTCAE V5 and determined by routine clinical assessments., through study completion, up to 2 years
explore the molecular basis for the dynamic changes and differences in MRD, Bone puncture samples from routine clinical consultations were collected, and single-cell transcriptome sequencing technology was applied to analyze and compare the differences in MM cells (clones) and bone marrow microenvironment (including immunity, inflammation, and stroma) of MRD-transformed and non-transformed patients after adjusting the treatment regimen, using the samples before adjusting the treatment regimen as the baseline control, in order to explore the molecular basis for the dynamic changes and differences in MRD, through study completion, up to 2 years|explore the elderly (especially debilitated) patients' MRD-adjusted treatment, For patients â‰¥65 years old, through the adjusted treatment-adjusted MRD-negative rates to explore the impact of strategy adjustment on elderly patients, through study completion, up to 2 years
There is still an unmet clinical need as to whether NDMM patients with persistent MRD positive would benefit from switching to high-intensity therapy. The induction regimen (Dara+/- (Vd, Rd, Pd, VRd, VPd)) was selected based on the frail or high-risk status of NDMM patients. Transplantation or consolidation and maintenance regimens were adjusted by MRD status detected by NGF.
