Laparoscopic Surgery Versus Robot Surgery for Right-side Colon Cancer: Short-term Outcome of a Randomised Clinical Trial
The recent introduction of robotic surgical system has revolutionized the field of minimally invasive surgery. The investigators hypothesized that adoption of a robotic surgical system for patients with right-side colon cancer seems appealing because This system provides high-definition three-dimensional vision, eliminates physiologic tremor, and better ergonomics. This randomized controlled trial was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of robotic right hemicolectomy in comparison with laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.
Colon Cancer
PROCEDURE: robot-assisted surgery|PROCEDURE: laparoscopic right-hemicolectomy
surgical quality based on pathological examination, during perioperative period (1-30 days after operation)
complication, during perioperative period ( 1-30 days after primary operation)
