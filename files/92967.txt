First-in-human Safety and Tolerability of MP0317 in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Advanced Solid Tumors
This study is investigating a new experimental therapy, MP0317, a DARPin速 drug candidate targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and CD40. Preclinical studies suggest that MP0317 may provide benefit for the treatment of tumors known to express high levels of FAP and for which approved therapies have been exhausted. This is the first study of MP0317 in humans and its main purpose is to test its safety and tolerability in patients with advanced solid tumors. This study will also examine the blood levels of MP0317 at several increasing dose levels and a recommended dose for further development will be determined. The recommended dose will be tested in a second part of the study to confirm safety and to further assess the preliminary biologic and anti-tumor activity.
