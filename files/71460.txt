MRI-Based Active Surveillance to Avoid the Risks of Serial Biopsies in Men With Low-Risk Prostate Ca
Phase II non-inferiority randomized trial of annual systematic biopsies versus mpMRI and targeted biopsies for men with low risk prostate cancer on active surveillance with any volume Gleason's Score 6, but no prior MRI imaging of the prostate.
Prostate Cancer|Prostate Adenocarcinoma|Multiparametric MRI|Gleason's Score 6
PROCEDURE: TRUS-guided biopsy|PROCEDURE: mpMRI with targeted biopsy
To asses the detection rate of Gleason score ≥ 4+3 in patients with low-risk prostate cancer who undergo transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy-based active surveillance (Group 1) versus patients who undergo mpMRI-based active surveillance (Group 2)., 3 years
Percentage of patients in Group 1 versus Group 2 who remain on active surveillance from the time of randomization until the end of study participation., To compare adherence with active surveillance requirements in Group 1 versus Group 2., 3 years|To compare the rate of biopsy-related infections in Group 1 versus Group 2., 3 years|To compare the missed rate of occult Gleason score ≥ 4+3 by template biopsy at end of study in Group 1 versus Group 2., 3 years
This is an unblinded, randomized trial of TRUS biopsy-based active surveillance versus mpMRI-based active surveillance. Patients on the TRUS biopsy-based arm will undergo annual systematic biopsies without any MRI staging or guidance. Patients on the mpMRI- based arm will undergo annual mpMRI surveillance imaging, with image-guided targeted biopsies only as indicated by radiographic findings.
