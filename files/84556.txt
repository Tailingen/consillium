Feasibility of Biodynamic Imaging for Predicting Therapeutic Effect in Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas
The purpose of this study is to determine if you can use an assay on tumor samples to see different patterns in response to the same chemotherapy treatment.
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
BDI as a chemosensitivity assay on fresh tumor samples, To examine the feasibility of using BDI as a chemosensitivity assay on fresh tumor samples obtained by core needle biopsy from patients planned to receive routine care gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas., up to 336 days
BDI patterns and results with Response Evaluation Criteria, To compare BDI patterns consistent with chemotherapy response ex-vivo to response to chemotherapy as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria., up to 336 days
To examine the feasibility of using biodynamic imaging (BDI) as a chemosensitivity assay on fresh tumor samples obtained by core needle biopsy from patients planned to receive routine care gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for treatment of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
