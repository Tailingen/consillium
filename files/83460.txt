A Real-World Study of Neoadjuvant/Conversion Therapy for Colorectal Cancer With Chemotherapy And Anti-Angiogenic Targeted Agents
Fruquintinib is already the standard third-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, but the efficacy of fruquintinib in neoadjuvant and conversion therapy for locally advanced/advanced colorectal cancer has not yet been reported. This study aims to observe the efficacy and safety of fruquintinib combined with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant or conversion therapy for colorectal cancer patients in the real world.

Corhot2：Time from the first treatment up to 2 years.|Corhot1 and Corhot2: Disease Control Rate (DCR), Disease Control Rate (DCR): Proportion of patients with target lesions who achieve a complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) among all treated patients., corhot1 ：Time from the first treatment up to 12 weeks. Corhot2：Time from the first treatment up to 2 years.|Corhot2: Curative Surgery Conversion Rate, Curative Surgery Conversion Rate: The proportion of subjects who undergo potentially curative surgical resection of both the primary gastric lesion and any metastases among all subjects receiving the conversion therapy regimen., Time from the first treatment up to 24 weeks|Corhot2: Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free Survival (PFS): Defined as the time from initiation of the study treatment regimen until the first radiographic disease progression, postoperative disease recurrence, or death (whichever occurs first). This can be calculated separately for surgical and non-surgical patients, with surgical patients considering postoperative disease recurrence or death (whichever occurs first)., Time from the first treatment up to 2 years.|Corhot1and Corhot2: Adverse events, Adverse events during neoadjuvant or conversion therapy, impact on surgery (delay, surgical complications) for corhot1, impact on surgical procedure and postoperative outcomes for corhot2., through study completion, an average of 1 year
