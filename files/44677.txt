A Study of Picoplatin in Colorectal Cancer
Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the large intestine (colon) or the rectum (end of the colon). Several drugs are often given in combination to treat colorectal cancer. One of the most active treatment combinations is known as FOLFOX, which is a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin. Oxaliplatin is a type of platinum drug and was approved by the FDA in 2004. While generally well-tolerated, oxaliplatin may cause toxicity to the nerves, such as sensory loss or cold sensitivity.

Picoplatin is a new type of platinum drug that has shown activity with 5-FU in pre-clinical studies and has undergone extensive Phase 1 and Phase 2 testing in a variety of cancers. No significant nerve toxicity has been seen in previous studies of picoplatin.

This study will review the safety and effectiveness of FOLPI, which is the combination of 5-FU and leucovorin with picoplatin in participants with colorectal cancer.

safety and efficacy, duration of the study
Subjects will be randomized centrally to treatment with picoplatin administered either every two or every four weeks and will be assigned a dose of picoplatin dependent on the study results to date. Each patient will also receive therapy every two weeks with 5-FU and leucovorin. In each schedule, the cohort size will be 3 subjects, to be expanded to 6 subjects if a dose-limiting toxicity is observed. If not dose-limiting toxicity observed among the 3 subjects within a cohort, picoplatin dose escalation may proceed, until the maximum tolerated dose is established.
