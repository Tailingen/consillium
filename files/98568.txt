Study of ZV0203 in Patients with HER2-Positive Advanced Solid Tumors
An open-label, multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study to assess the safety, Pharmacokinetic (PK), immunogenicity and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ZV0203 in patients with HER2-Positive advanced solid tumors
HER2-positive Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: ZV0203
Frequency of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), To investigate the safety characteristics., From the day of ICF sign to 30 days after the day of the last treatment|Maximum Tolerated dose of ZV0203, To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ZV0203., 21 days after first treatment
