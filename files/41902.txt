Dosimetry/Validation Study of 131Iodine-Anti B1 (Murine) Radioimmunotherapy for Chemotherapy Refractory Low Grade B Cell Lymphomas and Low Grade Lymphomas That Have Transformed to Higher Grade Histologies
Study RIT-II-001 is a phase II, multicenter study of the safety, tumor and organ dosimetry, dosimetry methods, and efficacy of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody for the treatment of patients with low-grade or transformed low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that each site could accurately conduct the whole body dosimetry required for the safe and effective dosing of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody. Additional objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, dosimetry, and safety of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody.
Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin
BIOLOGICAL: Tositumomab (Anti-B1 Antibody) and Iodine-131 Tositumomab
Number of Participants Who Received the Therapeutic Dose at the Seven Clinical Research Sites, The dosimetry methods were validated for seven different clinical research sites., Day 1 within one hour of infusion (I) and prior to urination (U); Days 2, 3, and 4 after dosimetric dose (DD) I, following U; Days 6 and 7 after DD I, following U
Number of Participants With the Indicated Therapeutic Doses (TD) (Total Body Dose), Based on their platelet count and body weight. Participants received different TDs of TST. For obese participants (weighing more than 137% of their calculated lean body weight), the calculation to determine the administered activity (mCi) was performed using the maximum effective mass (i.e., the minimum of the participant's mass and 137% of their calculated lean body weight). The administered activity (mCi) for participants with a Baseline platelet count of 100001-149999 cells/millimeter cubed (mm\^3) was reduced to a 65 cGy total body dose, after any adjustment for obesity., Participants were evaluated for up to 142 months in Study 104731 or were followed in the long-term follow-up study (Study 104526) for up to 136.3 months|Number of Participants (Par.)
