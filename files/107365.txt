MFOLFIRINOX And Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SBRT) for Pancreatic Cancer With High Risk and Locally Advanced Disease
This is a prospective, multicentre randomised, phase II clinical trial, with randomisation 2:1 by minimisation and stratification by tumour stage, planned chemotherapy and institution.
Pancreatic Cancer
RADIATION: Stereotactic Radiotherapy (SBRT)|DRUG: mFOLFIRINOX|DRUG: Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel|DRUG: Gemcitabine + Capecitabine|PROCEDURE: Pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure)
Locoregional control (Locoregional Response Rate LRR), To determine if the addition of SBRT to chemotherapy improves locoregional control;, Within 12 months of randomisation;
Safety (NCI CTCAE v5.0), Compare acute and late side effects from chemotherapy +/- SBRT, Safety Assessment before each cycle of chemotherapy, post chemotherapy treatment, following SBRT and surgery (if applicable) then at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months post-randomisation and 6 monthly during year 2, 3 and 4|Surgical morbidity/mortality (Clavien grading system), Length of stay, death within 30 days, frequency and severity of adverse events. Hospital admission during surgery will be calculated from day of surgery to date of discharge from acute care hospitalisation. The length of stay in acute hospital care will include intensive care admissions., At discharge post-surgery, 30 days and 90 days post surgery, up to 4 years|Radiological response rates (RECIST v1.1), Compare radiologic response rates for chemotherapy +/- SBRT, at baseline. In SBRT arm, post-initial chemotherapy (prior to SBRT). In both arms, 4-6 weeks post completion of initial treatment (prior to surgery), 3 ,6, 9 and 12 monthly during year 2, 3 and 4.|Progression Free Survival (PFS) (RECIST v1.1), Compare 12-month progression free survival, From randomisation to the time of first documented clinical or imaging relapse or date of death from any cause, whichever occurs first; up to 4 years|Pathological response rates (College of American Pathology Tumour Regression Grade TRG), Compare pathologic response rates of chemotherapy +/- SBRT, At SRBT/surgery compared to baseline;|Surgical resection rates (Guidelines for the Evaluation of Resectability and Histology), Compare rates of surgical resection, At surgery|R0 resection rates (>1mm) (Synoptic PC histology reporting as outlined in Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia (RCPA), Compare R0 resection rates (\>1 mm), At surgery|Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ C30 and PAN26 QOL), To assess the impact of the regimens on quality of life of patients, Baseline, Day 1 of each cycle of chemotherapy, prior to SBRT, post initial chemotherapy +/- SBRT, prior to surgery, 30 days post end of treatment, at months 3, 6,9 and 12 post randomisation 6 monthly in years 2, 3 and 4.|Deterioration-Free Survival (DFS) (EORTC QLQ C30), To assess overall net clinical benefit of treatment, The time until the first of the following events: a 10-point deterioration in health status from baseline, disease progression, death, or treatment discontinuation;up to 4 years|Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval from the date of randomisation to date of death from any cause, or the date of last known alive. Participants will be censored at the date of commencement of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy., From the date of randomisation to date of death from any cause, or the date of last known alive; up to 4 years
Exploratory biomarker analysis of blood, The list of blood biomarkers and their measurement will be updated when confirmed., baseline, prior to SBRT (Arm B only), insertion of fiducial markers (Arm B, optional), post initial treatment, at surgery (optional, at selected sites), 6 and12 months post randomisation and at progression, up to 5 years|Exploratory biomarker analysis of tissue, The list of tissue biomarkers and their measurement will be updated when confirmed., Diagnosis (archival tissue), at time of fiducial insertion (Arm B, optional), surgical resection (for resectable patients) and at time of progression (optional), up to 5 years.|ePRO Acceptability, Proportion of patients who are willing to use electronic device vs. paper format, Analysis of demographic data and assessing data quality between the group, Baseline, Day 1 of each cycle of chemotherapy, 2 weeks post initial chemotherapy(SBRT arm), 4-6 weeks post initial chemotherapy +/- SBRT, 30 days post end of treatment, at months 3, 6,9 and 12 post randomisation 6 monthly in years 2, 3 and 4.
This is a prospective, multicentre randomised, phase II clinical trial to evaluate safety and activity of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in addition to chemotherapy in patients with high-risk and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer (BRPC) and locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). High risk defined as any patient with tumour \>4cm, extrapancreatic extension or node positive disease.
