Long-Term Follow-up of Patients Treated With Miltenyi Cell and Gene Therapies
The goal of this Long-Term Follow-Up Trial is to assess long-term safety and efficacy of Miltenyi CAR T treatment.

Adverse Events, Percentage of patients with late-onset adverse reactions (AR), serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse reactions (SAR) and adverse events of special interest (AESI) including relapse or progression of the underlying disease, life-threatening infections, death due to any cause, new and secondary malignancies, through study completion, up to 14 years
Lymphocyte count, B and T lymphocyte count, through study completion, up to 14 years|Height, Height, through study completion, up to 14 years|Weight, Weight, through study completion, up to 14 years|Tanner staging for pediatric patients, Tanner staging for pediatric patients, through study completion, up to 14 years|Menstruation status for pediatric patients, Did the patient experience their first menstrual cycle (menarche)? If yes, enter date, through study completion, up to 14 years|RCL, Percentage of patients with detectable replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) (if results of 2 consecutive years are negative for an individual patient, further sampling will not be continued for this patient; if results of all samples in first year of primary trial were negative for an individual patient, sampling will not be continued for this patient in this long-term follow-up trial), through study completion, up to 14 years|Relapse / Progression, Percentage of patients who relapse or progress since enrollment and rate of surviving patients, through study completion, up to 14 years|Detectable Transgene levels, Percentage of patients with detectable transgene levels (if results of 2 consecutive years are negative for an individual patient, further sampling will be stopped for this patient), through study completion, up to 14 years
The focus in this trial is on the occurrence of any late adverse reactions (AR), serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse reactions (SAR) and adverse events of special interest (AESI), i.e. relapse or progression of the underlying disease, life-threatening infections, death due to any case, new and secondary malignancies, lymphocyte counts, detection of the transgene of the CAR T cells, detection of replication-competent lentivirus (RCL), developmental tracking in pediatric patients and furthermore, assessment of the primary status of disease progression and overall survival.
