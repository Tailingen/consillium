Dose Escalation Trial of BNT152+153 in Patients With Cancer
This is an open-label, multisite Phase I dose escalation, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) trial of BNT152+153 in various solid tumor indications.

The clinical trial will enroll patients with various solid tumors that are metastatic or unresectable for whom there is no available standard therapy likely to confer clinical benefit, or patients who are not candidates for such available therapy.

The trial consists of Part 1 and Part 2 with adaptive design elements:

* Part 1 consists of Groups A and B.

  * Group A is a BNT153 monotherapy dose escalation in patients with advanced solid malignancies until the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) is defined. If MTD is not reached, maximum administered dose (MAD) may be used for further development (or another dose as determined by the safety review committee \[SRC\]).
  * Group B is a BNT152 monotherapy dose escalation in patients with advanced solid malignancies until the MTD or optimal biological dose (OBD; the lowest safe dose associated with optimal biological activity) is defined, whichever occurs earlier.
  * Group A will be activated first while the time point for Group B activation is at sponsor's decision.
* Part 2 will start after the MTD or MAD or another dose as determined by the SRC have been established for BNT153 and MTD or OBD for BNT152 in Part 1. Part 2 (Part 2A, 2B and 2C) is a dose escalation of BNT152+153 in patients with advanced solid malignancies until the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) is defined.
* Part 2 may implement a biomarker cohort if a clinical benefit is observed at one or more doses of BNT152+153 that show a clear PD effect in the peripheral blood. The Biomarker Cohort will recruit patients at selected sites.
Solid Tumor
DRUG: BNT152|DRUG: BNT153
Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including Grade â‰¥ 3, serious, fatal TEAE by causal relationship to trial treatment, TEAEs will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v.5.0., up to 24 months|Occurrence of dose reduction and discontinuation of investigational medicinal product within a patient due to TEAE, up to 24 months|Occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the DLT evaluation period - BNT152, 21 days|Occurrence of DLTs during the DLT evaluation period - BNT153, 21 days
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of patients in whom a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) is observed as best overall response., up to 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of patients in whom a CR or PR or stable disease (SD) (per RECIST 1.1, SD assessed at least 6 weeks after first dose) is observed as best overall response., up to 24 months|Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first overall response (CR or PR per RECIST 1.1) to first occurrence of objective tumor progression (progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause, whichever occurs first., up to 24 months
The Part 2 starts with Part 2A. Enrollment of Part 2B begins after dose level 1 in Part 2A is deemed safe by the SRC. The dose escalation in Part 2A continues as described in the protocol. The dose escalation in Part 2B continues as described in the protocol until RP2D is determined. To further investigate the effect of BNT152+153, Part 2C may be introduced upon review of the emerging data.
