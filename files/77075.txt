Analysis of the Variation in Caspase-8 Availability and Cleavage in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Control of cell death is frequently disrupted in cancer resulting in overgrowth of tumour cells. Caspase-8 is a key enzyme involved in controlling cell death. This study examines the importance of caspase-8 in oral cancer.
Oral Cancer
OTHER: There is no intervention.
Caspase-8 activity in oral cancer and its impact on disease progression, Molecular analysis of caspase-8 activity will be undertaken and correlated with tumour features and outcome., Up to 3 years
Control of cell death is frequently disrupted in cancer resulting in overgrowth of tumour cells. The caspase family of enzymes are the key performers of controlled cell death and caspase-8 is frequently mutated in oral cancer. This study will perform DNA sequencing to determine if the gene is wild-type (not mutated). The abundance of inactive (uncleaved) and active (cleaved) caspase-8 will be determined. The levels of the proteins that caspase-8 interacts with (including caspase-3) will be determined. Results will be correlated with tumour stage, patient outcome and the presence of immune cells and other microscopic features. This will improve the understanding of the importance of caspase-8 in oral cancer.
