A Pilot Trial Using BR55 Ultrasound Contrast Agent in the Assessment of Prostate Cancer
Pilot study to evaluate the ability of BR55 to identify prostate cancer lesions with Gleason Score ≥7 by ultrasound molecular imaging on the basis of a visual score in comparison with histopathology results
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: BR55
Number of Lesions With Gleason Score ≥ 7 Identified by Ultrasound Molecular Imaging, To assess the ability of BR55 to identify prostate cancer lesions with a Gleason score ≥ 7 using histopathology as truth standard, Within 30 minutes after administration of BR55
Number of Participants With Adverse Events, To obtain safety data in subjects administered BR55, 24 hours post-dose
This multi-centre, open label, prospective, pilot study was designed to assess the ability of BR55 to detect VEGFR2 in human prostate cancer by Ultrasound Molecular Imaging (USMI). The binding of BR55 to VEGFR2 (focal enhancement still visible after significant decrease in signal from circulating microbubbles seen) was assessed at USMI and VEGFR2 expression was to be confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis including VEGFR2 and CD31 staining.
