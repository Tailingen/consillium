PAlbociclib and Circulating Tumor DNA for ESR1 Mutation Detection
This study is a randomized, open-label, multicentric, phase III trial conducted in patients receiving aromatase inhibitor and palbociclib as first line therapy for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and which aims to evaluate, at the onset of ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA, the efficacy of a change of the hormone therapy (aromatase inhibitor (AI) changed to fulvestrant) combined to palbociclib, together with the safety of hormone therapy and palbociclib combination in the overall population.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Palbociclib 125mg|DRUG: Aromatase Inhibitors|DRUG: Fulvestrant Injectable Product
Incidence of treatment-emergent Adverse Events, Global safety of the combination of palbociclib + endocrine therapy in the whole population, with focus on hematological toxicities.

Safety will be assessed by the collection of grade ≥3 adverse events, using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03 - in all included patients., Throughout study completion, up to 4 years|Progression-free survival (Step 2), To assess whether a change of the hormone therapy associated with palbociclib will benefit patients for whom rising ESR1 mutations are detected during treatment with palbociclib and aromatase inhibitor.

Progression-Free Survival (PFS) will be measured from the time of randomization to the time of tumor progression (as assessed by the investigator per RECIST v1.1) or death (whichever comes first) - in randomized patients., From randomization to disease progression or death, up to 4 years
Progression-free survival (step 3), To assess PFS in patients undergoing a cross-over following RECIST tumor progression in Arm A, from the start of crossover.

Progression-Free Survival will be measured from the time of cross-over to the time of tumor progression (as assessed by the investigator per RECIST 1.1) or death (whichever comes first) - in all patients with crossover, From cross-over, up to 4 years|Progression-free survival (step 1&2), To report efficacy (PFS based on RECIST) of palbociclib combined with hormone therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant), from the date of initial inclusion into the trial.

Progression-Free Survival will be measured from the time of inclusion to the time of tumor progression (as assessed by the investigator per RECIST 1.1) or death (whichever comes first) - in all included patients including those who switched to fulvestrant., From inclusion, up to 4 years|Time to strategy failure from randomization (Step 2 and 3), To assess whether the early switch (switch following ESR1 mutations increase) to fulvestrant contributes to a longer time to strategy failure than a late switch (cross-over following RECIST tumor progression).

Time to strategy failure will be measured from the time of randomization until palbociclib+endocrine therapy discontinuation or death (whichever comes first) - in all randomized patients., From randomization, up to 4 years|Chemotherapy-free survival (Step 2 and 3), To assess whether the early switch (following ESR1 mutations increase) to fulvestrant contributes a longer chemotherapy-free survival than a late switch (cross-over following RECIST tumor progression).

Chemotherapy-free survival will be measured from the time of randomization until the date of chemotherapy initiation or death (whichever comes first) - in all randomized patients., From randomization, up to 4 years|Incidence of treatment-emergent extra-hematological Adverse Events, To obtain additional safety data in a broad patient population treated with palbociclib and hormone therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) in a general Description of all extra-hematological grade ≥3 toxicities and SAEs incidence rate in the overall population and each treatment step, Throughout study completion, up to 4 years|Quality of life by quality of life questionnaire (QLQ)-C30, Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.

The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level., From inclusion and every 2 months until disease progression, up to 2 years|Other line of therapy, To report the anti-cancer treatments received after the first line therapy., Throughout study completion, up to 4 years|Overall Survival, The overall survival is the length of time from inclusion that patients enrolled in the study are still alive., Throughout study completion, up to 4 years
