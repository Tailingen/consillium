Antitumor Activity of Vactosertib in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Acral and Mucosal Melanoma Patients Progressed From Prior Immune Check Point Inhibitor
This trial is a multicenter, single arm study of efficacy of vactosertib in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced acral or mucosal melanoma patients progressed prior treatment including immunotherapy or targeted therapy and chemotherapy. This trial will be conducted though Korean Cancer Study Group (KCSG). The KCSG is responsible for the project management of the trial. Patient recruitment will take at 4 institutions.

Participants will be treated for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years) after initiation of treatment with intravenous 200mg of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks in combination with vactosertib. Vactosertib will be given orally for 200mg, bid for 5 days (from Mon. to Fri.) per week. This study will use ORR based on RECIST 1.1 and modified RECIST 1.1 (immune related RECIST) criteria as the primary endpoint and the tumor assessment will be done every 6 weeks. Secondary endpoints are DCR, PFS, OS, and safeties. Exploratory biomarkers predictive biomarker candidates (e.g., level of PD-L1 tumor expression, EMT marker, PD-L1, TGF-β RII, and pSMAD2) in tumor tissue and ctDNA in blood will be investigated in both pre-treatment and post-treatment periods.
Acral Melanoma|Mucosal Melanoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab, Vactosertib
Overall Response Rate, Efficacy Analysis Set includes all patients who have received at least 1 dose of the study drug, had measurable disease at baseline according to RECIST 1.1, and had at least 1 post-baseline tumor response assessment. Patients with evidence of disease progression or death before the first scheduled assessment of tumor response will be included in this Analysis Set. It will be the primary analysis set for tumor response.

Primary efficacy endpoints will be based upon investigators' tumor assessments per RECIST 1.1 and will be summarized as follows to evaluate the preliminary anticancer activities of vactosertib and pembrolizumab combination. Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients who have a partial or complete response to therapy by RECIST 1.1., Primary analysis is planned at approximately 6 months after the first dose of last enrolled patient, after study termination, or at study completion decided by Principal Investigator, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 6months.
