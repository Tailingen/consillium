Hypofractionated Proton Beam Radiotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma
This phase II study is to evaluate the effectiveness of hypofractionated proton beam therapy (PBT) for HCC patients in hepatitis B endemic area.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
RADIATION: Proton Beam Therapy
local progression-free survival, To evaluate the local progression-free survival (LPFS) in HCC patients treated with hypofractionated proton beam radiotherapy., Up to 1 year
overall survival, * To evaluate compliance of proton beam radiotherapy for HCC by analyzing acute and late treatment-related toxicity, such as radiation-induced hepatic toxicity and gastrointestinal tract toxicity
* To evaluate the impact of hypofractionated proton beam radiotherapy for HCC by analyzing the tumor response rate, local disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) rate, Up to 2years until study closed
The primary endpoint is local progression free survival. The trial is a single arm phase II trial with the historical arm. The expected 3-year local progression free survival for patient with HCC patients treated with proton beam therapy would be 80%. With a power of 80% and a type I error level of 10%, evaluable 40 patients are required to reject that the null hypothesis that true 3-year local progression free survival rate is â‰¤65%. Considering the 10% unevaluable patients due to loss of follow up, a total 45 eligible patients for each arms will be enrolled.
