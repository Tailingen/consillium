Safety and Efficacy Study of Epitope Peptide To Treat HLA-A*24 or A*02-positive Advanced Solid Tumors
In this study, the investigators examine using a combination of two types of HLA-A\*2402 (or HLA-A\*0201)-restricted epitope peptides, which were derived from VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for advanced solid tumor patients who are refractory to standard therapy.
Solid Tumors
BIOLOGICAL: HLA-A*2402 or A*0201 restricted peptides
Evaluation of safety: the number of adverse events of vaccination therapy., 2 months|Evaluation of clinical efficacy: Overall survival., 2 months
Various immunological responses including peptides specific CTL, antigen cascade, regulatory T cells, cancer antigens and HLA levels., 2 months|Evaluation of clinical efficacy: Progression free survival., 2 months|Evaluation of clinical efficacy: Tumor markers., 2 months|Evaluation of clinical efficacy: Objective response rate., 2 months
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immune response and clinical efficacies of HLA-A\*2402 or HLA-A\*0201 restricted epitope peptides (VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2) emulsified with Montanide ISA 51 for advanced solid tumors.

In this phase I/II trial, the investigators examine using a combination of the two peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment for HLA-A\*2402 or HLA-A\*0201-positive advanced solid tumor patients who are refractory to standard therapy.
