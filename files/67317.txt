Study of XB002 in Subjects With Solid Tumors (JEWEL-101)
This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and clinical antitumor activity of XB002 administered IV q3w alone and in combination with nivolumab or bevacizumab to subjects with advanced solid tumors.

DRUG: XB002|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Bevacizumab
Dose-Escalation Stage: MTD/recommended dose for XB002, To determine the MTD and/or RD for further evaluation of IV administration of XB002 alone and in combination therapy in subjects with advanced malignancies, 18 months|Cohort-Expansion Stage: Objective Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate preliminary efficacy of XB002 when administered alone and in combination therapy by determining the ORR per RECIST 1.1 (or other applicable response criteria eg. RANO or PCWG3 criteria) as assessed by the Investigator, 12 months
Safety of XB002: Adverse Events, To evaluate the safety of XB002 through the evaluation of incidence and severity of nonserious adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), 30 months|Tolerability of XB002 as evaluated by the duration of exposure for the study, To evaluate the tolerability of XB002 through the evaluation of duration of exposure for the study treatment, 30 months|Tolerability of XB002 as evaluated dose intensity of the study treatment, To evaluate the tolerability of XB002 through the evaluation of dose intensity of the study treatment, 30 months|Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax), To evaluate the Cmax for XB002, total antibody, and free payload at scheduled visits over time, 30 months|Trough Concentration (Ctrough), To evaluate the Ctrough of XB002, total antibody, and free payload at scheduled visits over time, 30 months|Immunogenicity of XB002, To assess the immunogenicity of XB002 as measured by anti-drug antibody (ADA) analysis, 30 months|Anti-tumor activity of XB002: Objective Response Rate (ORR), To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of XB002, as measured by ORR, per RECIST 1.1 (or other applicable response criteria eg. RANO or PCWG3 criteria) as assessed by the Investigator (dose escalation stage) or by a BIRC for selected cohorts (cohort expansion stage)., 30 months|Anti-tumor activity of XB002: Duration of Response (DOR), To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of XB002, as measured by DOR, per RECIST 1.1 (or other applicable response criteria eg. RANO or PCWG3 criteria) as assessed by the Investigator (dose escalation stage) or by a BIRC for selected cohorts (cohort expansion stage), 30 months|Anti-tumor activity of XB002: Progression Free Survival (PFS), To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of XB002, as measured by PFS, per RECIST 1.1 (or other applicable response criteria eg. RANO or PCWG3 criteria) as assessed by the Investigator (dose escalation stage) or by a BIRC for selected cohorts (cohort expansion stage), 30 months|Cohort-Expansion Stage: overall survival, To evaluate overall survival, 12 months
