Protocols for Painless Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) of Actinic Keratoses
This study is being done to compare a new, continuous illumination regimen of ALA-PDT (Aminolevulinate-Photodynamic Therapy) to a conventional regimen for treatment of actinic keratoses. The hypothesis is that the continuous illumination approach will be less painful, but equally efficacious, as the old regimen.
Actinic Keratosis
PROCEDURE: Aminolevulinic acid based photodynamic therapy
AK clearance, The primary endpoint is treatment efficacy (AK lesion clearance at 3 months). The specific aim of this study is to establish proof-of-principle for the concept that a long delivery period of blue light from the Blu-U device, using the standard fluence rate but starting only 15 min after the application of Levulan and lasting 1 hour (fluence of 360 J/cm2), can provide a clearance rate of AK lesions comparable to a standard regimen of Blu-U light (fluence of 10 J/cm2) beginning 1 hr after LevulanTM application., at 3 months post-treatment
Pain during illumination, The secondary endpoint is pain during illumination. The hypothesis is that efficacy at 3 months will be statistically equivalent with the two approaches, but pain will be significantly less with the continuous treatment regimen., During treatment through post-treatment Day4
This study is being done to compare a modified version of the standard ALA-PDT (Aminolevulinate-Photodynamic Therapy) treatment of actinic keratoses, to a modified version in which light exposure begins immediately after application of the Levulan. We hypothesize that this will yield a therapeutic efficacy equivalent to the standard ALA-PDT regimen, but will cause less pain during the light exposure. The study employs a bilateral design in which the left versus right sides of the treatment area are compared in the exact same patient. There are 3 arms of the study, each having a different time duration of light exposure in the modified regimen to determine which one is most efficacious
