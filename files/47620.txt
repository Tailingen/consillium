Handheld Ultrasound Device to Triage Women With a Positive Clinical Breast Examination by Trained Non-radiologists
Cross sectional study to evaluate estimate accuracy of portable ultrasound device in correctly differentiating the benign breast lesions from the malignant ones in the women referred with a positive Clinical breast examination (CBE) screening test.
Breast Cancer|Carcinoma in Situ
OTHER: Triage of clinical breast examination positive women using handheld ultrasound by non-radiologists.
Accuracy of non-radiologist portable ultrasound device for triaging women with positive clinical breast examination, Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of portable ultrasound device to detect breast cancer and carcinoma in situ with repeat clinical breast examination, mammography/ultrasound and/or cytology/core biopsy as the gold standard test., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
Agreement between portable ultrasound device and mammography/ultrasound, Agreement between portable ultrasound device and mammography/ultrasound by a radiologist in differentiating malignant and benign solid breast lesions., Through study completion, an average of 1 year
More than two million new cases of breast cancer occur each year worldwide. Implementing mammography screening is complex and resource-intensive, making it impractical in resource-limited settings. Clinical breast examination (CBE) has been recommended as an alternative screening option for low- and middle-income countries. Several studies have shown a significant shift towards earlier stage tumours detected by CBE. However, the high false-positive rate and low positive predictive value of CBE expose women to unnecessary and costly further diagnostic procedures, as well as the negative psychological consequences. There is an urgent need for a more accurate, cost-effective and reliable triage technology that can be performed by any healthcare provider.
