Indenoisoquinoline LMP744 in Adults With Relapsed Solid Tumors and Lymphomas
Background:

The new drug LMP744 (NSC 706744) damages deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). This causes cell death. Researchers want to see if it can treat certain kinds of cancer. They want to understand how the drug works and how it affects the body.

Objective:

To test the safety of LMP744 and find out the dose of the drug that can be safely given to humans.

Eligibility:

Adults at least 18 years old who have metastatic solid tumors or lymphoma, which have progressed after other treatment.

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

* Vital signs taken
* Blood and urine tests
* Heart tests
* Scans or ultrasound

Some participants will have a tumor sample taken 2 times. A small piece of tumor is removed by a small needle. A scan or ultrasound will guide the process.

The study will be done in 28-day cycles.

Each cycle, participants will get the study drug in a vein for 60 minutes once a day for 5 days.

For day 1 of cycle 1, participants will be admitted to the clinic and have blood and urine taken several times.

At the beginning of each cycle, participants will have a clinic visit and repeat some screening tests. They will also do this twice in the middle of cycle 1 and once in the middle of cycle 2.

After participants stop taking the study drug, they will be followed for 30 days. They may give blood samples. They will be contacted by phone to see how they are doing....

Background:

* Indenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin inhibitors of topoisomerase 1 (top1) with improved characteristics over their predecessors. Indenoisoquinolines have better chemical stability, producing stable deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-top1 cleavage complexes, and exhibit a preference for unique DNA cleavage sites, compared with their camptothecin counterparts.
* They have demonstrated activity against camptothecin-resistant cell lines and produce DNA-protein crosslinks, which are resistant to reversal. They also show less or no resistance to cells overexpressing the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ATP-binding cassette super-family G member 2 (ABCG2), and multidrug resistance (MDR-1).

Primary Objectives:

-To establish the safety, tolerability and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of LMP744 (NSC 706744) administered intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days every day (QD) x 5) schedule in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.

Secondary Objectives:

-Characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of LMP744.

Exploratory Objectives:

* Evaluate the effect of LMP744 on markers of DNA damage phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX), phosphorylated Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (pNbs1), pATR, excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), RAD51 recombinase (RAD51), Topo1cc, topoisomerase 1 (Top1), Schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and pre- and post- treatment tumor biopsies in patients at the expansion cohort.
* Assess preliminary antitumor activity of LMP744.
* Examine genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) that may be associated with response or resistance to treatment

Eligibility:

-Adult patients must have histologically documented, relapsed solid tumors which have progressed after one line of therapy, or lymphoma which has progressed after initial therapy and without potentially curative options, or patient refuses potentially curative therapy.

Study Design:

* Cycle 1 and subsequent cycles: Patients will receive LMP744 administered IV QD over 1 hour on days 1-5 followed by 23 days without drug (28-day cycle).
* Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) samples will be collected. Tumor biopsies will be mandatory during the expansion phase.

LMP744 will be administered IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle.

Blood samples for PK analyses will be collected at the following timepoints in cycle 1 only:

Day 1, prior to drug administration, 2 minutes (+/- 2 minutes) before end of infusion, and at appropriate time points post infusion (15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post infusion)

Day 2, 24-hour (hr) post day 1 start of infusion (prior to day 2 infusion), and 2 minutes (+/- 2 minutes) before the end of infusion

Day 3, 24 hr post day 2 start of infusion (prior to day 3 infusion), and 2 minutes (+/- 2 minutes) before end of infusion

Day 4, 24 hr post day 3 start of infusion (prior to day 4 infusion), and 2 minutes (+/- 2 minutes) before end of infusion

Day 5, 24 hr post day 4 start of infusion (prior to day 5 infusion), and 2 minutes (+/- 2 minutes) before end of infusion

Day 8, 72 hr post day 5 start of infusion Blood for circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (optional) will be collected at baseline, on day 3 of

Cycle 1 (within 2 to 4 hours after the start of LMP744 infusion), on day 1 of every subsequent cycle (prior to drug infusion), and at disease progression.

Tumor biopsies (mandatory in expansion phase) will be obtained at baseline and then on day 2 (1-4 hours after the LMP744 infusion) in cycle 1 only.
