A Multicountry, Multicentre, Non-interventional, Retrospective Study to Determine Real-world Treatment Patterns and Associated Outcomes After First Line Osimertinib in Patients With Advanced and Metastatic NSCLC EGFRm in the GCC Region
A Multicountry, Multicenter, Non-interventional, Retrospective Study to determine Real-world treatment patterns and associated outcomes after FIRST LINE Osimertinib in patients with advanced and Metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR-activating mutations in the GCC Region
Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung
To describe treatments and sequencing after treatment with first line Osimertinib., Treatments and sequencing after treatment with first line Osimertinib - data on all subsequent lines of treatment, duration and dose changes will be collected until death or last contact or interim data cut-off/end of study period along with disease progression and outcome on the respective line of treatment, 1st April 2018 till December 31st, 2021.|To describe real world time to the next treatment or death (rwTTNTD)., rwTTNTD, defined as the time in days from and inclusive of the index date until the start date of the next systemic therapy line or death from any cause (in absence of next systemic therapy line). Patients who do not receive a subsequent systemic therapy line or die during the study observation period will have TTNTD right censored at the earliest date of last contact or interim data cut-off date/end of the study period., 1st April 2018 till December 31st, 2021.
Osimertinib has demonstrated superior PFS compared to firstgeneration EGFR-TKIs (erlotinib and gefitinib) in the first line setting in clinical trials. There remains a need to consider clinical outcomes in the real-world setting and determine the characteristics of long-term survivors in the real world. It will also be important to determine the subsequent treatment pathways of patients who progress on treatment with Osimertinib
