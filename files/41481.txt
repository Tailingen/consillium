The Preventive Role of Fractionated Laser Resurfacing Against Actinic Neoplasia in an At-Risk Geriatric Population
The purpose of this study is to determine if the Fractionated Laser Resurfacing (FLR) procedure can protect one forearm/wrist from precancerous actinic keratosis (AKs) as well as prevent skin cancer in older subjects with active AKs. This study builds on a similar study ongoing at the Dayton Veterans Administration dermatology clinic. This study is also testing if a photograph of the skin can be used to predict where the AKs and an skin cancers will form.
