A Phase II Randomized Trial for Early-stage Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Oropharynx: Radiotherapy vs Trans-oral Robotic Surgery (ORATOR)
The historical standard treatment for early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx is radiation therapy. Some patients require chemotherapy with the radiation, and some patients require surgery if the tumour or lymph nodes have not responded after radiation.

This study will compare radiation therapy with a new surgical treatment called transoral robotic surgery (TORS). TORS is a new surgical approach using a robot to assist the surgeon in removing the tumour, potentially with fewer side effects than older surgical techniques.
