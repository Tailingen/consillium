Study of Miransertib (MK-7075) in Participants With PIK3CA-related Overgrowth Spectrum and Proteus Syndrome (MOSAIC) (MK-7075-002)
This is an open label, Phase 1/2 study of oral miransertib (MK-7075) administered to participants at least 2 years of age with phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA)-related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS) and Proteus Syndrome (PS) (MOSAIC).
PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS)/Proteus Syndrome
DRUG: Miransertib
Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in a participant, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product and does not imply any judgment about causality., Up to approximately 48 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Treatment Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in a participant, whether or not considered drug related.

The study consists of two parts: Part A and Part B. Part A was closed to enrollment under Amendment 6. As of Amendment 7, the endpoints for Part A and Part B have been combined to assess the safety and tolerability of miransertib in participants with PROS and PS. Previous efficacy and pharmacokinetic (PK) objectives and endpoints have been removed. Amendment 7 will complete the final enrollment into the MOSAIC study and Compassionate Use/Expanded Access Program.
