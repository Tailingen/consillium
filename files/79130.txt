Evaluating True PCR-negative Rate of Frontline Dasatinib in Early Chronic Phase CML for Therapeutic Harmonization
This study is designed to confirm the efficacy of dasatinib 100mg once daily in producing a complete molecular response and to prove a possibility of "Operational Cure" in CMR patients.
Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia
OTHER: RQ-PCR RNA Analysis
Rate of CMR(complete molecular response), Level of Bcr-Abl transcript (Conventional Q-RT-PCR), 36 month
Rate of MMR(major molecular response), Level of Bcr-Abl transcript (Conventional Q-RT-PCR), 3,6,12,24 and 36 months
This study also examines kinetics of complete molecular responses using new highly sensitive PCR based technology, digital PCR, which is reported to have a sensitivity down to 6 log reduction.
