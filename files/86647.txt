Phase I, Open-Label Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity PEK Fusion Protein Vaccine
Phase I, Open-Label Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a Three Dose Regimen of Escalating Doses of PEK Fusion Protein Vaccine in Women with LSIL or HSIL.

PEK fusion protein vaccine (PEK + GPI-0100) is safe and well tolerated in patients with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) of the cervix and induces a measurable immune response.
