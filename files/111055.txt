A Study of Voruciclib Alone or in Combination With Venetoclax in Subjects With B-Cell Malignancies or AML
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of voruciclib monotherapy in subjects with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies or AML after failure of standard therapies or voruciclib in combination with venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML

Determine the safety and tolerability of voruciclib, Safety will be measured by the incidence of all AEs and SAEs, timing, grade \[CTCAE v4.03\] severity, seriousness, relatedness.

Tolerability will be measured by the incidence of DLTs (dose limiting toxicities), 2 years|Determine the safety and tolerability of voruciclib in combination with venetoclax in subjects with AML., Safety will be measured by the incidence of all AEs and SAEs, timing, grade \[CTCAE v4.03\] severity, seriousness, relatedness.

Overall Response Rate (ORR), defined as the sum of complete response (CR), complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) and partial response (PR) for B-cell malignancies, or for AML the sum of CR/CRi rate by the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) criteria, 2 years|Duration of Response (DOR), defined as the time from the initial determination of response to the time of disease progression or death on study, which ever occurs first, 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first dose of study drug administration (Cycle 1 Day 1) to disease recurrence or progression as defined by IWG criteria, or death on study, 2 years|Evaluate the PK of voruciclib, Determined by the Area Under the Concentration time curve (AUC), 2 years|Evaluate the PK of voruciclib Cmax in combination with venetoclax Determined by the Area Under the Concentration time curve (AUC), Determined by the Area Under the Concentration time curve (AUC), 2 years
This is a Phase 1, open-label, 3 + 3 dose escalation and expansion study to determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of voruciclib monotherapy in subjects with relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies or AML after failure of prior standard therapies or voruciclib in combination with venetoclax in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML. Escalation to the next higher dose level will depend on demonstrated safety and tolerability at each dose level.
