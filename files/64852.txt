Rehabilitation and Longitudinal Follow-up of Cognition in Adult Lower Grade Gliomas
Patients with glial brain tumors have increasingly improved outcomes, with median survival of 5-15 years. However, the treatments, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, often lead to impaired attention, working memory, and other cognitive functions. These cognitive deficits frequently have significant impact on patient quality of life. Although currently, there is no established standard of care to treat cognitive deficits in brain tumor patients, standard cognitive rehabilitative treatments have been developed for those with traumatic brain injury and stroke. However, the feasibility and efficacy of these cognitive treatments in individuals with brain tumors remains unclear.

Percentage of subjects who complete all of the intervention exercises for each cohort (Arm 1), The intervention will be considered feasible for a larger-scale efficacy study if greater than 80% of the subjects complete the intervention. Patients will be replaced if they drop out of the intervention (either by declining their first follow-up visit for Cohort 1 in-person rehab; declining to participate in the Cohort 2 ReMind intervention; or by texting the word "STOP" in the Cohort 3 short message service (SMS) texting intervention)) within the first 14 days. These patients will be replaced.

The Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) measures the strength and direction of association between two variables and can take values from +1 to -1 where a value of +1 indicates a perfect association, an rs of 0 indicates no association and an rs of -1 indicates a perfect negative association.

This trial studies how well cognitive rehabilitation therapy works in improving cognitive function in patients with lower grade gliomas. Patients with low grade gliomas frequently have symptoms of cognitive impairment, such as difficulty with short term memory and processing information, that impacts their daily lives. The ReMind application (app) is an iPad app developed for cognitive rehabilitation for patients. The healthy texting platform was developed to help patients with depression and cognitive difficulty to provide education and track their mood. Methods of cognitive rehabilitation therapy such as in person cognitive rehabilitation, computerized cognitive rehabilitation, and healthy text messaging may help improve cognition and quality of life in patient with low grade gliomas.
