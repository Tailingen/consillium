Study of Focal Cryoablation in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out if men, with low-risk prostate, can have the small amount of cancer within their prostate removed by freezing, called Focal Cryoablation or Cryotherapy.
Prostate Cancer
PROCEDURE: focal cryotherapy
To assess the local oncologic efficacy of focal cryoablation in men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer, as measured by the ability to obtain all negative biopsy cores at the site of focal ablation of the cancer., conclusion of the study
To evaluate the change from baseline in quality-of-life indicators following focal cryoablation in patients with low-risk localized prostate cancer., conclusion of the study|To evaluate treatment related tissue changes with ultrasound imaging, Ultrasound examination of the prostate performed at the time of biopsy procedures will be include archiving of 3D digital images to allow post-hoc analysis of the images to assess for tissue changes that may be characterized with imaging software., prior to performing the biopsy|To evaluate treatment related tissue changes with ultrasound imaging, Ultrasound examination of the prostate performed at the time of biopsy procedures will be include archiving of 3D digital images to allow post-hoc analysis of the images to assess for tissue changes that may be characterized with imaging software., at the 6-8 month patient office visit
