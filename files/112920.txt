Effect of SPGB on ICP and Oxygenation of Cerebral Venous Outflow in Craniotomy for Cerebral Tumors.
This study aims to investigate the effect of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block on ICP and arterio- jugular venous oxygen difference (AJVDO2) and jugular bulb oxygen saturation (SjVO2). Throughout this study, the efficacy of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block as scalp block in craniotomy operation will be assessed, and the effect of SPGB on cerebral hemostasis during craniotomy will be evaluated by monitoring of both ICP, AJVDO2 and SjVO2.
Cerebral Tumor
PROCEDURE: SPGB
Intracranial Pressure, ICP changes checked by a subdural ICP monitor that positioned after the first burr hole at the opposite side of the tumor immediately after induction of anesthesia. ICP monitoring will be conducted every 20 minutes until time of initial craniotomy and at time of closure of the dura., Every 20 minutes until time of initial craniotomy, then again after the dura was sutured.
Jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation and cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference., Jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation will be measured then AVDO2 will be calculated., Every 20 minutes throughout the operation period.
This study was performed in the Neurosurgical operating room and included 52 patients allocated into two groups: the treatment group (block group) and the control group (non-block group). 26 patients enrolled in block group and 26 patients in non-block group.

Intraoperative ICP monitoring by subdural ICP monitors will be done every 20 minutes in both block and non- block groups until craniotomy has been occurred, then at the time of closure of the dura . Arterio- jugular venous oxygen difference and Jugular venous bulb oxygen saturation changes will be recorded every 20 minutes in block and non- block groups throughout time of the surgery till closure of the dura.
