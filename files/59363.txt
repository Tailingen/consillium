Evaluation of a Simple-Prep Controlled Embolic
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the GPX® Embolic Device when used as indicated for embolization requiring distal vessel penetration in 114 subjects in up to 25 investigational sites in the USA, New Zealand, and Canada.
Embolization|Vascular Tumor|Renal Angiomyolipoma|Renal Cell Carcinoma|Bone Tumor|Portal Vein Embolization
DEVICE: GPX® Embolic Device
Freedom from major adverse events (MAEs), MAEs are defined as:

* Nontarget embolization with ischemia in an unintended anatomical area
* Systemic allergic and/or toxic reaction to the GPX Embolic Device
* Catheter entrapment and/or breakage
* Culture-proven abscess in target organ/tissue
* Embolization-related death, Index procedure through 30-day follow-up|Single binomial proportion of successful delivery of the GPX Embolic Device to the target vessel embolization site(s), Determined by the investigator at the time of enrollment, During procedure|Single binomial proportion of successful occlusion of flow immediately beyond the target vessel embolization site(s), Determined by the core lab via comparison of the pre- and final post-embolization images, End of procedure
Occurrence of device-related adverse events (AE) through 30 days post-index procedure, 30-day follow-up|Occurrence of adjunctive embolization agent usage during the embolization procedure, End of procedure|Occurrence of catheter occlusion due to the GPX Embolic Material, End of procedure
The investigation is a single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, prospective, multicenter, multinational pivotal study. Subjects will undergo distal embolization in the peripheral vasculature, including vascular tumors, renal embolizations, and portal vein branches, with the GPX® Embolic Device and will then be followed 30-days post-procedure.
