Dasatinib for Modulating Immune System After Autologous Stem Cell Transplants for Multiple Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin, or Hodgkin Lymphoma
This study uses a drug called dasatinib to produce an anti-cancer effect called large granular lymphocyte cellular expansion. Large granular lymphocytes are blood cells known as natural killer cells that remove cancer cells. Researchers think that dasatinib may cause large granular lymphocyte expansion to happen in patients who have received a blood stem cell transplant (SCT) between 3 to 15 months after the blood SCT. In this research study, researchers want to find how well dasatinib can be tolerated, the best dose to take of dasatinib and to estimate how often large granular lymphocytic cellular expansion happens at the best dose of dasatinib.
