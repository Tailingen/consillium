Phase 0- Pilot Study of Pembrolizumab on Immune Cells in Patient With Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This is an open label, single-arm, pilot trial to evaluate the immune effects, safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in subjects newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have persistent leukemia after induction chemotherapy. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0-1. The enrollment target for this study is 10 patients.
