Phase I Clinical Trial of CT0181 Cells in the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma
A Phase I Clinical Study of CT0181 cells in Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: CT0181 Cells
1.Dose-Limiting Toxicity（DLT）, Safety, 28days|Maximal Tolerable Dose（MTD）, tolerability evaluation, 28days|Treatment Emergent Adverse Event（TEAE）, Incidence rate, 28days|Adverse Event of Special Interest, Incidence rate, 28 days
Primary objectives:

Evaluate the safety and tolerance of CT0181 cells in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma within 28 days after the first infusion

Secondary objectives:

Evaluate the metabolic kinetics of CT0181 cells ; Evaluate overall safety and tolerability ; Evaluate the initial efficacy of CT0181 cell infusion in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with positive Glypican-3（GPC3 ）expression.
