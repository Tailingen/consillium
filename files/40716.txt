Inetetamab Combined With Anti-PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody and Albumin-Bound Paclitaxel for HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is a multi-center, prospective, interventional, single-arm clinical trial. In the study, patients with her2-positive recurrent or metastatic breast cancer who were initially treated were included. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Inetetamab combined with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody and albumin-bound paclitaxel for HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Inetetamab combined with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody and albumin-bound paclitaxel for HER2+ Metastatic Breast Cancer.To explore a new concept of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody combined with immunotherapy in the treatment of recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The primary end point is progression free survival (PFS). The secondary end points are objective response rate (ORR), Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) and safety assessment.
