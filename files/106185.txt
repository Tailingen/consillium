Pharmacokinetics of Entospletinib in Adults With Normal and Impaired Liver Function
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of entospletinib (ENTO) and/or its metabolites (if applicable) in participants with impaired hepatic function (stratified by smoking status, as appropriate) relative to matched, healthy controls.
Oncology
DRUG: Entospletinib
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: AUCtau of ENTO, AUCtau is defined as concentration of drug over time (the area under the concentration verses time curve over the dosing interval)., 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 hours postdose on Day 5|Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameter: Cmax of ENTO, Cmax is defined as the maximum concentration of drug., 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 hours postdose on Day 5
Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), TEAEs are defined as events that meet one of the following criteria:

* Any adverse events (AEs) with onset date of on or after the study drug start date and no later than 30 days after permanent discontinuation of study drug or
* Any AEs leading to premature discontinuation of study drug., Baseline up to Day 9 plus 30 days|Percentage of Participants Experiencing Treatment-Emergent Laboratory Abnormalities, Treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities were defined as values that increase at least one toxicity grade from baseline. The most severe graded abnormality from all tests was counted for each subject., Baseline up to Day 9 plus 30 days
