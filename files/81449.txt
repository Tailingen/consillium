Artificial Intelligence for Early Diagnosis of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common malignant tumor of upper digestive tract. However, the detection rate and diagnosis accuracy of early esophageal squamous cell cancer is low. The aim of this study is to develop a computer-assisted diagnosis tool combining with optical magnifying endoscopy for early detection and accurate diagnosis of it.
