This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, multicenter clinical study to explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride when combined with tislelizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory Extranodal Natural Killer/T Cell Lymphoma（NKTCL）. Liposomal mitoxantrone hydrochloride will be given on day 1 at two different doses (16 mg/m2, 20 mg/m2) and be combined with tislelizumab. The dose limited toxicity (DLT) will be evaluated after the first cycle of therapy. A maximum of 6 cycles of therapy are planned. An dose expansion study of mitoxanquinone hydrochloride liposome at recommended phaseII dose (RP2D) dose level combined with tirelizumab was conducted to explore the efficacy and safety tolerance of the combined regimen. After 6 cycles of induction therapy, if the outcome was assessed as complete remission (CR)/partial remission (PR)/Stable disease (SD), continued maintenance therapy with tirelizumab.
