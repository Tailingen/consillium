Therapeutic Effect of Surgical Debulking of Metastatic Lymph Nodes in Cervical Cancer Stage IIICr
This study is a prospective, multicenter and randomized clinical trial (DEBULK trial) to determine the therapeutic effect of surgical debulking of bulky or multiple lymph nodes before concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) in cervical cancer stage IIICr.

Bulky or multiple lymph nodes metastasis in cervical cancer shows poor prognosis and can also diminish the effect of radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT). However, it is difficult to increase the dose of radiation and chemotherapy considering their side effects. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the therapeutic effect of surgical debulking of bulky or multiple lymph nodes before concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) compared to CCRT only, in cervical cancer stage IIICr. This study is a phase III, multicenter and randomized clinical trial (DEBULK trial).

* Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT)
* Surgical debulking of bulky or multiple lymph node followed by CCRT
