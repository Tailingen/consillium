Investigation of Î²-hydroxybutyrate Supplementation as Chemoprevention in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis
The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of BHB supplementation as a novel strategy to impede the development and progression of intestinal adenomas in individuals with FAP, thus reducing the need for frequent upper endoscopies and colonoscopies, and potentially preventing the need for risk-reducing surgical intervention.

Determine whether oral BHB supplementation is safe and tolerable in FAP, Assessment of FAP patient tolerance of BHB supplements through monitoring of side effects and/or intolerances and patient compliance. We will monitor the percentage of individuals who continue BHB supplementation for the duration of the study, as well as the compliance with taking the BHB supplement., Through study completion, which will be approximately 3 years
Measure whether oral BHB supplementations increases serum BHB levels in FAP, Measure fasting serum BHB levels before, during, and at the end of BHB supplementation to determine if BHB supplementation significantly increases serum BHB levels., Through study completion, which will be approximately 3 years|Change in transcription and protein expression in the intestinal mucosa and in intestinal polyps in FAP after oral BHB supplementation, Transcriptional profiling and subsequent validation with protein level determination will be performed in the intestinal mucosa and in intestinal polyps before and after BHB supplementation to determine if BHB supplementation is having measurable transcriptional and protein effects on the intestinal mucosa and on intestinal polyps., Through study completion, which will be approximately 3 years|Determine whether oral BHB supplementation in FAP reduces intestinal polyp burden, The polyp burden in the duodenum as well as in the lower GI tract (rectal cuff, rectum, rectal pouch) will be calculated through polyp counting and measurement on endoscopy before and after BHB supplementation to permit comparison of polyp burden before and after BHB supplementation., Through study completion, which will be approximately 3 years
We plan to undertake both an initial absorption study (Part A) in up to 9 individuals with FAP followed by a longitudinal, randomized, placebo-controlled study (Part B) in 30 individuals with FAP, who will receive R-1,3-butanediol (HVMN Ketone-IQ), an orally administered BHB precursor. Participants with FAP in Part A will have a blood sample collected and then take R-1,3-butanediol at one of three different doses for 2 weeks, which will be followed by another blood sample collection. In Part B, participants with FAP who undergo their scheduled colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy along with an upper endoscopy will be consented and subsequently randomized to receive either placebo (10 individuals) or R-1,3-butanediol at one of two doses (20 individuals). The participants then return every 4 weeks for a blood draw and at that time will also provide a stool sample, which will allow us to monitor the levels of BHB in their systemic circulation and stool. After 12 weeks of R-1,3-butanediol consumption, an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy will be performed, which will be the same as the procedure performed on study entry.
