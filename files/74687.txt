Ovarian Tissue Cryopreservation in Females Undergoing Procedures That Will Potentially Lead To Loss of Ovarian Function
The purpose of this study is to retrieve and cryopreserve ovarian tissue from females undergoing a treatment that may lead to irreversible loss of ovarian function.
Cancer|Effects of Chemotherapy|Unspecified Complication of Bone Marrow Transplant|Auto Immune Disease
PROCEDURE: Retrieval and Cryopreservation
Return of hormones produced by the ovarian tissue, 3 months after re-implantation
Development of egg(s) appropriate for use in in vitro fertilization, Participants will be followed through their reproductive years (until the patient reaches 45 years of age)
The aim of this preliminary study is to retrieve and properly cryopreserve ovarian tissue for autotransplantation in any premenopausal female whose ovarian function is threatened in a physiological, pathological or iatrogenic manner in an effort to observe the return of ovarian endocrine function and development of egg(s) appropriate for use in in vitro fertilization.
