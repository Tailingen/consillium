A Study to Learn About the Study Medicine Called Vepdegestrant (ARV-471, PF-07850327) in People With ER+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer in China
The purpose of this clinical trial is to learn about the pharmacokinetics. safety and tolerability of the study medicine (called ARV-471) for the potential treatment of advanced estrogen receptor postive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer.

This study is seeking participants have

* ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer
* received at least 1 line of endocrine therapy with or without CDK4/6 inhibitor
* received up to 2 prior regimens of chemotherapy for advanced setting. All participants in this study will receive ARV-471. ARV-471 will be given by mouth at home once a day. The experiences of people receiving the study medicine will be examined. This will help determine if the study medicine is safe and effective.

Participants will take part in this study until their cancer is no longer responding. During this time, they will have visits at the study clinic about every 4 weeks.

Objective Response Rate - Percentage of Participants With Objective Response, Percentage of participants with objective response based assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response.

Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm). No new lesions. PR was defined as \>=30% decrease under baseline of Percentage of participants with objective response based assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)., Baseline up to 24 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit, Percent of participants with confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 24 weeks on study according to RECIST.

Per RECIST v1.1: CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis \<10 mm). No new lesions. PR was defined as \>=30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, Progressive Disease (PD)., Baseline up to 24 weeks|Duration of Objective Response (DOR), DOR: time from date of first documented response (CR or PR) to first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer. RECIST V1.1, a) CR: disappearance of all lesions; any pathological lymph nodes (TLs) or non-pathological (non-TLs) must have reduction in short axis to \<10 mm; normalization of tumor marker level for non-TLs; b) PR: \>=30% decrease in sum of diameter (dia) of all TLs, referring baseline sum of dia; c) PD: \>=20% increase in sum of diameter of all measured target lesions taking as reference smallest sum of diameter of all target lesions recorded at or after baseline, sum must also be absolute increase of \>=5 mm. Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Appearance of at least 1 new lesion. If a participant with a CR or PR had no PD or death due to underlying cancer, participants was censored at date of last adequate tumor assessment., From the date of first documented response (CR or PR) until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 weeks|Presence (rate) or absence of blood biomarkers, To identify biomarkers (ESR1 mutation) of complete response and progression if occurs, immediately after the end of treatment|Number of Participants With Notable Electrocardiogram (ECG) Values, Criteria for notable ECG values were as follow: QT interval (in millisecond \[msec\]) new (newly occurring post-baseline value) greater than (\>) 450, 480, 500, increase from baseline \>30, increase from baseline \>60; corrected QT interval by Fredericia formula (QTcF) in msec new (newly occurring post-baseline value) \> 450, 480, 500, increase from baseline \>30, increase from baseline \>60; corrected QT interval by Bazett's formula (QTcB) in msec new (newly occurring post-baseline value) \> 450, 480, 500, increase from baseline \>30, increase from baseline \>60; heart rate in bpm new (newly occurring post-baseline value) \<60 and \>100., From baseline up to 28 days after last dose of study drug|Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities, Hemoglobin (HGB),hematocrit,erythrocytes (ery.),HDL cholesterol (chl.)\<0.8\*lower limit of normal(LLN);reticulocytes (ret.), ret./ery.
