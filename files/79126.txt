Stereotactic Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer
RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This trial is studying the side effects of stereotactic radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with prostate cancer.
Prostate Cancer
OTHER: questionnaire administration|PROCEDURE: implanted fiducial-based imaging|RADIATION: stereotactic radiosurgery
Number of Grade 3-5 Adverse Events as Assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0, This study's primary goal is to determine the rate of acute grade 3-5 toxicities following CyberKnife treatment. Per RTOG/ECOG, acute toxicity will be defined as occurring within 90 days of completing treatment., Within 90 days of completing treatment
Number of Late Grade 3-5 Toxicities as Assessed by NCI CTCAE v3.0, Late toxicity will be defined as toxicity occurring more than 90 days after treatment. It is graded based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0, and RTOG/ECOG definitions., Within 5 years of completing treatment|Biochemical Disease-free Survival, PSA, Assessed at months 3,6,12,18,24 and every 6 months through 5 years|Disease-free Survival (Phoenix and ASTRO Definitions), Assessed yearly for 5 years|Disease-specific Survival, Assessed yearly for 5 years|Overall Survival, Assessed yearly for 5 years|Rate of Local Failure, Assessed at months 3,6,12,18,24 and every 12 months through 5 years|Rate of Distant Failure, Assessed at months 3,6,12,18,24 and every 12 months through 5 years|Quality of Life as Measured by the Short Form-12 Health Survey, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, and the American Urological Association Symptom Index, and the Utilization of Sexual Medications/Devices, Survey at 1,6,12 months and yearly up to 5 years
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To estimate in both low- and low-to-intermediate-risk groups of patients with prostate cancer, the rate of acute toxicities observed during the 5 years following CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

Secondary

* To estimate the rate of late grade 3-5 toxicities after SRS in these patients.
* To measure biochemical disease-free survival of patients treated with this therapy.
* To measure rates of local failure, distant failure, disease-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this therapy.
* To measure quality of life in generic and organ-specific domains in patients treated with this therapy.
* To evaluate imaging modalities and their potential role in the detection of prostate cancer persistence, recurrence, and/or progression in patients treated with this therapy.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to risk group (low risk vs low/intermediate risk).

Patients undergo fiducial placement using ultrasound. At least 5-10 days later, patients undergo CyberKnife® stereotactic radiosurgery once daily for 5 days.

Patients complete 4 questionnaires at baseline and periodically during study to assess acute and late toxicities and quality of life (e.g., overall health status, patient function, sexual function, and urinary symptoms).

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 5 years.
