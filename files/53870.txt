Far Infrared Radiation Treatment for Uterine Fibroids
A preliminary study to determine the efficacy of using energy specific far infrared (FIR) radiation for the treatment of uterine fibroids.
Leiomyoma
RADIATION: Far Infrared Radiation (5μm to 20μm wavelength)
The primary end point is to determine the therapeutic effects of far infrared radiation on uterine fibroids, 2 years and 9 months
The secondary end point of the study is to evaluate the therapeutic effects of far infrared radiation on other related uterine conditions, for example, bleeding., Two years and nine months
Uterine fibroids are the most common neoplasms of the female pelvis. These benign tumors are generally oval in shape and often highly vascular. On MR imaging exams, uterine fibroids are easily identifiable. They occur in 20-25% of women of reproductive age and can cause a variety of problems generally described as either bleeding or mass effects from the fibroid.

We are postulating that energy specific electromagnetic radiation of the uterus will shrink the benign tumors.
