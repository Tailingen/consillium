Chlorpromazine and Standard of Care in Glioblastoma
This is a phase 1 study investigating the re-purposing of chlorpromazine, combined with temozolomide and radiation in the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.
Glioblastoma Multiforme
DRUG: Chlorpromazine|DRUG: Temozolomide|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy
Safety and acute toxicity of chlorpromazine (CPZ) when administered throughout the standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) will be graded per NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events will be summarized by system organ class and/or preferred term, type of adverse event, and severity (based on NCI CTCAE v5.0 grades), First treatment through 30 days post last dose of study drug|Recommended phase II dose of chlorpromazine in combination with the standard treatment protocol for glioblastoma, The study will utilize a 3+3 design, and up to 6 patients will be treated at each dose level. The recommended Phase II dose will be defined as the highest dose level for which at most 1 of 6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT)., 4 weeks
Progression free survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated with CPZ and standard chemoradiation 6 months from the date of surgery, Time from diagnosis to documented disease progression or death due to any cause., 2 years|2-year overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed GBM treated with CPZ and standard chemoradiation 6 months from the date of surgery, Time from diagnosis up to 2 years post completion of treatment, 2 years
The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and acute toxicity of chlorpromazine (CPZ) when administered throughout the standard treatment protocol for glioblastoma multiforme, as well as determine progression free survival.

Chlorpromazine (25 mg daily for the first 3 patients then dose escalate to 50 mg if no DLT) will be added to a standard of care regimen which includes radiation and adjuvant Temozolomide. Chlorpromazine treatment will continue for up to 6 cycles or until criteria for removal is met. Temozolomide is administered following standard practice adopted at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC).

Subject will have several MRI scans for disease assessment throughout the treatment. There will be 3 phases of treatment for each patient:

Concomitant Chlorpromazine- Start 7 days prior to day 1 of concurrent Temozolomide and radiation. Will continue with Chlorpromazine through radiation therapy (temozolomide will cease after 49 days)

Interim Phase- When radiation has ended, subject will take Chlorpromazine for 28 days- no Temozolomide

Adjuvant phase- subject resumes Temozolomide per standard practice, and continues to take Chlorpromazine through 6 cycles of Temozolomide.
