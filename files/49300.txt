Imexon for Relapsed Follicular and Aggressive Lymphomas
The purpose of this study is to determine whether Amplimexon (imexon for injection) is effective in the treatment of indolent and aggressive lymphomas that have progressed after treatment with standard therapies.

Overall Response Rate of of Participants to Imexon in the Treatment of Relapsed/Refractory Indolent and Aggressive Lymphomas, CT, PET, or MRI scans for the assessment of objective tumor responses were performed at baseline, after cycle 2, and every 3 cycles thereafter until disease progression. Standard response criteria from the International Harmonization Project on Lymphoma were used for classification of objective tumor responses. Response was defined as PR (Regression of measuable disease and no new sites) if \>= 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters of up to 6 largest dominant masses; no increase in size of other nodes (a) \[18F\]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid or PET prior to therapy; one or more (PET) positive at previously involved site (b) Variably FDG-avid or PET negative; regression on CT., One year
Median Time to Progression Free Survival in Participants With Relapsed/Refractory Indolent and Aggressive Lymphomas, Measured from start of treatment until disease progression or death from any cause., up to 25 months
A phase II exploratory trial of imexon in lymphoma is justified by: (1) the observation of clinical activity (partial response to the drug observed in phase I testing in a subject with refractory indolent lymphoma); (2) the finding that imexon prevents the development of human immunoblastic lymphoma in SCID mice; (3) the finding that lymphoma cell lines are killed by readily achievable doses; and (4) translational studies implicating the importance of the redox state of the cancer cell.

The dose and schedule chosen (1000 mg/m2 daily X 5 days every 3 weeks) is based on tolerability and subject acceptance in prior AmpliMed phase I studies.

The planned correlative studies should help to identify potential biomarkers for response to imexon and provide further insight into potential mechanisms of imexon action hypothesized from results of prior laboratory studies.
