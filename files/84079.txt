Laryngeal Preservation in Pyriform Sinus Carcinoma
Patients were eligible if they had biopsy proven, previously untreated T3 with fixed cord involvement squamous cell carcinoma of the pyriform sinus.

The study compare conventional radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin to induction chemotherapy with cisplatin fluorouracil followed by conventional radiotherapy. The primary end point was the preservation of the larynx. The secondary end points included toxicity, causes of death and survival rates.
Squamous Cell Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: induction chemotherapy|PROCEDURE: Conventionnal chemotherapy
The primary end point was to compare the two treatment arms to define the best schedule of preservation of an intact larynx., 2 years
Secondary end points analyzed causes of death, overall survival rate and event (loco-regional recurrent disease, metastases, death) free survival rate., 2 years
Objectives: To compare conventional radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin to induction chemotherapy with cisplatin fluorouracil followed by conventional radiotherapy. The primary end point was the preservation of the larynx. The secondary end points included toxicity, causes of death and survival rates.

Design: Multicenter prospective randomized phase III trial. Setting: Academic tertiary care center. Patients: Seventy one adult patients with biopsy-proven previously untreated resectable T3 with fixed cord involvement squamous cell carcinoma of the pyriform sinus.

Main Outcomes Measures: Patients were evaluated for toxic reactions, and organ preservation and survival rates. Statistical analysis of overall survival and event free survival was performed using the Kaplan Meier method.
