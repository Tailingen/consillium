Chemotherapy-free Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab in HER2-positive Breast Cancer: FDG-PET Response-adapted Strategy.
The study assess the early metabolic effects of neoadjuvant treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (± endocrine therapy) on the primary tumor and axillary lymph nodes and their predictive value for pathologic complete response (pCR) in the breast and axilla.

And also assess 3-year invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) in patients with HER2-positive (HER: human epidermal receptor) breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab and pertuzumab (± endocrine therapy) using a FDG-PET response-adapted strategy.

For all tests, we will use two sided p-values with alpha ≤ 0.05 level of significance.

All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status/quality of life scale, and six single itemsThe QLQ-BR23 (quality of life questionnaire) breast cancer module is meant for use among patients varying in disease stage and treatment modality.The scoring approach for the QLQ-BR23 (quality of life questionnaire) is identical in principle to that for the function and symptom scales/single items of the QLQ-C30., Baseline, cycle 3 (after 63 days approximately), before surgery and end of study through study completion (after cycle 18- after 12 months approximately)|3, 5, and 7-year iDFS, 3, 5, and 7-year iDFS (cohort A; cohort B \[with the exception of 3-year iDFS\]; cohorts A/B by PET responder status, HR status, and HER2 status)., After 3, 5 and 7 years (After 36, 60 and 80 months)|3,5 and 7-year DDFS (DDFS:Distant disease-free survival), 3, 5, and 7-year DDFS (cohort A; cohort B; cohorts A/B by PET responder status, HR status, and HER2 status)., After 3, 5 and 7 years (After 36, 60 and 80 months)|3, 5 and 7-year DFS (DFS:Disease-free survival), 3, 5, and 7-year DFS (cohort A; cohort B; cohorts A/B by PET responder status, HR status, and HER2 status)., After 3, 5 and 7 years (After 36, 60 and 80 months)|3, 5 and 7-year (OS: overall survival), 3, 5, and 7-year OS (cohort A; cohort B; cohort C; cohorts A/B by PET responder status, HR status, and HER2 status), After 3, 5 and 7 years (After 36, 60 and 80 months)|PFS (cohort C) (PFS: Progression-free survival), PFS (patients with subclinical M1 at baseline by 18F-FDG PET/CT - cohort C)., Until progression or death, assessed up to approximately 84 months|Adverse events, Adverse events, grade 3-4 adverse events, related adverse events, serious adverse events, related serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to discontinuation (cohort A; cohort B; cohort C; cohorts A/B by PET responder status, HR status, and HER2 status)., Until progression or death, assessed up to approximately 84 months|3, 5, and 7-year EFS, 3, 5, and 7-year EFS (cohort A; cohort B)., After 3, 5 and 7 years (After 36, 60 and 80 months)|To assess 3, 5, and 7-year adapted iDFS, DDFS, and DFS, To assess 3, 5, and 7-year adapted iDFS, DDFS, and DFS on patients with subclinical M1 at baseline by 18F-FDG PET/CT - cohort C., After 3, 5 and 7 years (After 36, 60 and 80 months)
LINGain sub-study: analyze the variation of peripheral γδ T cells in blood samples, To analyse the variation of peripheral γδ T cells in blood samples from patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer in neoadjuvant treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab (± endocrine therapy) at 6 weeks after start of treatment (end of the 2nd cycle of treatment) respect to the baseline., Screening, end of cycle 1 and end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 21 days)
Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) will be trastuzumab and pertuzumab, carboplatin, and docetaxel, as well as all endocrine therapy drugs to be administered according to HR status (hormone receptor). For cohort C, trastuzumab SC (subcutaneous) and pertuzumab IV will be IMPs until a maximum of 18 cycles.

Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:4 ratio, with a randomization stratified by HR status to receive trastuzumab and pertuzumab with docetaxel and carboplatin (cohort A) or trastuzumab and pertuzumab ± endocrine therapy according to HR status (cohort B).

A F-FDG PET/CT will be performed at baseline (total body) and after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy. Central review of F-FDG PET/CT will be mandatory. Patients allocated into cohort A will continue with the same treatment for a total of six cycles regardless of 18F-FDG PET/CT results. Patients enrolled into cohort B showing at least 40% reduction of the SUVmax of F-FDG PET/CT respect to baseline (PET responders) will continue with the same treatment for a total of 8 cycles. PET-non responders patients will also receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy based on six cycles of docetaxel and carboplatin concurrently with trastuzumab and pertuzumab for all cycles.

Following surgery, cohort B/PET responders patients who do not achieve a pCR will additionally receive six cycles of docetaxel and carboplatin concurrently with trastuzumab and pertuzumab for all cycles. Moreover, all patients from cohorts A/B must complete 18 cycles of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, along with adjuvant endocrine therapy and radiotherapy according to HR status (hormone receptor) and institutional practices, respectively.

An additional exploratory cohort (cohort C) will include patients with evidence of subclinic M1 at baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT, but not previously detected by routine clinical assessment. These patients will receive trastuzumab and pertuzumab with docetaxel and carboplatin for a total of six cycles. After first six cycles, these patients will receive trastuzumab and pertuzumab ± endocrine.therapy according to HR status for at least 12 additional cycles after surgery (only if surgery is performed). According to institutional practices, it will be allowed to continue treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, along endocrine therapy on the basis of HR status, as maintenance therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

A sub-set of 42 patients (35 patients from cohort A and 7 patients from cohort B) from 5 sites in Spain are participating in the LINGain sub-study "Prospective evaluation of predictive/prognostic immunogenicity biomarkers for target therapy in HER2-positive early breast cancer within the PHERGain study" : Hospital General de Valencia, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, IVO, Hospital La Fe and Hospital Arnau de Vilanova.
