A Phase 1, Open-Label, Non-Randomized, Dose-Escalating Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of TAS-119 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: TAS-119
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.03, Identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of TAS-119, Up to 2.5 Years
This is a Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study of TAS-119 evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacogenomics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumour activity in patients with advanced and unresectable solid tumours. The study will evaluate TAS-119 monotherapy, employing two sequential phases.

* A Dose Escalation Phase
* An Expansion Phase
