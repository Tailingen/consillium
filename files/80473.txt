Daratumumab in VHR T-ALL Treated According to the ALL National Treatment Program
The goal of this clinical trial is to test daratumumab in adult very high risk T-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia.

The main question it aims to answer is wether the addition of daratumumab daratumumab to the national standard of care is able to increase the rate of MRD-negative patients after induction therapy.

Participants will be treated with:

• daratumumab in combination with a pediatric-inspired treatment scheme - as in the previous GIMEMA LAL1913 protocol.
T-Lymphocytic Leukemia, Acute
DRUG: Daratumumab plus chemotherapy according to the national treatment program
MRD-negativity rate after cycle 1, Number of patients on the total of evaluable patients without residual disease after the first induction cycle with chemotherapy plus daratumumab, 1 month
This study is a multicenter phase II trial based on the addition of daratumumab to chemotherapy in the front-line treatment of very high-risk T-ALL.

T-ALL patients are eligible at diagnosis in case of ETP or near ETP immunophenotype. Due to their biological and clinical similarities, T-Myeloid MPAL can also be included. Other VHR T-ALL patients (i.e. those with WBC count \>100 x109/L, with complex karyotype with ≥5 unrelated anomalies or with a CD1a-negative immunophenotype) will also be eligible.

A safety run-in is foreseen for 5 patients: if grade \>3 infusion-related reactions or extra hematologic adverse events of grade \>3 that, for investigator's clinical judgement cannot be due to chemotherapy alone, are not observed in more than 2 patients during the first cycle of daratumumab, the study will continue with the core phase.

After a steroid/cyclophosphamide pre-treatment phase, that can occur before enrollment during the screening period, patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be treated with daratumumab in combination with a pediatric-inspired treatment scheme - as in the previous GIMEMA LAL1913 protocol.
