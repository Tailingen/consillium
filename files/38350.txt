Educational Materials Development for Physical Activity in CAncer
In cancer setting, physical exercise has emerged as an important factor to control cancer-related symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. In addition, the correlation between physical activity and survival is recently consolidating. Nevertheless, several previous studies have shown that the majority of cancer patients are insufficiently active. Written information, for example a guidebook, may be a good oppurtunity, to improve lifestyle. Developing and testing an exercise guidebook, based on Theory of Planned Behavior and specifically designed for cancer patients, may be an effective tool to deliver information and increase physical activity level in this population.
