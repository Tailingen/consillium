Breast Cancer, Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy, and Sexual Functioning: The Effects of Vaginal Testosterone Therapy
It is well documented that women who have breast cancer may experience a decrease in quality of life and sexual functioning due to side effects from adjuvant endocrine therapy, typically aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Women taking AIs are more likely to report unpleasant urogenital and vaginal symptoms due to the physiologic suppression of estradiol. This treatment can impair sexual functioning and cause a decreased sexual health quality of life.

At the present time, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for the vulvovaginal or sexual side effects related to the use of AIs. The lack of treatment options is concerning because the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer continues to increase; their longevity, also, continues to increase with the use of newer adjuvant chemotherapies. Local health care practitioners have observed that the benefits of vaginal testosterone for sexual health in breast cancer survivors are similar to the benefits of vaginal estrogen in women without breast cancer.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of using a daily compounded vaginal testosterone cream for 4 weeks (28 days) on breast cancer survivor's reported experience of vulvovaginal symptoms accompanying the use of AIs and their associated quality of life and sexual functioning.

DRUG: Testosterone
Total Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) Score, The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire was administered to participants prior to starting vaginal testosterone therapy and the survey was repeated after using the study drug for 4 weeks. The participants served as their own controls. The FSFI assesses six domains of sexual functioning (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain) over the past 4 weeks. The sum of all domain scores equals the total FSFI score. The total FSFI score ranges from 2-36 and a total FSFI score \< 26.5 suggests female sexual dysfunction., Baseline, 4 weeks|FSFI Desire Domain, The desire score is calculated by adding the individual scores from the desire domain (question #1 and #2) and multiplying the sum by the domain factor of 0.6. The domain score for desire ranges from 1.2 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) and a higher value represents a better outcome., Baseline, 4 weeks|FSFI Arousal Domain, The arousal score is calculated by adding the individual scores from the arousal domain (question #3, #4, #5, #6) and multiplying the sum by the domain factor of 0.3. The arousal domain score ranges from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum)and a higher value represents a better outcome., Baseline, 4 weeks|FSFI Lubrication Domain, The lubrication score is calculated by adding the individual scores from the lubrication domain (question #7, #8, #9, #10) and multiplying the sum by the domain factor of 0.3. The domain score for lubrication ranges from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) and a higher value represents a better outcome., Baseline, 4 weeks|FSFI Orgasm Domain, The orgasm score is calculated by adding the individual scores from the orgasm domain (question #11, #12, #13) and multiplying the sum by the domain factor of 0.4. The domain score for orgasm ranges from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) and a higher value represents a better outcome., Baseline, 4 weeks|FSFI Satisfaction Domain, The satisfaction score is calculated by adding the individual scores from the satisfaction domain (question #14, #15, #16) and multiplying the sum by the domain factor of 0.4. The satisfaction domain score ranges from 0.8 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) and a higher value represents a better outcome., Baseline, 4 weeks|FSFI Pain Domain, The score for pain is calculated by adding the individual scores from the pain domain (question #17, #18, #19) and multiplying the sum by the domain factor of 0.4. The domain score for pain ranges from 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) and a higher value represents a better outcome., Baseline, 4 weeks
