[18F]-AraG for the Detection of T-Cell Activation in Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Patients Undergoing PD-1/PD-L1-Directed Therapy
This trial studies how well \[18F\]-AraG works in detecting T-cell activation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced), who are undergoing PD-1/PD-L1-directed therapy. \[18F\]-AraG is a "radiotracer" which attaches to immune cells directed at the cancer and shines a light that can be seen using a special camera, called a "positron emission tomography" or "PET" scanner. \[18F\]-AraG may improve the ability to detect a response of the cancer in the body to immunotherapy.

DRUG: Fluorine F 18 Ara-G
Fluorine F 18 Ara-G ([18F]-AraG) uptake values in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) before and after treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy obtained, The positron emission tomography (PET) images will be interpreted qualitatively and semi-quantitatively on a lesion-by-lesion basis. Semi-quantitative analysis will be employed as follows: (a) Regions of interest (ROIs) will be placed around tracer avid foci suspicious for malignancy in order to obtain standardized uptake value (SUV) parameters, including maximum SUV (SUVmax), SUVpeak, SUVmean; (b) SUV data will be recorded along with volumetric and positional information in a standardized form., Baseline up to within 2 weeks after starting immunotherapy
Mean change in SUV, All SUV measurements will be summarized descriptively, separately for baseline and follow-up. Descriptive statistics for the SUVs will be done on a subject basis and a per lesion basis. Graphical summaries including box plots will be prepared to illustrate distributions and detect outliers or other findings; numerical summaries will include, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and range as appropriate. For each target lesion, the scan 1 and scan 2 SUV will be determined and compared. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to estimate the mean change in SUV from scan 1 to scan 2, allowing for possible need to account for between-patient random variation both in baseline level of SUV and amount of change. The primary result will be an estimate of the mean change in SUV, with a 95% confidence interval, along with the between patient and within-patient, between-lesion variation., Baseline up to within 2 weeks after starting immunotherapy|Correlation between [18F]-AraG uptake and clinical response, Baseline up to within 2 weeks after starting immunotherapy
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To quantify fluorine F 18 Ara-G (\[18F\]-AraG) uptake (standardized uptake value \[SUV\]) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor (primary, nodal, and metastatic sites) at baseline and after 1 dose of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy in both patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy and in patients treated with immunotherapy/chemotherapy combination therapy.

II. To correlate change in \[18F\]-AraG uptake before and after the start of therapy with radiographic response in patients treated with immunotherapy.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive \[18F\]-AraG intravenously (IV) and then undergo PET/CT over 2 hours at baseline and within 2 weeks after starting immunotherapy. Patients may also undergo blood sample collection.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 12 months.
