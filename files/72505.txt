Olinvacimab With Pembrolizumab in Patients With mTNBC
The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Olinvacimab in combination with Pembrolizumab in patients with mTNBC.
Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
DRUG: Olinvacimab
Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). RECIST 1.1 will be used to determine ORR and patients with no post baseline tumor assessments, will be classified as non-responders, Baseline upto 24 months
Duration of response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time between the date of first response (CR or PR) according to RECIST 1.1 to the date of first disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Baseline upto 24 months|Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST 1.1., Baseline upto 24 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS time is defined as the time from the start date of the study drug administration to date of the first disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first., Baseline upto 24 months|Overall survival (OS), OS time is defined as the time from the start date of the study drug administration to the date of death due to any cause., Baseline upto 24 months
ORR evaluated by iRECIST criteria:, ORR will be evaluated based on iRECIST criteria in the FAS., Baseline upto 24 months|DOR evaluated by iRECIST criteria:, DOR will be evaluated based on iRECIST criteria in the FAS., Baseline upto 24 months|DCR evaluated by iRECIST criteria:, DCR will be evaluated based on iRECIST criteria in the FAS., Baseline upto 24 months|PFS evaluated by iRECIST criteria:, PFS will be evaluated based on iRECIST criteria in the FAS., Baseline upto 24 months|OS evaluated by iRECIST criteria:, OS will be evaluated based on iRECIST criteria in the FAS., Baseline upto 24 months|Pharmacodynamic evaluation, Change in concentration of serum biomarkers, Baseline upto 24 months|Exome sequencing of tumor tissue, The descriptive information of tumor tissue with mutation, Screening visit|Immune suppression by level of circulating MDSC population, The percent change of MDSC compared to baseline (before treatment on day 1 of cycle 1) will be measured., Baseline upto 24 months
After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients will complete informed consent form in written. During 2 weeks screening period, investigator will evaluate patient eligibility and if it meet with protocol, patient will enrolled. 1 cycle treatment is perform on D1, D8, D15 to inject Olinvacimab and Pembrolizumab, it can be repeated upto 35 cycles.
