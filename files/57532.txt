Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Followed by Chemoradiation Versus Chemoradiation for Stage IIIC Cervical Cancer Patients: A Randomized Phase III Trial
Evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with albumin-bound paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for stage IIIC cervical cancer patients with carcinoma \>4 cm in greatest dimension and/or lymph node \>2cm in short axis.

3-year progression-free survival ratio, the time from study randomization to 3 years, the ratio for patients without disease progression nor death., up to 3 years
in this phase III tiral , stage IIIC cervical cancer patients with carcinoma \>4 cm in greatest dimension and/or lymph node \>2cm in short axis will be randomly assigned to two circles of NAC with albumin-bound paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by standard CRT with weekly cisplatin plus pelvic radiotherapy or to standard CRT alone.

The primary end point was 3-year progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points were response rate, 3-year locoregional control, 3-year overall survival (OS), safety, and quality of life.
