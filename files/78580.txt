Intravesical Mitomycin C After Diagnostic Ureteroscopy for Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma
The objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a phase III randomized trial of intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) for prevention of intravesical recurrence (IVR) after diagnostic ureteroscopy for suspected upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). In the current study, 40 patients will be randomized to receive MMC or no intervention and will be followed for two years to determine the incidence of adverse events and IVR.
