DEVICE: MyoStrainÂ®
Sensitivity and accuracy of detection of patients with myocardial dysfunction who necessitate cardioprotection during cancer treatment using MyoStrain compared to standard of care (SOC) as measured by left ventricular ejection fraction, -Receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to identify criteria for standard of care and MyoStrain cardiac features to detect subclinical cardiotoxicity.

-. Considering many patients will have a complex management of cardioactive medications as well as cancer treatment regimen, the classification of cardiotoxicity status will be based on a clinical committee to designate whether the patient experienced no cardiotoxicity, functional decline without cardiotoxicity, subclinical cardiotoxicity, or clinical cardiac dysfunction at each exam time point, Through 36 months|Sensitivity & accuracy of detection of patients requiring cardioprotection therapy for cardiotoxicity during cancer treatment who demonstrate an improvement in myocardial function using MyoStrain compared to SOC as measured by LVEF, -Receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to identify criteria for standard of care and MyoStrain cardiac features to detect improvement in cardiac function due to cardioprotective therapy in patients exhibiting cardiotoxicity
