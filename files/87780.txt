Efficacy of Ipsilateral High Thoracic Ultrasound-guided Erector Spinae Plane Block in Thoracic Cancer Surgeries
To evaluate the effectiveness of ultrasound guided Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) in controlling post thoracotomy ipsilateral shoulder pain.
Thoracotomy|Erector Spinae Plane Block|Thoracic Cancer|Shoulder Pain
PROCEDURE: Thoracic Epidural Analgesia (TEA) group|PROCEDURE: Thoracic Epidural Analgesia and Erector Spinae Plane Block (ESPB) group
Percentage of patients with ipsilateral shoulder pain., Percentage of patients with ipsilateral shoulder pain with a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ≥ 3 where (0 = no pain and 10 = severe pain) in the first postoperative hour., one hour postoperatively
Time to first rescue analgesia, Time to first analgesic request after surgery in the form of intravenous morphine in a dose (0.05 mg/kg), 24 hours postoperatively|Changes in postoperative heart rate, Heart rate will be recorded before block performance and before induction of anesthesia, intraoperatively every 10 min till the end of surgery and after surgery at T (30 min in Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 hours)., Preoperatively, intraoperatively, and 24 hours postoperatively|Changes in postoperative in mean arterial blood pressure, Mean arterial blood pressure will be recorded before block performance and before induction of anesthesia, intraoperatively every 10 min till the end of surgery and after surgery at T (30 min in Post-Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 hours)., Preoperatively, intraoperatively, and 24 hours postoperatively.|Total intra-operative fentanyl consumption., In case of an elevation of heart rate or mean arterial blood pressure ≥ 20% of the baseline will be treated by fentanyl 0.5 μg / kg., intraoperatively|Changes in postoperative oxygen saturation, Mean oxygen saturation at predetermined time intervals (1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours)., 24 hours postoperatively|Complications occurrence, Adverse events as bradycardia, hypotension, failed block, local anesthetic toxicity, drowsiness and dizziness., 24 hours postoperatively
The aim of thoracotomy surgery is to explore the thoracic cavity and manage different pathologies including pulmonary, diaphragmatic, mediastinal, esophageal and vascular pathologies. It can be performed posterolaterally, anterolaterally or even anteriorly.

Post-thoracotomy Ipsilateral Shoulder Pain could undermine pain management in the post-thoracotomy patient.

Erector spinae plane block is a relatively novel block and was first described for chronic thoracic neuropathic pain in 2016. It is an inter-fascial plane block, but it may be classified as a paraspinal block due to its mechanism of action and injection site. It has been reported for a variety of indications, as in thoracic neuropathic pain and in postoperative analgesia after major open abdominal surgery. Erector spinae plane block has been successfully used to treat chronic shoulder pain, and the local anesthetic spread was reported to reach the level of C3 when it was performed at T2.

Ultrasound imaging made the practice of regional anesthesia easier in visualization and identification of usual and unusual position of nerves, blood vessels, needle during its passage through the tissues, as well as deposition and spread of local anesthetics in the desired plane and around the desired nerve.
