Evaluating the Effectiveness of Decitabine With Gemcitabine, Oxaliplatin for Relapsed/Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma
To establish an optimal therapeutic strategy for patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) who have relapsed after first-line chemotherapy or are refractory to initial treatment, we designed a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy of a multidrug combination regimen comprising decitabine, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin as a second-line or later treatment. This clinical trial is based on a review of existing literature, which supports the rationale for using this three-drug combination.
Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL)
DRUG: Decitabine with GemOx|DRUG: GemOx
Objective response rate, The objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) to treatment, as assessed by Lugano criteria., From cycle 1 day 1 to completion of cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)
Complete response (CR) rate, From cycle 1 day 1 to completion of cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Time to response (TTR), From cycle 1 day 1 to completion of cycle 6 (each cycle is 21 days)|Progression-free survival (PFS), From cycle 1 day 1 to study completion, an average of 2 years.|Overall survival (OS), From cycle 1 day 1 to study completion, an average of 2 years.
