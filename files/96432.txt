Prostate Cancer Metastatic Disease
DRUG: HRS-2189|DRUG: HRS-5041
PSA50, PSA50 is the percentage of evaluable patients with ≥50% decline in PSA level, measured at baseline and the time point of every 4 weeks in efficacy analysis set., up to 2 years
PSA30, PSA30 is the percentage of evaluable patients with ≥30% decline in PSA level measured at baseline and the time point of every 4 weeks in efficacy analysis set., up to 2 years|Time to PSA progression, The definition is the time from the date of first dose until the date of first PSA progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression). PSA progression is per PCWG3 criteria and newest version of CSCO guideline as follows: 1) if PSA level declines from baseline, PSA level is ≥25% increase from baseline and ≥1 ng/ml, which needs to be confirmed after at least 4 weeks; 2) if PSA level has not declined from baseline, PSA level is ≥25% increase from baseline and ≥1 ng/ml after at least 12 weeks from the date of first dose., up to 2 years|ORR by investigator, ORR is the percentage of evaluable patients with a confirmed investigator-assessed response of CR (complete response) or PR (partial response) per RECIST v1.1, and measured at baseline and the time point of every 8 weeks in first 16 weeks, at the time point of every 12 weeks after first 16 weeks., up to 2 years|DCR by investigator, DCR is the percentage of evaluable patients with a confirmed investigator-assessed response of CR (complete response), PR (partial response) or SD (stable disease) per RECIST v1.1, and measured at baseline and the time point of every 8 weeks in first 16 weeks, at the time point of every 12 weeks after first 16 weeks., up to 2 years|DoR, DoR is the time from the date of first detection of objective response (which is subsequently confirmed) until the date of objective radiographic disease progression., up to 2 years|rPFS, rPFS is the time from the date of first dose until the date of objective radiographic disease progression or death (by any cause in the absence of progression) per RECIST v1.1 and PCWG3 criteria., up to 2 years|Time to next skeletal-related event, The definition is the time from the date of first dose until the date of next skeletal-related event. Skeletal-related events include radiotherapy or surgery to the bone, pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or changing anti-tumor treatment in order to relieve bone pain., up to 2 years|OS, OS is the time from the date of first dose until the date of death by any cause., up to 2 years|Percentage of participants who experience an adverse event [Safety and Tolerability], An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study treatment and irrespective of causality to study treatment. Percentage of participants who experience an adverse event and discontinue study drug due to an AE., From the time of informed consent provided to 30 days after the last dose of study therapy
