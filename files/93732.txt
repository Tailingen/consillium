Clinical Study of an Dendritic and Glioma Cells Fusion Vaccine With IL-12 for Treatment-naïve GBM Patients.
A multi-center, open-label, single-arm, phase I/II clinical study is designed to test the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational Dendritic and Glioma Cells Fusion vaccine given with IL-12 for treatment-naïve patients after resection of glioblastoma.

Adverse Events (AE) / Serious Adverse Events (SAE), AE/SAE associated with the intervention will be captured throughout the treatment portion of the study. All adverse events will be then compiled and these patients will be recorded., 2-3 years|Progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months, Assessed from this study start date to the date of the first observation of clinical or radiographic disease progression or death due to any cause. Patients will be censored at the time they are last known to be alive and progression free (if withdrawn or lost to follow-up)., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 6 months
Immunological Assays, Assays including Flow Cytometry and Elispot will be employed to determine if cellular and humoral immunity were induced by serial vaccination with DC/Tumor Fusion Cells and IL-12., 2-3 years|Overall survival (OS) time, Assessed from this study start date to date of death of any cause. Patients will be censored at the time that they are last known to be alive (if withdrawn or lost to follow-up)., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 120 months
This clinical trail includes two phases: basic treatment phase and immunotherapy phase. In basic treatment phase, patients will receive concomitant radiation and TMZ-chemotherapy. In immunotherapy phase, besides maintenance chemotherapy with TMZ, Fusion cells will be administered with IL-12 to enhance the immunity of patients.
