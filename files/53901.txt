Bortezomib as First Salvage Therapy for Myeloma Patients Previously Exposed to Bortezomib as Initial Treatment.
This observational, non-interventional, retrospective, multicenter, national study focuses on collecting information about the effectiveness and safety of bortezomib re-use at first relapse in MM patients already treated in their first line with a bortezomib-based regimen, re-challenged with the same drug according to current clinical practice and/or Italian SIE/SIES/GITMO, IMWG and/or NCCN Guidelines/Treatment Recommendations.

Data will be collected retrospectively from approximately 25 haematologic/oncologic sites in Italy. Approximately, data of up to 100 patients will be collected.
