TCb vs EC-T in High Risk ER+/HER2- Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of docetaxel plus carboplatin (TCb) regimen compared with conventional chemotherapy regimen (epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, EC-T) regimen as adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage high-risk estrogen receptor (ER) positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (ER+/HER2-) breast cancer.

invasive disease-free survival (iDFS), invasive disease-free survival, 5 years
distant relapse free survival (DRFS), distant relapse free survival, 5 years|overall survival (OS), overall survival, 5 years|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events adverse events according to CTCAE 5.0, through study completion, an average of 1 year|Quality of life measured by EORTC QLQ C30, Registration of differences in quality of life between the two groups in the study. EORTC QLQ-C30(scale range 0-100, a higher score indicating better quality of life) will be used for as quality of life measurement. The scores will be presented graphically in separate figures. Differences between the groups will be tested using t-test and analysis of covariance., 5 years
