Study of 23ME-01473 in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
This is a first-in-human open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of 23ME-01473 given by intravenous infusion in participants with advanced solid cancers who have progressed or are intolerant of available standard therapies.

This study includes a dose escalation portion to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) to evaluate the clinical activity of 23ME-01473 and further evaluate its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in participants with solid malignancies.
