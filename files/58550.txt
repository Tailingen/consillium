Study of Cetuximab Plus/Minus Weekly Paclitaxel After Progression To First-Line Pembrolizumab Plus Platinum-5FU in Subjects With Recurrent/Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) arises from epithelial cells and occurs in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx. SCCHN is the seventh most common cancer worldwide with an annual incidence of approximately 90.000 cases per year in Europe.

Recurrent / metastatic SCCHN remains a grievous diagnosis and optimal treatment options after progression to first-line ICI treatment are not determined yet. Previous reports showed that cetuximab plus paclitaxel after progression to ICI therapy may have an enhanced activity as second line after ICI therapy ERBIOTAX is multi-center, open-label, randomized, non-comparative two-arm, phase 2 trial Investigator Initiated Study.

The primary study aims is to evaluate the efficacy of weekly cetuximab combined with paclitaxel (Arm A) or cetuximab monotherapy (Arm B) after progression to pembrolizumab plus platinum / 5-FU. The efficacy of treatment will be assessed through objective response rate (ORR).

Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to ERBITAX (cetuximab + paclitaxel) and cetuximab, respectively, assigning 2 patients to Arm A and 1 patient to Arm B out of 3 patients. No stratification for the randomization process is planned as this is a non-comparative study. A total of 65 evaluable patients will be included in the trial; 41 in Arm A and 24 in Arm B.

The main hypothesis is that treatment with the cetuximab +/- paclitaxel regimen maybe more effective after immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) failure in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Recurrent / Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: Paclitaxel
Confirmed objective response rate (ORR) according to RECIST V1.1 criteria, Objective response rate (ORR) will be Assessed by the investigator through imaging follow-up (CT scan/MRI) using RECIST 1.1. This will be considered as the percentage/proportion of patients with confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as their overall best response throughout the study period.

Objective responses must be confirmed in a second CT scan performed 4 weeks later (+ 7 day window). Objective responses will be assessed locally by the investigator according to RECIST, version 1.1, and indicating the change in size of tumors as compared with baseline, at the first dose of study treatment., Throughout the study period, approximately 24 months
DCR (Disease Control Rate), Percentage/proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), according to ORR definition for the trial, or maintained stable disease (SD) as their overall best response, assessed by imaging follow-up (CT scan/MRI) and RECIST 1.1 criteria. Stable disease should be maintained for at least 4 months to be considered as a DCR event., Throughout the study period, approximately in a time frame 6 months from the start of treatment|Progression-free surviva (PFS), Progression-free survival (PFS): Time from randomization to the date of confirmed PD according to RECIST 1.1. Patients alive and free of events at the date of the analysis will be censored at their last known tumor assessment. Patients who start a new treatment line without progression will be censored on the date of first dose of the subsequent anticancer treatment., Throughout the study period, at week 8 and every 12 weeks thereafter from start treatment for up to approximately 24 months|Overall survival (OS), Overall survival (OS): defined as the time elapsed from randomization until death from any cause. We will assess the median OS, estimated by Kaplan-Meier. Patients alive and free of events at the date of the analysis will be censored at their last known contact. Survival will be assessed by recording patient status at each visit. Patients will be followed up for at least 2 years, Throughout the study period, approximately 24 months from start treatment|Frequency and severity of adverse events and Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), Frequency and severity of adverse events and Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) assessed by NCI CTCAE v5.0 Adverse events (AE) assessment: type, frequency, outcome of adverse events and severe adverse events (SAEs). Actions taken regarding cetuximab and paclitaxel (i.e. treatment interruptions) will be recorded.

Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessment: type, frequency, grade, outcome, relation with study treatment, all considering the total number and proportion based on the safety population.

Treatment-related AEs: An event is assessed as related to study treatment when there is a reasonable possibility that study treatment caused the event. Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between study treatment and the event. This event is called a suspected adverse reaction. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug., Throughout the study period, approximately a time frame of 2 years from start treatment|Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), assessed through the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3, the head and neck specific module QLQ-H\&N35 and EuroQol EQ-5D.

These questionnaires ask questions in relation to physical, emotional, social aspects and in general the level of functionality of patients diagnosed with cancer in the last week after application.

The scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better functioning for the patients, except for symptoms scales, in which high scores indicate greaters symptoms., Throughout the study period, approximately a time frame of 2 years from start treatment

3. Study Design The ERBIOTAX trial is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, non-comparative two-cohort, Phase II clinical trial of cetuximab either as monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel in patients with SCCHN progressing on or after pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line combination therapy. Additional details on the eligibility criteria of the study are found in protocol.

   The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of weekly cetuximab combined with paclitaxel (Arm A) or cetuximab monotherapy (Arm B) after progression to pembrolizumab plus platinum / 5-FU. The efficacy of treatment will be assessed through ORR.

   The design includes a screening phase in which patient eligibility is addressed, a treatment phase with cetuximab, either as a single agent or combined with paclitaxel, and a follow-up phase.

   Signed informed consent form (ICF) will be obtained prior to the start of the specified screening window. Procedures conducted as part of the subject's routine clinical management (e.g., blood count determinations and imaging studies) prior to signing of ICF may be used for screening or for defining baseline data, provided these procedures are conducted as specified in the protocol.Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to ERBITAX and cetuximab, respectively.
4. Study population The trial will include 65 evaluable patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (41 in group A and 24 in group B).
5. Study Treatments

Patients will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to cetuximab + paclitaxel (ERBITAX) (Arm A) or to cetuximab monotherapy (Arm B). The complete schedule of treatment is detailed below:

ARM A: Cetuximab 400 mg/m2 initial dose followed by 250 mg/m2 + Paclitaxel 80mg/m2 (D1, D8 and D15 each 3-weeks cycle) for 4 cycles. Then, monotherapy maintenance with cetuximab at a dose of 500 mg/m2 will be administered biweekly (D1 and D15; Q4W) until disease progression or death, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal of consent\*.
