A Novel Serological Risk Model for Early Non-invasive Diagnosis of Cholangiocarcinoma
This is a prospective, observational and exploratory clinical study. The object of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of a novel serological risk model on blood samples in early diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma patients.
Cholangiocarcinoma
DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: No interventions
Malignant/Benign status of enrolled suspected cholangiocarcinoma patients by pathological examination, The pathological examination results of each enrolled patient will be recorded, 4 weeks|Malignant/Benign status of enrolled suspected cholangiocarcinoma patients evaluated by the novel serological risk model, The novel serological risk model will be constructed for differential malignant/benign diagnosis, 2 weeks
A reliable and accurate preoperative tool capable of early diagnosing malignant cholangiocarcinoma is lacking and urgently needed for clinical practice. This study proposes to establish and evaluate a novel serological risk model on blood samples for non-invasively diagnosing cholangiocarcinoma. The study includes the construction of capable novel serological risk model and the validation of the diagnosis model.
