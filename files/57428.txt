Clinical Research for the Consistency Analysis of PD-L1 in Cancer Tissue and Plasma Exosome
The detection of tissue PD-L1 immunohistochemistry in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has an important role in guiding for the treatment of immune detection point. At the same time,tissue detection is time-consuming and laborious, liquid biopsy can reflect the information of tumor tissue,PD-L1 mRNA in plasma exosomes (pExo) is expected to be simple, rapid, non-invasive means of detection. The project is planned to explore the consistency analysis of PD-L1 expression level detected in cancer tissues and pExo.We have designed to detected the expression levels of PD-L1 mRNA and protein in cancer tissue and detected the expression levels of PD-L1 mRNA in pExo.By using variance analysis of repeated measures design information. Thus exploring the consistency analysis of PD-L1 expression level detected in tissues and pExo,guiding clinical practice of radiotherapy combining with immunotherapy.
