In China, the incidence of esophageal cancer has declined in recent years, but the mortality rate has been ranked fourth. Morbidity and mortality were ranked sixth and fourth in all malignancies, respectively. Therefore, esophageal cancer has always been a major malignant tumor that threatens the health of our residents. Investigator designed a single-arm, open-label, phase II trial of Toripalimab Combined With Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of Toripalimab Combined With Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
