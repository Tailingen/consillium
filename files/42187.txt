The Evaluation of PC14586 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Harboring a TP53 Y220C Mutation (PYNNACLE)
The Phase 2 monotherapy portion of this study is currently enrolling and will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PC14586 (INN rezatapopt) in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation. The Phase 1 portion of the study will assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of multiple dose levels of rezatapopt as monotherapy and in Phase 1b in combination with pembrolizumab.

Rezatapopt is a first-in-class, oral, small molecule p53 reactivator that is selective for the TP53 Y220C mutation.

The primary objective of Phase 2 Monotherapy is to evaluate the efficacy of rezatapopt at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) including the Overall Response Rate (ORR) in the Ovarian Cancer Cohort and the ORR across all cohorts as determined by blinded independent central review. Secondary objectives of Phase 2 are to characterize the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, quality of life, and other efficacy measures of PC14586 rezatapopt at the RP2D. Enrollment is open for the Phase 2 Monotherapy portion of the study.

The primary objective of Phase 1 Monotherapy is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D of rezatapopt. Secondary objectives are to characterize the PK properties, safety and tolerability, and to assess preliminary efficacy including ORR. Enrollment into Phase 1 Monotherapy is complete.

The primary objective of Phase 1b Combination Therapy is to establish the MTD/RP2D of rezatapopt when administered in combination with pembrolizumab. Secondary objectives of Phase 1b Combination Therapy are to characterize PK, safety and tolerability, and to assess preliminary efficacy of rezatapopt when administered in combination with pembrolizumab, including ORR. Enrollment into Phase 1b Combination Therapy is complete.
