An Open-label, Dose Escalation, Pharmacodynamic, Pharmacokinetic, and Effect of Food Phase 1 Study of E7820 to Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose Following Twice Daily Oral Administration in Subjects With Unresectable Solid Tumors
This study consists of two Parts. Part A (Food Effect Study) and Part B (Determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose \[MTD\] for twice daily \[BID\] Dosing).Part A will be initiated first, and Part B will be initiated after the PK results of Part A have been evaluated.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: E7820|DRUG: E7820
Treatment Phase Part A: AUC(0-inf): Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to Infinity for E7820, Day 1 or 8: 0.5-48 hours|Treatment Phase Part A: AUC(0-t): Area Under the Plasma Concentration- Time Curve From Time 0 to t for E7820, Day 1 or 8: 0.5-48 hours|Treatment Phase Part A: Cmax: Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration for E7820, Day 1 or 8: 0.5-48 hours|Treatment Phase Part B: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of E7820 BID Dosing Schedule, MTD defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 participants experienced a dose-limiting toxicity(DLT), with the next higher dose having at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 participants experiencing DLTs. DLTs were defined using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events(CTCAE) Version 4.03 as: Neutropenia less than(\<) 0.5\*10\^9/liter(L) for greater than(\>) 5 days; neutropenia \<1\*10\^9/L with fever; thrombocytopenia \<25\*10\^9/L accompanied by bleeding or thrombocytopenia \<10\*10\^9/L; any Grade 3 or 4 nonhematological toxicity for which the study drug could not be excluded as a cause (other than nausea, vomiting or diarrhea in the absence of appropriate prophylaxis) with the following clarification: Grade 3 or 4 nonhematological laboratory abnormalities for which there was no expected clinical correlation would not be considered DLTs; treatment delay of \>14 days required to recover from E7820-related toxicities., Up to Cycle 6 (Cycle length =28 days)
Extension Phase Part A, and Treatment and Extension Phase Part B: Number of Participants With Best Overall Response (BOR), BOR based on RECIST 1.1 for target and non-target lesions is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for \>4 weeks or stable disease (SD) for \>5 weeks from first dose. CR: disappearance of target and non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level, all lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (\<10 millimeter \[mm\] short axis). PR: at least 30% decrease in sum of diameters (SOD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline SOD persistence of one or more non- target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest SOD. PD: at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the SOD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., From first dose of study drug (Baseline) up to approximately 6.6 years|Extension Phase Part A, and Treatment and Extension Phase Part B: Duration of Response, Duration of response based on RECIST 1.1 for target and non-target lesions is the time from the date of first documented confirmed CR/PR until the first documentation of confirmed progressive disease (PD) or death, whichever came first. CR: disappearance of target and non-target lesions,normalization of tumor marker level,all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size(\<10 mm short axis). PR: at least 30% decrease in SOD of target lesions,taking as reference the baseline SOD persistence of one or more non- target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. PD:at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the SOD of target lesions,taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions., From date of first documented confirmed CR/PR until date of first documentation of PD or death (approximately up to 6.6 years)|Extension Phase Part A, and Treatment and Extension Phase Part B: Number of Participants With Death and Progressive Disease (PD), PD: at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the SOD of target lesions. For PD: participants with best response of PD have been reported. For Death: participants with death known to have died at any point have been reported., From first dose date to the date of the first documentation of confirmed PD or death (approximately up to 6.6 years)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Safety assessments consisted of monitoring and recording all AEs and SAEs; regular monitoring of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urine values; physical examinations; and regular measurement of vital signs, ECG, and multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scans or echocardiograms., From the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug (approximately up to 6.6 years)
