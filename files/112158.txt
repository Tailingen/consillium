A CR-UK Phase I Trial of LY3143921
This clinical study is looking at a drug called LY3143921 hydrate (a Cdc7 inhibitor) in adult patients with advanced solid tumours. The main aims are to find out the maximum dose of LY3143921 hydrate that can be given safely to patients, more about the potential side effects and how they can be treated

This clinical study is looking at a drug called LY3143921 hydrate (a Cdc7 inhibitor). Cdc7 helps our cells replicate correctly. In normal cells, Cdc7 is usually found at a low level, but can reach higher levels in cancer cells. This is often the case in certain types of solid tumour cancers, which we will focus on in this study. It is thought that giving LY3143921 hydrate will block the function of Cdc7 and will affect cancer cells by stopping their replication and causing them to die. LY3143921 hydrate looks promising in laboratory studies and studies in animals.

This clinical study has two parts:

Part 1 - a 'dose escalation' phase where groups of patients will receive increasing doses of LY3143921 hydrate to find a safe dose and a dose that best targets the cancer cells. This part of the trial is now closed.

Part 2 - an 'expansion' phase where a larger group of patients will receive the highest dose of LY3143921 hydrate considered to be safe from Part 1, to find out more about how the drug is working.
