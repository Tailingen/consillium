Rehabilitation - Physical Activity and Coping
The project is a non-randomized intervention study with group-based physical exercise. Cancer survivors who have participated in the rehabilitation program at the Center for Education and Rehabilitation are included in the study.

The cancer and cancer treatment have led to patients struggling with physical, mental and social late effects which prevent them from functioning in everyday life and return to work. The purpose of the project is to investigate whether one municipal group training measure can help to lower the threshold for the user to maintain good exercise habits and return to work / everyday life, as well as the effect on the user's physical form and quality of life and the transition between health level and the body itself measure.
