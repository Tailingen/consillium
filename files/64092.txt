A Study to Evaluate LBL-007 in Combination With Tislelizumab Plus Chemotherapy in Participants With Unresectable Locally Advanced or Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
This is a randomized, open-label study to compare how well LBL-007 works in combination with tislelizumab and chemotherapy versus tislelizumab and chemotherapy when given as the first-line treatment in participants with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
