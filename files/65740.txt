Interferon-α for TP53 Myeloid Malignancy Post Allo-HSCT
To investigate the efficacy of interferon-α prophylaxis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with TP53 mutation who were negative for minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry within 2 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To explore the efficacy of interferon-α in reducing the relapse rate of AML/MDS patients with TP53 mutation after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).
Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: IFN-Α
The incidence of relapse, Disease relapse was defined as blasts ≥ 5% post transplantation., 1 year post HSCT
The incidence of positive minimal residual disease post allo-HSCT, Positive MRD was defined as leukemia-associated immunophenotyping (LAIPs) by flow cytometry., 1 year post HSCT|The incidence of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD), The severity of acute GvHD (aGvHD) and chronic GvHD (cGvHD) was evaluated according to standard criteria., aGvHD within 100 days and cCvHD within 1 year|The incidence of non-relapse mortality, The incidence of non-relapse mortality, 1 year post HSCT.|The probability of progression free survival, Survival without disease progression, 1 year post HSCT.|The probability of overall survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from transplantation to death from any cause or to the last follow-up., 1 year post HSCT.
