A Safety and Efficacy Study of Allogeneic CAR Gamma-Delta T Cells in Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory Solid Tumors
This study is composed of phase I and IIa parts. The dose-escalation phase I part aims to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to identify the safety of CAR001 in subjects with relapsed/refractory solid tumor; the dose-expansion phase IIa part aims to evaluate the potential efficacy of CAR001 in subjects with relapsed/refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), colorectal cancer (CRC) or Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
Solid Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: HLA-G-CAR.BiTE allogeneic γδ T cells
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of CAR001 for Phase I part, MTD was determined by testing increasing doses once a week for 4 weeks via IV on dose escalation cohorts 1 to 5 with 3 to 6 participants each. MTD reflects the highest dose of drug that did not cause a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in \> 33% of participants. DLTs were defined as any AE ≥ grade 3 (CTCAE v5.0) that is considered to be causally related (possibly, probably, or definitely related) to CAR001 within 4 weeks., 4 weeks after last dosing of CAR001|Objective Response Rate (ORR) of CAR001 for Phase IIa part, The rate of subjects with CR or PR based on RECIST1.1 in patients with NSCLC, TNBC or CRC; RANO in patients with GBM. Although there is no control group in this study, the ORR after CAR001 administration could be compared to baseline., from visit 1 to 24-months of safety and efficacy follow-up period
Safety - AEs and SAEs incidences over the study period, The incidence of AEs and SAE from screening to the end of study or until documented disease progression., from visit 1 to 24-months of safety and efficacy follow-up period|Safety - Vital signs assessments at each post-treatment, Changes of vital signs at each post-treatment measurement or until documented disease progression from baseline., from visit 1 to 24-months of safety and efficacy follow-up period|Safety - Laboratory examinations at each post-treatment, Changes of laboratory data at each post-treatment measurement or until documented disease progression from baseline., from visit 1 to 24-months of safety and efficacy follow-up period|Safety - 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) assessments at each post-treatment, Changes of ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS interval, and QT interval by 12-lead ECG at each post-treatment measurement or until documented disease progression from baseline., from visit 1 to 24-months of safety and efficacy follow-up period|Safety - Physical Examination at each post-treatment, Abnormality in physical examination at each post-treatment measurement or until documented disease progression from baseline., from visit 1 to 24-months of safety and efficacy follow-up period|Efficacy - Progression Free Survival (PFS) rate, Time from 1st CAR001 administration to disease progression determined by MRI or CT, or death of the subject whichever comes first. Subjects who do not occur disease progression or mortality until the EOS will be considered as right-censored. Although there is no control group in this study, the PFS after CAR001 administration could be compared to historical data., from visit 1 to 24-months of safety and efficacy follow-up period|Efficacy - Overall Survival (OS) rate, Time from 1st CAR001 administration to death. Subjects who do not die until the end of study will be considered as right-censored. Although there is no control group in this study, the OS after CAR001 administration could be compared to historical data. After the EOS, the OS should be followed every 3 months by phone contact., from visit 1 to 24-months of safety and efficacy follow-up period|Efficacy - Change of QoL from baseline, QoL will be assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3.0 from baseline to subsequent evaluation visits or until documented disease progression., from visit 1 to 24-months of safety and efficacy follow-up period|Efficacy - Change of ECOG Performance Status Scale, ECOG Performance Status Scale will be assessed from baseline to subsequent evaluation visits or until documented disease progression., from visit 1 to 24-months of safety and efficacy follow-up period
Primary Objective:

Phase I:

To evaluate the safety of CAR001 in subjects.

Phase IIa:

To provide potential evidence for the clinical efficacy of CAR001 in improving tumor response rate in subjects.

Secondary Objectives:

To evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of CAR001 in subjects.

Exploratory:

Level of CAR-positive γδT cells in peripheral blood from baseline to subsequent visits. (Time Frame: 12 months after the last infusion)
