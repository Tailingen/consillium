Multi-CAR-T Cells Targeting B Cell Lymphomas
This study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of a combination of 4th generation chimeric antigen receptor gene-modified T cells targeting B cell surface molecules including CD19 and alternative CARTs as booster and consolidation treatment for patients with highly resistant B cell lymphomas, including primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and BCL involving central nervous system (CNS-BCL). Clinical response and development of a simplified and standardized lentiviral vector and cell production protocol will be investigated. This is a phase I/II trial enrolling patients from multiple clinical centers.
B Cell Lymphoma (BCL)
BIOLOGICAL: 4SCAR19 and 4SCAR20/22/70/PSMA/13/79b/GD2
Safety of fourth generation anti-CD19 and anti-CD20/CD22/CD70/PSMA/CD13/CD79b/GD2 CAR-T cells infusion, Safety of fourth generation anti-CD19 and anti-CD20/CD22/CD70/PSMA/CD13/CD79b/GD2 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed B cell lymphoma (BCL) using CTCAE 4 standard to evaluate the level of adverse events, 24 weeks
Anti tumor activity of fourth generation anti-CD19 and anti-CD20/CD22/CD70/PSMA/CD13/CD79b/GD2 CAR-T cells infusion, Objective responses (complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) are assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria., 1 year
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has proven effective in treating B cell malignancies. However, post CD19-CART relapses occur at high rate due to the CD19 antigen loss or the exhaustion of CART cells. Furthermore, the success of treating relapsed/refractory B cell lymphoma (BCL) such as primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and CNS-involved BCL has been limited. To overcome tumor escape and prolong in vivo CART efficacy, we have developed a novel multiple CAR-T therapy regimen including booster and consolidation CART applications to to target highly-refractory cancer. Selected patients will be enrolled after target antigen confirmation including CD19, CD20, CD22, CD70, CD13, CD79b, GD2 and PSMA through immunostaining of their tumor specimens. The aim is to evaluate safety and long term efficacy of the multiple CART therapy strategy in the BCL patients.
