WEST-KOaST Study: WES Analysis of Testicular Cancer Patientsand Their First-degree Family Members
The project aims to identify the possible risk factors regarding the onset of the disease and to evaluate genes and gene modifications responsible for the onset od testicular cancer.
Testicular Cancer
GENETIC: Analysis of biological samples of saliva from testicular cancer patients and from their first-degree family members
Saliva biological sample, Saliva biological samples will be collected from both patients with testicular cancer and their first-degree family members trough a buccal swab, that will be analysed with a whole exome sequencing (WES) in order to explore panel of genes, Baseline
Demographic-clinical variables, Demographic and clinical variables will be collected from the interview with the physician: 1)Age of the subject; 2. Age at diagnosis; 3. Ethnicity; 4.BMI; 5. Lifestyle (smoking, diet, alcohol, physical activity...); 6. Histotype of the neoplasm; 7; Nodule Size; Presence of embryonal carcinoma \> 50%; 8. Percentage of necrosis present; 9. Basic pharmacological therapy; 10. Chemo/radiotherapy;, Baseline
Testicular tumor represents a relatively rare disease that hit young-adults men. It represents 1% of all male cancers and 5% of all urological male tumors. Its incidence grow year by year. In the field of the oncological research, the lack of knowledge about genes related to this disease represent a very relevant clinical question. For this reason this project aims to collect biological samples of saliva from testicular cancer patients and from their first-degree family members; demographic-clinical variables will be also collected in order to draft a comprehensive panel of genes and gene modifications related to the testicular cancer, combining this survey with a very detailed description of this cohort of patient in terms of clinical features and quality of life.
