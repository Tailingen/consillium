Human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced condyloma acuminata (CA), commonly known as anogenital or genital warts, is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. There are a wide variety of available treatments of genital warts, but none are considered completely effective. It has been suggested that AS101 works by stimulating the innate and acquired arms of the immune system.

In previous proof-of-concept clinical study AS101 topical cream was tested on HPV warts and shown cure in high percentages. However the cream formulation was unstable therefore a new formulation was developed mainly for the carrier. In this study the improved AS101 ointment will be tested in female patients with external genital warts in an open study to assess its safety and efficacy.
