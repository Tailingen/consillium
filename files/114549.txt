Gastrointestinal Anastomosis Using MonoPlus® Suture
The primary aim of this study is to collect clinical data on the performance of MonoPlus® suture applied in routine clinical practice. Diverse parameters are to be used to assess the safety and efficacy of MonoPlus® suture for gastrointestinal anastomosis construction.

This study has been designed to implement an action within the framework of a proactive Post Market Clinical Follow up (PMCF) activity.

EQ-5D-5L is designed for self-completion by respondents and it takes only a few minutes to complete. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire. EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 pages - descriptive system and the EQ visual Analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondents self rated health on a 20 cm vertical , visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled "the best health you can imagine" and " the worst health you can imagine", until 6 months postoperative|Satisfaction of the patient with the surgery, This parameter will be noted using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which state "0" at one end representing "no pain" and "100" at the opposite end representing "maximal pain". The values are compared over postoperative period., at discharge (approximately 10 days postoperative), 1 month, and 6 months after surgery|Assessment of suture material handling parameters, Assessment of the handling of the suture material intra-operatively using a questionnaire including different dimensions (knot security, tensile strength, knot run down, stiffness) with 5 evaluation levels (excellent, very good, good, satisfied, poor)., intraoperatively
