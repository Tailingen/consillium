Accelerated Brachytherapy Forward Chemo Radiation Therapy (ABC-RT) for Locally-advanced Cervical Cancer
The standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer is well established as a combination of chemotherapy and radiation, typically over 25-28 daily fractions with the addition of a brachytherapy boost to the primary tumor. An important component to treatment efficacy is overall treatment time. Prolongation of overall treatment time has been shown to lead to worse local control and overall survival; thus, strategies to effectively deliver radiation efficiently is required.

This is a pragmatic feasibility study to determine the impact of upfront brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external beam radiation for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (FIGO 2018 stage IB3-IVA) on late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity, oncologic outcomes including recurrence free survival, and systemic and local immune response.
Locally Advanced Cervical Carcinoma
RADIATION: Hypofractionated external beam radiation|DRUG: Chemotherapy|RADIATION: Image-guided brachytherapy
Late treatment related grade 3 or greater gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse events experienced by participant, -Must be at least possibly related to RT., Between day 91 and 2 year follow-up (estimated to be 2 years and 6 weeks)
Local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), A local recurrence is defined as histologic or radiographic evidence of cancer in the cervix. Local recurrence-free survival is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to the time of local recurrence or death, whichever occurs first. The living patients with CR, PR, or SD in the cervix are censored at the corresponding date., Up to 2 year follow-up (estimated to be 2 years and 6 weeks)|Regional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), A regional recurrence is defined as histologic or radiographic evidence of cancer in the pelvic or para-aortic nodes. Regional recurrence-free survival is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to the time of regional recurrence or death, whichever occurs first. The living patients with CR, PR, or SD in the pelvis or para-aortic lymph nodes are censored at the corresponding date., Up to 2 year follow-up (estimated to be 2 years and 6 weeks)|Progression-free survival (PFS), Progression- free survival is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to progression or death, whichever occurs first. The living patients without progression are censored at the last follow-up., Up to 2 year follow-up (estimated to be 2 years and 6 weeks)
