Efficacy and Safety Assessment of NIlotinib in CML Patients With Suboptimal Response on Imatinib Therapy
whether Nilotinib at the two sequential dosage forms will induce quicker and deeper response in those patients, and if FISH on PB (Peripheral blood) would be an effective way to monitor response compared to conventional cytogenetics on bone marrow (BM) sample
Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic
DRUG: Nilotinib 300 mg.
The primary efficacy variable of this study is the overall Major molecular response at 12 month after starting Nilotinib 300mg twice daily for patient who suboptimally responded to Imatinib as per the ELN guidelines, 12 Months
Rate of cytogenetic response (complete cytogenetic response CCyR and Major cytogenetic response MCyR) and Major molecular response MMR at 3, 6 and 12 months of starting Nilotinib in patients who had a suboptimal response on Imatinib., 12Months|Rate of CCyR at 6 months and MMR at 6 and 12 months from Nilotinib dose escalating to 400 mg BID., 12 months|Rate and duration of Complete Hematologic Response CHR., 12 months|Rate of CMR at 12 months of Nilotinib., 12 months|Comparison of FISH results with conventional cytogenetics at 3, 6 & 12 months., 12|Overall survival., 12
Mutational analysis for the patients with suboptimal response at the pre defined end points as per the ELN guidelines., 12 months
This is a multicenter, open label trial which will be conducted within Kingdom of saudi Arabia for which CML (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) patients who meet eligibility criteria and showing sub optimal response to Imatinib therapy as per European leukemia Net ELN 2013 guidelines will be recruited and switched to Nilotinib 300 mg twice a day therapy.

Efficacy assessments of hematologic and cytogenetic response and disease progression, will be performed every 6 months at a minimum, including hematologic analysis, bone marrow cytogenetics, and molecular studies to ensure that nilotinib is being provided to patients who were responding and that patients who progressed could discontinue therapy.

Safety assessments include evaluation of adverse events, hematologic assessment, biochemical testing, cardiac enzyme assessment, serial electrocardiogram evaluation, and physical examination. Adverse events are graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0. Survival will be dated from start of nilotinib therapy until death from any cause and censored at last follow-up for patients who were alive.

The data will be summarized with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics, efficacy evaluation, and safety observations and measurements.
