Parotid-sparing IMRT for Nasopharyngeal Cancer
In the treatment of nasopharyngeal cancers, to determine the incidence of high grade (≥G2) subjective xerostomia at 1 year.
Nasopharyngeal Cancers|Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy With Chemotherapy
RADIATION: Intensity modulated radiotherapy with chemotherapy
the incidence of ≥G2 xerostomia at 1 year using the subjective component LENTSOMA, 12 months
Acute radiation toxicities, 0-3 months|Late radiation toxicities, 3-24 months|loco-regional disease-free survival (LRDFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), 2 years|chemotherapy compliance and toxicities, 0-12 weeks
The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility in delivering induction chemotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with IMRT in the treatment of locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancers and to determine the incidence of high grade (≥G2) subjective xerostomia at 1 year.
