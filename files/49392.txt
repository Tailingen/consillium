Epirubicin and Paclitaxel, Alone or Together With Capecitabine as First Line Treatment in Metastatic Breast Cancer
Anthracycline-taxane regimens are effective means of postponing progression in metastatic breast cancer. It is yet unclear whether addition of capecitabine to this combination improves the treatment outcome.

Patients with advanced breast cancer are randomized to first-line chemotherapy with a combination of epirubicin (Farmorubicin®) and paclitaxel (Taxol®) alone (ET) or in combination with capecitabine (Xeloda®, TEX). Starting doses for ET are epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, and for TEX epirubicin 75mg/m2, paclitaxel 155 mg/m2, and capecitabine 825 mg/m2 BID for 14 days. Subsequently, doses are tailored related to side effects.

Primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), time to treatment failure (TTF), objective response (OR), safety and quality of life (QoL).
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Capecitabine
Time to progression, Time to progression comparing treatment with ET vs. TEX in patients with advanced breast cancer. Evaluation every 9 weeks during treatment until progression as long as study treatment was given, and every 12 weeks until date of progression, if treatment was disrupted for any other reason. Patients in the state of persistent complete response after primary completion date were reported only upon date of progression or death up to 78 months, From date of randomisation until date of first radiolocically documented progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first up to 78 months
Time to treatment failure, Time on treatment irrespective of reason for disruption (toxicity, patients wish), From date of randomization until date of treatment disruption for any reason up to 78 months|Response rate, Every 9 weeks during treatment|Overall survival, Date and cause of death reported yearly during the ongoing trial, up to 78 months after primary completion date only on the occasion of death, Time from randomisation until date of death up to 78 months|Number of participants with adverse events, All side effects which appear during treatment are reported and graded according CTC v.2., Continuously during treatment and until 2 months after termination|Quality of life, Measured at five points during nine months from randomization., Baseline, 2, 4, 6 and 9 months|Tumor biological data related to treatment, Fine needle aspirates from metastases, Within two weeks before start of treatment
