Study of Vorinostat (MK-0683) With Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Other Indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (B-NHL), or Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) Participants (MK-0683-103)
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of vorinostat (MK-0683) in participants with relapsed and/or refractory follicular lymphoma. The exploratory purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of MK-0683 in participants with relapsed/refractory non-FL indolent B-NHL or relapsed/refractory MCL. The primary hypothesis is that MK-0683 will show efficacy in relapsed/refractory FL patients as measured by the Overall Response Rate.
Lymphoma
DRUG: Vorinostat
Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a Complete Response (CR: Normal liver/spleen physical exam, all lymph nodes and nodal masses are normal, and there is no bone marrow involvement), a Complete Response/unconfirmed (CRu: Normal liver/spleen physical exam, plus at least a 75% decrease in the sum of the products of the greatest diameters of nodal masses if any are greater than 1.5 cm in their greatest diameter, normal or indeterminate bone marrow involvement), or a Partial Response (PR: Either normal physical exam, lymph nodes, and lymph node masses plus positive bone marrow involvement; OR normal physical exam or decrease in liver/spleen size plus at least a 50% decrease in the diameters of lymph nodes and nodal masses) as assessed using the international working group Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma standardized response criteria described by Cheson, BD in 1999. The percentage of participants who experienced a CR, CRu, or PR is presented., Up to 650 days|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The number of participants who experienced an AE was presented., Up to approximately 29 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE), An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The number of participants who discontinued from study drug due to an adverse event was reported., Up to 536 days
Time to Treatment Failure for Relapsed/Refractory FL, Time to Treatment Failure is defined as the time from allocation until the date of any treatment failure, including documented disease progression, or discontinuation of the study medication for any reason. Data was censored on the efficacy data cutoff date of 25 February, 2011., Up to 650 days|Time to Response for Relapsed/Refractory FL, Time to Response is defined as the time from allocation until the time of an initial response. Data was censored on the efficacy data cutoff date of 25 February, 2011., Up to 650 days
