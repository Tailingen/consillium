Transient Infrared Imaging for Early Detection of Skin Cancer
The hypothesis or study goal is to determine whether functional dynamic infrared imaging can be used for melanoma and other skin cancer screening and/or diagnosis.
Skin Cancer
DEVICE: Infrared Imaging Device- ALIAS
To detect skin cancers with >90% sensitivity and >50% specificity using infrared imaging, We are developing a screening algorithm than can compute data from infrared pictures and give us a threshold below which all the cases are benign and above which is malignant.

Our primary outcome is to detect all the malignant cases with more than 90% sensitivity and all the benign cases with more than 50% specificity,, 5 years
