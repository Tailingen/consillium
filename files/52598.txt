This is a randomized, controlled, parallel, multicenter trial to compare post-operative complications and long-term results between open and laparoscopic technique in emergency colorectal surgery.

Laparoscopic technique in elective colorectal surgery has been shown to be advantageous for patients compared to open technique. However, the feasibility and potential benefits of laparoscopic colorectal surgery in emergency setting has not been evaluated sufficiently.

The aim of this study is to compare laparoscopic and open technique in emergency colon resections. Primary outcome is the immediate recovery after operation and secondary outcome is long-term overall and cancer-specific survival.
