Cancer|Deafness
OTHER: Education
Number of participants who are adherent to cancer screening, Completion of at least one recommended cancer screening as measured by documentation of the actual screening, 9 months
Percent of participants who demonstrate high cancer knowledge and high perceived patient centered care, Positive change in patient-physician communication and cancer knowledge from baseline to closeout as defined by the participating patient., 9 months
Study hypothesizes that the intervention that involves utilization of a DDBHH CHN will result in (i) DDBHH patients demonstrating greater adherence to screening compared to DDBHH patients who were assigned to the standard of care group , and (ii) higher patient-physician communication rating by DDBHH patients compared to DDBHH patients who were assigned to the standard of care group. Bilingual ASL-English measures (e.g., sociodemographics, cancer knowledge, patient-physician communication) will be administered to the participant at baseline data collection and again after the final data collection or by 11 months for comparison.
