Phase I and Consecutive Phase II, Two-arm, Randomized Multi-center Trial in Patients With Advanced Melanoma
A prospective phase I and consecutive phase II, twoarm, randomized multi-center trial of temsirolimus in combination with pioglitazone, etoricoxib and metronomic low-dose trofosfamide versus dacarbazine (DTIC) in patients with advanced melanoma

Phase I: To determine the dose of temsirolimus to be used in phase II part of the study

Phase II:

To determine overall survival Secondary objectives

* To evalulate response rate
* To evaluate time to progression (TTP)
* To evalulate time to partial response (time to PR or better)(TPR)
* To evaluate quality of life
* To evaluate tolerability and safety
