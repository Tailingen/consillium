A Safety and Antitumor Activity Trial of Immunoradiotherapy Combinations as a Treatment Option for Subjects With Metastatic Solid Tumors
The main purpose is to assess the safety and clinical activity of GEN1042 in combination with radiotherapy or GEN1042 in combination with radiotherapy and pembrolizumab as a treatment option for participants with metastatic solid tumors.
Non-CNS Tumor
BIOLOGICAL: GEN1042|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Radiotherapy
Part 1: Number of Participants with Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), Toxicities will be graded for severity according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (NCI-CTCAE v5.0)., During the first cycle (Cycle length = 21 days)|Part 2: Number of Participants with Abscopal Response in Non-irradiated Target Lesions, Assessed by investigator., Up to 12 months after the last radiation treatment
Parts 1 and 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as percentage of participants with a confirmed best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST) v1.1 as assessed by investigator., Up to 2 years|Parts 1 and 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the onset date of response to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause based on RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigator., Up to 2 years|Parts 1 and 2: Disease Control Rate (DCR), The disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of CR, PR, and stable disease (SD) according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 2 years|Parts 1 and 2: Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomization (or date of first administration of GEN1042 ± pembrolizumab treatment for participants in Part 1) to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause based on RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigator., Up to 2 years|Parts 1 and 2: One- year Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization (or date of first administration of GEN1042 ± pembrolizumab treatment for participants in Part 1) to date of death due to any cause., Up to 2 years|Part 1: Number of Participants With Abscopal Response in Non-irradiated Target Lesions, Assessed by investigator., Up to 12 months after the last radiation treatment|Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants with Adverse Events (AEs), From screening until the end of the safety follow-up period (30 days or 90 days after last dose)|Parts 1 and 2: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of GEN1042, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to 30 days after last dose|Parts 1 and 2: Maximum (Peak) Plasma Concentration (Cmax), Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to 30 days after last dose|Parts 1 and 2: Elimination Half-life (T1/2) of GEN1042, Predose and postdose at multiple timepoints up to 30 days after last dose|Parts 1 and 2: Number of Participants with Anti-drug Antibodies (ADAs), Predose at multiple timepoints up to 30 days after last dose
The study will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 (dose-finding) and Part 2 (randomization).

Part 1 will evaluate the safety of immunoradiotherapy combinations and establish the dose(s) to be evaluated in Part 2.

Part 2 will evaluate the anti-tumor activity of immunoradiotherapy combinations at the established dose(s) from Part 1.

Participants in both parts are treated with one of the following combinations:

* Radiotherapy + GEN1042
* Radiotherapy + GEN1042 + Pembrolizumab

While participants in Part 1 are assigned sequentially (GEN1042 without pembrolizumab is investigated first), participants in Part 2 are randomized 1:1 in the two treatment arms.
