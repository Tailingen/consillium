Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) for Head and Neck Cancer
For patients undergoing treatment for head and neck cancer, this study will use dynamic contrast-enhanced CT scans to try to determine which lymph nodes in the neck contain cancer and require surgical removal.
Head and Neck Cancer
RADIATION: Dynamic Contrast Enhanced CT scan
Sensitivity and specificity of DCE-CT in predicting the presence of residual lymph node disease after the completion of chemotherapy, 8-10 weeks post treatment
Sensitivity and specificity of DCE-CT in predicting presence of lymph node disease at surgery, Approximately 2-6 weeks after enrollment
