Suction Drain in Axillary Lymph Node Dissection for Malignant Melanoma
Postoperative complications like seroma formation and wound site infection readily occur following completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for malignant melanoma. We analyzed the impact of time-to-drain removal and drainage volume on seroma formation after ALND.
