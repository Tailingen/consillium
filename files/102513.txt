Type 1 Interferon Induced Changes to Exercise Adaptations in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Patients
Investigating the physiological effects of the interferons type 1 and 2 (IFNs), and the cytokines Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on the adaptive changes to exercise in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

The investigators hypothesize that the pathogenic blockage of IL-6 signalling that occurs in SLE, will decrease the cardiac and metabolic adaptations to aerobic exercise, and this decrease can be related to the IFN signature.

55 patients was included in a 12-week investigator blinded 1:1 randomised high intensity aerobic exercise intervention study.

55 patients with SLE have been included and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to a 12 week high intensity interval training (HIIT) course or standard care.

Randomization was stratified by sex.

All patients will undergo baseline and followup testing including: VO2Max, Pulmonary Function, Capillaroscopy, OGTT, Blood Tests, Epigenetic Markers of IFN, TNF and IL-6 signalling, Echocardiography,DXA, Medical Examination, Acute Exercise Bout with blood tests during and after an exercise bout similar to the intervention. A subgroup of patients will be offered a 82-Rb Pet CT of the heart as opt-in.

The exercise programme consists of 12 weeks of tri-weekly exercise bouts of 38-45 minutes, following warm-up subjects will undergo 4 sets of 4 minute high intensity exercise, measured as the pulse being above 85% of HRmax for more than half the time; and 3 minute low to medium intensity exercise between the high intensity sets, measured as the pulse being between 40 to 60% of HRmax.
