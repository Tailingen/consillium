Trial Comparing Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy to Radiofrequency Ablation for Renal Cell Carcinoma
This study will assess whether Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) can provide comparable local control, with similar or improved toxicity rates compared to Radio Frequency Ablation (RFA) when treating small renal cell carcinomas.
Renal Cell Carcinoma
RADIATION: SBRT|RADIATION: RFA
Proportion of Patients With Local Control of Disease, On imaging, local control will be defined as when the treated lesion shows no enhancement., 12 months|Cumulative Incidence of Grade 2 and Greater Toxicities, The number of patients reporting grade 2 and greater toxicities (for this trial the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events or CTCAE was used)., up to 30 days after the last study treatment
Difference in Quality of Life (QOL) Scores Between SBRT and RFA Treatment Arms, QOL scores will be summarized descriptively by treatment at each time point using the Convalescence and Recovery Evaluation (CARE) and SF-12 quality of life assessments . Any differences between treatment groups will be tested in the context of a general linear model with terms for treatment, time, treatment time and possibly other patient level covariates that might explain QOL., Pre-study, last day of treatment; 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months post treatment|Difference in Patient Time Away (Measured in Days) Between SBRT and RFA Treatment Arms, Patient time away from work/home secondary to treatment will be captured via patient questionnaire as a number of days and will be summarized descriptively by treatment group. Any differences between treatment groups will be tested by a two-sample t-test or nonparametric Mann-Whitney test., Pre-study, last day of treatment; 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months post treatment|Metastasis Free Survival Time, 36 months post treatment|Overall Survival Time, 36 months post treatment|Difference in Incidence of Treatment Related Pain Between SBRT and RFA Treatment Arms, All patients will be followed to assess the development of treatment related pain, and resultant usage of analgesics (drug classification and dosage) for treatment related pain. Incidence and severity of pain will be recorded for all patients, using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), as will any resultant use of analgesics, and these will be compared between the two arms and analyzed in the non-randomized SBRT cohort., Pre-study, last day of treatment; 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months post treatment
