Study of CAR.70-engineered IL15-transduced Cord Blood-derived NK Cells in Conjunction With Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy for the Management of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma, Mesothelioma and Osteosarcoma
To find a recommended dose of donated NK cells that can be given with lymphodepleting chemotherapy to patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, mesothelioma, or osteosarcoma. The effects of this therapy will also be studied.
Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma|Advanced Mesothelioma|Advanced Osteosarcoma
DRUG: CAR.70/IL15-transduced CB-derived NK cells|DRUG: Fludarabine phosphate|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide
Incidence of Adverse Events, Graded According to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version (v) 5.0, through study completion; an average of 1 year.
Primary Objective:

* To determine the safety, tolerability, and optimal cell dose of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR).70/interleukin (IL)15-transduced cord blood (CB)-derived natural killer (NK) cells in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma, advanced mesothelioma, and advanced osteosarcoma.
* To determine the antitumor activity of CAR.70/IL15-transduced CB-derived NK cells. Although the clinical benefit of CAR.70/IL15-transduced CB-derived NK cells has not yet been established, the intent of offering this treatment is to provide a possible therapeutic benefit and thus, the patient will be carefully monitored for tumor response and symptom relief in addition to safety and tolerability. Efficacy will be determined in each of the three cohorts.

Secondary Objectives:

* To quantify the persistence of infused allogeneic donor CAR-transduced CB-derived NK cells in the recipient.
* To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies.
* To obtain preliminary data on quality of life and patient experience.
