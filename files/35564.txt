NovellusDx Functional Profiling of Oncogenic Mutations in Lung Cancer Patients
NovellusDx technology identifies tumor-specific driver mutations, but unlike sequencing-based tests, NovellusDx has a functional assay that detects dis-regulated translocation of mutated signaling proteins to the nucleus. This allows NovellusDx to identify functionally-impactful driver mutations regardless of whether the mutation has previously been described or linked to a tumor type.
Lung Cancer
Correct identification of tumor mutant genes, Correct identification of patient oncogenic mutation in over 85% of the cases. this will be achieved by comparing sequencing results of the patient tumors to the results achieved using the NovellusDx diagnostic platform., up to 12 months
