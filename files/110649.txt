Combining MLN8237 With Nab-Paclitaxel in Patients With Advanced Solid Malignancies
This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of MLN8237 (alisertib) when given together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation (nab-paclitaxel) in treating patients with solid malignancies that are metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Alisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel work by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving alisertib together with nab-paclitaxel may provide a more effective anticancer treatment with fewer side effects.
Adenocarcinoma|Pancreatic Neoplasms
DRUG: MLN8237|DRUG: nab-Paclitaxel
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Completion of cycle 1|Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), Hematologic DLT is defined as any of the following that occurs during the first cycle that is attributed as possibly, probably or definitely related to the study treatment:

* Grade 4 neutropenia \> 7 days duration
* Febrile neutropenia of any duration with temperature ≥ 38.5 °C
* Grade 4 thrombocytopenia \> 7 days duration

Non-hematologic DLT is defined as any possibly, probably, or definitely related grade 3 or grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity that occurs during the first cycle with the following specific exceptions:

* Grade 3 fatigue
* Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or anorexia that returns to Grade 1 prior to the start of Cycle 2
* Grade 3 non-hematological laboratory abnormalities that resolve to grade 1 or baseline prior to the start of Cycle 2

Any delay in treatment \>14 days that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment will be considered a DLT., Completion of cycle 1
