Effects of Music Therapy on Psychological States Among Cancer Patients Undergoing MRI Scans and a Relevant Mediator
The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of a music therapy protocol on improving anxiety, symptom distress, and relaxation among cancer patients who are going through MRI scanning. Physiological data, such as pulse rates and respiration rates will be collected. Furthermore, data about scanning efficiency will be collected to assess if scanning efficiency is affected by the protocol implementation. The secondary study objective is to assess whether or not there is a relationship between patient attention to music during the intervention process and the changes in anxiety, symptom distress, and relaxation.

Anxiety, Self-rating scale (VAS 0-10) to rate patient anxiety, with 0 being no anxiety and 10 being extreme anxious, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 days|Symptom distress, Self-rating scale (VAS 0-10) to rate symptom distress, with 0 being no distress and 10 being extreme distressed., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 days|Relaxation, Self-rating scale (VAS 0-10) to rate relaxation, with 0 being unrelaxed and 10 being very relaxed., From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 days
Pulse rates, The change of pulse rates during MRI scanning, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 1 day|Respiration rate, The change of respiration rate during MRI scanning, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Scanning efficiency, Duration of actual scans require, duration of the whole process, and the frequency of pause due to patient in-compliance, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 100 months|Patient satisfaction level, A 1 to 5 satisfaction scale, with 1 being strongly unsatisfied, 2 being unsatisfied, 3 being somewhere between unsatisfied and satisfied, 4 being quite satisfied. and 5 being strongly satisfied, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 days|Patient attention to music (only for the music therapy group), A 1 to 5 self-rating scale, with 1 being fully attended during the whole process, 2 being attended most time during scanning, 3 being attended sometime during scanning, 4 being unattended most time during scanning, and 5 being fully unattended, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 3 days
To assess the protocol, recruited participants will be randomly allocated into two groups: a control group or a music therapy group. Participants in the control group will receive standard care as usual, and they will be offered music therapy interventions upon their request during subsequent appointments. Participants in the music group will receive standard care and music therapy interventions. All participants will rate their psychological states pre- and post-MRI exams. Their physiological data will be recorded during the examination. After the scanning, they will complete an experience review.
