PRostate Cancer Plasma Integrative Multi-modal Evaluation
The study aims to develop PRIME (PRostate cancer plasma Integrative Multi-modal Evaluation) liquid biopsy test and to implement its use to query prospectively collected samples in advanced prostate cancer (PCa) clinical trials and/or clinical settings. In order to maximise the utility of liquid biopsies for advanced PCa, PRIME is focused on the development of novel computational and sequencing approaches that integrate multiple information from plasma circulating elements: i) cell free DNA (cfDNA) gene mutation data with accurate quantitation of cfDNA structural genomic changes, ii) cfDNA genomic profiling with cfDNA methylation status, and iii) the information provided by extracellular vesicles (EVs) and EV-associated cargo (including DNA, RNA and proteins).
