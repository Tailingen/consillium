An Open Study of ASP8273 in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Who Have Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutations
Purpose of the study is to determine the following in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR activating mutations.

* the safety and tolerability of ASP8273.
* the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP8273.
* the antitumor activity of ASP8273.
Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
DRUG: ASP8273
Phase I: Safety and tolerability of ASP8273 as assessed by Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), A DLT is defined as any pre-determined toxicity that is related to study drug per the investigator and which occurs during Cycle 0 and Cycle 1 using the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) Japanese translation of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE ver 4.0 - JCOG), Up to Day 23|Phase II: Overall response rate (CR+PR) at Week 24, The overall response rate, which is defined as the proportion of subjects whose best overall response is rated as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST Version 1.1, will be calculated, Week 24
Phase I: Safety and tolerability of ASP8273 as assessed by adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug or has undergone study procedures and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product, Up to 18 months|Phase I: Safety and tolerability of ASP8273 as assessed by laboratory tests, Laboratory tests to be conducted are hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, coagulation profile, lipid panel and lymphocyte subpopulation, Up to 18 months|Phase I: Safety and tolerability of ASP8273 as assessed by vital signs, Vital signs to be measured includes blood pressure, pulse rate and temperature, Up to 18 months|Phase I: Safety and tolerability of ASP8273 as assessed by 12-lead ECG, including the assessment of QT intervals, Up to 18 months|Phase I: Plasma concentrations of unchanged ASP8273, Up to Day 1 of Cycle 3|Phase I: Urine concentrations of unchanged ASP8273, Up to Day 1 of Cycle 3|Phase I: Overall response rate (CR+PR), The overall response rate is defined as the proportion of subjects whose best overall response is rated as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST Version 1.1, will be calculated, Up to 18 months|Phase I: Disease control rate (CR+PR+SD), The disease control rate is defined as the proportion of subjects whose best overall response is rated as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST Version 1.1, will be calculated., Up to 18 months|Phase II: Plasma concentrations of unchanged ASP8273, Up to Day 1 of Cycle 3|Phase II: Urine concentrations of unchanged ASP8273, Up to Day 1 of Cycle 3|Phase II: Safety and tolerability of ASP8273 as assessed by adverse events (AEs), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug or has undergone study procedures and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.

This study consists of Phase I and Phase II.

The objectives of Phase I are to determine the following in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR activating mutations.

* safety and tolerability of ASP8273.
* the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of ASP8273 based on the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) profile.
* pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASP8273.
* antitumor activity of ASP8273.

The objectives of Phase II are to determine the following at the RP2D of ASP8273 in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation.

* efficacy of ASP8273
* safety of ASP8273
* PK of ASP8273
