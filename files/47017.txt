This study plans to enroll 330 eligible female patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. All eligible patients will be randomly assigned to the treatment group or the control group in a 2:1 ratio. The following two factors will be used for stratification: 1) visceral metastasis (yes or no); 2) menopausal status (postmenopausal; premenopausal or perimenopausal). The study consists of a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. It aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BEBT-209 in combination with fulvestrant versus placebo in combination with fulvestrant in patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have experienced disease progression after prior endocrine therapy.
