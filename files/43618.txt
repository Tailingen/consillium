A Phase II Study for 609A in the Treatment of Advanced Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma
The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of recombinant anti-PD-1 humanized monoclonal antibody injection (609A) in patients with unresectable or advanced undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma
Sarcoma, Soft Tissue
DRUG: Recombinant anti-PD-1 humanized monoclonal antibody injection
ORR,Objective response rate, CT/MRI examinations were performed every 6 weeks, and the efficacy of anti-tumor treatment was evaluated by RECEIST and iRECEIST standards., up to 18 months.
AE, All adverse events related to 609A observed through various tests (including blood routine, pregnancy test, electrocardiogram, etc.), up to 18 months.|BOR, Best overall response, CT/MRI examinations were performed every 6 weeks, and the efficacy of anti-tumor treatment was evaluated by RECEIST and iRECEIST standards., up to 18 months.|DCR, Disease control rate, CT/MRI examinations were performed every 6 weeks, and the efficacy of anti-tumor treatment was evaluated by RECEIST and iRECEIST standards., up to 18 months.|DOR, Duration of Response, CT/MRI examinations were performed every 6 weeks, and the efficacy of anti-tumor treatment was evaluated by RECEIST and iRECEIST standards., up to 18 months.|TTR, Time to response, CT/MRI examinations were performed every 6 weeks, and the efficacy of anti-tumor treatment was evaluated by RECEIST and iRECEIST standards., up to 18 months.|SD duration, CT/MRI examinations were performed every 6 weeks, and the efficacy of anti-tumor treatment was evaluated by RECEIST and iRECEIST standards., up to 18 months.|Immunogenicity of 609A, Detect the presence of anti-609A antibodies through the subject's blood sample, up to 18 months.
This is a multi-center, open label, phase II clinical study. The safety and effectiveness of 609A in the treatment of unresectable or advanced undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma are mainly evaluated by ORR (based on the results of CT/MRI examination of subjects during treatment).
