A Phase II Clinical Trial of PXD101 in Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Cutaneous and Peripheral T-Cell Lymphomas
Open-label, non-randomized trial to assess the effectiveness of PXD101 in patients with recurrent or refractory cutaneous or peripheral and other types of T-cell lymphomas. PXD101 is a new, potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Patients are treated with belinostat(PXD101) 1000 mg/m2 on days 1-5 of a 21 day cycle.

Objective Response Rate in Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL), Tumor response was assessed using Cheson (Cheson 2007) and SWAT criteria. The SWAT score represents the product of the percentage total body surface area (TBSA) involvement of each lesion type (patch, plaque, and tumor or ulceration), multiplied by a weighting factor., throughout the study, or for a maximum of 2 years|Objective Response Rate in Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL)), Tumor response was assessed using the revised criteria of Cheson (Cheson 2007).Tumor assessments were done using conventional radiographic methods, e.g. CT or CT/PET., throughout the study, or for a maximum of 2 years
Time to Progression, Time to progression was defined as the interval between the first date of treatment and the first notation of disease progression., throughout the study, or for a maximum of 2 years|Time to Response, Time to response was defined as the interval between the first date of treatment and the first notation of response., throughout the study, or for a maximum of 2 years|Duration of Response, Duration of response was defined as the time from first notation of response until the time of first notation of disease progression., throughout the study, or for a maximum of 2 years
