A Phase 0 Window of Opportunity Trial of Intratumoral Seasonal Influenza Immunization in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC) Patients Awaiting Curative Excision
This study is investigating the effects on immune cells of injecting the influenza vaccine (also known as "flu shot") into cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) tumors prior to having standard-of-care Mohs excision surgery. The study will help understand if the addition of the influenza vaccine could improve the immune system response against the cancer.

The names of the study drug involved in this study is:

-Fluzone Influenza vaccine (flu shot)
Skin Cancer|Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC)|Cutaneous Squamous Cell Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: Fluzone Trivalent
Mean Percent Change of CD8+ T-cells Density, CD8+ T-cell infiltration density (as measured by cells/mm2) on tumors is collected at the time of Mohs micrographic surgery compared to baseline (time of diagnostic biopsy)., Up to 15 Days
Change in Tumor Diameter, Evaluate the change in tumor diameter based on day 1 screening and the biopsy from the time of diagnosis., Up to 15 Days|Adverse Events, Adverse events rate is defined as the percentage of participants who have experienced adverse events based on CTCAE 5.0, Up to 38 days|Mean Percent Change of Tumor Microenvironment Markers Compared Before and After Intratumoral Influenza Vaccination, Evaluation of the differences of effect on the mean percent change of tumor microenvironment markers before and after the administration of intratumoral influenza vaccine in CSCC lesions, Up to 15 Days
This Phase 0, window-of-opportunity study is investigating the effects on immune cells of injecting the influenza vaccine (also known as "flu shot") into cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) tumors prior to having standard-of-care Mohs excision surgery. This study will help understand if the addition of the influenza vaccine can improve the immune system response against the cancer.

The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, in-clinic visits, blood tests, and measurements and photographs of tumors.

It is expected that 25 people will take part in this research study.
