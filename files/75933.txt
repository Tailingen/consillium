Bowman-Birk Inhibitor Concentrate in Preventing Cancer in Healthy Men
This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate in preventing cancer in healthy men. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing, or coming back. The use of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate may prevent cancer.
Unspecified Adult Solid Tumor, Protocol Specific
OTHER: placebo|DRUG: Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate
Safety as measured by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria and a recommended Phase II dose (RPTD), Up to 4 weeks
Pharmacokinetics measurements of BBI in the blood and urine, Mean, median and 95% confidence interval will then be calculated for each parameter for each dose group. The relationship between dose and the above parameters will be investigated using simple linear regression., 0 (immediately prior to BBIC administration), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 hours after BBIC administration
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the toxic effects of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate, administered as an orange juice suspension, in healthy male participants.

II. Determine a safe dose range of this drug in these participants. III. Determine a recommended phase II dose of this drug in these participants.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these participants.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study.

Participants are sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 dose level cohorts. One participant in each dose level cohort is randomized to receive placebo. Participants receive 1 of 4 escalating doses of oral Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate or placebo, as an orange juice suspension, on day 1.

After completion of study treatment, participants are followed periodically for 4 weeks.
