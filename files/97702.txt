Study of Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection for Treatment of Perianal Warts
Study is a dose escalation study. Fifteen patients will be enrolled in 2 treatment cohorts. Five participants (cohort A) will be treated with 200IU Multikine daily, 5 days/week for 2 weeks, off 2 weeks, then again 5 days/week for 2 weeks. If no serious adverse events are noted in cohort A patients, ten participants will be treated in cohort B. Cohort B participants will be treated the same as cohort A participants except that dose will be increased to 400IU Multikine per day.
