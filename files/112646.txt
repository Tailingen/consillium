Individualized Adaptive De-escalated Radiotherapy for HPV-related Oropharynx Cancer
This prospective study aims to utilize pre- and mid-treatment PET-CT to guide de-escalation of radiation therapy in HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx.
Oropharynx Cancer
DRUG: Carboplatin|RADIATION: Radiation Therapy|DRUG: Paclitaxel
The Percentage of Patients With Local Regional Recurrence (LRR) of Disease, RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) will be used to evaluate response and recurrence. All patients will be analyzed together as the goal of the study is to estimate risk of LRR in this patient population treated with this particular strategy in which some patients continue to receive standard therapy while others are de-escalated. Results will also be estimated and reported separately for patients receiving standard or de-escalated therapy., 1 Year|Change in Metabolic Tumor Volume 50% (MTV 50%), The change in metabolic tumor volume (MTV)50% at the mid-treatment timepoint will be calculated as percent change from baseline and used as a continuous variable in a Cox model for an outcome of time to LRR. Will also evaluate more non-parametrically, the relation between hazard of LRR and mid-treatment MTV50% using a kernel estimator in a Cox model., 2 months
Quality of Life Assessed Per the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck (FACTHN), Quality of life (QOL) outcomes and swallowing study results will be summarized descriptively by timepoint. If there is substantial missingness in the QOL outcomes the study will assess for informative missingness by comparing earlier QOL scores and change in earlier QOL scores between patients missing QOL at later time points (e.g. 1 or 2 years)., 2 Years|The Proportion of Patients Alive, 2 Years|Incidence of Toxicity, Toxicity outcomes will be estimated as proportions of patients with available toxicity data at 3, 6 12 and 24 months., 3, 6, 12 and 24 Months|Detectable Circulating Tumor Deoxyribonucleic Acid (ctDNA) in Participants, The proportion of patients in whom ctDNA is detectable will be summarized as a binomial proportion at each timepoint. Additionally, the relation between ctDNA presence or other characteristics and patient outcomes including time to local or distant progression will be assessed by including ctDNA as a covariate in Cox models for local or distant control., 4 weeks
