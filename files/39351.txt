GPNMB-targeting Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy (GCAR1) for a Patient with Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma (CLIC-YYC-GPNMB-02)
CLIC-YYC-GPNMB-02 is a Single Patient Study (SPS) developed according to the Health Canada template and guidelines released in 2019 for studies to access therapies not otherwise available to patients, in the situation where there are no options of treatment or cure remaining. The patient under consideration for CLIC-YYC-GPNMB-02 has progressive metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). We propose to treat the patient with GCAR1, a patient-specific cell therapy product containing a mixture of autologous lymphocytes transduced with a lentiviral vector containing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that enables the specific targeting towards tumor cells expressing the cell surface protein glycoprotein non-metastatic B (GPNMB).
Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma
BIOLOGICAL: GCAR1
Assess for anti-tumor activity, Response is the primary endpoint of this study. Diagnostic imaging (CT and/or MRI) will be performed pre-infusion to document measurable disease, and 4-6 weeks after GCAR1 T-cell infusion to evaluate response to therapy., 1 year
