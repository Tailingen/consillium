Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Rhabdomyosarcoma Using Molecular Risk Stratification and Liposomal Irinotecan Based Therapy in Children With Intermediate and High Risk Disease
This is a phase II study to determine safety and efficacy of combining liposomal irinotecan with vincristine alternating with VAC in intermediate-risk patients, liposomal irinotecan with temozolomide and vincristine alternating with VAC in high-risk patients and the chemotherapy combinations when given with concomitant radiation therapy in intermediate and high risk patients.

Primary Objective

* Estimate event-free survival for intermediate-risk participants treated with VAC and vincristine and liposomal irinotecan (VLI) with the addition of maintenance therapy with vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide.
* Estimate the event-free survival for high-risk patients treated with VAC and vincristine, liposomal irinotecan, and temozolomide with the addition of maintenance therapy with vinorelbine and cyclophosphamide.

Secondary Objectives

* To assess the relation between pharmacogenetic variation in CEP72 genotype and vinca alkaloid (vincristine; vinorelbine) disposition in children with rhabdomyosarcoma.
* To assess the relation between the pharmacogenetic variation in drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, and the pharmacokinetics of vinca alkaloids, liposomal irinotecan, and cyclophosphamide in children with rhabdomyosarcoma.
* To assess the extent of inter-patient variability in the pharmacokinetics of vinca alkaloids, liposomal irinotecan, and cyclophosphamide in children with rhabdomyosarcoma, and explore possible associations between drug disposition and patient specific covariates (e.g., age, sex, race, weight).
* Estimate the cumulative incidence of local recurrence and overall 3-year event-free survival in patients with low-risk disease, intermediate-risk disease or high-risk disease treated with either no adjuvant radiation or minimal volume radiation and compare these outcomes with the outcomes achieved on RMS13.

Maximum tolerated doses (MTDs), MTD is defined in the study as the highest treatment dose that would deliver desirable treatment effects without resulting in a target toxicity rate greater than 0.3. For each of three groups (intermediate-risk, high-risk, and intermediate-and-high-risk-with-early-radiation), we will employ the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design to find the MTD., 4 years|Event-free survival (EFS), We will estimate the 2-year event-free survival for intermediate-risk and high-risk patients, which is the estimated probability of a patient not having any events within the 2-year follow-up. If an event, including local failure, distant failure, death or loss to follow-up occurs for a patient within 2-year, we call it failure, otherwise call it response., 2 years post, off therapy|Local recurrence rate (LRR), LRR is defined as a binary endpoint in the study. The local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) is defined as time from randomization to the earlier date of the first of local disease recurrence or death due to any cause. The distant failure will be considered to be the competing risk, patients for whom follow-up ended without clinical improvement will be censored. The goal of the local recurrence rate endpoint is to evaluate the 2-year LRR by comparing the administration of 59.4 GyRBE and 68 GyRBE for patients (pooled intermediate- and high-risk groups) with tumor size greater than or equal to 5cm meeting the eligibility criteria for randomization (no biliary tree or specific extremity cases).

This is a phase II study to determine safety and efficacy of combining liposomal irinotecan with vincristine alternating with VAC in intermediate-risk patients, liposomal irinotecan with temozolomide and vincristine alternating with VAC in high-risk patients and the chemotherapy combinations when given with concomitant radiation therapy in intermediate and high risk patients. The dose of liposomal irinotecan for intermediate and high risk patients will be 160/mg/m2 on Day 1 based on the results and recommended phase 2 dose of the Phase I trial ONITT trial. The primary objective is to assess event-free survival (EFS). The sample size is determined based on a 2-year EFS estimate for each risk group, with a total study duration of 4 years for enrollment and 2 years of follow-up per patient.

The study employs a single-arm adaptive Phase II design, with an estimated 46 patients in the intermediate-risk group and 34 patients in the high-risk group, ensuring 80% power and a 5% Type I error rate. The trial will conclude once the last enrolled patient has completed 2 years of follow-up.
