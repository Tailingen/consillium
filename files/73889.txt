Evaluation of Reporting of Cardio-vascular Adverse Events With Antineoplastic and Immunomodulating Agents (EROCA)
Antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents may lead to various cardio-vascular adverse reactions. This study investigates reports of cardio-vascular toxicities for treatment including Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification L (antineoplastic agents, endocrine therapy, immunostimulants, and immunosuppressants drugs) in the World Health Organization's (WHO) global database of individual safety case reports (VigiBase).

The research includes the report with MedDRA terms: SOC Cardiac Disorders, SOC Vascular Disorders, Sudden death (PT), Cardiac and vascular investigations (excl enzyme tests) (HLGT), Skeletal and cardiac muscle analyses (HLT), Case reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports to September 2018
Causality assessment of reported cardiovascular events according to the WHO system, Case reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports to September 2018|Description of the type of cardiotoxicity depending on the category of antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, Case reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports to September 2018|Description of the duration of treatment when the toxicity happens, Case reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports to September 2018|Description of the drug-drug interactions associated with adverse events, Case reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports to September 2018|Description of the pathologies (cancer) for which the incriminated drugs have been prescribed, Case reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports to September 2018|Description of the population of patients having a cardio-vascular adverse event, Case reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) of individual safety case reports to September 2018
Antineoplastic therapies are responsible of a wide range of cardio-vascular side effects.The investigators use VigiBase, the World Health Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to identify cases of cardiovascular adverse drug reactions following treatment with antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents
