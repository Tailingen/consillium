Comparison of Emergence and Oxygenation During One-lung Ventilation With Desflurane and Propofol Anesthesia
Which is more adequate general anesthetic agent, desflurane or propofol, for emergence and recovery time, and perioperative oxygenation in lung resection surgery?
Lung Cancer
DRUG: desflurane|DRUG: propofol
Oxygenation, Arterial blood gases are monitored.Pulmonary blood flow is measured using transesophageal echocardiogram., prior to surgery to one-hour after extubation
Rapidity of Emergence From Anesthesia, Time to extubation and orientation, where the patient is., one minute after cessation of anethetic agents to one hour after extubation|Quality of Consiousness, quality of consciousness will be assessed using Aldrete score, after extubation|Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting, degree of nausea and frequency of vomiting, on the postoperative day 1
The investigators plan to investigate the effects of desflurane on oxygenation (prevention of HPV) of OLV compare with propofol which is used in general anesthesia for lung resection.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) wiill be used to measure pulmonary blood flow during surgery visible and successively. To confirm the effect of HPV by measuring the change in pulmonary blood flow. The correlation between the blood oxygen concentration and attenuation of blood flow will be investigated.
