Adaptive Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy to the Prostate and Pelvic Nodes With Simultaneous Integrated Boost to the MR-detected Nodule for Patients With High-risk and Unfavorable Intermediate-risk Prostate Cancer
This trial is a prospective clinical trial designed to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of whole-pelvis adaptive prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with a tumor boost to the magnetic resonance (MR)-detected sites of disease. The hypothesis is that this treatment approach will be safe and feasible with \<15% of patients experiencing an acute CTCAEv5 grade ≥3 genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event.

DEVICE: Ethos Varian treatment system|RADIATION: Adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy|DRUG: Androgen deprivation therapy
Rate of acute grade ≥3 GI and GU adverse events, From start of radiotherapy through 90 days after start of radiotherapy
Changes in patient-reported quality of life as measured by EPIC-26, -The EPIC-26 is used to assess health related quality of life among persons with prostate cancer. It contains 5 domains of urinary incontinence, urinary irritability/obstructive, bowel, sexual, and hormonal. Response options for each EPIC item form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing better health related quality of life., At screening, end of radiotherapy (week 5), 3 months after start of radiotherapy, and every 3 months until month 24|Changes in global function as measured by EQ-5D-5L, -The EQ-5D-5L is a commonly used and reliable questionnaire used to assess patient perception of their current health state. Patients are asked about their levels of difficulty with mobility, self-care, and usual activities, and about their pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression levels on a 5-point scale where the response "I have no problems" = 1 and "I am unable/have extreme" = 5., At screening, end of radiotherapy (week 5), 3 months after start of radiotherapy, and every 3 months until month 24|Rate of acute grade ≥3 adverse events at least possibly related to radiotherapy, From start of radiotherapy through 90 days after start of radiotherapy|Rate of acute <grade 3 GI and GU adverse events, From start of radiotherapy through 90 days after start of radiotherapy|Rate of late grade ≥3 adverse events at least possibly related to radiotherapy, From day 91 after the start of radiotherapy until completion of follow-up at month 60
Rate of late GI and GU adverse events, From day 91 after the start of radiotherapy until completion of follow-up at month 60|Failure-free survival, -Time from start of radiotherapy to biochemical relapse, radiographic recurrence with development of local, regional or distant metastases, or death to due to any cause, From start of radiotherapy until completion of follow-up (estimated to be 60 months)|Biochemical recurrence free-survival, * Biochemical recurrence free survival: Defined as a \>2 ng/mL rise in the PSA above the nadir post initial treatment or evidence of radiographic progression.
* Time from start of radiotherapy to recurrence of prostate cancer by PSA criteria or radiographically), From start of radiotherapy until completion of follow-up (estimated to be 60 months)|Overall survival, -Time from start of radiotherapy to death from any cause, From start of radiotherapy until completion of follow-up (estimated to be 60 months)|Metastasis-free survival, -Time from start of radiotherapy treatment to radiographic diagnosis of metastatic disease (M1 disease) or death from any cause, From start of radiotherapy until completion of follow-up (estimated to be 60 months)|Prostate cancer-specific mortality, -Time from start of radiotherapy to death due to prostate cancer., From start of radiotherapy until completion of follow-up (estimated to be 60 months)
