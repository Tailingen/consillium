The Effectiveness and Safety of XELOX and Tislelizumab + PLD for Resectable Gastric Cancer (LidingStudy)
This is a signle-arm, multi-center, open-lable, phase II study. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tislelizumab + oxaliplatin + capecitabine + PLD in the neoadjuvant treatment of resectable gastric adenocarcinoma.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: PLD|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine|DRUG: Tislelizumab
Pathological complete remission rate, Completely resected tumor specimens and all sampled regional lymph nodes were detected without residual infiltration (ie ypT0 ypN0 in AJCC staging version 8.0), 4-month
Objective response rate, Defined as the proportion of subjects whose best overall response is complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)., 3-month|R0 resection rate, Defined as the proportion of patients who have achieved R0 resection. R0 surgery is defined as complete resection of the tumor without visible residual lesions either by naked eyes or under microscope., 4-month|3-year overall survival rate, Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the enrollment to death for any cause. The Kaplan-Meier curve of OS will be proformed to calculted the 3-year OS rate., 3-year|Progress-free survival, 1) In patients who underwent radical surgery, the time from enrollment to recurrence or death; 2) in patients who did not undergo radical surgery, the time from enrollment to progression (according to RECIST 1.1) or death determined as disease progression., 3-year|3-year PFS rate, The Kaplan-Meier curve of progress-free survival will be proformed to calculted the 3-year PFS rate., 3-year
Adverse events (AEs), AEs are evaluated according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria v5.0., 4-month
This single-arm, multicenter, open-label study plan to enroll patients with resectable stage III gastric adenocarcinoma to recieve tislelizumab + oxaliplatin + capecitabine + PLD regimen for 2 or 4 cycles, radical resection will be performed after neoadjuvant therapy. Radiological evaluation will be performed every 2 cycles to evaluate the resectability of tumor. Survival follow-up will be performed after surgery, until patient's withdrawal of informed consent, loss to follow-up or death, whichever comes first.
