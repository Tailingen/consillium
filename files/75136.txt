Investigator-Initiated Trial of Combined Ipilimumab, Nivolumab and Stereotactic Radiation in Patients With Metastatic Clear-Cell RCC (ccRCC) Who Have Failed Treatment With Single-Agent Nivolumab
The purpose of this study is to see if continued nivolumab with the addition of ipilimumab plus hypo-fractionated stereotactic radiation (sTR) of a single lesions results in partial or complete responses in patients with metastatic ccRCC who fail initial treatment with single agent nivolumab.
