A Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Antitumor Activity of INV-9956 in Adult Patients With Advanced Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
This is a Phase 1a, first-in-human, open-label dose-escalation study to determine the RDR and/or MTD, and to assess the DLT of INV-9956. The safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and preliminary antitumor activity of INV-9956 will be assessed in adult patients with advanced mCRPC.
Advanced Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: INV-9956
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), The highest dose level at which at least 6 patients have been treated and less than 33% of patients experienced a DLT., Within first 28 days of treatment|Recommended dose range (RDR), The RDR will be determined based on the PK and PD data, the preliminary clinical activity of INV-9956, as well as the incidence rate and nature of the toxicities observed in subsequent cycles beyond Cycle 1, 12 months
Characterize the safety of INV-9956 as assessed by CTCAE v5.0, To analyze the safety profile of INV-9956 as a single agent by AE, clinical lab test results, ECG and Vital signs changes, 12 months|Determine the PK using AUC of INV-9956, To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) using AUC of INV-9956 after a single dose and at steady state after multiple doses, 12 months|Determine the PK using Cmax of INV-9956, To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) using Cmax of INV-9956 after a single dose and at steady state after multiple doses, 12 months|Determine the blood concentration of steroid hormone, To determine the blood concentration of steroid hormones at various timepoints as PD markers for INV 9956, 12 months|Evaluate Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), To evaluate rPFS per PCWG-modified RECIST v1.1 (soft tissue response) and PCWG3 criteria (bone metastases), 12 months|Evaluate overall response rate (ORR), To evaluate ORR per PCWG-modified RECIST v1.1 (soft tissue response) and PCWG3 criteria (bone metastases), 12 months
This is a Phase 1a, first-in-human, open-label dose-escalation study to determine the RDR and/or MTD, and to assess the DLT of INV-9956. The safety, tolerability, PK/PD, and preliminary antitumor activity of INV-9956 will be assessed in adult patients with advanced mCRPC. The study will be conducted in 3 stages: Stage 1: dose escalation; Stage 2: dose expansion; Stage 3 (optional): Dose escalation beyond the optimal dose.

The total number of patients enrolled will depend upon the number of dose-escalation cohorts and the number of doses evaluated in Stage 2.

The investigational drug will be co-administered with dexamethasone and fludrocortisone acetate as corticosteroid replacement therapy.
