Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) in Accordance With National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 as Determined by the Efficacy and Safety Evaluation Committee (ESEC), DLT was defined as an adverse event (AE) occurring in Cycle 1 in Phase 1 and judged that the causal relationship to the investigational product could not be denied. The severity of all AEs was graded based upon the NCI CTCAE version 3.0. DLTs were defined as: • Grade 4 Hemoglobin \<6.5 g/dL • Grade 4 Neutrophil \<500/μL continuing for at least 5 days • Febrile neutropenia (Grade 4 neutropenia caused by fever and ≥ 38.5° C for more than 1 hour) • Grade 4 thrombocyte (\< 25,000/μL), or thrombocytopenia with hemorrhage requiring platelet transfusion • Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea at \> grade 3 in spite of treatment • Grade 3 ALT (alanine aminotransferase) or AST (aspartate aminotransferase) values continued for 7 days. • Grade 4 ALT or AST • Grade 2 arrhythmia • Grade 4 non-hematological AEs • Other grade 3 non-hematological AEs except transient fatigue, anorexia, hyponatremia, and tumor lysis syndrome • Other AEs leading to discontinuation of administration, Up to Day 28; Cycle 1|Percentage of PTCL Participants With an Overall Best Response in Accordance With a Modified International Workshop Response Criteria (IWC) 1999 in Phase 2, Objective disease response in PTCL was defined as patients with a complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu) or a partial response (PR) according to modified IWC 1999 criteria and assessed by an independent efficacy reviewer. A CR is \>75% decrease in size of maximum 6 largest target within nodal and extranodal lesions, complete disappearance of other nodal and extranodal; total disappearance of clinical disease; disease-related signs and symptoms, normalization of biochemical abnormalities, disappearance of spleen, liver, or kidney enlargement; no bone marrow (BM) involvement, no new sites of disease. CRu: all above criteria fulfilled except for BM involvement is indeterminate. PR: a ≥50% decrease in size of 6 largest target lesions and no increase other nodal and extranodal; no progression of clinical disease; disease-related signs and symptoms, normalization or biochemical abnormalities, no progression in size of liver, spleen, or kidney; and no new sites of disease, Tumor assessments performed every 2 months; median follow-up time was 100 days; up to the data cut-off of 28 July 2015
Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Associated With Romidepsin, An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen during the course of a study. An AE that resulted in any of the outcomes was defined as a serious (SAE): • Death • Life-threatening event • An inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Persistent or significant disability or incapacity; • Congenital anomaly or birth defect • Other important medical event The investigator judged the relationship of an AE to study drug based on the timing of the AE relative to drug administration and whether or not other drugs, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions could provide an explanation for the event.

This is a Phase 1/2, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm trial with two phases. The first phase is a 3 + 3 dose escalation phase to determine a recommended dose for treating patients with Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) or Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) based on the assessment of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs).The second phase will assess efficacy at the recommended dose by measuring objective response \[Complete Response (CR), Unconfirmed Complete Response (CR(u)) or Partial Response (PR)\] and determining best overall response of each patient. Phase 1 will enroll a maximum of 12 patients and Phase 2 will enroll up to approximately 40 patients
