Granulocyte-macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor, Interferon and Interleukin-2 as Adjuvant Treatment for Renal Cancer
This prospective study assesses toxicity and potential efficacy of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN) alpha and interleukin-2 (IL-2) postoperatively in patients with high-risk renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
Renal Cell Carcinoma
DRUG: GM-CSF, IFN alpha and IL-2
Disease-free survival (DFS), 3.5 years
Progression rate, 28 months|Overall survival (OS), 5 years|Number of Participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability, 12 months
Patients with high-risk RCC have a dismal prognosis. To date, no effective adjuvant therapy exists for this patients category. We suggest that combination of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon alpha (IFN) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulate immune system from dendritic cells till cytotoxic T-lymphocytes step by step and eliminate residuary tumor cells.

This prospective, non-randomized, phase II trial assessed low-dose GM-CSF, IFN and IL-2 postoperatively in patients with high-risk renal cell carcinoma.
