Assessment of Molecular Remission by ASO-qPCR After Bortezomib-dexamethasone (Vel/Dex) Followed by ASCT
The primary objective of this study is to determine the rate of molecular remissions (MolR) assessed by ASO-RQ-PCR technique after induction treatment with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vel/Dex) prior to high-dose therapy with melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT), and after HDT-ASCT in patients with multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma
DRUG: bortezomib + dexamethasone
Molecular remission after Vel/Dex induction (4 cycles) and 3-4 months after ASCT in those patients receiving CR or nCR, Before ASCT and 3-4 months after ASCT and then with 3-4 months interval
HDT-ASCT is so far considered the standard of care for younger patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Current evidence indicates that quality of response is an important prognostic factor for long-term survival in MM. There are only very few data on molecular remissions (MolR) determined by the most sensitive technique, allele-specific-oligonucleotide - real-time quantitative - polymerase chain reaction (ASO-RQ-PCR) in MM, and there are no data available on molecular responses after bortezomib-based induction therapy followed by HDT-ASCT. The main aim of this study is to determine molecular response rate after ASCT following bortezomib-based induction treatment compared to a historical control group with conventional VAD induction treatment. A sensitivity of ASO-RQ-PCR technique will be compared to immunofixation and with immunophenotyping by flow cytometry.
