Study of Tinengotinib VS. Physician's Choice a Treatment of Subjects With FGFR-altered in Cholangiocarcinoma
This study is a Phase III, Randomized, Controlled, Global Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Tinengotinib versus Physician's Choice in Subjects with Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR)-altered, Chemotherapy- and FGFR Inhibitor-Refractory/Relapsed Cholangiocarcinoma

Part A: Incidence, duration, and severity of adverse events (AEs), As assessed per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 (or the most current version)., Up to 30 days from study discontinuation|Part B: PFS by BICR, Progression-free survival (PFS) by BICR: PFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression as assessed by BICR per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, or date of death due to any cause, whichever is earlier., From first study drug administration until the date of first documented progression assessed by BICR or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months
Part A: ORR by Investigator, ORR:objective response rate (ORR), the proportion of subjects who achieved a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1., Through study completion, an average of 9 months.|Part A: DOR by Investigator, Duration of response for CR or PR based on RECIST version 1.1., Through study completion, an average of 9 months.|Part B:Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death of any cause., From first study drug administration until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 24 months.|Part B: Objective Response Rate (ORR) by BICR and by Investigator:, The proportion of subjects who achieved a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) based on RECIST version 1.1., Through study completion, an average of 9 months.|Part B: Duration of Response (DOR) by BICR and by Investigator, Duration of response for CR or PR based on RECIST version 1.1., Through study completion, an average of 9 months.|Part B: PFS by Investigators per RECIST v1.1., PFS is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression as assessed by BICR per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, From first study drug administration until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 24 months.
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive tinengotinib 8 mg QD, tinengotinib 10 mg QD or Physician's Choice in Part A; and eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive the recommended Part B dose or selected dose or Physician's Choice in Part B.
