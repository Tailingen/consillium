Combination of Venetoclax, Hypomethylation Agent and Low-dose Cytarabine as a Salvage Therapy for Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Although studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficiency and safety of venetoclax-based therapy, alone or in combination with hypomethylation agent or low-dose cytarabine, in relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia, data are scarce and heterogenous. In this study, the investigators aimed to assess safety and response to a new venetoclax-based triple-drug combination regimen (venetoclax + hypomethylation agent + low-dose cytarabine) in acute myeloid leukemia patients who had relapsed/refractory disease or positive minimal residual disease.

Although the promising activity of venetoclax-based therapy is well demonstrated in the treatment of previously untreated elderly or unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia, there are few data on the efficacy of venetoclax-based salvage therapy in relapsed/refractory patients, which can be difficult to treat. To date, data on venetoclax as monotherapy or in combination with hypomethylation agent or low-dose cytarabine as a salvage regimen in relapsed/refractory AML are scarce and heterogenous. In this study, the investigators aimed to assess safety and efficiency of a new triple-drug combination regimen, venetoclax + hypomethylation agent + low-dose cytarabine, in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia or persistent positive minimal residual disease in the salvage setting.
