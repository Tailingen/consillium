Clinical Study of Venetoclax Combined With CAG in the Treatment of Refractory/Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
The goal of this clinical trial is to test the safety and efficacy of venetoclax plus CAG regimen in refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia patients.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
DRUG: Ven+CAG
CR/CRi rate, the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery, 2 to 3 weeks after the end of cycle 1 (each cycle is 14 days)|CR/CRi rate, the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery, 2 to 3 weeks after the end of cycle 2 (each cycle is 14 days)
MRD status, MRD-positive status was defined as FCM positivity in two consecutive BM samples at a 2-week interval, PCR positivity in two consecutive BM samples at a 2-week interval, or both FCM and PCR positivity in a single BM sample after the first-month post-HSCT. Positive FCM was defined as \>0.01% of cells with a LAIPs phenotype in \>1 BM samples after transplantation. The expressions of leukemia-associated genes were evaluated by TaqMan-based RT-PCR, including Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) and genes which were determined in the diagnostic specimens., 2 to 3 weeks after the end of cycle 1 (each cycle is 14 days)|MRD status, MRD-positive status was defined as FCM positivity in two consecutive BM samples at a 2-week interval, PCR positivity in two consecutive BM samples at a 2-week interval, or both FCM and PCR positivity in a single BM sample after the first-month post-HSCT.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Safety of Ven combined with CAG regimen in the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML patients
* Efficacy of Ven combined with CAG regimen in the treatment of relapsed/refractory AML patients Participants will receive therapy of venetoclax and CAG regimen (Ara-C, Acla and C C-GSF)
