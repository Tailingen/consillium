Prediction of Immunotherapeutic Effect of Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
To detect the difference of PD-L1 and miRNA expression profiles of exosomes in NSCLC patients before and after immunotherapy, and to explore the potential of plasma exosomes PD-L1 and miRNAs as biomarkers to predict the therapeutic effect of NSCLC on anti-PD-1 / PD-L1.
NSCLC Patients
DRUG: pabolizumab|DRUG: nafulizumab
PD-L1 expression profiles of exosomes, detect the difference of PD-L1 expression profiles of exosomes in NSCLC patients before and after immunotherapy, through study completion, an average of 1 year|miRNA expression profiles of exosomes, detect the difference of miRNA expression profiles of exosomes in NSCLC patients before and after immunotherapy, through study completion, an average of 1 year
