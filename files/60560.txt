A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of TL118 in Solid Tumors Patients
The main objective of the study will be to evaluate the efficacy of TL118 in participants with solid tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions

TL118 is an orally active inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) family consists of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC. These receptors are encoded by the NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, and oncogenic fusions of NTRK may cause cancer cells to grow and spread in the body. The purpose of this study is to explore how effective TL118 is for the treatment of patients with solid tumors harboring NTRK gene fusions.
