A Study of APR-246 in Combination With Dabrafenib in Resistant Patients With BRAF V600 Mutant Melanoma
The purpose of this study is to make a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of a combined APR-246 and dabrafenib therapy regimen in patients with BRAFV600 mutant unresectable and/or metastatic cutaneous melanoma resistant to the dabrafenib/trametinib combination. In addition, the study aims to assess the safety profile of the combined APR-246 and dabrafenib therapy regimen, to explore potential biomarkers, and to further describe the anti-tumour activity of the combination of APR-246 and dabrafenib. The trial will enroll up to 31 evaluable patients.
