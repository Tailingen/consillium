A Study of IMC-002 in Patients with Advanced Cancer Failed to Standard Therapy
This is an Open-Label, Dose-Escalation and Expansion, Phase I Study to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Clinical Activity of IMC-002 in Patients with Advanced Cancer Failed to Standard Therapy
Advanced Cancer
BIOLOGICAL: IMC-002
Incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), 21 days|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability], clinically significant changes in physical examination, vital signs, ECG parameters, clinical laboratory tests, AEs, through study completion, an average of 1 year
The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of IMC-002.

Multiple-dose levels of IMC-002 will be tested in subjects with advanced cancer.
