A Prospective Study on the Prediction Model of Para-aortic Lymph Node Metastasis
The goal of this prospective single-arm trial is to investigate the accuracy and feasibility of the para-aortic lymph node metastasis prediction model in locally advanced cervical cancer, as well as its impact on patients' prognosis. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Is the para-aortic lymph node metastasis prediction model accurate and feasible?
* Whether the para-aortic lymph node metastasis prediction model can affect the prognosis of patients.
Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer
PROCEDURE: surgical staging
The accuracy of the prediction model, The performance of the model was assessed with respect to discrimination which was measured by the concordance index and calibration which was assessed by the calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test and Brier score. The investigators will calculate respectively the sensitivity and 95% confidence interval (CI), specificity and 95% CI, positive likelihood ratios (LR+) and 95% CI, negative likelihood ratios (LR-) and 95% CI, and the Kappa value., 2 years
