A Dose Escalation Study to Estimate MTD, DLTs and Pharmacokinetics After a Single Intracranial Dose of SI-053 as an add-on to the Current Standard of Care, in Adult Patients With Newly Diagnosed GBM
SI-053 is a novel powder formulation containing temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating chemotherapy agent, in an excipient which forms a viscous gel upon reconstitution in water. SI-053 will be used as an add-on to SoC for newly diagnosed GBM. SoC consists of maximal safe resection followed by radiation therapy (RT) with concomitant TMZ and adjuvant chemotherapy with TMZ. For MGMT promoter methylated GBM, lomustine and TMZ may be administered plus radiation therapy
