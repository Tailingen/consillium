Brostallicin in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy such as brostallicin use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of brostallicin in treating patients who have recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma.
Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm
DRUG: brostallicin
Objective Tumor Response Rate, â€¢ Determine the objective tumor response rate (confirmed complete response and confirmed partial response) of brostallicin in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma, 1 year
Maximum Tolerated Dose of brostallicin, 1 year|Time to response, 1 year|Duration of Response, 1 year|Time to treatment failure, 1 year|Time to tumor progression, 1 year|Overall Survival, 1 year
OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the objective tumor response rate (confirmed complete response and confirmed partial response) of brostallicin in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma.
* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the time to and duration of response, time to treatment failure, time to tumor progression, and survival in patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.
* Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.
* Correlate baseline whole blood levels and activity of glutathione with clinical outcome in patients treated with this drug.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study.

* Phase I: Patients receive brostallicin IV over 10-30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of brostallicin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

* Phase II: Additional patients are accrued and treated at the MTD of brostallicin as in phase I.

Patients are followed every 2 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-52 patients will be accrued for this study.
