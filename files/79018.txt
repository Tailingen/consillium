Cabazitaxel vs Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Patients With Poor Prognosis Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to assess and compare the clinical benefit rate in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer and poor prognostic factors treated with cabazitaxel or novel hormonal agents (abiraterone or enzalutamide) as initial therapy, to determine which treatment is most active in this population. Clinical benefit rate is defined as PSA or measurable radiological response of any duration or stable disease for \> or equal to 12 weeks, in the absence of other indicators of progression.

There is option to cross-over onto the other arm if the patient progresses.

DRUG: cabazitaxel|DRUG: Abiraterone|DRUG: Enzalutamide 160mg daily (oral)
Clinical benefit rate, To assess and compare the clinical benefit rate in patients with mCRPC and poor prognostic factors treated with cabazitaxel or novel hormonal agents (abiraterone or enzalutamide) as initial therapy, to determine which treatment is most active in this population. Clinical benefit rate is defined as PSA or measurable radiological response of any duration or stable disease for greater than or equal to 12 weeks, in the absence of other indicators of progression., 12 weeks or more
Duration of treatment time to progression, To measure the treatment time before any type of progression (symptomatic, PSA, or radiological) between Arm A and Arm B, 12 weeks until disease progression|Progression Free Survival, To measure the progression-free survival of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients following treatment with cabazitaxel or abiraterone/enzalutamide as initial therapy., 12 weeks until disease progression|Overall Survival, To measure the overall survival of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients following treatment with cabazitaxel or abiraterone/enzalutamide as initial therapy., 12 weeks until 2 years after last study visit
