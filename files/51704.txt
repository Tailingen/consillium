T-VEC in Non-melanoma Skin Cancer
Evaluation of the mechanism of Action of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in patients with locally advanced non-melanoma skin cancer.
Non-melanoma Skin Cancer|Basal Cell Carcinoma|Squamous Cell Carcinoma|Cutaneous Lymphoma|Merkel Cell Carcinoma
GENETIC: Talimogene Laherparepvec (T-VEC)
Change from Baseline local immune effects after repeated T-VEC injections, Detection of increased local immune activation markers in skin biopsies of injected lesions. The following markers will be assessed by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR): interferon (IFN), 2-prime, 5-prime oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), Interferon-induced GTP-binding protein MxA (MXA) and C-X-C motif chemokine 11 (CXCL11), at baseline, after 3 injections (week 6) and optionally after 6 injections (week 12)
Detection of Tumor Regression using World Health Organization (WHO) response criteria, Measurement of the treated tumor size will be performed at baseline and at each visit until end of the study, at baseline and at week 22|Systemic immune response, Detection of increased systemic immune Response markers in sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by multi-Color fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), at baseline and week 6, optionally also at week 12|Analysis of Adverse events, All serious and non-serious adverse events that occur after enrollment through 30 (+7) days after the last administration of T-VEC will be recorded, At week 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 22
This study evaluates the administration of T-VEC in non-melanoma skin cancer. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of T-VEC in patients with non-melanoma skin cancer through determination of local immune effects after repeated T-VEC injections.
