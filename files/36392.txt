Cetuximab Plus FOLFOXIRI vs Cetuximab Plus FOLFOX For CRCLM
The aim of the trial is to optimize response rates and rates of secondary resections of metastases in patients with initially non-resectable metastatic colorectal cancer Liver Metastasis of RAS wildtype. The patients will be treated in two therapy groups:

Experimental arm A: Chemotherapy with FOLFOXIRI + Cetuximab Standard arm B: Chemotherapy with FOLFOX + Cetuximab
Colorectal Cancer|Liver Metastases
DRUG: Irinotecan|DRUG: Cetuximab|DRUG: 5-fluorouracil|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Leucovorin
Overall Response Rate, Partial response (PR) plus complete response (CR)): assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 criteria, assessed up to 12 months
Depth of Response, The investigator assesses DpR by measuring the ratio of maximum tumor regression to baseline tumor, and calculates the median value, Each follow up visit, assessed up to 12 months|R0 Resection Rate, Defined as the proportion of patients who achieve complete resection after treatment with cetuximab plus FOLFOXIRI regimen or cetuximab plus FOLFOX regimen according to the study protocol, Each follow up visit, assessed up to 12 months|Early Tumor Shrinkage, Target lesion reduction of a least 20% from the nadir following 4 treatment courses assessed using the RECIST version 1.1 criteria, Each follow up visit, assessed up to 12 months|Progression-Free Survival, Assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1, defined as the time from the start of study treatment to disease progression, or relapse after resection of liver metastases, or death due to any cause., Each follow up visit, assessed up to 60 months|Overall Survival, Defined as the time from the start of study treatment to death due to any cause, Each follow up visit, assessed up to 60 months
We intend to carry out a randomized controlled clinical study of cetuximab plus FOLFOXIRI regimen versus cetuximab plus FOLFOX regimen in the first-line treatment of patients with initially unresectable CRLM, to answer the question of whether cetuximab plus FOLFOXIRI regimen can improve the overall ORR, surgical resection rate and OS compared with cetuximab plus FOLFOX regimen in patients with previously untreated, initially unresectable CRLM patients.
