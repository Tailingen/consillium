Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT), Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any of the following adverse events (AEs) occurring in the first 2 cycles of treatment (6 weeks) which were attributable to crizotinib, pembrolizumab or both: hematologic toxicities including Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, Grade greater than or equal to (\>=) 3 neutropenic infection, Grade \>=3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; non-hematologic toxicities including Grade \>=3 toxicities (non-laboratory), Grade \>=3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea despite maximal therapy, non-hematologic Grade \>=3 laboratory value if medical intervention was required to treat the participant or the abnormality led to hospitalization; inability to complete at least 80 percent of the first 2-cycle doses of crizotinib or both infusions of pembrolizumab within the DLT observation period due to treatment-related toxicity. Grade was based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03., 6 weeks
Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device, regardless of the causal relationship to study treatment. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs which occurred for the first time during the effective duration of treatment or AEs that increased in severity during treatment. Serious AEs (SAEs) were defined as any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or caused prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduction normal life functions). AEs included SAEs and non-serious AEs. Causality to study treatment was determined by the investigator. Severity was graded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03., 2 years|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR refers to percentage of participants who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in accordance with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1. A participant achieved CR if both target and non-target lesions achieved CR, no new lesions; achieved PR if target lesions achieved CR or PR, non-target lesions were assessed as non-CR/non-progressive disease (PD) or not evaluated, and no new lesions. For target lesions, CR: complete disappearance of all target lesions; PR: \>= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. For non-target lesions, CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels and all lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size; non-CR/non-PD: persistence of any non-target lesions and/or tumor marker level above the normal limits., Baseline, Week 9 and every 6 weeks thereafter, for about 2 years|Duration of Response, Duration of Response (DR) was defined as the time from first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that was subsequently confirmed, to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death on study due to any cause, whichever occurred first., Baseline, Week 9 and every 6 weeks thereafter, for about 2 years|Time to Tumor Response, Time to Tumor Response (TTR) was defined as the time from the first dose of crizotinib or pembrolizumab to the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) that was subsequently confirmed., Baseline, Week 9 and every 6 weeks thereafter, for about 2 years|Progression Free Survival, Progression Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the first dose of crizotinib or pembrolizumab to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death on-study due to any cause, whichever occurred first.

PD-L1 assessment was performed using immunohistochemistry. A sample was considered negative if tumor proportion score was less than 1%; positive if tumor proportion score was greater than or equal to 1%; strong positive if tumor proportion score was greater than or equal to 50%., Screening
The patients will be screened for up to 28 days before they start treatment to determine if they meet eligibility criteria. The screening procedures will include physical examination, blood work and radiological scans.

In the dose finding phase, patients who meet eligibility criteria will receive crizotinib at the dose level assigned that will be taken on daily basis and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.

Once a Crizotinib dose level is decided, the dose expansion cohort will start enrolling patients who meet eligibility criteria.

All patients will be followed up every three weeks. Blood samples will be drawn to test for safety and tumor activities and radiological scans will be performed on certain timepoints to determine the antitumor activities.

There will be a quality of life questionnaire administered at certain time points during the study.

The study will have a quality assurance plan that addresses data validation and registry procedures. There is a plan to visit the investigator site for routine monitoring and auditing.

The team will conduct source data verification to assess the accuracy, completeness, or representativeness of registry data by comparing the data to external data sources (e.g., medical records, paper or electronic case report forms, or interactive voice response systems).

The study will also include a statistical analysis plan describing the analytical principles and statistical techniques to be employed in order to address the primary and secondary objectives of this study, as specified in the study protocol or statistical plan.
