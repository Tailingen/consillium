Effect of Low Dose Metronomic Chemotherapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer
Low dose metronomic chemotherapy (LDMC) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is used as a palliative regiment with the aim to prolong and improve quality of life. The effect of LDMC is not fully elucidated. The aim is to evaluate the effect of LDMC with Capecitabine and Cyclophosphamide (CX) and to discover new potential predictive markers and potential markers for monitoring treatment effect.
