A Study of Nimotuzumab Combinated With Gemcitabine in K-RAS Wild-type Locally Advanced and Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical trials are ongoing globally to evaluate Nimotuzumab in different indications. Nimotuzumab has been approved to treat squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN), glioma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in different countries.The clinical phase Ⅲ trial designed to assess overall survival（OS）of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concurrently with Gemcitabine in patients with RAS wild type of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer
Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: nimotuzumab|DRUG: Gemcitabine|OTHER: Placebo
Overall Survival（OS）, The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS, defined as from randomization to death due to any cause).

We screened 90 pts (90 patients were allocated for treatment) from 480 pts, of whom 8 pts were excluded due to serious violation of the inclusion criteria: 7 pts with K-Ras mutants, 1 pt with gallbladder cancer. Finally, 82 pts were included in FAS. The primary end point was evaluated in the full analysis set (FAS; all eligible patients who received at least one dose of nimotuzumab/placebo and had one evaluation of efficacy)., up to 3 years
Time to Progression（TTP）, TTP, defined as from randomization to the first observation of disease progression. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., up to 3 years|Progression Free Survival（PFS）, PFS, defined as from randomization to disease progression or all-cause death. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., up to 3 years|Objective Response Rate（ORR）, Objective response rate (ORR), including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions., Once every eight weeks，up to 5.4 months|Disease Control Rate（DCR）, Disease control rate (DCR), including complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) and stable disease(SD). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1) for target lesions and assessed by CT/MRI: CR, disappearance of all target lesions; PR, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions. SD, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD (PD, defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions)., Once every eight weeks，up to 5.4 months|Clinical Benefit Response（CBR）, The clinical benefit response(CBR)was evaluated every 8 weeks on the basis of the Burris criteria. CBR included pain (intensity of pain and consumption of analgesics), PS (performance status, evaluated according to KPS) and weight changes. Effective is defined as at least one positive improvement in the CBR index (pain, physical status or weight change) and no negative indicator is found, which can be rated as a clinical benefit case., every 8 weeks, up to 5.4 months|Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Adverse Events as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participant's participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the participant's participation in the research., up to 75.2 months
