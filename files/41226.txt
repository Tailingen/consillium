A Phase II Trial of Exploring the Predictive Factors of TX and XELOX Regimen in the First Line Treatment of MGC
Platinum, fluorouracil and taxane based regimen are all acceptable in the first line treatment of metastatic gastric cancer. The TX and XELOX regimen are two common regimen used in MGC. whichever regimen is used, the average response rate is less than 50%. So a rather part of patients can't get benefit from the treatment. It is urgent to find out the predictive factors of these regimens in order to get a higher response and better survival outcome.

DRUG: Docetaxol|DRUG: Oxaliplatin|DRUG: Capecitabine
objective response, RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) will be used to evaluate the response of each patient every 6 weeks. The main purpose of this study is to search for the biomarkers which will predict the response of patients with MGC received TX or XELOX regimen as first line therapy, 6 weeks
progression free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as from the date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 60 months, From randomization until first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first (up to 60 months)
overall survival(OS), OS is defined as from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months, from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months
Patients with MGC will be treated with TX or XELOX regimen. Before treatment, 14 days after treatment and after progression, the blood sample will be collected. Primary tumor blocks will also of collected. These samples will be used to detect predictive factors of the two types first line therapy.
