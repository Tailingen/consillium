Ultrasound Guided Costotransverse Block for Breast Cancer Surgery
Costotransverse block is a novel regional anesthesia technique described a few months ago. It's use for breast surgery has been reported by only one case report in the literature. As the investigators have considered that Costotransverse block can be efficacious for providing postoperative analgesia in the breast surgeries, the investigators have implemented the application of this blockade into practice at the clinic. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the analgesic effect of ultrasound-guided unilateral costotransverse block in breast cancer surgery.
Postoperative Pain
OTHER: costotransverse block
24 hours morphine consumption, morphine consumptions for both group will be recorded, 24 hours
Numeric rating scale for postoperative pain intensity, Changes in Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at rest and on movement will be recorded at intervals. NRS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. The NRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. "no pain") to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. "pain as bad as you can imagine" or "worst pain imaginable")., 24 hours
