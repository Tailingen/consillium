BEHAVIORAL: MODEL Care
Feasibility: Recruitment Rates at Baseline, The number of individuals who are eligible will be divided by the number of individuals approached., Recruitment rates will be estimated at baseline.|Feasibility: Enrollment Rates at Baseline, The number of enrolled individuals will be divided by the number of eligible individuals., Enrollment rates will be caluclated at baseline.|Feasibility: Attendance at Post-Intervention (6 weeks), The mean number of sessions attended by each participant type (i.e., patients, family caregivers, providers) will be calculated and compared to the total number of MODEL care sessions provided (i.e., 6 for patients/family caregivers and 5 for providers)., Attendance will be calculated at the end of the intervention (6 weeks).|Feasibility: Retention Rates at Post-Intervention (6 weeks), The proportion of the total number of participants enrolled who completed post-intervention assessments (at 6 weeks) will be calculated by dividing the number of individuals assessed post-intervention (6 weeks) by the number of participants who were enrolled/assessed at baseline., Retention rates will be calculated at the end of the intervention (6 weeks).|Acceptability: Intervention Satisfaction at Post-Intervention (6 weeks), An investigator-created measure of intervention satisfaction will be administered. This measure includes items assessing participants' overall satisfaction, satisfaction with different components of the intervention, likelihood of recommending the course to others, and the intention to continue using MODEL Care skills. The mean score on the satisfaction scale will be calculated for each group (patients, family caregivers, and providers) post-intervention (6 weeks)., Participants' satisfaction with the intervention will be assessed at the end of the intervention (6 weeks).|Feasibility: Retention Rates at 1-Month Follow-up (10 weeks), The proportion of the total number of participants enrolled who completed 1-month follow-up assessments (at 10 weeks) will be calculated by dividing the number of individuals who were assessed at 1-month follow-up (10 weeks) by the number of participants enrolled/assessed at baseline., Retention rates will be calculated at 1-month follow-up (10 weeks).
Change from Baseline in Avoidant Coping at Post-Intervention (6 weeks), To measure avoidant coping, the Brief COPE and Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer (Mini-MAC) scales will be administered to patients and family caregivers. To assess avoidance among participating health care providers, items adapted from a study assessing effects of end-of-life communication training, and 4 subscales from the Young-Rygh Avoidance Inventory will be used. The effects of MODEL Care on avoidant coping will be determined by calculating the change in avoidant coping scores from baseline to post-intervention (6 weeks) for each group of participants on their respective measures., Avoidant coping will be measured at baseline and post-intervention (6-weeks) for all three groups (patients, family caregivers, and health care providers).|Change from Baseline in Avoidant Coping at 1-Month Follow-up (10 weeks), To measure avoidant coping, the Brief COPE and Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer (Mini-MAC) scales will be administered to patients and family caregivers. To assess avoidance among participating health care providers, items adapted from a study assessing effects of end-of-life communication training and 4 subscales from the Young-Rygh Avoidance Inventory will be used. The effects of MODEL Care on avoidant coping will be determined by calculating the change in avoidant coping scores from baseline to 1-month follow-up for each group of participants on their respective measures., Avoidant coping will be measured at baseline and at 1-month follow up (10 weeks) for all three groups (patients, family caregivers, and health care providers).|Change from Baseline in Quality of Life at Post-Intervention (6 weeks), Patients' quality of life will be measured with the McGill Quality of Life Inventory. Family caregivers' quality of life will be assessed with Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer. Health care providers' quality of life will be assessed using the Professional Quality of Life measure, and Satisfaction with Life scale. The effects of MODEL Care on quality of life will be determined by calculating the change in quality of life scores from baseline to post-intervention (6 weeks) for each group of participants., Quality of life will be measured at baseline and post-intervention (6 weeks) for all three groups (patients, family caregivers, and health care providers).|Change from Baseline in Quality of Life at 1-Month Follow-up (10 weeks), Patients' quality of life will be measured with the McGill Quality of Life Inventory. Family caregivers' quality of life will be assessed with the Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer. Health care providers' quality of life will be assessed using the Professional Quality of Life measure, and Satisfaction with Life scale. The effects of MODEL Care on quality of life will be determined by calculating the change in quality of life scores from baseline to 1-month follow up for each group of participants., Quality of life will be measured at baseline and at 1-month follow-up (10 weeks) for all three groups (patients, family caregivers, and health care providers).|Change from Baseline in Depression at Post-Intervention (6 weeks), Depression will be assessed for all 3 groups using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8). The effects of MODEL Care on depression will be determined by calculating the change in PHQ-8 scores from baseline to post-intervention ( 6 weeks) for each group of participants., Depression will be measured at baseline and post-intervention (6 weeks) for all three groups (patients, family caregivers, and health care providers).|Change from Baseline in Depression at 1-Month Follow-up (10 weeks), Depression will be assessed for all 3 groups using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8). The effects of MODEL Care on depression will be determined by calculating the change in PHQ-8 scores from baseline to 1-month follow up for each group of participants., Depression will be measured at baseline and at 1-month follow-up (10 weeks) for all three groups (patients, family caregivers, and health care providers).|Change from Baseline in Anxiety at Post-Intervention (6 weeks), Anxiety will be assessed for all 3 groups using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). The effects of MODEL Care on anxiety will be determined by calculating the change in GAD-7 scores from baseline to post-intervention (6 weeks) for each group of participants., Anxiety will be measured at baseline and post-intervention (6 weeks) for all three groups (patients, family caregivers, and health care providers).|Change from Baseline in Anxiety at 1-Month Follow-up (10 weeks), Anxiety will be assessed for all 3 groups using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7). The effects of MODEL Care on anxiety will be determined by calculating the change in GAD-7 scores from baseline to 1-month follow up for each group of participants., Anxiety will be measured at baseline and at 1-month follow-up (10 weeks) for all three groups (patients, family caregivers, and health care providers).|Change from Baseline in Readiness for Advance Care Planning at Post-Intervention (6 weeks), Patients' readiness to complete 3 advance care planning behaviors (i.e., Physician's Orders for Scope of Treatment form, discussing "goals of care" with their oncologist, and discussing "goals of care" with their family) will be assessed. Responses to these 3 items will indicate the patient's stage of readiness (ranging from pre-contemplation to maintenance) on each behavior. The effects of MODEL Care on advance care planning will be determined by calculating the change in readiness stage category on each behavior from baseline to post-intervention (6 weeks) for patients., Readiness for advance care planning will be measured at baseline and post-intervention (6 weeks) for patients only.|Change from Baseline in Readiness for Advance Care Planning at 1-Month Follow-up (10 weeks), Patients' readiness to complete 3 advance care planning behaviors (i.e., Physician's Orders for Scope of Treatment form, discussing "goals of care" with their oncologist, and discussing "goals of care" with their family) will be assessed.
