Influence Mechanism of Tumor Microenvironment Changes on Neoadjuvant Therapy for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
To evaluate the predictive value and mechanism of inflammatory factors in peripheral blood on the prognosis of patients, and to explore the influencing factors of inflammation and tumor microenvironment on the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy for esophageal cancer. To explore the predictors of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
Esophageal Cancer
Tumor diameter, The tumor diameter will be measured to evaluate the therapeutic effect, 1 year
Overall survival, The survival time of patients is calculated from first treatment, 1 year
Patients with esophageal cancer admitted to Hubei Provincial People's Hospital from May 2023 to December 2024 were collected (the estimated number of patients included is 60). Collect research objects: 1. Baseline information: gender, age, tumor location, T stage, N stage, and BMI, etc. The tumor staging and grading are determined according to the eighth edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer esophageal cancer staging; 2. Laboratory data; Blood routine, liver and kidney function, electrolyte, coagulation function, tumor markers and cytokines were collected before neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, after 2 cycles of treatment and after 4 cycles of treatment (if applicable). After every two cycles of treatment, the remission status of the disease was evaluated by CT or gastroscopy in the routine treatment. To evaluate the predictive value and mechanism of peripheral blood inflammatory factors on the prognosis of patients, and to explore the influencing factors of inflammation and tumor microenvironment on the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy for esophageal cancer.
