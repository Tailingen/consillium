Preliminary Study on the Diagnostic Value Comparison of 18F-FAPI-04 PET/CT and PET/MR in Gastric Cancer
This project aims to comprehensively analyze the diagnostic efficacy of SUVmax, SUVean, TLG, MTV, etc. in gastric cancer through 18F-FAPI-04 PET/CT imaging combined with serum tumor markers and other methods, and construct a molecular imaging diagnostic model for gastric cancer; Next, analyze the diagnostic efficacy of 18F-FAPI-04 PET/CT and PET/MR multimodal imaging in evaluating SUVmax, PET/CT-PCI, and PET/MR-PCI for gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis, and construct a molecular imaging diagnostic model for gastric cancer peritoneal metastasis; Exploring the clinical value of 18F-FAPI-04 PET/CT and PET/MR imaging in the diagnosis and staging of gastric cancer.
