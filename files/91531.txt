Durvalumab Combined With Consolidation Radiotherapy After First-line Treatment in Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer With Oligometastases
In patients with oligometastatic (1-5 lesions) extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, to explore the efficacy and safety of Durvalumab immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy followed by consolidation radiotherapy, to provide scientific basis for the formulation of the best comprehensive treatment plan in the future.

overall survival time, Time from the date of first dosing of Durvalumab to death from any cause., up to 2 years
locoregional recurrence-free survival, The time from the date of first dosing of Durvalumab to the first appearance of objective disease progression or death from any cause (if it occurs before disease progression)., up to 2 years|distant metastasis-free survival, The time from the date of first dosing of Durvalumab to the first appearance of the tumor had metastasized., up to 2 years
To explore the efficacy and safety of consolidation radiotherapy after Durvalumab immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in patients with oligometastatic small cell lung cancer (1-5 lesions), so as to provide scientific basis for making the best comprehensive treatment plan in the future.All subjects will receive the following treatments:

1. Induction period (3 weeks as a cycle, 4 cycles of administration): Durvalumab + carboplatin/cisplatin + etoposide, intravenous drip
2. Consolidation radiotherapy period: radiotherapy for primary chest lesions + oligometastatic lesions.
3. Maintenance phase (administered every 4 weeks): Durvalumab intravenous infusion.
