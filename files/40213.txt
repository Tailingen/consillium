ONC-392 Plus Lutetium Lu 177 Vipivotide Tetraxetan in Patients With mCRPC
In this Phase 2 study, mCRPC patients with PSMA positive scans who progressed on prior ARTA and up to 2 lines of taxanes, and are na√Øve to lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan, will be enrolled. The study is open-label, randomized with active control, multi-center study.

The goal of this clinical trial is to examine the safety and efficacy of ONC-392 in combination with lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patient who have disease progressed on androgen receptor pathway inhibition. The main questions it aims to answer are (1) whether it is safe to combine ONC-392 with lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan, (2) whether the combination increases the radiographic progression free survival (rPFS).

In Phase 1 of the trial, participates will be randomized to experimental arm and control arm in 2:1 ratio. In experimental arm, they will be given ONC-392 IV infusion for up to 9 cycles or approximately one year, together with lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan for up to 6 cycles. In Phase 2 of the trial, participants will be randomized to three arms in 1:1:1 ratio. There will be two experimental arms, one with low dose of ONC-392 and one with high dose ONC-392, to be given in IV infusion for up to 9 or 13 cycles or approximately one year, together with lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan for up to 6 cycles. In active control arm for both Phase 1 and Phase 2, participants will be given standard of care treatment with lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan for up to 6 cycles.
