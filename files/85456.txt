Drug-drug Interaction Study of Ofatumumab With Bendamustine in Subjects With Indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions between ofatumumab and bendamustine in subjects with previously untreated or relapsed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).
Cancer
DRUG: ofatumumab|DRUG: bendamustine
Pharmacokinetic measures of Cmax and Area Under the Curve by analysis of blood samples for the amount of each drug present at different timepoints., The amount of ofatumumab and bendamustine in the blood will be measured when given individually or together to obtain Cmax and Area Under the Curve. Bendamustine levels will be collected at Cycles 1 and 2: Predose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 (end of infusion), 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 24 hours. Ofatumumab will be collected at Cycle 4: Predose, end of infusion, then 1, 2, 24, and 72 hours after end of infusion, then once each on Days 8, 15, and 22., 4 months
Changes in vital signs and the number adverse events, Changes in vital signs will be measured during the entire study to determine any effect on the subjects health. Also the recording of all adverse events that occur during the study will be collected for analysis., 14 months|Measure the extent of the disease by CT scan or flow cytometry analysis, Dimension measurement assessments by CT scan of disease will be collected at Screen, Cycle 5, 3 month follow up visit, and 6 month follow up visit. Flow cytometry measurements will be collected at Screen and Weeks 1, 2, 5, 13, 21, 41, and 53., 14 months
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential drug-drug interactions between ofatumumab and bendamustine in subjects with previously untreated or relapsed indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Ofatumumab and bendamustine will be administered alone and in combination in a two-arm, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ofatumumab and bendamustine.

The primary objective of the study is to evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters of ofatumumab and bendamustine alone and in combination. Secondary objectives are to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy.
