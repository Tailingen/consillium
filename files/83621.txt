Lorcaserin in Treating Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Patients With Stage I-IV Gastrointestinal or Breast Cancer
This phase I trial studies how well lorcaserin works in treating chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with stage I-IV gastrointestinal or breast cancer. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a nerve problem that causes pain, numbness, tingling, swelling, or muscle weakness in different parts of the body. This condition can occur in patients who have received taxane chemotherapy drugs, or the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin. Lorcaserin may improve chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy by reducing pain, preventing or relieving joint symptoms, and improving balance.

DRUG: Lorcaserin|DRUG: Lorcaserin Hydrochloride|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration
Measure the improvement in balance for patients with chronic CIPN, Will be evaluated using a measure of postural control: root-mean-squared amplitude of center of pressure (COP) excursion for the medial-lateral axis of the body ., Up to 4 weeks
Improvement in patient-reported chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy symptoms, Evaluate using Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). The BPI-SF is an additional PRO. It is a validated instrument that has been used to evaluate pain symptoms and functional capacity in our target population.45, Baseline up to 4 weeks
Nerve conduction test (NCT) result analysis, The study will compare baseline variables of patients with abnormal NCT results to those with normal NCT results. Will present descriptive statistics and perform t-tests comparing the two groups with respect to demographics (age, BMI), RMSml, and patient-reported outcomes (CIPN 20, BPI-SF)., Baseline up to 4 weeks
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate preliminary efficacy of lorcaserin to improve balance decrements in patients with chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate patient reported outcomes (PROs) after a one time dose of lorcaserin in patients with chronic CIPN.

OUTLINE:

Patients receive lorcaserin orally (PO) on day 1.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
