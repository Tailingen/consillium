First-in-Man, Dose-escalation Trial of C-met Kinase Inhibitor MSC2156119J in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a an open-label, dose-escalation, first-in-man (FIM) study designed to explore MSC2156119J, in subjects with advanced solid tumors who have not responded to previous therapies or for whom no other therapies are available.

Subjects will be assigned one of the dosing regimens:

* Regimen 1: MSC2156119J once daily for 14 days, followed by 7 days with no treatment (21-day cycle)
* Regimen 2: MSC2156119J three times per week (e.g., Days 1, 3, and 5) for three weeks (21-day cycle)
* Regimen 3: MSC2156119J every day for three weeks (21-day cycle)
Patients With Solid Tumors, Either Refractory to Standard Therapy or for Which no Effective Standard Therapy is Available
DRUG: MSC2156119J
Number of Subjects With Any Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), DLT was defined as one of the following adverse events (AEs) observed during Cycle1, regardless of MSC2156119J relationship, excluding AEs assessed by investigator exclusively related to subject's underlying disease or medical condition: Grade 4 neutropenia for \>7 days; Grade \>=3 febrile neutropenia for \>1 day; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia/Grade 3 with bleeding; Grade \>=3 nausea and emesis, despite optimal treatment; Grade \>=3 non-hematological AE, except emesis and nausea with no adequate therapy and alopecia, Grade \>= 3 liver AE with a recovery period of \>7 days or to Grade \<=1 for subjects without liver metastases or to \<=2 for subjects with liver metastases; Grade \>=3 lipase and/or amylase rise with pancreatitis confirmation, either based on clinical or radiological signs. Any AE not otherwise defined as a DLT that, due to prolonged recovery to Grade \<=1 or baseline status, leads to delay of above 21 days in planned administration of study drug., Day 1, 3, 8, 14, 17 of Cycle 1 (for Regimen 1 and 3); Day 1, 3, 8, 15, 19 of Cycle 1 (for Regimen 2)|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), MTD was defined as the dose level at which 2 out of 3 subjects or 2 out of 6 subjects experienced a DLT. The primary endpoint was to determine MTD of MSC2156119J for each of the 3 treatment regimens in subjects with advanced solid tumors. However, during the course of the trial it was established that the MTD could not be determined and instead, RP2D was to be determined., Cycle 1 (Day 1 to Day 21)|Number of Subjects With Treatment-Related Adverse Events, Related AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which was considered to have a relationship with the study drug (suspected to be reasonably related to the study drug or AE was medically (pharmacologically/clinically) attributed to the study drug as per Investigator's assessment., Baseline up to 158.01 weeks
Number of Subjects With Treatment-Emergent AEs (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation or TEAEs Leading to Death, AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this the study drug. An AE was defined as any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A serious AE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important.
