Evaluate Breast Masses Using a New Method of Ultrasound Contrast to Detect Abnormal Blood Flow in Breasts
The purpose of this study is to determine if breast imaging with ultrasound can be improved by using 1) a ultrasound attachment with two transducers and 2) a contrast agent. These changes might allow smaller blood vessels to be seen than under the way breast ultrasound is usually performed.

PROCEDURE: Ultrasound Imaging with Contrast
The purpose of this study is to determine if performing ultrasound with an attachment made up of two transducers (rather than just a single transducer) will provide more information about the blood vessels in the breast than the current attachment.

The study will also examine the question of whether use of an ultrasound contrast agent will the scanner to see smaller blood vessels than are detected without the agent.
