SHR-1210 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Extranodal NK/T Cell Lymphoma
This is an open-label, multi-center, nonrandomized, Phase 2 study to evaluate efficacy and safety of SHR-1210 in subjects with relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.Efficacy will be assessed every 8 weeks according to 2014 Lugano criteria.Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed at baseline, before each study treatment, and throughout the study.
Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma, Nasal Type
DRUG: SHR-1210
objective response rate, rate of subjects achieved complete response plus partial response in all evaluable subjects, from first patient first visit to 6 month after last patient first visit
The primary objective of this phase 2 study is to assess objective response rate of SHR-1210 in patients with relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma. The secondary objective is to observe time to response,progression free survival rate at 2 years,overall survival rate at 2 yearsï¼Œsafety and immunogenicity of SHR-1210 in relapsed or refractory extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma.The relationship of PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue and EBV-DNA copies in blood to SHR-1210 efficacy in these patients would also be explored.
