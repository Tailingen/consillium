A Study of F0002-ADC in Chinese Patients With Refractory or Recurrent CD30+ Hematologic Malignancies.
This is a Phase I dose escalation study designed to define the maximum tolerable dose(MDT), the safety profile, pharmacokinetic parameters, immunogenicity and anti-tumor activity of F0002-ADC in Chinese patients with relapsed/refractory CD30-positive hematologic malignancies.
