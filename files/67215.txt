This study is a multicenter, prospective cohort study that will recruit at least 2244 individuals with chest HRCT findings of pulmonary nodules and recommended follow-up by MDT from four research centers. According to whether patients with pulmonary nodules are treated with traditional Chinese medicine, they are divided into a traditional Chinese medicine cohort and a non-traditional Chinese medicine cohort , and are followed up for at least 2 years. The main outcome measures were pulmonary nodule growth (enlargement or new onset) and nodule regression (reduction or disappearance). To evaluate the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine treatment for patients with pulmonary nodules, secondary outcome measures include nodule volume, average nodule density, doubling time of volume, internal and external signs of nodules, anxiety self-assessment scale, depression self-assessment scale and SF-36 scale.
