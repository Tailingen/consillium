A Multi-center, Open-label Study of Oral ENMD-2076 for the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Fibrolamellar Carcinoma
The purpose of the study is to determine whether once-daily dosing with ENMD-2076 will be a safe and effective treatment in patients with FLC. Safety will be measured by looking at the adverse events that may happen and the efficacy will look at the progression of the disease over time.
Advanced Adult Hepatocellular Carcinoma|Advanced Fibrolamellar Carcinoma
DRUG: ENMD-2076
Overall Response Rate, 6-month overall response rate (ORR rate) using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR) - disappearance of all target lesions; partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; ORR = proportion of patients evaluated as CR + PR, 6 months
Progression Free Survival, using RECIST v 1.1 criteria, 6 months
Frequency and Severity of Adverse Events, Frequency and severity of adverse events in patients evaluable for toxicity, 6 months
Primary Objective:

â€¢ To determine the 6-month progression free survival (PFS6) rate when patients with advanced fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) are treated with daily oral ENMD 2076

Secondary Objectives:

* To evaluate the overall response rate using RECIST v 1.1 criteria when patients with FLC are treated with daily oral ENMD 2076.
* To evaluate the median Progression Free Survival (PFS), Time to Progression (TTP), and Overall Survival (OS).
* To determine the safety of ENMD-2076 as defined by the frequency and severity of adverse events when patients with FLC are treated with daily oral ENMD-2076
