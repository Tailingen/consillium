An Efficacy and Safety Study of Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS)-Fentanyl in Cancer Participants With Inadequately Controlled Pain by Non-Narcotic Analgesics
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS)-fentanyl D-Trans (transdermal patch containing a drug that is put on the skin so the drug will enter the body through the skin) treatment in cancer participants of Korea with inadequately controlled pain by non-narcotic analgesics (drug used to control pain) and participant's satisfaction.
Pain; Cancer
DRUG: Fentanyl D-trans
Percentage of Participants Satisfied With Pain Treatment, Participants were assessed for their satisfaction for pain treatment after the application of the Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS)-fentanyl D-trans., Day 29
Difference in Pain Intensity Before and After Administration of (TTS)-Fentanyl D-trans, Pain intensity difference was measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, which ranges from 0 to 10 centimeter (cm) where 0 cm=no pain and 10 cm= unimaginably severe pain., Day 1 and Day 29
Number of Participants With Detailed Reason for Satisfaction With the Pain Treatment, Participants were assessed for satisfaction for pain treatment after the administration of the TTS-fentanyl D-trans in detail with satisfied reasons, which are excellent pain relieving effect, convenient administration, minor adverse event, generally satisfied and other., Day 29|Initial and End Point Dose of TTS-Fentanyl D-trans, Dose of TTS-fentanyl D-trans were monitored at start and end of the trial., Day 1 and Day 29|Number of Participants With Investigator's Overall Evaluation on the Pain Treatment, Investigator assessed the participants for satisfaction on pain treatment after the administration of the TTS-fentanyl D-trans as very satisfied, satisfied, average, dissatisfied or very dissatisfied., Day 29
This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm, multicenter (conducted in more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), prospective (study following participants forward in time) study conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of TTS-fentanyl D-trans in cancer participants of Korea with inadequately controlled pain by non-narcotic analgesics and for participant's satisfaction. The participants will receive the initial dose of TTS-fentanyl D-trans patch releasing 12 micrograms per hour (12 mcg/hr) of fentanyl and will be increased by 12 mcg/hr or 25 mcg/hr, every 3 days depending on the participant's pain control. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by participant's satisfaction with pain treatment. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.
