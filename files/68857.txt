Postoperative Pain Management After Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy
Esophagectomy is a major surgical procedure often associated with significant morbidity and mortality and significant level of postoperative pain. In contrast to open esophagectomy where epidural pain control has been considered as a gold standard and could be crucial in affecting outcome the analgesic scheme for minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is yet to be established. We would like to compare continuous epidural analgesia and continuous paravertebral block combined with single shot subcostal transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block in the analgesic effects, levels of cytokines, and postoperative complications in patients receiving MIE.
