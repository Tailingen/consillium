Comparison Between NCRT and NCT Followed by MIE for Treatment of Locally Advanced Resectable ESCC
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by minimally invasive esophagectomy on patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(cT3-4aN0-1M0).
Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Stage cT3-4aN0-1M0
PROCEDURE: Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy|PROCEDURE: Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy|PROCEDURE: Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy
Overall survival(OS), Up to the date of death of any causes since the date of randomization, up to 36 months
Progression-free survival(PFS), Disease recurrence is defined as locoregional (esophageal bed or anastomotic or regional lymph nodes) or metastatic (supraclavicular lymph nodes or distant organs)., Up to the date of disease recurrence since the date of randomization, up to 36 months|Pathological response rate(pCR), The resected specimen following neo-adjuvant treatment are assessed by using standardised work up of the resection specimen in the pathology department and standardised histological criteria for tumour regression grading. The degree of histomorphologic regression is clarified into four categories as follows: grade 1, no evidence of vital residual tumor cells (pathological complete response); grade 2, less than 10% vital residual tumor cells; grade 3, 10 to 50%; and grade 4, more than 50%., Up to the date of pathological reports obtained since the date of randomization, up to 12 months|R0 resection rate, No vital tumor is presented at the proximal, distal, or circumferential resection margin, it is considered to be R0 resection. If a vital tumor is shown at 1 mm or less from the proximal, distal, or circumferential resection margin, it is considered to be microscopically positive (R1)., Up to the date of pathological reports obtained since the date of randomization, up to 12 months|Positive lymph nodes' number, According to pathological reports, record the number of positive lymph nodes, Up to the date of pathological reports obtained since the date of randomization, up to 12 months|Treatment related complications, Number and severity of adverse events that are related to treatment of each patients, and hospital readmission., Up to 1 month after surgery since the data of randomization, up to 13 months|Quality of life(QOL), QOL is respectively evaluated at randomization and 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and yearly after surgery among patients by using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC QLQ-OES18, Up to the end of follow-up since the data of surgery, up to 36 months|Recurrence-free survival (RFS), RFS is defined in resected patients who achieved an R0 or R1 resection as the time interval from surgery to the date of first recurrence (local, regional or distant) or death, whichever comes first., Up to the date of disease recurrence since the date of surgery, up to 36 months
It is a prospective randomized phase III clinical trial sponsored by Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital with other eight hospitals in China participating in. 264 patients with locally advanced resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma(cT3-4aN0-1M0) are recruited and randomly assigned into the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy group (NCRT group) and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (NCT group) according to the proportion of 1:1.The safety,efficacy of protocols and prognosis of patients are compared between the two regimens.
