A Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study of Anti-CD27 (Varlilumab) and Anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab) in Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors
This is a study to determine the clinical benefit (how well the drug works), safety, and tolerability of combining varlilumab and nivolumab (also known as OpdivoÂ® , BMS-936558). Both drugs target the immune system and may act to promote anti-cancer effects.

DRUG: Combination of varlilumab and nivolumab
Phase I: Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as determined by CTCAE v4.0, dose-limiting toxicities, and laboratory abnormalities., Safety follow-up is 100 days from last study drug dose.|Phase II: Preliminary antitumor activity of the combination of varlilumab and nivolumab as measured by objective response rate (ORR) in patients with CRC, ovarian cancer, RCC and SCCHN and Overall Survival-12 months in GBM., Evaluated every 8 weeks following treatment initiation until treatment is discontinued or disease progression, for up to 3 years.
Varlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called CD27 found on certain immune cells and may act to promote anti-tumor effects.

Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called PD-1 on immune cells and promotes anti-tumor effects.

Eligible patients that enroll in the dose escalation portion of the study will be assigned to one of three dose levels of varlilumab in combination with 3 mg/kg of nivolumab. The first phase of the study will test the safety profile of the combination and determine which dose will be studied in Phase ll of the overall study.

During Phase ll, depending on cancer type, groups of patients will be enrolled and receive varlilumab at a dose of either 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 3 mg/kg every 12 weeks, or 0.3 mg/kg every 4 weeks in combination with nivolumab at 240 mg.

All patients enrolled in the study will be closely monitored to determine if there is response to the treatment as well as for any side effects that may occur.
