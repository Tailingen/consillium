A Randomized, Double-blind, Multicenter, Sham-controlled, Safety and Efficacy Study of Conbercept in Patients With mCNV
This study is design to evaluate the effect of conbercept therapy on visual acuity and anatomic outcomes compared to sham injection and durability of response observed in subjects with choroid neovascularization secondary to pathological myopia.
Choroid Neovascularization Secondary to Degenerative Myopia
DRUG: conbercept, Fixed|DRUG: conbercept, PRN|OTHER: sham injection
mean change from baseline of visual acuity, to compare the mean change from baseline of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between conbercept treatment group and sham injection group at month 3, 3-month
mean change from baseline of anatomical features, to compare the difference of mean change from baseline of CRT, CNV size and lesion size between conbercept treatment group and sham injection group at month 3, 3-month|mean change from baseline of visual acuity, to evaluate the mean change from baseline of BCVA of two groups from month 1 to month 9, 9 months|safety and tolerability of conbercept, to evaluate the incidence of AEs (ocular or non-ocular) of two groups at month 3 and 9, 3-month and 9-month
