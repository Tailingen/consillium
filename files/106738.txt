Interventional X-ray and Scintigraphy Imaging of 99mTc-MAA During the Radioembolisation Pretreatment Procedure
To establish the safety and feasibility of interventional x-ray and scintigraphy imaging during the pre-treatment procedure of hepatic radioembolization
Liver Cancer
DEVICE: IXSI
Device Feasibility, The feasibility of IXSI will be assessed by questionnaires filled in by interventional radiology personnel, Immediately after surgery
Radioactivity distribution over time, The radioactivity distribution in the liver segments will be measured over time to assess potential dynamic behavior, Immediately after surgery|Radioactivity distribution in 3D, The quality of IXSI scans will be assessed by measuring the radioactivity distribution in the liver segments in 3D, Immediately after surgery
To establish the safety and feasibility of interventional x-ray and scintigraphy imaging during the pre-treatment procedure of hepatic radioembolization
