Transverse Myelitis Related to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines
Few patients receiving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may experience rare but serious adverse events such as transverse myelitis (TM). Today, data about TM are scarce.

The objective was to investigate reports of TM adverse events related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines labelled by FDA and EMA, including ChAdOx1nCov-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca), BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson \& Johnson) and using the World Health Organization's (WHO) pharmacovigilance database: VigiBase.
Vaccine Adverse Reaction
DRUG: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
TM reportes related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, date of the first AE related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to December 10, 2021
Description of the latency period since SARS-CoV-2 vaccine exposure., date of the first AE related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to December 10, 2021|Description of the outcomes following TM, date of the first AE related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to December 10, 2021|Description of patients who experienced co-reported adverse events, date of the first AE related to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to December 10, 2021
Here, investigators use the World Health Organization's (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to identify cases of TM related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
