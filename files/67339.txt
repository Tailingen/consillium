Study of the CDK4/6 Inhibitor Abemaciclib in Solid Tumors Harboring Genetic Alterations in Genes Encoding D-type Cyclins or Amplification of CDK4 or CDK6
This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for cancer abnormality in one of the following genes: CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK4, or CDK6.

The drug involved in this study is:

-Abemaciclib
Cancer
DRUG: Abemaciclib
Progression-Free Rate, proportion of patients who are alive and progression-free at 4 months on both arms., 4 months
Overall Response Rate, objective response rate by RECIST 1.1 for patients enrolled to both arms., 2 years|Toxicity, Adverse event data in all participants by CTCAE 4.03, 2 years
This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Abemaciclib as a treatment for any disease.

To participate in this study, the participant must have an abnormality in one of the following genes: CCND1, CCND2, CCND3, CDK4, or CDK6. Abnormalities in these genes may cause the cancer to grow more rapidly. CDK4 and CDK6 are proteins that are involved with the cell growth process. D-type cyclins (CCND1, CCND2, and CCND3) are proteins that help control the activity of CDK4 and CDK6.

Abemaciclib is being studied as a treatment for people with advanced cancer. Abemaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. CDK inhibitors work to stop cell growth. In this research study, the investigators are hoping to learn whether Abemaciclib can be used to slow or stop the growth of cancers with specific genetic abnormalities.
