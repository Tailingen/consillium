HylaCare in the Treatment of Acute Skin Changes in Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer
This will be a randomized, double blind, vehicle-controlled evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of HylaCareTM. The study will employ the patient as her own control, a commonly used method for the evaluation of topical dermatologic agents. Each patient will be randomized blindly as to whether the study serum will be applied to the medial or lateral portion of the treated breast, using the nipple as the dividing line. The product and placebo will also be applied to the contra-lateral breast in the same fashion, as a further control. The study drug and placebo will be applied three (3) times daily.

Acute Skin Toxicity Per NCI-CTC v4.0, NCI-CTC (National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria) version 4.0 was used to assessed acute skin toxicity grade by physician. Toxicity grade range from Grade 0 to Grade 5, with higher grade indicating worst skin toxicity., Week 5 during radiation therapy|Acute Skin Toxicity Per NCI-CTC v4.0, NCI-CTC(National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria) version 4.0 was used to assessed acute skin toxicity grade by physician.

Acute Skin Toxicity, as Measured by Number of Participants With Skin Reactions, Acute skin toxicity, as measured by number of participants with skin reactions via self assessment, Week 5 during radiation therapy
Patients will be allocated to the treatment using a randomized permuted block. There will be no stratification. Patients will be randomized to receive the investigational product to be applied to either the medial (inside) or lateral (outside) portion of the breast, a placebo product will be used on the other side. Patients and clinical investigators will be blinded to the treatment assignments.
