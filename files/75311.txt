(HARBOR) Study to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of BLU-263 Versus Placebo in Patients With Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2/3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of elenestinib (BLU-263) + symptom directed therapy (SDT) with placebo + SDT in participants with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by SDT. Parts 1 and 2 will enroll participants with ISM. Participants enrolled in Part 2 will roll over onto Part 3 to receive treatment with elenestinib in an open-label fashion following completion of the earlier Part. Part K will enroll participants with ISM who have previously received an approved selective KIT inhibitor. The study also includes pharmacokinetic (PK) groups that will enroll participants with ISM.
