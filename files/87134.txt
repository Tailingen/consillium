A Study of OMP-313M32 in Subjects With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of OMP-31M32 as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab. OMP-313M32 is an experimental anti-TIGIT antibody that was developed to block TIGIT from binding PVR allowing the body's T-cells to destroy cancer cells.
Locally Advanced Cancer|Metastatic Cancer
DRUG: OMP-313M32|DRUG: Nivolumab
Incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), The Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) will be determined in patients treated with OMP-313M32 in combination with nivolumab, Subjects will be assessed for DLTs through the end of the first cycle (Days 1-29)|Incidence of treatment emergent adverse events, Percentage of patients with adverse events, up to approximately 2 years
Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures (AUC) - Phase 1a, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be evaluated, 1st dose and 4th dose: pre-dose, post-infusion, and 1, 3, 7 and 10 days. All other doses: pre-dose, 15 minutes and 7 days post-infusion. PK sample will be taken at treatment termination and every 4 wks for 12 wks.|Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures (AUC) - Phase 1b, Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be evaluated, 1st dose and 4th dose: pre-dose and 15 minutes post-infusion. All other doses: pre-dose. PK sample will be taken at treatment termination and every 4 wks for 12 wks.|Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures (T1/2) - Phase 1a, The half life (T1/2) of OMP-313M32 will be assessed, 1st dose and 4th dose: pre-dose, post-infusion, and 1, 3, 7 and 10 days. All other doses: pre-dose, 15 minutes and 7 days post-infusion. PK sample will be taken at treatment termination and every 4 wks for 12 wks.|Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures (T1/2) - Phase 1b, The half life (T1/2) of OMP-313M32 will be assessed, 1st dose and 4th dose: pre-dose and 15 minutes post-infusion. All other doses, pre-dose.PK sample will be taken at treatment termination and every 4 wks for 12 wks.|Immunogenicity of OMP-313M32, Percentage of patients with anti-OMP-313M32 antibodies assessed, up to approximately 2 years|Objective Response, Measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), up to approximately 2 years|Progression-free survival, Measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), approximately 2 years
This is an open-label, Phase 1a/b dose escalation study of OMP-31M32 administered as a single agent or in combination with nivolumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This study consists of a screening period, a treatment period and a post-treatment follow-up period in which patients will be followed for survival for up to 2 years. Subjects will be enrolled in two stages in the Phase 1a (dose escalation and expansion) and one stage in the Phase 1b (dose escalation).
