Eltrombopag in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) Patients With Thrombocytopenia
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag in people who have myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with thrombocytopenia who have progressed or are resistant to decitabine or azacitidine. (These are the only 2 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \[FDA\] which can improve platelet counts). The investigators (the study doctor, study staff, and sponsor) want to find out what effects, good or bad, eltrombopag (study drug) may have on people with low platelet counts due to MDS. The investigators will also be testing how well eltrombopag may work at different doses in these diseases.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)|Thrombocytopenia
DRUG: Eltrombopag
Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of eltrombopag for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in participants with MDS who have either progressed or are resistant to Hypomethylating Agents (HMTA). The MTD is defined as the highest dose where less than 33% of participants experience a drug related predefined dose limited toxicity (DLT)., 24 months
Study was originally designed as a Phase I/II but was terminated during the Phase I portion due to lack of efficacy
