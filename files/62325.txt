Endoscopic Multispectral Imaging for the Early Detection of Barrett's Neoplasia
The overall objective of this pilot study is to determine whether multispectral imaging increases the diagnostic accuracy of the current standard of high-definition white-light endoscopy for the detection of Barrett's-associated neoplasia (high grade dysplasia or cancer). The investigators goal is to develop a multispectral endoscopic platform that can be used to survey a large surface area and, potentially, serve as a 'red flag' for microendoscopic imaging of small areas. The goal of this pilot study is to preliminarily determine the accuracy of these modalities during the endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus.
