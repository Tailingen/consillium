In-office Hysteroscopic Laser Ablation for Symptomatic Submucous Uterine Fibroids
To evaluate feasibility and efficacy of in-office hysteroscopic ablation of submucous uterine fibroid using diode laser
Laser Hysteroscopic Ablation of Submucous Myoma
DEVICE: hysteroscopic ablation of submucous uterine fibroid using diode laser
Bleeding, improvement of the heavy menstrual bleeding, before the procedure and at 3 months follow up visit
fibroid volume reduction, measure by US the reduction of the myoma size, before the procedure and at 3 months follow up visit|changes on the myoma vascularity, measure by 3D US Doppler Color, before the procedure and at 3 months follow up visit
A pilot study was conducted between January 2018 and January 2019 in a tertiary care university hospital. Patients with at least one symptomatic, class 0-2 of FIGO classification, uterine fibroid of â‰¤ 7cm in size were eligible for inclusion. Evaluation of the changes in fibroid size and vascularity was performed using 3D Doppler ultrasonography. Vaporization of the fibroid core was conducted using a 1470nm wavelength diode laser inserted through the hysteroscope's working channel. Primary outcome was the evaluation of the fibroid volume before and at 2 months after the procedure.
