B-catenin in Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Its Mimickers
Examine the role of B-catenin in differentiation of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma from other lesions that may be similar to it
Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
BIOLOGICAL: Immunohistochemical staining
Detection of B-catenin expression in cutanous squamous cell carcinoma and its mimickers, Detection of expression of B-catenin in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and its mimickers by immunohistochemical procedures using antihuman B-catenin monoclonal antibodies, 6 month
Skin cancer is one of the most common form of cancer worldwide. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is one of most common skin tumers that caused by many factors as ultra violet ,ionizing radiation and others . It was an advanced spectrum ranging from actinic keratosis to invasive and metastatic squmous cell carcinoma. Correct identification of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is a challenge as it has both clinically and histopathologically mimickers.

So the aim of this study is to identify the expression of B-catenin in cutaneous Squamous cell carcinoma and its mimickers.
