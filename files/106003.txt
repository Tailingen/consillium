FeASibility of Cbct-guIded ONline Adaptive RadioThErapy
The accuracy of radiotherapy can be increased by correcting for geometric uncertainties and changes between radiotherapy fractions. These corrections are currently done with online adaptive treatment on a specialized linear accelerator (linac) for a small subset of patients. However, patients currently treated on a standard linac could also benefit from online adaptive radiotherapy. The objective is to determine the feasibility of online CBCT-guided adaptive radiation therapy on a standard Elekta linac.

DEVICE: online CBCT-guided adaptive radiation therapy using a new software
Feasibility: successful application of the online adaptive treatment in 90% of 20 patients, The adaptive treatment is feasible if the technique is successfully ap-plied in 90% of 20 patients., From first fraction until the last fraction, an average of 20-35 fractions
Safety: Treatment associated ≥ grade 3 acute toxicity according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5.0)., Treatment associated ≥ grade 3 acute toxicity according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5.0)., From Baseline until 3 months after the last radiotherapy fraction
