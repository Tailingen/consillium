Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in Patients With Grade 1 and Grade 2 Advanced GEP-NET
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of \[177Lu\]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus octreotide long-acting release (LAR) versus octreotide LAR alone in newly diagnosed patients with somatostatin receptor positive (SSTR+), well differentiated Grade1 and Grade 2 (G1 and G2) (Ki-67 \<10%) advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) with high disease burden
