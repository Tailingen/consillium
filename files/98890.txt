Detecting Transitional Cell Carcinoma From Haematuria
To validate ELISAs for the detection of urinary tissue factor (TF) in patients suspected of having bladder cancer.
Transitional Cell Carcinoma
Specificity and sensitivity of the ELISAs when compared to standard cystoscopy., To examine the specificity and sensitivity of the ELISAs, compared to cystoscopy, in urine samples from patients presenting with gross or microscopic haematuria. The assays will provide measurements of the TF isoform concentrations present in patient urine samples, and the information on a subsequent diagnosis (or non-diagnosis) of a urothelial cancer will be obtained through reference to medical records., Outcome measure will be assessed by 6 months after trial completion.
Positive and negative predictive values of the ELISAs when compared to standard cystoscopy., To determine the positive and negative predictive values of the ELISAs, compared to cystoscopy, in urine samples from patients presenting with gross or microscopic haematuria., Outcome measure will be assessed by 6 months after trial completion.
The effective diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), the most common form of bladder cancer, is often quite challenging, due to a lack of disease-specific symptoms. Detecting TCC early is crucial to increase the chances of a cure. Cystoscopy, which is currently the standard test used for urothelial cancer diagnosis, is an invasive and relatively expensive procedure but, while several potential markers in urine have been studied with the goal of replacing cystoscopy, no urinary marker alone or in combination with others has shown sufficient accuracy.

In this study, levels of tissue factor (TF) isoforms will be measured by ELISA in urine samples collected from patients referred to the haematuria clinic with visible or microscopic haematuria. These values will be linked to the subsequent diagnosis of each patient, and used to assess the accuracy of the ELISAs in detecting TCC when compared to standard cystoscopy.
