Fractionated Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin Followed by Non-engraftment Donor Leukocyte Infusions for Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study includes patients with relapsed acute leukemia who have previously been treated with standard treatment that is still present and there is no curative treatment option available. Researchers are studying whether the drug Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin, followed by an infusion of blood cells called leukocytes from a donor, can stimulate the immune system to potentially fight the leukemia. Gemtuzmab ozogamicin is a class of drugs known as an antibody drug conjugate. The drug is given on days 1,4,7. It is infused, attaches to cells with a certain marker on the surface (the majority of which would be leukemia cells). The drug is then internalized and the chemotherapy drug becomes activated. Gemtuzumab is currently FDA approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

The infusion of leukocytes to stimulate the immune system to fight your leukemia is investigational and has not been proven to cure cancer. This combination of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin and donor leukocytes is not an FDA approved treatment and is investigational.

Initially a total of 6 patients will be included in the study to assess the safety of the treatment. Once 6 patients have been treated and no unacceptable toxicities are seen, more patients will be enrolled. The study will treat up to 18 patients on the study.
