A Study of CM336 in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1/2 study in China to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of CM336 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

This study consists of a dose escalation part (Phase 1) and a dose extension part (Phase 2 ).

The safety and tolerability of CM336 will be evaluated in Phase 1 study, as well as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose level for Phase 2 study will be determined.

The efficacy of CM336 will be evaluated in Phase 2 study.
