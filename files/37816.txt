Feasibility of the ETOILE program, number of patients which joined the programme compared to number of patients referred, 6 months
This is a pilot feasibility study, of the quasi-experimental before-after, non-randomized, mono-centric type. Feasibility is assessed on process criteria (adoption, reach implementation, satisfaction). Intermediate effectiveness is assessed on the skill level of patients and their caregivers, before, after and at a distance from education. Patients' anxiety levels will also be assessed before, after and at a distance from the program. The level of health literacy will be assessed at the start of the study.
