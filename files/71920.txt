Support Through Remote Observation and Nutrition Guidance (STRONG) Program for Pancreatic Cancer Patients
The purpose of the study is to assess the feasibility and participant satisfaction with the Support through Remote Observation and Nutrition Guidance (STRONG) program. The program provides enhanced dietician access and nutrition support for participants living with pancreatic cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.
Pancreatic Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: Consultations with Moffitt Dietician|BEHAVIORAL: Daily Food Intake Diary with Fitbit Smartphone application|BEHAVIORAL: Questionnaires
Feasibility of the STRONG Program, Feasibility of the Support through Remote Observation and Nutrition Guidance (STRONG) program will be assessed using recruitment and retention rates, along with data completion rates., at 12 weeks|Acceptability of the STRONG Program, Acceptability of the STRONG Program measure uses 4 items to indicate participant satisfaction. The measure uses a scale of 0-5, 0 meaning the participant completely disagrees with the statements regarding intervention satisfaction and 5 indicating complete agreement with the statements regarding intervention satisfaction. The measure score ranges from 0-20 with 20 indicating the highest degree of satisfaction., at 16 weeks|Participant adherence to the STRONG Program, will be defined as ≥ 60% of patients will meet with a dietician for 4/6 dietician visits and ≥ 60% of patients will track daily food intake via a Fitbit., Up to 90 days|Malnutrition: Significant Weight Loss, Significant weight loss will be defined as a loss of \>5% and \>10% of body weight over the 16 week assessment period. Weight will be measured in kg., at 16 weeks|Malnutrition: Low BMI, Low BMI will be calculated by combining weight (kg) and height measurements (m²) and defined as \<20kg/m² for adults \< 70 years old and \<22kg/m² for adults ≥ 70 years old over the 16 week assessment period., at 16 weeks|Malnutrition: Low Skeletal Muscle Mass, Low skeletal muscle mass will be calculated by estimating skeletal muscle index (SMI) by dividing the cross-sectional area of muscle in a single 'slice' from an abdominal CT scan (cm2) by stature (square of height in m²). Low SMI will be defined as ≤38.9 cm2/m2 for females and ≤55.4 for males over the 16 week assessment period., at 16 weeks
