Lymphadenectomy in Early Ovarian Cancer
To assess the impact of comprehensive staging surgery with no lymphadenectomy on survival and quality of life in patients with early-stage ovarian cancer.

OBJECTIVES: Compare the efficacy and safety in patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA -IIA epithelial ovarian cancer, undergo completion staging surgery including systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy versus comprehensive staging surgery without lymphadenectomy.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized phase III multicenter study. Patients will receive comprehensive staging surgery without Lymphadenectomy or completion staging surgery including systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, and the adjuvant chemotherapy will accord to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Patients are followed up every 3 months within the first 2 years, and then every 6 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 656 patients will be recruited for this study within 5 years.
