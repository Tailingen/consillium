Image-Guided Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Shoulder, Arm, Hip, or Leg
RATIONALE: Image-guided radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a lower dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well image-guided radiation therapy works in treating patients with primary soft tissue sarcoma of the shoulder, arm, hip, or leg.

The CTCAE v3.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE., 2 years after start of treatment (+/- 3 months)|Percentage of Patients With Wound Complications, Estimate rate of patients with acute wound complications with 95% confidence interval assuming binomial distribution., From date of surgery to 4 months post-surgery|Pattern of First Failure, Pattern of first failure including local failure (in-field, marginal, and outside-field failure), regional failure, distant failure, and death without disease progression., From registration to date of local, regional or distant progression. Report at time of primary outcome measure analysis.|Mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Rating Scale (MSTS) by Late Radiation Morbidity at Two Years, The Musculoskeletal Tumor Rating Scale (MSTS) is a measure of physical function across 7 items, completed by the physician (preferably by the Orthopedic Surgeon or Surgical Oncologist) or the physician's designated staff. The 7 items are: pain, range of motion, strength, joint stability, joint deformity, emotional, acceptance, and overall function. Each item is scored from 0-5 (worst possible to best possible condition). The item scores are summed to get the total score which ranges from 0-35.

Late radiation morbidity is defined as ≥ grade 2 lymphedema, subcutaneous fibrosis, or joint stiffness. Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v3.0. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE v3.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild AE, Grade 2 Moderate AE, Grade 3 Severe AE, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 Death related to AE., From start of treatment to 2 years.|Percentage of Patients With Other CTCAE, v.3.0 Grade 3-5 Adverse Events, Adverse events are graded using CTCAE v3.0.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To determine the effect of reduced radiation volume using image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) on lymphedema ≥ grade 2, subcutaneous fibrosis, and joint stiffness at 2 years in patients with primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity.

Secondary

* To estimate the rates of other grade 3-5 adverse events as measured by Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v3.0.
* To determine the pattern of first failure, including local failure (in-field, marginal, and outside-field failure), regional failure, distant failure, and death without disease progression.
* To estimate the rates of local failure, local-regional failure, distant failure, distant disease-free survival, disease-free survival, overall survival, and second primary tumor.
* To estimate the rate of wound complications.
* To correlate the degree of late radiation morbidity (defined as any lymphedema, subcutaneous fibrosis, or joint stiffness) at 2 years with scores on the clinical measure, Musculoskeletal Tumor Rating Scale (MSTS).

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

* Neoadjuvant radiotherapy: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups (group 1 closed to accrual as of 01/08/10).

  * Group 1 (closed to accrual as of 01/08/10): Patients undergo 3-D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated therapy (IMRT) once daily, 5 days a week, for 4½-5 weeks. Patients also receive up to 6 courses of neoadjuvant, adjuvant, concurrent, or interdigitated chemotherapy.
  * Group 2: Patients undergo 3D-CRT or IMRT once daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks.
* Surgery: At 4-8 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant radiotherapy, patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor. Patients with positive tumor margins (residual tumor) undergo intraoperative radiotherapy boost or proceed to adjuvant radiotherapy within 2 weeks after surgery.
* Adjuvant radiotherapy: Patients undergo either external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) once daily for 8 fractions or brachytherapy.

After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
