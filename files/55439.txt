A Study of RC48-ADC in Subjects With Advanced Breast Cancer
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of RC48-ADC for injection in subjects with advanced breast cancer with HER2 positive or HER2 low expression
Advanced Breast Cancer
DRUG: RC48-ADC 1.5 mg/kg (HER2 Positive)|DRUG: RC48-ADC 2.0 mg/kg (HER2 Positive)|DRUG: RC48-ADC 2.5 mg/kg (HER2 Positive)|DRUG: RC48-ADC 2.0 mg/kg (HER2 Low Expression)
RP2D, Recommended Phase II Dose, Estimated 2 year
Cmax, Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration, Estimated 2 year|AUC, Area Under Curve, Estimated 2 year|Tmax, Time for Cmax, Estimated 2 year|Overall response Rate (ORR), As per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 - to estimate the anti-tumor activity of RC48-ADC., Estimated 2 year|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR), Clinical Benefit Rate was defined as the percentage of patients with complete remission (CR) partial remission (PR) stable (SD) not less than 4 months., Estimated 2 year|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival (PFS) (median) was determined using the number of months measured from the initial date of treatment to the date of documented progression, or the date of death (in the absence of progression) of participants. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions., Estimated 2 year
