Real-Time Optical Biopsy in Improving Lung Cancer Diagnosis in Patients Undergoing Lung Biopsy
This pilot early phase I trial studies how well real-time optical biopsy works in improving lung cancer diagnosis in patients undergoing lung biopsy. Real-time optical biopsy using confocal microscopy may improve the ability of physicians to diagnose lung cancer and accurately differentiate cancerous and benign lesions found during computed tomography screening.

Diagnosis of ex vivo tissue samples for lung cancer or benign lesions using optical microscopy, The aim is to show that it is possible to distinguish lung cancer from benign lesions in ex vivo tissue samples using optical microscopy., At the time of biopsy|Imaging of ex vivo tissue samples using an endoscopic instrument, A proof-of-concept endoscopic instrument will be tested for imaging through a biopsy needle under computed tomography guidance on ex vivo tissue samples., At the time of biopsy
PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Show that it is possible to distinguish lung cancer from benign lesions in ex vivo tissue samples using optical microscopy.

II. Test a proof-of-concept endoscopic instrument for imaging through a biopsy needle under computed tomography (CT) guidance on ex vivo tissue samples.

OUTLINE:

Patients undergo extraction of up to 3 additional lung biopsies from target lesions that are at least 2-3 cm in diameter using the 19 gauge SuperCore biopsy needle or the 20 gauge Rotax needle. The extracted tissue is imaged via confocal fluorescence microscopy using a variety of fluorescent contrast agents, such as, fluorescein sodium, methylene blue, or indocyanine green and then undergo hematoxylin and eosin processing.
