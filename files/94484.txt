Leuplin SR 11.25 mg Injection Kit Specified Drug-use Survey "Long-term Use Survey in Prostate Cancer Patients (96 Weeks)"
The purpose of this survey is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term use (96 weeks) of leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 milligram (mg) injection kit (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg injection kit) in prostate cancer participants in daily medical practice.
Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Leuprorelin acetate
Number of Participants Reporting One or More Adverse Drug Reactions, Adverse drug reactions are defined as adverse events (AEs) which are in the investigator's opinion of causal relationship to the study treatment. AEs are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product reported from the first dose of study drug to the last dose of study drug., Baseline up to Week 96|Number of Participants Reporting One or More Serious Adverse Drug Reactions, Serious adverse drug reactions are defined as serious adverse events (SAE) which are in the investigator's opinion of causal relationship to the study treatment. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly., Baseline up to Week 96
Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on TNM Classification, PFS was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to documented disease progression or death on study. For participants who experienced no disease progression and did not die while on study, data were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate PFS. TNM classification based on tumor size, if cancer cells had spread to nearby lymph nodes (LN), or distant metastasis. Stages included: stage 0(no evidence of cancer cells),stage 1(T1N0M0), stage IIA(T0N1M0, T1N1M0, T2N0M0), stage IIB(T2N1M0, T3N0M0), stage IIIA(T0N2M0, T1N2M0, T2N3M0, T3N1orN2M0),stage IIIb( T4 anyNM0, any TN3M0),stage IIIC(any TN3M0), stage IV(any T any NM1), where T0=early form of tumor, T1=\<2 centimeter (cm), T2=2-5 cm, T3=\>2 cm, T4=large sized, N0=not spread to LN, N1=spread to 1 to 3,N2=spread to 4 to 9,N3=spread \>10 axillary LN, M0=no metastasis, M1= Metastasis., Baseline up to 96 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Overall Survival (OS) Based on TNM Classification, OS was defined as the duration from randomization to death (due to any cause). Probability of OS was reported using Kaplan-Meier method. TNM classification based on tumor size, if cancer cells had spread to nearby lymph nodes (LN), or distant metastasis. Stages included: stage 0(no evidence of cancer cells),stage 1(T1N0M0), stage IIA(T0N1M0, T1N1M0, T2N0M0), stage IIB(T2N1M0, T3N0M0), stage IIIA(T0N2M0, T1N2M0, T2N3M0, T3N1orN2M0),stage IIIb( T4 anyNM0, any TN3M0),stage IIIC(any TN3M0), stage IV(any T any NM1), where T0=early form of tumor, T1=\<2 centimeter (cm), T2=2-5 cm, T3=\>2 cm, T4=large sized, N0=not spread to LN, N1=spread to 1 to 3,N2=spread to 4 to 9,N3=spread \>10 axillary LN, M0=no metastasis, M1= Metastasis., Baseline up to 96 weeks or death (which ever occurs first)|Percentage of Participants With Metastasis-free Survival, Baseline up to 96 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Disease-specific Survival, Disease-specific survival is defined as time interval between the date of randomization and the earliest date of local, regional or distant relapse, or death due to cancer., Baseline up to 96 weeks
This survey was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term use (96 weeks) of leuprorelin acetate 3 months depot injection kit (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg Injection Kit) in prostate cancer participants in daily medical practice.

For adults, 11.25 mg of leuprorelin acetate is usually administered subcutaneously once every 12 weeks. Prior to injection, the plunger rod of the syringe is pushed upward with the needle pointed upward, allowing the entire suspension fluid contained to be transferred to the powder. The powder is then fully suspended in the fluid while ensuring that bubbles are not generated.
