Immunotherapy With Ipilimumab and Nivolumab Preceded or Not by a Targeted Therapy With Encorafenib and Binimetinib
This is a multicenter, 2-arm open-label, randomized comparative phase II study. The objective of this trial is to prospectively evaluate whether a sequential approach with an induction period of 12 weeks with encorafenib + binimetinib followed by combination immunotherapy with nivolumab + ipilimumab improves progression free survival compared to combination immunotherapy nivolumab + ipilimumab alone in patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
Unresectable Stage III Melanoma|Stage IV Melanoma
DRUG: Nivolumab + Ipilimumab|DRUG: Encorafenib + Binimetinib
Progression Free Survival (PFS), PRS is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first date of progression, or until date of death (whatever the cause), whichever occurs first. Progression will be assessed according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1), 4.1 years from first patient in
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death, whatever the cause., 6 years from first patient in|Complete Response (CR) rate, CR will be assessed according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1), 4.1 years from first patient in|Time to Complete Response (CR), Time to CR is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the occurrence of first CR., 4.1 years from first patient in|Duration of Complete Response (CR), Duration of CR will be measured from the time measurement criteria for CR are first met until the first date that recurrence is objectively documented., 4.1 years from first patient in|Best overall response rate, Best overall response will be assessed according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1), 4.1 years from first patient in|Time to best response, Time to best response is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the occurrence of the best response (CR or PR, whichever comes first). CR and PR will be assessed according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1), 4.1 years from first patient in|Duration of best response, Best response duration will be measured from the time measurement criteria for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) are first met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented. CR and PR will be assessed according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1), 4.1 years from first patient in|Occurrence of adverse events, This study will use the International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, for adverse event reporting., 4.1 years from first patient in|Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to second objective disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever first. The second objective disease progression will be assessed according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1), 4.1 years from first patient in
