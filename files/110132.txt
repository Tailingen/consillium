Body Composition During Cancer Treatment
The purpose of this study is to assess how bone density and body composition changes over a cancer patient's treatment via SOZO measurements, DEXA scan (bone density and whole body composition), performance status tests, food log, urine color test, and other study assessments. These assessments will begin after cancer diagnosis but prior to intervention, and continue during treatment and at post-treatment visits.
Cancer
DEVICE: SOZO Device|DEVICE: DEXA Scan
SOZO device can detect changes in body composition, Assess change in body composition from baseline to final visit, Up to 6 months
Correlate SOZO with 24-hour food recall., Assess correlation of SOZO measurements with 24-hour food recall., Up to 6 months|Correlate SOZO with DEXA scan, Assess correlation of SOZO measurements and DEXA scan (bone density with hip and spine measurements and whole body composition) results, Up to 6 months|Correlate SOZO with standard of care, Assess correlation of SOZO measurements with standard of care measurements, Up to 6 months|Detect changes in physical performance, Change from baseline in 6 minute walk test distance, Up to 6 months|Correlate SOZO with urine color test, Assess correlation of SOZO measurements with urine color test., Up to 6 months
This is an observational, prospective device use study. 50 subjects will be enrolled in the study. The study will look at the changes in the participants body composition as they go through cancer treatment using the SOZO device. The SOZO device is intended to estimate the following body composition parameters: Fluid status (TBW, ECF, ICF), Total body composition (fat free mass, fat mass, % of weight), Metabolic report (active tissue mass, extracellular mass, basal metabolic rate), Skeletal muscle mass, Phase angle, Body mass index (BMI), Weight, and Hydration index (Hy-Dex) analysis. Participants will have 5 study visits during the course of their cancer treatment where SOZO measurements will be taken as well as other study measurements.
