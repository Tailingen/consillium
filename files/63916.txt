Pembrolizumab Concurrent With and Following Carbon-ion Radiotherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Adenocarcinoma
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if pembrolizumab works for cervical adenocarcinoma treat with concurrent chemo-carbon-ion radiaotherapy (CIRT).

The main questions it aims to answer are:

• Does concurrent chemo-CIRT with pembrolizumab improves 2-year progression-free survival (PFS), compared with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with conventional X-rays?
Cervical Adenocarcinoma|Cervical Adenosquamous Carcinoma
DRUG: Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®)
Progression-free survival (PFS), It is based on the investigator's RECIST 1.1 assessment, or in the absence of imaging evidence of disease progression based on RECIST 1.1, histologically confirmed PD, after concurrent chemo-CIRT with pembrolizumab., At 2 years after the start of trial treatment
Overall survival (OS), To evaluate the 2-year overall survival after concurrent chemo-CIRT with pembrolizumab., At 2 years after the start of trial treatment|Complete response (CR) rate, To evaluate the complete response (CR) rate, defined as the maximum response of the primary tumor based on RECIST 1.1 assessment at 6 months after initiation of CIRT., At 6 months after the start of trial treatment|Local control (LC), To evaluate the 2-year local control (LC) after concurrent chemo-CIRT with pembrolizumab., At 2 years after the start of trial treatment|Acute and late toxicities, To evaluate the acute and late toxicities of concurrent chemo-CIRT with pembrolizumab., Acute (≤ 90 days) and late toxicities (> 90 days) over 2 years after the start of trial treatment.
