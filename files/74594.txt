A Study Evaluating IPI-926 in Combination With Gemcitabine in Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
Study IPI-926-03 is a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate IPI 926 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. Phase 1b is designed as a dose escalation study. Once the maximum tolerated dose of IPI-926 in combination with gemcitabine is established in the Phase 1b portion of the study, the Phase 2 portion will commence.

Phase 2 is designed as a randomized, double-blind (investigator/patient), placebo-controlled study. There is no cross-over option for patients in either arm of the Phase 2 (i.e., there is no option for patients receiving placebo to cross-over to IPI-926).
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: IPI-926 plus gemcitabine|DRUG: Placebo plus gemcitabine
Evaluation of safety profile including MTD, To determine the safety profile, including maximum tolerated dose, of IPI-926 plus gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer., Once per week for 3 weeks of a 4 week cycle|Overall survival comparison, * To compare the overall survival (OS) of patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with IPI-926 plus gemcitabine or placebo plus gemcitabine.
* To evaluate the safety of IPI-926 plus gemcitabine or placebo plus gemcitabine., An average of 6 months
Measurement of the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC0-t) of IPI-926 and gemcitabine., - To evalutate pharmacokinetics (PK) of IPI-926, gemcitabine, and their relevant metabolites., During the 3rd week of the first 4 week cycle|Comparison of PFS, TTP and ORR, - To compare the progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and overall response rate (ORR) of patients treated with IPI-926 plus gemcitabine or placebo plus gemcitabine., An average of 6 months
IPI 926 is an inhibitor of the Hedgehog Pathway. IPI-926 in combination with gemcitabine may improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer. Infinity is conducting a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IPI-926 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer.
