Reconstructions With Back Donor Site Flaps and Validation of Quality of Life Scales
The latissimus dorsi flap is the oldest and most used technique for breast reconstruction. Nonetheless, there are few studies evaluation the long-term effect of harvesting one of the muscles of the back. This project has four parts.

1. Validation of scales/instrument for Swedish.
2. Long-term results after reconstruction with latissimus dorsi- a ten year retrospective follow-up.
3. Thoracodorsal artery perforator flap (TDAP) vs latissimus dorsi flap- a randomized controlled trial - breast reconstruction.
4. TDAP vs Limber flap - a randomized controlled trial- reconstruction of axillary hidradenitis suppurativa.
Breast Cancer
PROCEDURE: Latissimus dorsi flap|PROCEDURE: Thoracodorsal artery perforator flap to breast|PROCEDURE: Deep inferior epigastric perforator flap
Patient satisfaction and breast-related quality of life after breast reconstruction, Breast Q reconstruction.The BREAST-Q has multiple domains, each scored from 0 to 100 (higher scores indicate greater satisfaction or quality of life), there is no overall BREAST-Q score., 10 years|Back and shoulder function after breast reconstruction, Breast Q the back and shoulder function scale. The scale is scored from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Higher scores reflect a better outcome., 10 years|Back appearance after breast reconstruction, Breast-Q the back appearance scale.The scale is scored from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Higher scores reflect a better outcome., 10 years|Shoulder function after breast reconstruction, Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the shoulder index (WOOS) provides scores on four domains: (1) physical symptoms; (2) sport, recreation, and work; (3) lifestyle; and (4) emotions.Each question has a possible score from 0-100 giving a total score up to 1900. The highest or most symptomatic score is 1900 and the best or asymptomatic score is 0., 10 years|Abdominal satisfaction after breast reconstruction, Breast Q abdominal satisfaction and abdominal well-being.The scale is scored from 0 (worst) to 100, 10 years
Complications after breast reconstruction, Measured in patients randomized to TDAP or latissimus dorsi flap., 2 years
Validation of Breast Q: The Back Appearance scale for Swedish, Translation and validation of the instrument for Swedish, 1 year|Validation of Breast-Q: The back and shoulder function scale for Swedish, Translation and validation of the instrument for Swedish, 1 year|Normal material for Breast-Q, Measurement of quality of life according to breast-Q in a normative population, 5 years|Normal material for Breast-Q back appearance scale, Measurement of quality of life according to breast-Q back appaearance scale in a normative population, 5 years|Normal material for Breast-Q back and shoulder function scale, Measurement of quality of life according to breast-Q back and shoulder function scale in a normative population, 5 years
