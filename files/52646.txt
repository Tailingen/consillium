Sorafenib VS TACE in HCC Patients With Portal Vein Invasion
The investigators are going to compare the therapeutic effect of sorafenib and transarterial chemoembolization in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with major branch of portal vein invasion.

TACE is an established therapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has been shown to significantly improve survival in these patients compared to no treatment. Moreover, TACE can be performed safely and may improve the overall survival of patients with HCC and major branch of portal vein invasion. Sorafenib, already approved for HCC, could lead to significantly improvement in tumor control and survival in patients with advanced stage HCC. So far there are no head to head comparison reports about the efficacy of Sorafenib and TACE. Here the investigators evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib and TACE in advanced HCC with major branch of portal vein invasion.
