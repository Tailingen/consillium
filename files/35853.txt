Obinutuzumab in Combination With Lenalidomide in Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma in Real World Study
This study is planned to prospectively observe and verify the efficacy and safety of induction therapy with obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide followed by maintenance therapy with obinutuzumab and lenalidomide in patients with R/R FL in a real-world setting in a Chinese population.

Available data have shown that the combination of obinutuzumab and lenalidomide has shown good efficacy and safety in patients with R/R FL, but the efficacy and safety in Chinese patients remain to be verified.

This study is planned to prospectively observe and verify the efficacy and safety of induction therapy with obinutuzumab in combination with lenalidomide followed by maintenance therapy with obinutuzumab and lenalidomide in patients with R/R FL in a real-world setting in a Chinese population.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* To assess the ORR in the R/R FL patient population treated with the combination of obinutuzumab and lenalidomide
* To assess CRR, PFS, EFS, DOR, OS, and safety in patients with R/R FL treated with the combination of obinutuzumab and lenalidomide

Participants in this study will not and should not result in any intervention to the patient's treatment and visits. All treatments and visits for patients will be at the physician's discretion according to clinical practice
