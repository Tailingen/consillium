Myo-inositol Therapy on the Dynamics of Embryo Development in Patients Suffering From PCOS Undergoing ICSI Treatment
The purpose of this study is to analyse the activity of myo-inositol on pregnancy rate, embryo development dynamics and oestradiol and progesterone concentration in blood serum and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and catalase concentration in follicular fluid of patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) undergoing Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI).
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome|Infertility
DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Inofolic: myo-inositol and folic acid
Oestradiol (E2) level in blood serum (pg/ml), Between 11th and 19th day of cycle, when the largest of the oocyte in the evaluation of ultrasound exceeded 17mm diameter,|Progesterone (ng/ml) level in blood serum, Between 11th and 19th day of cycle, when the largest of the oocyte in the evaluation of ultrasound exceeded 17mm diameter|Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity level in follicular fluid (mIU/mg), The decision was taken when three conditions are met: the biggest oocyte exceeds 17mm, the endometrium was over 9mm (two layers) and estradiol level was greater than 150, On puncture day or on collection day of oocytes, in practice, between 11th and 19th day of cycle|Catalase activity level in follicular fluid (mIU/mg), The decision was taken when three conditions are met: the biggest oocyte exceeds 17mm, the endometrium was over 9mm (two layers) and estradiol level was greater than 150, On puncture day or on collection day of oocytes, in practice, between 11th and 19th day of cycle
Period of blastocyst and embryo development, Embryo culture was evaluated by means of constant monitoring performed in 10-minute intervals with a camera placed inside the incubator.The t0 time was described as the hour of the ICSI. tF was defined as the first moment when pronuclei were already visible, whereas tC as the last moment of their visibility. The moment when a single cell embryo appeared after syngamy was determined as t1, and then the superseding divisions were marked as t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8. tM stood for the beginning of morula formation, whereas tB was the time during which the first signs of blastocyst cavity could be seen., From the moment of puncture, between the 11th and 19th day of the cycle, for a maximum of seven days|Pregnancy rate, Ultrasound examination of the echo of the embryo and heart rate, During the 7th week of pregnancy
The purpose of this study is to analyse the activity of myo-inositol on pregnancy rate, embryo development dynamics and oestradiol and progesterone concentration in blood serum and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and catalase concentration in follicular fluid of patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) undergoing Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI).
