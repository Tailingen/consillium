This is a multicenter, expanded access program protocol to provide access to melflufen for patients with RRMM in medical need, who have progressive disease after they received a minimum of at least two prior lines of therapy, are triple-class refractory to at least one PI, at least one IMiD and at least one anti-CD38 mAb or intolerant to a specific therapeutic drug class. Patients with primary refractory MM are eligible to participate as long as they meet the criteria of being triple class refractory. They may meet these criteria for triple class refractory MM if they have received at least one PI, at least one IMiD, and at least one Anti-CD38 mAb in their first line treatment or have had at least 2 prior lines of therapy.
