A Study of PEP07 (Checkpoint Kinase 1 Inhibitor) in Patients With Advanced Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is

* To assess the safety and tolerability of PEP07 administered orally as a single dose and at escalating dose levels, and, to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of study treatment in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).
* To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PEP07 monotherapy.

Participants will receive PEP07 administered orally once daily (QD) for 2 consecutive days and 5 days off, every week for 4 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, confirmed pregnancy, death, consent withdrawal, HSCT or other anti-cancer treatment is required, or the Sponsor ends the study, whichever occurs first.

This is a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center study recruiting patients with R/R AML and MCL.

The study will utilize an Accelerated Titration Design in the lower dose levels followed by a traditional 3+3 dose escalation design at higher dose levels until RP2D is determined. The starting dose will be 40 mg.

All potential study candidates will provide informed consent and will undergo screening procedures before participating in the study. After a screening period of up to 28 days, qualified patients will be enrolled to receive their assigned dose regimen of PEP07 monotherapy.
