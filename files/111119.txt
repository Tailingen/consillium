COHORT Trial in Clinical Pelivc Lymph Node Metastatic Prostate Cancer
In local advanced prostate cancer patients with clinically positive metastatic regional lymph node, the optimal treatment is still unanswered. For these patients, radiotherapy combined with hormonal therapy or hormonal therapy alone are recommended. Recently, the reports from NCCB and SEER data showed that radiotherapy combined with hormonal therapy have better survivals than hormonal therapy alone.

This randomized phase III trial compare hormonal therapy alone with combined hormone with radiotherapy in clinically pelvic lymph node metastatic prostate cancer.
