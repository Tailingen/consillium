Chemosensitization With Plerixafor Plus G-CSF in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
This study is designed to test the combination of Plerixafor with G-CSF for chemosensitization in patients with relapsed or refractory AML.
Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute
DRUG: G-CSF|DRUG: Plerixafor|DRUG: Mitoxantrone|DRUG: Etoposide|DRUG: Cytarabine
Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose of Plerixafor Plus G-CSF When Combined With MEC, Completion of Phase I enrollment (17 months)|Phase II: Complete Response Rate (CR+CRi), * Morphologic complete remission (CR): Defined as morphologic leukemia-free state, including \<5% blasts in BM aspirate with marrow spicules and a count of \> 200 nucleated cells and no blasts with Auer rods, no persistent extramedullary disease, ANC \> 1,000/mm3, platelet count \> 100,000/mm3.
* Morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi): Defined as CR with the exception of neutropenia \<1,000/mm3 or thrombocytopenia \<100,000/mm3., 45 days
Phase I and Phase II: Safety and Tolerability of Regimen as Measured by Grade and Frequency of Adverse Events Exceeding 10% in Total Frequency, 30 days following end of treatment|Time to Hematologic Recovery as Measured by Time to Neutrophil Recovery, -Neutrophil recovery is defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \>= 500/mm\^3, Up to 62 days after treatment|Time to Hematologic Recovery as Measured by Time to Neutrophil Recovery, -Neutrophil recovery is defined as absolute neutrophil count \>= 1000/mm\^3, Up to 62 days after treatment|Time to Hematologic Recovery as Measured by Time to Platelet Recovery, -Platelet recovery is defined as platelets \>= 50,000/mm\^3, Up to 62 days after treatment|Time to Hematologic Recovery as Measured by Time to Platelet Recovery, -Platelet recovery is defined as platelets \>= 100,000/mm3, Up to 62 days after treatment|Characterize the Mobilization of Leukemic Cells With Plerixafor Plus G-CSF as Measured by Fold Change in White Blood Cells, 6 hours after plerixafor|Characterize the Mobilization of Leukemic Cells With Plerixafor Plus G-CSF as Measured by Fold Change in AML Blast Count, 6 hours after plerixafor|Characterize the Effects of Plerixafor Plus G-CSF on Fold Change in CXCR4 Clone 1D9 Relative Mean Fluorescent Intensity, 6 hours after plerixafor|Characterize the Effects of Plerixafor Plus G-CSF on Fold Change in CXCR4 Clone 12G5 Relative Mean Fluorescent Intensity, 6 hours after plerixafor|Time to Progression, Recurrence / morphologic relapse: Defined as reappearance of blasts in the blood or the finding of \> 5% blasts in the BM, not attributable to any other cause. New dysplastic changes are considered a relapse. If there are no blasts in the peripheral blood and 5-19% blasts in the BM, the BM biopsy and aspirate should be repeated in \> 1 week to confirm relapse., 2 years|Time to Treatment Failure, 8 days|Overall Survival, Overall survival: Defined as the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death from any cause., Median follow-up was 34.6 months
In this study, we are seeking to target the leukemia microenvironment to overcome disease resistance. We hypothesize that by disrupting the interaction of leukemic blasts with the bone marrow microenvironment, we may sensitize leukemic blasts to the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In this study, we seek to maximize blockage of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis through the following:

1. Addition of G-CSF, which down regulates SDF-1 expression and acts synergistically with plerixafor in stem cell mobilization
2. Intravenous instead of subcutaneous dosing of plerixafor to improve kinetics of administration.
3. Dose escalation of plerixafor and twice daily dosing to maintain maximum CXCR4 blockade.
