Maintenance Capecitabine Plus Best Supportive Care Versus Best Supportive Care for Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
This multicenter, randomised, phase 3 study is to evaluate the survival benefit of maintenance capecitabine plus best supportive care versus best supportive care for metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients after disease controlled with TPC palliative chemotherapy.
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma
DRUG: capecitabine|OTHER: Best supportive care (BSC)
progression-free survival, the time from randomization to the progression of disease, up to 6 years
overall survival, the time from randomization to death, up to 6 years|duration of response, the time from the date of the first cycle of chemotherapy to the progression of disease, up to 6 years|objective response rate, CR, PR and SD rate, up to 6 years|adverse effects, chemotherapy side effects, up to 6 years|quality of life of the patients during the Maintenance Capecitabine and/or Best Supportive Care, evaluate with FACT-H\&N every 3 months after randomiztion, up to 6 years
Firstly diagnosed metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients will receive 4-6 cycles of palliative chemotherapy with taxol,cisplatin and capecitabine. After disease controlled, they will be randomly assigned to maintenance capecitabine plus best supportive care(BSC) or BSC alone. The primary end point is progression-free survival, the secondary end points are overall survival, duration of response, objective response rate, adverse effects and quality of life.
