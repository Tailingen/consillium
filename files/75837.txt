Symptoms of anxiety, The PROMIS-Anxiety (PROMIS-A) is a validated PRO consisting of 8 questions measuring anxiety symptoms. The change in PROMIS-A score over time will be assessed (reduction indicates reduced anxiety)., 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study
Symptoms of depression, The PROMIS-Depression (PROMIS-D) is a validated PRO consisting of 8 questions measuring depression symptoms. The change in PROMIS-D score over time will be assessed (decrease indicates reduced depression)., 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Symptoms of emotional distress, Change in PROMIS Emotional Distress; a composite of PROMIS-Anxiety and PROMIS-Depression over time (decrease indicates reduced emotional distress)., 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Cancer-related symptoms of anxiety (intrusions), The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) is used to assess subjective distress caused by a stressful life event, which in this study is cancer. The change in the IES-R Intrusion subscale score over time will be assessed (decrease indicates reduced intrusive symptoms related to cancer)., 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Wellbeing and quality of life, The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) is designed to measure four domains of HRQOL in cancer patients: Physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being. The change in FACT-G scores over time will be assessed (increase indicates improved quality of life)., 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Stress management/coping skills, The Measure of Current Status (MOCS) Part A measures self-perceived status for using coping skills. The change in MOCS Part A scores over time will be assessed (increase indicates greater confidence in skill use ability)., 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Non-specific (social) intervention effects, The Measure of Current Status (MOCS) Part B assesses non-specific intervention effects - feelings of normalcy vs. alienation, sense of cohesiveness with other patients, perceptions of care from persons around them, and a sense of being better off than other cancer patients. The change in MOCS Part B scores over time will be assessed (increase indicates greater non-specific intervention effects)., 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Perceived stress, The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) measures how different situations affect feelings and perceived stress. The change in PSS scores over time will be assessed (higher PSS scores indicate higher perceived stress)., 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Benefit finding, The 17-item Benefit Finding Scale measures the perception that positive contributions were made to one's life by the experience of being diagnosed with and treated for cancer. Change in scores over time will be assessed (increase indicates increase in benefit finding)., 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study
Fear of cancer recurrence, The Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory - Short Form and the Fear of Cancer Recurrence single item measure assess the fear of cancer returning or progressing (higher scores indicate greater fear of cancer recurrence)., 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Healthcare utilization - visits and admissions, Number of visits and admissions (higher indicates greater healthcare utilization), 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Healthcare utilization - hospitalizations, Length of hospitalizations in days (higher indicates greater healthcare utilization), 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Healthcare utilization - medications, Number of medications (higher indicates greater healthcare utilization), 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study|Healthcare utilization - claims and costs, Number of healthcare claims and associated costs (higher indicates greater healthcare utilization), 3 and 6 months post RESTORE end-of-study
