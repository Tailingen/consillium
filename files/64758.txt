SURGE: Supporting UnderRepresented Minorities in Genomics-based Cancer Trial Enrollment (Intervention)
SURGE aims to increase equity in clinical trial enrollment by addressing barriers to genomic testing, which is increasingly needed to assess precision clinical trial eligibility and access standard precision therapies. The study is an interventional pilot meant primarily to assess the feasibility of the intervention. The intervention is comprised of a patient navigator, text message questionnaire, and informational video.
Gastrointestinal Cancer|Hematologic Cancer|Thoracic Cancer
BEHAVIORAL: SURGE
Genomic testing uptake, Intervention impact on rate of uptake of genomic testing, Up to 90 days of enrollment
Patient interaction with the intervention, Interaction with each component of the intervention (as appropriate by intervention arm), Up to 30 days of enrollment|Acceptability of questionnaire modality, We will use the System Usability Scale to measure usability of the questionnaire electronic tool. The 10-item System Usability Scale is scored on a five-point Likert scale, with 1 being Strongly Disagree and 5 being Strongly Agree., Up to 30 days of enrollment
Supporting UnderRepresented populations in Genomics-based cancer trial Enrollment (SURGE) is a multimodal intervention to address medical literacy and unmet social determinants of health (SDoH) needs as barriers to tumor somatic genomic testing consent among historically underrepresented patients (HUP) diagnosed with advanced solid or hematologic malignancies as a prerequisite to precision therapies and/or clinical trial eligibility. Our key hypothesis is that video-based education with or without 1:1 patient navigation will address medical literacy and unmet SDoH barriers, supporting HUP decision-making about genomic tumor consent. We will conduct a type 1 hybrid implementation effectiveness study among a cohort of HUP seeking medical oncology care at two academic and two community practice sites.
