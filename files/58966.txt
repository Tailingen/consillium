Pilot Study to Define the Immune Response Following Cryoablation of Invasive Breast Cancer
This study will investigate the safety, feasibility, and immune response associated with cryoablation of early invasive breast cancer prior to lumpectomy. Based on mouse models, the investigators believe that cryoablation will initiate a stronger immune response relative to the control group.

Consenting patients will be randomized to one of two arms: standard of care (control) or cryoablation (intervention). Participants will undergo a blood draw at the time of consent. Those in the control arm will continue with their standard of care lumpectomy. The intervention arm will receive cryoablation 2 weeks before their scheduled lumpectomy and undergo a second blood draw before the lumpectomy.
Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Breast
PROCEDURE: Cryoablation
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events [safety], Assessed via phone call with participant and including any participant-reported adverse events, such as pain, bruising, bleeding, swelling, and skin changes, 1 day after cryoablation|Immune response, Immunohistochemical analysis of biomarkers in blood and resected tissue, One week after lumpectomy|Cosmetic outcome, Change in appearance based on distortion and volume loss of the breast, Change from one month to one year after lumpectomy|Tumor margin status [effectiveness], Assessment of whether excised tumor's margins are positive or negative for cancer, and whether re-excision is required, 7-10 days after lumpectomy
