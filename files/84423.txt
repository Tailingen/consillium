A Study of Palbociclib in Combination With Bazedoxifene in Hormone Receptor Positive Breast Cancer
This research study is studying a drug called Palbociclib in combination with Bazedoxifene (a type of endocrine therapy, which prevents breast cancer cell growth by blocking estrogen stimulation) as a possible treatment for this diagnosis.

The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

* Palbociclib
* Bazedoxifene
Breast Cancer Stage IV|Unresectable Locally Advanced Invasive Breast Cancer|Metastatic Invasive Breast Cancer
DRUG: Palbociclib|DRUG: Bazedoxifene
Clinical Benefit Rate, Clinical Benefit Rate is the percentage of participants who achieve clinical benefit from the study treatment. Clinical benefit is defined as at least 24 weeks of confirmed Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or Stable Disease (SD).

SD or better is achieved if the following are true:

Target Lesions:

-At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.

Non-target Lesions:

* No progression.
* No appearance new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.

Bone Lesions:

* \< 25% increase in lesions.
* No new lesions., Assessed for response for up to 34 months|Clinical Benefit Rate by ESR1 Genotype, Clinical Benefit Rate is the percentage of participants who achieve clinical benefit from the study treatment. Clinical benefit is defined as at least 24 weeks of confirmed CR, PR, SD.

SD or better is achieved if the following are true:

Bone Lesions:

* \< 25% increase in lesions.
* No new lesions.

ESR1 genotype determined using established methods, Assessed for response for up to 34 months|Percent of Participants With All Grade Neutrophil Count Decrease, Assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 regardless of whether the event is related or unrelated to treatment. Neutrophil counts are evaluated using established methods., Baseline, until resolution or for 30 days after the subject's last study visit, up to 43 months.

Non-target Lesions:

* No progression.
* No appearance new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.

Bone Lesions:

-\>50% increase in lesions.

-No new lesions., Assessed for response for up to 34 months|Median Progression-Free Survival, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause as estimated by Kaplan Meier methods. Progression is measured using RECIST 1.1 criteria, defined as at least a 20% increase in size in target lesion and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and/or appearance of new lesions. Patients who have not progressed and are alive are censored at the date the patient is known to be progression-free., Up to 42 months|Median Overall Survival, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive., Up to 42 months|Median Progression-Free Survival for Patients by ESR1 Genotype, Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from start of treatment to disease progression or death from any cause as estimated by Kaplan Meier methods. Patients who have not progressed and are alive are censored at the date the patient is known to be progression-free. ESR1 genotype is determined using established methods. Progression is measured using RECIST 1.1 criteria, defined as at least a 20% increase in size in target lesion and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and/or appearance of new lesions, Up to 24 months|Overall Survival by ESR1 Genotype, Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.

This research study is a Phase I/II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trial tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being studied. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet approved Palbociclib in combination with Bazedoxifene for use in participants with your type of cancer, but it has been approved for other uses (metastatic breast cancer).

Palbociclib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Palbociclib blocks activity of two closely related enzymes (proteins that help chemical reactions in the body occur), called Cyclin D Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6). These proteins are part of a pathway, or a sequence of steps which is known to control cell growth. Laboratory testing has shown that palbociclib may stop the growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

Endocrine therapy prevents breast cancer cell growth by blocking the activity of the estrogen receptor. During this study the endocrine therapy will be bazedoxifene.

In this research study, the investigators are evaluating how safe palbociclib is and how well palbociclib in combination with bazedoxifene, a form of endocrine treatment, works in participants with a history of stage four breast cancer.
