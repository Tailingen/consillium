Advanced malignant solid tumors have limited treatment options and poor prognosis, which is a major health challenge worldwide. As a promising immunotherapy strategy, cancer vaccines use tumor-specific antigens or tumor-associated antigens to activate body-specific immune responses and effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Current research suggests that mitochondria are a form of archaeozoic proteus that is integrated into modern eukaryotes by symbiosis with anaerobic pre-eukaryotic (host) cells. Mitochondria are key mediators of innate and adaptive immune processes, and many mitochondrial components and metabolites (e.g., mitochondrial DNA, proteins, etc.) are released in response to cellular injury or stress as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to promote inflammatory responses. These DAMPs elicit an innate immune response by activating pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLRs and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). A mitochondrial engineering platform for the generation of antigen-rich mitochondria as a cancer vaccine has been successfully established. This study includes three dose cohorts and uses a "3+3" dose escalation design to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the engineered-mitochondria vaccine in patients with advanced solid tumors.
