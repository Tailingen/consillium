A Study of Combination Therapy With Venetoclax, Daratumumab and Dexamethasone (With and Without Bortezomib) in Participants With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma
This is a study of venetoclax, daratumumab, and dexamethasone with and without bortezomib combination therapy to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of these combinations in participants with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The study will consist of 3 distinct parts: Part 1 includes participants with t(11;14) positive relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma who will receive venetoclax in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone (VenDd); Part 2 includes participants with R/R multiple myeloma who will receive venetoclax in combination with daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (VenDVd); Part 3 includes participants with t(11;14) positive R/R multiple myeloma who will receive venetoclax in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone (VenDd) or daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (DVd).

Part 1 and Part 2 are non-randomized and will be initiated with a dose-escalation phase in which increasing doses of venetoclax will be given with fixed doses of daratumumab and dexamethasone (Part 1a) or with fixed doses of daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (Part 2a). Each dose escalation phase will be followed by a single-arm, open-label expansion phase. Part 3 will include a randomized, open-label expansion phase with participants receiving venetoclax in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone (VenDd) or daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (DVd).
