Clinical Trial on Acupuncture Adjuvant Treatment in the Pain After the Surgery of Gastrointestinal Carcinoma
Clinical trial on acupuncture adjuvant treatment in the pain after the surgery of gastrointestinal carcinoma. Gastrointestinal cancer patients are diagnosed by pathology or cell biology. Patients are randomized into 2 groups: The control group receive normal treatment only, the experimental group receive acupuncture therapy besides normal treatment. Clinical evaluation is based on the observation of the pain degree and life quality improvement. Blood biochemistry tests mainly include Prostaglandin E2(PGE2),5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT), histamine(HIS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), adrenaline, nor-adrenaline, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, cell flow cytometry on Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg cytokines as well as serum cortisol, estradiol (female), progesterone (female), testosterone (male) etc.
