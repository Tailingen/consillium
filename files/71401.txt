Rituximab in Treating Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Primary CNS Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed primary CNS lymphoma.
Lymphoma
BIOLOGICAL: rituximab
Radiographic Response, it at any time point patient progresses no more scans are required, patient is off study, 1 month, 2 months and then q3months
Progression-free Survival, pt had MRI every 3 months, pt had MRI q3months|Overall Survival, survival was evaluated q 2months, 47 months|Toxicity, patients only received drug for 8 weeks, 8 weeks - 2 cycles
OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the radiographic response proportion in patients with refractory or recurrent primary CNS lymphoma treated with rituximab.

Secondary

* Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.
* Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional courses of rituximab off study at the discretion of the treating physician.

Patients are followed every 2 months.

PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9 months.
