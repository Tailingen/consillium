An Exploratory Clinical Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Anti-CEA-CAR-T Cells Injection in Patients With CEA+ Locally Advanced and/or Metastatic Solid Tumors
This is a single-center, open-label clinical study of anti-CEA-CAR-T cells for CEA+ patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors. In this study, a single-dose regimen was designed, and the investigator had the discretion to decide whether the patient received more than once CAR T-cell therapy.This study intends to include CEA+ patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors.They will take the anti-CEA-CAR-T cell transfusion after a screening period, mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection, bridging therapy if necessary, and lymphocyte clearance pretreatment period.
