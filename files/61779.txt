Evaluation of the ctDNA LUNAR Test in an Average Patient Screening Episode
The ECLIPSE (Evaluation of the ctDNA LUNAR test in an Average Patient Screening Episode) study is a prospective, observational multi-site study without randomization. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the performance characteristics of a blood-based ctDNA LUNAR-2 test to detect colorectal cancer in a screen-relevant, average risk population.

The LUNAR-2 test has been developed to detect malignant disease in screen-relevant patients who would otherwise undergo screening for malignant disease using invasive methodologies such as colonoscopy. The intended use of such a test would be to return a result of ctDNA detected/ ctDNA not detected in a patient eligible for average risk screening for colorectal cancer. Those patients who receive a ctDNA detected result should undergo further investigation with colonoscopy.

In order to define the performance characteristics of the test in a relevant population, this study will perform a blood draw prior to the patient undergoing the standard of care colonoscopy (and all associated preparatory medications) and retrospectively compare the performance characteristics of the LUNAR-2 test with the findings of the index colonoscopy.

Outcomes of patients at one and two-years post-procedure will be collected as secondary endpoints to investigate the possibility of incidental, non-colorectal cancer cases and interval cancers that had not reached the clinical threshold for detection at the time of the index colonoscopy.
