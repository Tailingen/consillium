Precision Palliative Care for Patients with Advanced Esophageal Cancer
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if precision palliative care improves survival of patients with advanced esophageal cancer in adults.

Researchers will compare precision palliative care and standard palliative care to see if precision palliative care works more effectively to treat advanced esophageal s cancer.

Participants will receive precision palliative care or standard palliative care. All participants will answer survey questions about their quality of life, MDASI, PHQ-9, GAD-7 for 1 years.
