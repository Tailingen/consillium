Underwater Versus Conventional Endoscopic Mucosal Resection in the Treatment of Non-pedunculated Colorectal Polyps
A prospective, randomized, controlled study to compare the efficacy and safety of underwater endoscopic mucosal resection and conventional endoscopic mucosal resection in removal of non-pedunculated colorectal polyps
Colorectal Polyp|Colorectal Neoplasms
PROCEDURE: Endoscopic resection
en bloc resection, Rate of en bloc resection for non-pedunculated colorectal polyps of 10 mm or more, immediately after the procedure|Curative rate, Curative rate for non-pedunculated colorectal polyps of 10 mm or more, through study completion, an average of 6 months
Complication rate, Rate of complications including bleeding, perforation, up to 2 weeks|Local recurrence rate, Rate of local recurrence, 6 months|Procedure time, Time for complete resection of polyps, during the procedure
* Patients are undergone colonoscopy at the Endoscopy department of Ho Chi Minh City University Medical Center.
* Randomize patients with non-pedunculated polyp of 10mm or larger in size into 2 interventional groups based on Random function of Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 20.0, including (1) Group 1: Underwater endoscopic mucosal resection (UEMR) and (2) Group 2: Conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (CEMR).
* The time of local recurrence assessment depends on the histopathology of polyps. Polyps with low grade dysplasia are followed up at 6 months, while polyps with high grade dysplasia are followed at 3 months.
* Collecting variables which consist of primary and secodary outcomes.
