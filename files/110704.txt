Chiauranib in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma
Chiauranib , which simultaneously targets against VEGFR/Aurora B/CSF-1R, several key kinases involved in tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell mitosis, and chronic inflammatory microenvironment.

Chiauranib is a novel orally active multi-target inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits the angiogenesis-related kinases (VEGFR2, VEGFR1, VEGFR3, PDGFRa and c-Kit), mitosis-related kinase Aurora B and chronic inflammationrelated kinase CSF-1R in a high potency manner with the IC50 at a single-digit nanomolar range. In particular, Chiauranib showed very high selectivity in the kinase inhibition profile with little activity on off-target non-receptor kinases, proteins, GPCR and ion channels, indicative of a better drug safety profile in terms of clinical relevance.

This study is a phase II, single arm, open label, multi-center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chiauranib plus albumin-paclitaxel and gemcitabine as first-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
