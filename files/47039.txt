Organoids in Predicting Chemoradiation Sensitivity on Rectal Cancer
Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer will receive biopsy before the standard treatment of neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The investigators are going to establish organoids model from the pre-treatment biopsies and expose organoids to irradiation and the same chemotherapy drugs. The sensitivity of irradiation and chemotherapy drugs will be tested in the organoids model. Here, the investigators will launch the observational clinical trial to validate whether the organoids could predict the clinical outcome in locally advanced rectal cancer patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

Response of the rectal cancer organoids to irradiation and the same chemotherapy drugs as the corresponding patient., The investigators will culture rectal cancer organoids and treat with irradiation and the same chemotherapy drugs as the corresponding patient. The number and size of alive organoids will be observed after treatment. The correlation of organoids sensitivity and patient response will be evaluated., 2018.08-2020.11
Response of the rectal cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemoradiation., The investigators will use pathological tumor regression grade (TRG) to evaluate chemoradiation response of locally advanced rectal cancer patients., 2018.08-2020.11
