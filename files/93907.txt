High-flow Nasal Cannula Oxygenation Decrease Hypoxia in Gastroscopy Sedated by Propofol
Hypoxia is the most common adverse events during sedated gastroscopy. In present study, high-flow nasal cannula oxygenation will be utilized in order to reduce the hypoxia. At the same time the feasibility and safety will be evaluated.
