Tissue Oxygenation Are Associated With Anastomotic Leak Rates After an Ivor Lewis Esophagectomy
The purpose of this study is to test whether after an Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (the removal of a portion of the stomach and esophagus with re-attachment) there is an association between the intraoperative level of oxygen at the site where the esophagus is re-attached to the stomach (measured using the Wipox), and the incidence of a disruption at the site of the attachment after the surgery.

DEVICE: wireless pulse oximeter (Wipox)
association between tissue oxygenation (measured using the Wipox) at the anastomotic site and the incidence of anastomotic leak after an Ivor Lewis esophagectomy., The primary objective of this observational study is to determine whether in patients undergoing Ivor Lewis esophagectomy, low levels of tissue oxygenation at the anastomotic site are associated with increased risk of anastomotic leak (AL)., 2 years
To correlate various demographic, (age, co-morbidities, smoking history) and clinical variables (pre-operative therapy, intra-operative blood pressure and systemic oxygen saturation) with tissue oxygenation at the anastomotic site. Spearman rank correlation (for continuous variables) and Wilcoxon rank sum test (for categorical variables) will be used to test these associations., 2 years|To correlate anastomotic site tissue oxygenation with the postdischarge incidence of stricture, the association between anastomotic site tissue oxygenation and the incidence of post-discharge stricture observed during the 6 months following surgery will be assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum test (with O2 levels on a continuous scale) and Fisher exact test., 2 years|To correlate clinical variables, (age, co-morbidities, smoking history) and clinical variables (pre-operative therapy, intra-operative blood pressure and systemic oxygen saturation) with tissue oxygenation at the anastomotic site.
