Study With Cabazitaxel in Previously Treated Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Gastric Cancer
Single-arm study to determine disease control rate in second- (or later) line treatment with cabazitaxel after the failure of palliative primary treatment.
Gastric Cancer
DRUG: Cabazitaxel
Disease Control Rate (DCR), Patients are staged every 6 weeks during therapy (after cycle 2, 4 and 6, i.e. up to 18 weeks) and during follow-up (up to 12 months), up to 17 months
Overall survival (OS), From date of randomization until the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 17 months, up to 17 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 17 months, up to 17 months|Response rate by subgroup (with and without previous treatment with a taxane), Patients are staged every 6 weeks during therapy (after cycle 2, 4 and 6, i.e. up to 18 weeks) and during follow-up (up to 12 months), up to 17 months|Toxicity, incidence and intensity of adverse events, up to 18 weeks|Correlation of circulating tumor cells with PFS and OS, samples for analysis of circulating tumor cells are taken before therapy, before every new cycle, and at the end of treatment (every 3 weeks)., up to 18 weeks|Correlation of circulating tumor cells with the clinical response, up to 18 weeks
65 patients with advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction and stomach will be treated with 20mg/m2 Cabazitaxel for a maximum of 6 cycles. Main objective of the study is the Disease Control Rate (DCR) with Cabazitaxel.
