ICG-coated Endoscopic Clip for Tumor Localization
The fluorescent clipping method involves endoscopic clipping a fluorescent clip into the colonic lesion site in advance of surgery, and observing the position of the fluorescence through the colonic wall by a light source of a certain wavelength band during surgery.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the localization of colonic lesions using ICG coated endoscopic clip in laparoscopic colon surgery.
