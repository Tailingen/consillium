Bendamustine Hydrochloride and Rituximab With or Without Bortezomib Followed by Rituximab With or Without Lenalidomide in Treating Patients With High-Risk Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Follicular Lymphoma
RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. It is not yet known whether giving bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab together alone is more effective than giving bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab together with bortezomib or lenalidomide in treating follicular lymphoma.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab together with or without bortezomib followed by rituximab with or without lenalidomide to see how well they work in treating patients with high-risk stage II, stage III, or stage IV follicular lymphoma.

OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* To compare the complete remission rate in patients with high-risk follicular lymphoma receiving induction therapy comprising bendamustine hydrochloride and rituximab with vs without bortezomib.
* To compare the 1-year post-induction disease-free survival rate in patients receiving continuation therapy comprising rituximab with vs without lenalidomide.

Secondary

* To determine the 3-year progression-free survival and the 5-year overall survival of these patients.
* To evaluate patient-reported outcomes at baseline and during treatment to determine differences in symptom palliation, treatment-related symptoms, and overall health-related quality of life.
* To examine the association between baseline Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) information and outcome of these patients.
* To examine the association between baseline and end-of-treatment patient comorbidities assessed by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) and outcome.
* To create an image and tissue bank including serial PET/CT scans, diagnostic paraffin-embedded tissue, germline DNA, and serial blood and bone marrow samples sufficient to support proposed and future studies of tumor and host characteristics that may predict for clinical outcome, including treatment arm effects, and enhance existing prognostic indices. (exploratory)
* To evaluate the rate of peripheral neuropathy associated with subcutaneous and intravenous bortezomib.

OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to FLIPI-1score (0-2 vs 3 vs 4-5) and Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) tumor burden (low vs high). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

* Arm A then Arm D

  * Arm A (induction): Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
  * Arm D (continuation): Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of induction therapy, patients who have stable disease or better at time of post-induction restaging receive rituximab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
* Arm B then Arm E

  * Arm B (induction): Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1; bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 4. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
  * Arm E (continuation): Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of induction therapy, patients who have stable disease or better at time of post-induction restaging receive rituximab as in arm D.
* Arm C then Arm F

  * Arm C (induction): Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1 and bendamustine hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
  * Arm F (continuation): Immediately after completing induction therapy, patients who have stable disease or better at time of post-induction restaging receive oral lenalidomide on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of induction therapy, these patients receive rituximab IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Quality of life (including fatigue, neurotoxicity, anxiety, and depression) is assessed by questionnaire at baseline and periodically during study therapy.

Blood, bone marrow, and tissue samples may be collected periodically for correlative studies and for a repository.

After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 15 years.
