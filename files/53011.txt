The seroconversion rate of neutralizing antibodies, The seroconversion rate of neutralizing antibodies dected after immunization in pre-immune negative subjects from 30 days after the last dose HPV vaccine to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 , and 58., 30 days after the last dose
Number of subjects with postive antibodies after the whole schedule vaccination from the former negative subjects, To evaluate the vaccine immunogenicity is the geometric mean titer from 30 days after the last dose to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 , and 58., 30 days after the last dose|The level of neutralizing antibody elicited by the vaccine among the subjects with pre-immune positive after the whole schedule vaccination, The growth rate of GMTs of anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 neutralizing antibodies in pre-immune positive subjects from 30 days after immunization, 30 days after the last dose|Number of subjects with seroconversion rate (4-fold increase) after the whole schedule vaccination, The seroconversion rate (4-fold increase) of anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 neutralizing antibodies in subjects aged 16-26-year-old from 30 days after immunization, 30 days after the last dose|Number of AE within 30 minutes after each dose, Adverse events reported within 30 minutes after each dose, 30 mins after each dose|Number of SAE within 7days after each dose, Solicited adverse events reported between day 0 to day 7 after each dose, day 0 to day 7 after each dose|Number of unsolicited adverse events within 30days after each dose, Unsolicited adverse events reported between day 0 to day 30 after each dose, day 0 to day 30 after each dose|Number of all SAE during the study period, Serious adverse events reported during the study periodfrom 1st vaccination to the completion of study, Day 0 to 6 months post vaccination 3|Number and rate of pregnancy events, Pregnant event and pregnant outcome reported during the study period, Day 0 to 6 months post vaccination 3
The study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of 9-valent HPV recombinant vaccine in Chinese healthy females16 to 26 years of age.
