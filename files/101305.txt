A TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, PHARMACOKINETICS, AND EFFICACY OF SHR-A1904 IN SUBJECTS WITH ADVANCED SOLID TUMORS
The study (dose escalation/expansion) is being conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of SHR-A1904 in subjects with advanced solid tumors, and to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D), to assess preliminary efficacy of SHR-A1904, pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and immunogenicity of SHR-A1904 in subjects with advanced solid tumors.
Advanced Solid Tumors
DRUG: SHR-A1904
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), DLT is defined during the first cycle of the study treatment and assessed as certainly or at least possibly related to SHR-A1904 treatment., the first cycle of administration, up to 21 days|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), defined as the dose with the estimated toxicity probability which is the closest to the target toxicity probability., the first cycle of administration, up to 21 days|Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), RP2D is the dose selected for further study based on the phase I study results., the first cycle of administration, up to 21 days|Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), from the signing of informed consent form to the end of safety follow-up period (90 days after the last dose)
Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of efficacy evaluable subjects with the best overall response (BOR) of CR or PR as per RECIST 1.1 criteria., evaluated until the end of study, approximately 12 months after the first dose of study drug of the last subject, currently estimated March 2026|Duration of response (DoR), defined as the time from first documented tumor response (CR/PR) until PD/death., evaluated until the end of study, approximately 12 months after the first dose of study drug of the last subject|Clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the percentage of subjects who have achieved complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and/or stable disease (SD) lasting over 24 weeks (CR+PR+SDâ‰¥24 weeks)., evaluated until the end of study, approximately 12 months after the first dose of study drug of the last subject|Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first dose until PD/death., evaluated until the end of study, approximately 12 months after the first dose of study drug of the last subject|Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from first dose of study drug until death from any cause., until the end of study, approximately 12 months after the first dose of study drug of the last subject|Time to maximum concentration (Tmax), up to 30 days after the last dose|Maximum concentration (Cmax), up to 30 days after the last dose
