"Resilient Caregivers" - A Resilience-based Intervention for Distressed Partner Cancer Caregivers
The objective of this study is to develop and test the effectiveness of a resilience-based intervention for distressed partner caregivers of cancer patients in reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression and distress, while improving quality of life and resilience (meta-reflective skill, values clarification and coping strategies).
Distress, Emotional
BEHAVIORAL: "Resilient Caregivers"|OTHER: Care as usual
Change in symptoms of anxiety, Measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7); range 0-21; higher scores = more symptoms, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up
Change in psychological distress, Measured by the Distress Thermometer; range 0-10; higher scores = higher distress, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up|Change in symptoms of depression, Measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); range 0-27; higher scores = more symptoms, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up|Change in resilience, Measured by Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10); range 0-40; higher scores = greater resilience, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up|Change in perceived stress, Measured by Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10); range 0-40; higher scores = higher perceived stress, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up|Change in rumination/worry and coping, Measured by Cognitive Attentional Syndrome Scale (CAS-1); range 0-100; higher scores = worse rumination/worry and coping, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up|Change in quality of life, Measured by World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5); range 0-25; higher scores = better quality of life, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up|Change in valued living, Measured by the "Obstruction subscale" from the Valuing Questionnaire (VQ); range 0-30; higher scores = more interference with living consistently with one's values, Baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up|Change in sleep quality, Measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); range 0-21; higher scores = worse sleep quality, Baseline, after completion of intervention (approximately 3 months from inclusion), 6 months and 12 months follow-up
Informal caregivers of cancer patients often experience significant psychological distress, which may even exceed that of the patient's. Partners or spouses are typically the most important caregiver and emotional support person for the cancer patient, but there is a lack of psychological interventions that specifically target caregiving partners. "Resilient Caregivers" is a novel 7-session group-based program aimed specifically at improving the participant's ability to cope with the stresses of being a partner to a cancer patient. In this randomized trial, the investigators aim to assess the potential efficacy of this program in improving the caregiver's resilience and quality of life, as well as reducing symptoms of anxiety, depression and distress. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12-months follow-up.
