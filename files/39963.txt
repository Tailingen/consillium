Imaging of Patients With Known or Suspected Somatostatin Receptor Positive Neuroendocrine Tumors Using Cu64-DOTATATE
This is an open-label, single-dose, single-arm, single-center imaging study using DOTATATE peptide, labelled with the 64Cu tracer.
Neuroendocrine Tumors
DRUG: 64Cu-DOTATATE
Sensitivity of 64Cu-DOTATATE PET-CT Imaging for Detection of Somatostatin Receptor Positive SSTR (+) Tumor, The number of patients with NETs disease that was confirmed by SSTR(+) imaging using 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT and In111-Octreoscan (considered as the standard of truth imaging) A total of 63 subjects have been enrolled in the studies; among them 42 patients with known or suspected NET based on histology, or conventional imaging, or clinical evaluations and 21 healthy volunteers., 12 months|Specificity of 64Cu- DOTATATE PET/CT Imaging for Detection of Neuroendocrine Tumor, The number of subjects who have no SSTR (+) NETs as determined by 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT as well using the standard of truth imaging (In111-Octrescan SPECT/CT)., 12 months
Detection of Localized or Metastatic SSTR Positive NETs Lesions Using Both 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT and Standard of Truth Imaging, The number of patients with localized NETs or metastatic SSTR(+) neuroendocrine tumors that were detected by both 64Cu-DOTATATE and SOT, 12 months
In total, 59 subjects will be recruited in the study. The study will recruit both healthy volunteers as well as patients with confirmed or suspicious NET disease by histology or conventional anatomical and functional imaging modalities including but not limited to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or computed tomography (CT), and/or, F-18 FDG fluorodeoxyglucose PET (positron emission tomography)/CT and /or F-18 NaF sodium fluoride bone PET/CT and/or bone scintigraphy, and/or Octreoscan.
