Phase II Study of High-Dose Rituximab in High-Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients in Suboptimal Response After Induction Immunochemotherapy
This study explores the potential to improve the quality of response obtained after induction treatment in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), by giving a short and intense consolidation schema using high-dose rituximab. Patients in suboptimal response (Minimal Residual Disease persistence) after induction will be selected, as well as those who have a Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) relapse after having achieved MRD negativity.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
DRUG: Rituximab
rate of conversion into Minimal Residual Disease negativity, Evaluate the rate of conversion into MRD negativity 3 months after the administration of 4 monthly courses of high-dose (2000 mg) rituximab in high-risk CLL patients with suboptimal response after immunochemotherapy (ICT), or MRD relapse after ICT., Month 7 (= 3 months after the last dose of rituximab)
toxicity of the consolidation treatment by rituximab, from first administration of rituximab until end of follow-up period (= 12 months after the last rituximab administration)|Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic correlation, correlation between the level of MRD conversion at month 7 and pharmacokinetic dosage of rituximab performed after each rituximab perfusions, 1 month and 3 months after last rituximab., month 7|quality of life study, from selection visit until last follow-up visit planned 1 years after the last rituximab perfusion, during 17 months
This study is reserved for patients with residual disease at the end of therapy at the level of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD-positive either in the peripheral blood at least 6 months after the last dose of rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy or in the bone marrow at least 3 months after the last dose of rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy). Patients who have achieved MRD eradication and who have MRD relapse (reappearance of residual leukemic cells using 7/8-color flow cytometry in peripheral blood or bone marrow) are also eligible for the study.

Rituximab will be given intravenously at a monthly dose of 2000 mg four months (in total 4 doses of 2000 mg each), starting within one month after informed consent signature.

The patients will be followed during the treatment period with rituximab. A final evaluation will be done 3 months after the last dose of rituximab.
