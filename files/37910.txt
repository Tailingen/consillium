A Phase IIIB Study to Evaluate the Use of Capivasertib in Combination With Fulvestrant in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer Who Have Relapsed/Progressed on ET and CDK4/6 Inhibitor Reflecting Real World Clinical Practice in Spain
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of capivasertib + fulvestrant treatment administration in patients with locally advanced (inoperable) or metastatic HR+ / HER2- breast cancer with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered following recurrence or progression on or after endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitor.

Phase IIIb, multicentre, single arm, Spain study assessing effectiveness/safety of capivasertib+fulvestrant in locally advanced (inoperable) or metastatic HR+/HER2- BC with the PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered following recurrence or progression on or after endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitor. Capivasertib will be administered as 400mg BD, 4 days on 3 days off in combination with fulvestrant at the approved dose of monthly 500mg (2 Ã— 5mL IV), with an additional loading dose in Cycle 1.
