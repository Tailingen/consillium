ABR-217620 in Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma or Pancreatic Cancer
The drug ABR-217620 is a combination of two proteins, one that recognizes tumor cells and one that triggers an attack on the tumor cells by activating some white blood cells belonging to the body's normal immune system. In animals, this results in an accumulation of white blood cells in the cancer that can fight the cancer. This study will test how much of the drug can be given to patients with non-small cell lung cancer, renal clear cell carcinoma, or pancreatic cancer without causing unacceptable side effects.
