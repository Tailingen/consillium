Safety and Tolerability Study of Ingenol Mebutate Compared to 5-FU to Treat Facial Actinic Keratosis
Background: 5% 5-fluorouracil cream (5-FU) is a well-established treatment for actinic keratosis (AK) and ingenol mebutate gel (IMB) is a new topical field therapy.

Objective: To compare tolerability and safety of IMB with 5-FU for the treatment of facial AKs.

Methods: Open-label, prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with 100 patients with AKs within 25-cm2 contiguous field on the face. IMB was applied daily for three consecutive days. 5-FU was applied twice a day for four weeks. Treatment effect was evaluated at baseline and on days 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43, considering ITT populations.
Actinic Keratosis
DRUG: ingenol mebutate|DRUG: 5% 5-FU
Area under the LSR (local skin reactions)-Time Curve (AUC 0-43 days), Primary endpoint was to compare the total local skin reaction grading scale (LSR) and the area under the curve (AUC) with respect to duration of effects, using a generalized linear model, assuming a logarithmic link function. Age, Fitzpatrick skin type and site of the treatment were considered as covariates. The scale ranged from 0 to 4 (with higher numbers indicating greater severity) for the following six local skin effects: erythema, flaking/scaling, crusting, swelling, vesiculation/pustulation, and erosion/ulceration (maximum score of 24)., Baseline and on day 43
Area Under the each component of the total LSR-Time Curve (AUC 0-43 days), A secondary endpoint was to evaluate and compare the AUC for each component of the total LSR using generalized linear models. The effect of treatment on the proportion of patients that completed the assigned treatment regimens was compared using generalized estimating equation model and logarithmic link function., Baseline and on day 43
Number of participants with side effects in each arm of the study, An additional endpoint was to evaluate adverse effects related to the drugs., Baseline and on day 43
