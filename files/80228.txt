First-line Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer : FOLFIRINOX +/- LV5FU2 in Maintenance Versus Firgem
The pancreas cancer is the 4th cause of death. All stage confused, the survival at 5 years is note over 5 %. At metastatic stage, the pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an incurable disease with the survival median of 2-4 months without chemotherapy.

Up to 2011, gemcitabine was the only reference treatment of this type of cancer. But until, the FOLFIRINOX could permitted to improve significantly the overall survival (6,8 months with gemcitabine vs 11,1 months with FOLFIRINOX) and the progression free survival (3,3 months with gemcitabine vs 6,4 months with FOLFIRINOX) for patients under 76 years. Main toxicities of this treatment are hematological, gastrointestinal and neuropathy with apparition of sensitive neuropathy, reversible, related to oxaliplatin.

These results are on a population under 76 years old. In this study, the median age of patients at inclusion was 61 years old and FOLFIRINOX was still beneficial for patients more than 65 years old. Given the increase of proportion of patients than more of 65 years old with pancreatic cancer and given the increase of life expected, it is important to know the effectiveness and tolerance of such treatment for patient older than 65 years and 76 years.

FIRGEM is an original strategic sequential treatment witch alternates, every 2 month, 4 cycles of FOLFIRI.3 and 2 cycles of 3 injections of gemcitabine. There is no cross resistance known between this 2 treatments witch limit toxicities and preserve quality of life of patients. A Phase II trial testing this treatment regimen to classical regimen of gemecitabine, showed an overall survival of 11 months in the FIRGEM regimen and an overall survival of 8,2 months in the gemcitabine regimen. The rate of progression was 45% near of progression rate with FOLFIRINOX. Tolerance is close to that FOLFIRINOX regimen but this strategic doesn't induce limiting neurotoxicities and allow to use oxaliplatin in 2de line of treatment.

The trial propose to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerance of FOLFIRINOX regimen (8 cycles) with LV5FU2 in maintenance (that could increase the FOLFIRINOX tolerable without decrease efficiency), to FIRGEM regimen and to FOLFIRINOX (12 cycles) which is the reference regimen.
Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer
DRUG: FOLFIRINOX|DRUG: LV5FU2|DRUG: FOLFIRI.3|DRUG: Gemcitabine
Percentage of Patients Alive and Without Radiological and/or Clinical Progression 6 Months After the Randomization., Progression was defined as radiological progression according to RECIST v1.1 criteria and/or clinical progression according to the investigator. Progression or death (for any reason) was considered if the event occured within the first 6 months since randomization. 6 month scans were 6 month scans with a +/- 1 month window., 6 months after randomization
Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the patient's death (all causes). For alive patients, the date of last news was taken into account.

The analysis was done on the ITT population meaning the patients who have been randomized. Numbers of patients correspond the number of patients randomized in the study., Up to 3 years after the treatment start|Progression-free Survival (PFS), It was defined as the time between t randomization and the date of the first radiological progression (RECIST 1.1 criteria) and/or clinical progression according to the investigator or death (whatever the cause is); Patients alive without progression were censored at date of last news

., up to 12 months after randomization
