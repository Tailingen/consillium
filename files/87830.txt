A Multicenter Prospective Randomized Controlled Study of RPD Versus LPD
laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy(LPD) and Robot Pancreaticoduodenectomy (RPD), as two minimally invasive methods of pancreaticoduodenectomy(PD), have obvious advantages over traditional open pancreaticoduodenectomy(OPD) in terms of reducing surgical trauma and hospitalization time, but there are few studies on their perioperative safety and prognostic effects.However, there are few studies on the perioperative safety and prognostic effects of both procedures. In this trial, the perioperative data and prognosis of both procedures were collected and analyzed through a prospective, multicenter approach to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of both procedures.
Pancreatic Cancer|Common Bile Duct Diseases|Periampullary Carcinoma
PROCEDURE: laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy|PROCEDURE: Robot Pancreaticoduodenectomy
Rate of long-term Survival, Survival will be documented 3 years after surgery, 3 years
Unplanned re-admission rate after discharge within 30 days, Serious discomfort requiring re-admission within 30 days after discharge will be recorded, and the safety of the surgical method will be evaluated by this indicator, 3 months|Incidence of postoperative complications, During hospitalization, common complications of pancreaticoduodenectomy, such as postoperative pancreatic fistula, bile leak, gastrojejunostomy leak, and delayed gastric emptying, will be recorded according to the international diagnostic criteria to evaluate the short-term safety of this surgical approach, 2 months
In this trial, subjects proposed for PD were randomly divided into two groups, LPD and RPD, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients in both groups were operated and received perioperative management under the same surgical team and were operated according to the standard PD surgical approach. Subsequently, perioperative clinical data and long-term prognostic data of subjects in both groups will be collected and statistically analyzed to explore a better surgical approach.
