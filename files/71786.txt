Pre and Post Treatment Metabolomic Analysis of Leukemia: A Translational Clinical Trial of the Brown Cancer Center
To characterize the metabolism of glucose by the leukemic cells in patients with leukemia before and after initial chemotherapy.

To compare the metabolism of glucose by leukocytes in healthy volunteers and leukemic cells in leukemic patients.
Leukemia
Metabolic characteristics of leukemic cells from blood and urine samples using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), Blood and urine samples will be taken before and after chemotherapy treatment for up to 6 months post treatment and analyzed for metabolic substances using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with intergraded hyphenated mass spectrometry., Baseline up to 6 months post treatment
To characterize glycolytic metabolism in patients as demonstrated in leukemic cells and serum metabolite analysis after C13-glucose administration at strategic time points of treatment.

To detect and measure 13C-labeled metabolic markers which may be present in the serum and urine of leukemic patients.
