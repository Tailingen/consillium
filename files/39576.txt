Microwave Ablation in Ground Glass Nodules
GGO was commonly observed recently.Radiofrequency ablation has been widely applied in the treatment of patients with GGO. No study had explored the microwave ablation in the treatment of GGO.

The survival of patients with GGO treated with MWA, The overall survival, From the date of randomization until the date of the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 60 months
The disease free survival of patients with GGO treated with MWA, The disease free survival, From date of randomization until the date of first documented progression, assessed up to 60 months
Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, The safety, 1 year
GGO was common with the development of image. Treatments of GGO include radical surgery and irradiation. For patients who were poor candidate of surgery, image guided thermal ablation could be an alternative.Radiofrequency ablation has been widely applied in the treatment of eary-stage non small cell lung cancer and those patients with GGO. However, up to date, no study had explored the microwave ablation in the treatment of GGO.
