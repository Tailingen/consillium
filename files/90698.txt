Molecular Signature for Breast Cancer
The main objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the diagnostic performance of a diagnostic assistance tool for analysis of 5 prognostic and predictive markers of breast cancer (HER2, Ki67 Index, Mitoses, Estrogen Hormone Receptor, Hormone Progesteron receptors hormone of Progesteronereceptor) integrating an automatic analysis algorithm compared to a reference (gold standard defined as the rereading by at least two different anatomopathologists according to the standard method of care) in order to show the non-inferiority of the automatic analysis algorithm compared to this gold standard.
Breast Cancer
OTHER: Diagnostic assistance tool
Diagnostic performances, The diagnostic performance of the automatic marker scoring support tool will be assessed based on the pathologists' gold standard using sensitivity and specificity, at inclusion
Duration of procedure, Comparison of medical time spent reading the slide and establishing marker identification between the standard of care method (microscope and pathologist alone) and the automatic marker scoring support tool (MoSi4BCa), at inclusion|Cognitive savings, The contribution of the tool in terms of cognitive savings will be evaluated using quantitative survey for the pathologists participating in the study., at inclusion|General comfort of use, The contribution of the tool in terms of general comfort of use will be evaluated using quantitative survey for the pathologists participating in the study., at inclusion|Organizational constraints, The organizational constraints of the integration of the solution will be evaluated using a specific questionnaire dedicated to the pathologists and laboratory technicians who participated in the implementation and preparation of the installations., at inclusion|inter-rater agreement, Agreement between pathologists will be assessed using using Kappa coefficient or intraclass correlation coefficient, at inclusion|Diagnostic performances, Diagnostic performances will be assessed using positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and C-index or Area Under the Curve, at inclusion
