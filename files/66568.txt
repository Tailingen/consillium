Cabazitaxel Versus the Switch to Alternative AR Targeted Therapy Enzalutamide or Abiraterone in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Primary Resistant Patients to Abiraterone or Enzalutamide
Primary Objective:

To demonstrate the superiority in term of radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS) of cabazitaxel at at 25 milligram per meter square (mg/m\^2) plus prednisone (Arm A) versus either enzalutamide at 160 milligram (mg) once daily or abiraterone acetate at 1000 mg once daily plus prednisone (Arm B) in chemotherapy-naïve participants with metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) who have disease progression while receiving androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapy (abiraterone plus prednisone or enzalutamide) within 12 months of treatment initiation (≤12 months).

Secondary Objective:

* To compare efficacy for:
* Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate and Time to PSA progression (TTPP).
* Progression Free Survival (PFS).
* Overall Survival (OS).
* Tumor response rate in participants with measurable disease (RECIST 1.1)
* Pain response and time to pain progression.
* Symptomatic skeletal events (SSE) rate and time to occurrence of any SSE.
* To analyze messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) including androgen-receptor splice variant 7 messenger RNA (AR-V7) as a biomarker in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs).
* To evaluate safety in the 2 treatment arms.

Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS), rPFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of radiological tumor progression using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or progression of bone lesions using prostate cancer working group 2 (PCWG2) criteria or death due to any cause., Baseline until tumor progression or bone lesion progression or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1059 days)
Number of Participants With Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response, PSA response was defined as decline of serum PSA from baseline by \>= 50 percent (%)., Baseline up to PSA progression or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1059 days)|Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS: time interval between date of randomization to first documentation of tumor progression as per RECIST 1.1., Baseline upto progression or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1059 days)|Overall Survival, Overall Survival was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause., Baseline until death or study cut-off date, whichever was earlier (maximum duration: 1059 days)|Time to PSA Progression, Time to PSA progression was defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of first documented PSA progression as per PCWG2 criteria., Baseline up to PSA progression or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1059 days)|Number of Participants Achieving Tumor Response, Tumor response was defined as either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) according to the RECIST 1.1., Baseline up to disease progression or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1059 days)|Duration of Tumor Response, Duration of tumor response was defined as the time between the first evaluation at which the tumor response criteria were met and the first documentation of tumor progression., Baseline up to disease progression or death due to any cause (maximum duration: 1059 days)|Pain Response Using Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF) for Pain Intensity Score, Pain response was analyzed using the brief pain inventory-short form (BPI-SF)., Baseline until the end of study (maximum duration: 1059 days)|Time to Pain Progression, Time to pain progression was defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of the first documented pain progression., Baseline until disease progression, start of another anticancer therapy or study cut off, whichever came first (maximum duration: 1059 days)|Percentage of Participants With Symptomatic Skeletal Event (SSE), SSE was the occurrence of a new symptomatic pathological fracture, or the use of external beam radiation to relieve bone pain, or the occurrence of spinal cord compression, or tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention., Baseline until the end of study (maximum duration: 1059 days)|Time to Occurrence of Any Symptomatic Skeletal Events (SSE), Time to SSE was defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of the occurrence of the first event defining a SSE, whichever is earlier., Baseline up to occurrence of the first event defining a SSE (maximum duration: 1059 days)
The duration of the study per participant was approximately 2 years. Each participant was treated until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or participants refusal of further study treatment, and each participant was followed after completion of study treatment until death, study cutoff date, or withdrawal of participant consent.
