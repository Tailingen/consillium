An Open Label Phase II Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Assessment of the Potential for QTc Prolongation Following First Induction Treatment With CPX-351 (Cytarabine:Daunorubicin) Liposome Injection in Acute Leukemias and MDS Patients
The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of CPX-351 on cardiac repolarization, assess plasma drug levels, asses serum copper levels, and assess drug levels in urine.

Efficacy and Safety will be assessed in all patients enrolled to the study.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)|Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)
DRUG: CPX-351
Effect of CPX-351 on Cardiac Ventricular Repolarization (QTcF), Time-matched QTcF Changes From Baseline after the start of first infusion, 21 days
Serum Copper Levels Change From Baseline, Change from Baseline to Induction 1, Day 5, During 1st induction (up to 5 days)|Complete Response Rate, Following 1st induction, following 2nd induction if applicable|Tmax, Induction 1, Day 5|Cmax, Induction 1, Day 5
This study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase II, PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) trial of CPX-351 in patients with documented acute leukemia (AML or ALL) or MDS (IPSS score â‰¥ 1.5) and suitable for treatment with intensive chemotherapy. Each patient will be screened for hepatic impairment. Hepatic impairment will be assessed using the Child-Pugh system and only patients with a Child-Pugh score \<7 points will be eligible for this study. Patients will receive up to two inductions and four consolidation courses. Patients will be monitored for safety (early deaths, adverse events, metabolic changes, etc.) and efficacy (response for AML, ALL, and MDS) while on the study.
