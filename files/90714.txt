Dose-escalation Study of APG-1387 and Toripalimab in Solid Tumors
An ascending dose study in patients with solid tumors to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of APG-1387 in combination with toripalimab. A phase II study of 3 cohorts will be included.
Advanced Solid Tumor
DRUG: APG-1387 for Injection|DRUG: Toripalimab
Recommended Phase 2 dose(RP2D) (Applicable for: phase I stage in various solid tumor types)., Recommended phase 2 dose(RP2D) of APG-1387 in combination with toripalimab in subjects with solid tumors., 21 days.|Disease control rate (Applicable for: phase II in cohorts of Colorectal Cancer, Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) ., Evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version1.1 and iRECIST., 18-24months.
Overall Response (Applicable for: phase I stage in various solid tumor types), Evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 and iRECIST., 18-24months.|Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (safety and tolerability) (Applicable for: phase II), Patients treatment related adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs) will be assessed according NCI CTCAE Version 5.0., 18-24months.
This study will be conducted in two phases. In phase Ib, the safety and efficacy of different dose levels of APG-1387 in combination with 240 mg toripalimab will be explored to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of APG-1387 in combination therapy, both administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion. The following proposed doses of APG-1387 are to be evaluated: 20,30, or 45mg .

The Phase II portion, will compromise 3 cohorts of 15-25 patients.

The 3 cohorts will include the following:

* Colorectal cancer
* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma
* Non-small cell lung cancer with PD-1 antibody refractory or relapse.
