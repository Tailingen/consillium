Predictive Equations for Resting Energy Expenditure
Predictive equations are the main clinical tool for determining resting energy expenditure (REE). Thus, it is important to investigate the accuracy and agreement of these equations in different populations and context of diseases. The purpose of this study is to investigate the accuracy and agreement of predictive equations of REE in overweight women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The REE of all participants was measured (mREE) by means of indirect calorimetry and predicted (pREE) through ten equations basing on the anthropometric parameters (Harris \& Benedict, WHO/FAO/UNU including weight, WHO/FAO/UNU including weight and height, Owen, Mifflin-St. Jeor, Institute of Medicine, Ireton-Jones, Müeller, De Luis and Lazzer).
