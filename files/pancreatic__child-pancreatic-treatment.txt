Special Considerations for the Treatment of Children With Cancer
Cancer in children and adolescents is rare, although the overall incidence has slowly increased since 1975.[
1
]    Children and adolescents with cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following pediatric specialists and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
to achieve optimal survival and quality of life:
Primary care physicians.
Pediatric surgeons.
Pathologists.
Pediatric radiation
oncologists.
Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.
Ophthalmologists.
Rehabilitation
specialists.
Pediatric oncology nurses.
Social workers.
Child-life professionals.
Psychologists.
Nutritionists.
For specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer, see the summaries on
Supportive and Palliative Care
.
The American Academy of Pediatrics has outlined guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents
with cancer.[
2
]  At
these centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with current standard therapy. Other types of clinical trials test novel therapies when there is no standard therapy for a cancer diagnosis.  Most of the progress in identifying curative
therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials. 
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the
NCI website
.
Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2020, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.[
3
-
5
]  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because side effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  For information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors, see
Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer
.
Childhood cancer is a rare disease, with about 15,000 cases diagnosed annually in the United States in individuals younger than 20 years.[
6
] The U.S.
Rare Diseases Act of 2002
defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 people in the United States. Therefore, all pediatric cancers are considered rare.
The designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among pediatric and adult groups. In adults, rare cancers are defined as those with an annual incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people. They account for up to 24% of all cancers diagnosed in the European Union and about 20% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.[
7
,
8
] In children and adolescents, the designation of a rare tumor is not uniform among international groups, as follows:
A consensus effort between the European Union Joint Action on Rare Cancers and the European Cooperative Study Group for Rare Pediatric Cancers estimated that 11% of all cancers in patients younger than 20 years could be categorized as very rare. This consensus group defined very rare cancers as those with annual incidences of fewer than two cases per 1 million people. However, three additional histologies (thyroid carcinoma, melanoma, and testicular cancer) with incidences of more than two cases per 1 million people were also included  in the very rare group due to a lack of knowledge and expertise in the management of these tumors.[
9
]
The Children's Oncology Group defines rare pediatric cancers as those listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer subgroup XI, which includes thyroid cancers, melanomas and nonmelanoma skin cancers, and multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancers and colorectal cancers).[
10
]  These diagnoses account for about 5% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and about 27% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.[
4
]
Most cancers in subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancers, with other cancer types accounting for only 2% of the cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years and 9.3% of the cancers diagnosed in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.
These rare cancers are extremely challenging to study because of the relatively few patients with any individual diagnosis, the predominance of rare cancers in the adolescent population, and the small number of clinical trials for adolescents with rare cancers.
Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer, such as
Pancreatic Cancer Treatment
and
Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (Islet Cell Tumors) Treatment

Chemotherapy
Incidence
Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas, also known as Frantz tumor, is the most common pediatric pancreatic tumor, accounting for up to 70% of cases in most institutional series.[
1
,
2
] This tumor has low malignant potential and most commonly affects females of reproductive age (median age, 21 years), Black people, and East Asian people.[
2
-
4
] There is no known genetic or hormonal factor to explain the strong female predilection, although it has been noted that all tumors express progesterone receptors.[
5
]
Histology and Genomic Alterations
Histologically, solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is characterized by a combination of solid, pseudopapillary, and cystic changes. The fragility of the vascular supply leads to secondary degenerative changes and cystic areas of hemorrhage and necrosis.[
2
-
4
] The cells surrounding the hyalinized fibrovascular stalks form the pseudopapillae.[
3
]
A highly specific, paranuclear, dot-like immunoreactivity pattern for CD99 has been described.[
6
]
Variants in the
CTNNB1
gene have been identified in more than 90% of these tumors.[
7
]
Diagnosis
Solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is a very friable tumor, and tumor rupture and hemoperitoneum have been reported.[
2
-
4
] Tumors can occur throughout the pancreas and are often exophytic. On imaging, the mass shows typical cystic and solid components, with intratumoral hemorrhage and a fibrous capsule.[
3
]
A retrospective review of the National Cancer Database identified 21 pediatric patients (younger than 18 years) and 348 adult patients with solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas.[
8
]  When compared with their adult counterparts, the children had similar disease severity at presentation, received similar treatments, and experienced equivalent postoperative outcomes.
Treatment of Solid Pseudopapillary Tumor of the Pancreas
The outcomes of patients with solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas are excellent, with 10-year survival rates exceeding 95%.[
5
]
Treatment options for solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas include the following:
Surgery
.
Chemotherapy
.
Surgery
Treatment of solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is primarily surgical. However, preoperative and operative spillage is not unusual.[
9
] Whipple procedures (pancreaticoduodenectomy) are often necessary, but non-Whipple, pancreatic-sparing resections may be possible with a pancreatico-jejunostomy procedure. Surgery is usually curative, although local recurrences occur in 5% to 15% of cases.[
4
]
A retrospective review of the Italian Pediatric Rare Tumor Registry identified 43 pediatric patients diagnosed with solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas between 2000 and 2018.[
10
][
Level of evidence C1
]  The median age at diagnosis was 13.2 years (range, 7–18 years).  Only one patient presented with metastatic disease.
At follow-up (median, 8.4 years; range, 0–17 years), one recurrence occurred in a patient who had intraoperative rupture, and all patients were alive.
A study identified 38 children aged 0 to 18 years who were diagnosed with pseudopapillary solid tumor of the pancreas between 2008 and 2022 in a  German registry.[
11
] Patients were a median age of 14.5 years at diagnosis (range, 8–18 years), with a female preponderance (81.6%). The pancreatic tail was the most frequent location of the tumor. All patients underwent surgical resection.
No recurrences occurred during follow-up, although two patients underwent resection with microscopic residual disease.
Chemotherapy
Single-agent gemcitabine is reportedly effective in cases of unresectable or metastatic disease.[
12
] Metastatic disease, usually in the liver, may occur in up to 15% of cases.[

Incidence and Risk Factors
Pancreatoblastoma accounts for 10% to 20% of all pancreatic tumors during childhood. It is the most common pancreatic tumor of young children and typically presents in the first decade of life, with a median age at diagnosis of 5 years.[
1
,
2
]
Patients with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an increased risk of developing pancreatoblastoma. This syndrome is identified in up to 60% of children who develop pancreatoblastoma during early infancy and in 5% of children who develop pancreatoblastoma later in life.[
3
] Pancreatoblastoma has also been associated with familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes.[
4
]
Clinical Presentation
Although approximately one-half of pancreatoblastoma cases originate in the head of the pancreas, jaundice is uncommon. Close to 80% of the tumors secrete alpha-fetoprotein, which can be used to measure response to therapy and monitor for recurrence.[
2
] In some cases, the tumor may secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone or antidiuretic hormone, and patients may present with Cushing syndrome and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.[
3
] Metastases are present in 30% to 40% of patients, usually involving liver, lungs, and lymph nodes.[
2
]
Histology and Molecular Features
Pancreatoblastoma is thought to arise from the persistence of the fetal analogue of pancreatic acinar cells. Pathological examination shows an epithelial neoplasm with an arrangement of acinar, trabecular, or solid formations separated by dense stromal bands.[
1
]
These tumors will often have activation of WNT signaling (most commonly caused by somatic variants in
CTNNB1
).
IGF2
gene alterations have also been frequently observed in individuals with pancreatoblastoma. These findings suggest that pancreatoblastoma might result from the disruption of normal pancreas differentiation.[
5
,
6
]
Treatment of Pancreatoblastoma
The European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors within the PARTNER project (Paediatric Rare Tumours Network - European Registry) has published consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of childhood pancreatoblastoma.[
7
]
Using a multimodality approach, close to 80% of patients can be cured.[
2
]
Treatment options for pancreatoblastoma include the following:
Surgery
.
Chemotherapy
.
Other treatments
.
Surgery
Surgery is the main treatment for pancreatoblastoma, and a complete surgical resection is required for cure. Because of the common origin of the tumor in the head of the pancreas, a Whipple procedure is usually required.[
8
,
9
]
Chemotherapy
For large, unresectable, or metastatic tumors, preoperative chemotherapy is indicated. Pancreatoblastoma often responds to chemotherapy. A cisplatin-based regimen is usually recommended. The PLADO regimen, which includes cisplatin and doxorubicin, is most commonly used. Treatment is modeled after the management of hepatoblastoma, with two to three cycles of preoperative therapy, followed by resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.[
2
,
4
,
10
,
11
]
Patients with relapsed or persistent pancreatoblastoma have responded to treatment  with gemcitabine (one case) [
12
] and vinorelbine and oral cyclophosphamide (two cases).[
13
]
Other treatments
Although radiation therapy has been used for unresectable tumors and relapsed cases, its role in the treatment of microscopic disease after surgery has not been defined.[
4
]
High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue has been reported to be effective in selected cases.[

Treatment of Islet Cell Tumors
Incidence
Islet cell tumors represent approximately 15% of pediatric pancreatic tumors in most series.[
1
-
3
] These tumors usually present in middle age and may be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. Less than 5% of islet cell tumors occur in children.[
4
] For more information, see
Childhood Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) Syndromes Treatment
.
A single referral center in Russia retrospectively identified 22 children (aged 5–16 years) who were diagnosed with insulinomas.[
5
]  Five patients (23%) had multiple pancreatic lesions. All children underwent surgical treatment. Two patients were diagnosed with metastatic insulinomas. One of them had metastases at the time of insulinoma diagnosis, while the other was diagnosed with liver metastases 8 years after surgery. Eight children (36%) were found to carry
MEN1
variants (inherited, n = 5; de novo, n = 1; no data, n = 2). Children with MEN1 syndrome had a significantly higher number of pancreatic tumors than children without MEN1 syndrome. All of the MEN1 carriers developed additional MEN1 symptoms during the following 2 to 13 years. After five patients were diagnosed with inherited MEN1 syndrome, previously undiscovered MEN1 manifestations were found in seven family members.
Clinical Presentation, Risk Factors, and Diagnosis
The most common type of functioning islet cell tumor is insulinoma, followed by gastrinoma.
Insulinoma.
Patients with insulinoma present with fasting hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. In young children, presentation may include behavioral problems, seizures, or coma.
Gastrinoma.
Gastrinoma presents with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, with recurrent peptic ulcers in uncommon locations and diarrhea caused by gastric hypersecretion. While most insulinomas are benign, a significant proportion of gastrinomas are malignant.[
3
]
ACTHoma and VIPoma.
Other less common tumors seldom seen in children are the ACTHoma, which presents as Cushing syndrome, and the VIPoma, which presents as Verner-Morrison syndrome.
Nonfunctioning tumors are extremely rare in pediatrics, except when associated with MEN1 syndrome. Islet cell tumors are typically solitary. When multiple tumors are present, a diagnosis of MEN1 syndrome should be considered.
On imaging, these tumors are usually small and well defined. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is useful for detecting the location of islet cell tumors. However, only 60% to 70% of tumors express somatostatin receptors.[
4
]
Treatment of Islet Cell Tumors
Treatment options for islet cell tumors include the following:
Surgery.
Chemotherapy.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor therapy.
Treatment of islet cell tumors includes medical therapy for control of the syndrome and complete surgical resection.[
6
]  For patients with malignant tumors and unresectable or metastatic disease, chemotherapy and mTOR inhibitors are recommended.
The management of these tumors in children follows the consensus guidelines established for adult patients.[

Clinical Presentation
Treatment of Pancreatic Carcinoma
Incidence and Risk Factors
Pancreatic carcinomas are extremely rare in children. These malignancies represent less than 5% of pediatric pancreatic tumors and include the following:[
1
,
2
]
Acinar cell carcinoma.
Although rare in pediatrics, acinar cell carcinoma is more common than ductal adenocarcinoma, the most common pancreatic carcinoma in adults. Acinar cell carcinoma is considered to be the adult counterpart of pancreatoblastoma, and histological differentiation between these entities may be difficult.[
3
]
Ductal adenocarcinoma.
Ductal adenocarcinoma is rare in the first four decades of life and even rarer during childhood and adolescence.[
4
] Ductal adenocarcinoma is associated with several cancer predisposition syndromes, including hereditary pancreatitis (
PRSS1
variants), familial atypical mole and multiple melanoma (
CDKN2A
variants), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and other hereditary nonpolyposis colon carcinomas (
STK11
and germline mismatch repair genes), and syndromes associated with DNA repair gene variants (such as
BRCA2
and
ATM
).[

.
Genetics of Skin Cancer
.
Clinical Presentation
Presenting symptoms are nonspecific and are related to local tumor growth. However, 4% to 15% of adult patients with acinar cell carcinoma may present with a lipase hypersecretion syndrome, manifesting as peripheral polyarthropathy and painful subcutaneous nodules.

It is intended as a resource to inform and assist clinicians in the care of their patients.  It does not provide formal guidelines or recommendations for making health care decisions.
Reviewers and Updates
This summary is reviewed regularly and updated as necessary by the
PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board
, which is editorially independent of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  The summary reflects an independent review of the literature and does not represent a policy statement of NCI or the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
Board members review recently published articles each month to determine whether an article should:
be discussed at a meeting,
be cited with text, or
replace or update an existing article that is already cited.
Changes to the summaries are made through a consensus process in which Board members evaluate the strength of the evidence in  the published articles and determine how the article should be included in the summary.
The lead reviewers for Childhood Pancreatic Cancer Treatment are:
Denise Adams, MD (Children's Hospital Boston)
Karen J. Marcus, MD, FACR (Dana-Farber of Boston Children's Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Harvard Medical School)
William H. Meyer, MD
Paul A. Meyers, MD (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center)
Thomas A. Olson, MD (Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta - Egleston Campus)
