Camrelizumab Combined With AVD in the First-line Treatment for Patients With Advanced Classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma
This is a prospective phase II clinical trial to observe the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab combined with AVD in the first-line treatment for patients with advanced classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Epirubicin|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Dacarbazine
objective response rate, the total proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR), every 8 weeks from the day of the first cycle of treatment to 1 year after last patient's enrollment (each cycle is 28 days)
2-year progression-free survival, the total proportion of patients with no progression from date of the first day of treatment to the date of confirmed progressive disease or death which one occurrs first, from the day of the first cycle of treatment to the date of confirmed progressive disease or death, whichever occurs first, up to 2 years after last patient's enrollment (each cycle is 28 days)|overall survival, from date of first day of treatment to the date of death by any cause, from date of the first cycle of treatment to the date of death from any cause, assessed up to 5 years (each cycle is 28 days)|incidence and relationship with study drugs of grade 3-4 adverse events and abnormal laboratory examinations, the incidence and relationship with study drugs of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (based on NCI CTC-AE v4.03) and abnormal laboratory examinations, from the date of the first cycle of treatment to 1 year after last patient's enrollment (each cycle is 28 days)
Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a kind of malignant tumor of the lymph system, approximately 95% of which are classical hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL). Currently, ABVD and BEACOPP are commonly used in the first-line treatment for cHL. There are about one third of patients, whose pre-treatment assessment are mainly advanced cHL, suffering relapse and drug resistance. PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway plays an important role in the development and progression of cHL. Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab have been used in the therapy in relapsed and refractory patients with cHL. Camrelizumab, a humanized anti-PD-1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody, is independently developed in China. The goal of our trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab combined with AVD (Epirubicin, Vincristine and Dacarbazine) in the first-line treatment for patients with advanced classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.
