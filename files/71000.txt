Vinorelbine and Gemcitabine Versus Capecitabine in Pretreated Metastatic Breast Cancer
The combination of vinorelbine and gemcitabine seems to be an important part of the chemotherapy regimens used in metastatic breast cancer patients following treatment failure with the combination of a taxane and an anthracycline. Capecitabine rescue monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer patients following treatment failure with the combination of a taxane and an anthracycline, also seems to be an important part of the chemotherapy regimens used in metastatic breast cancer patients. Whether the combination of vinorelbine and gemcitabine or capecitabine administration is preferable is not yet known, especially in patients with metastatic disease.
