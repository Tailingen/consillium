A Study of NX-019 in Patients with Advanced, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Mutant Cancer
This is a 2-part, first-in-human, open-label study to determine the safety and tolerability of NX-019 and preliminary efficacy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant cancer.

Part 1: The primary objective of Part 1 of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NX-019 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/Recommended Expansion Dose(s) (REDs).

Part 2: The primary objective of Part 2 of this study is to confirm the safety and tolerability of NX-019 at the REDs and, for each expansion cohort, the preliminary evidence of efficacy as measured by objective response rate (ORR).
