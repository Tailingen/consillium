Gene Signatures to Guide HR+MBC Therapy in a Diverse Cohort
This is an open-label, multicenter, two-arm Phase II clinical trial that will evaluate the impact of 2nd line chemotherapy (i.e. capecitabine) on survival in patients with non-Luminal A hormone receptor-positive (HR+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC)
Invasive Mammary Carcinoma|Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Capecitabine|OTHER: Endocrine-therapy|OTHER: MammoPrint Â® and BluePrint assays
Progression free survival, Up to 3 years
Overall survival at 2 years, Up to 2 years|Overall survival at 5 years, Up to 5 years|Overall survival at 10 years, Up to 10 years|Clinical Benefit Rate, Percentage of patients without disease progression at 6 months, Approximately 6 months|Overall response rate, Up to 3 years|Incidence of adverse events, Up to 28 days post-treatment|Overall impact of treatment toxicity, Will be measured using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-G (5 point Likert-type scale from 1 ("none at all") to 5 ("very much"), Up to 3 years
Primary Objective:

- Determine the impact of early chemotherapy (i.e., capecitabine) versus endocrine therapy-based regimen on anti-tumor effect in patients with non-Luminal A hormone receptor-positive (HR+) metastatic breast cancer

Secondary Objectives:

* Compare the safety and tolerability of capecitabine versus endocrine therapy in patients with non-Luminal A hormone receptor-positive (HR+) metastatic breast cancer
* Determine the impact of early chemotherapy (i.e., capecitabine) versus endocrine therapy-based regimen on anti-tumor effect in patients with non-Luminal A hormone receptor-positive (HR+) metastatic breast cancer

Correlatives:

* Determine if the tumor mutations detected in cfDNA are early surrogates of response
* Determine if the cfDNA results at disease progression show new genomic alterations potentially associated with resistance to therapy
