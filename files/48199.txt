3D MRE-Based Evaluation of Meningioma Mechanical Properties and Histological Features
This prospective single-center study aims to evaluate the feasibility and clinical utility of three-dimensional magnetic resonance elastography (3D MRE) in assessing tumor stiffness and adhesion in patients with meningioma undergoing surgical resection. By correlating preoperative MRE-derived stiffness and adhesion maps with intraoperative findings and histopathological features, the study seeks to determine whether MRE can serve as a noninvasive imaging biomarker for surgical planning, risk stratification, and prediction of tumor behavior.

Agreement Between MRE Stiffness and Intraoperative Tumor Consistency, The primary outcome is the correlation between preoperative 3D MRE-derived shear stiffness values and intraoperative tumor consistency as assessed by the neurosurgeon using a standardized ordinal scale (1-5). Agreement will be evaluated using Spearman correlation and Bland-Altman analysis., Intraoperative (Day of Surgery)
Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors and are often surgically resectable. However, the intraoperative texture and adhesion of the tumor to surrounding structures vary widely and directly impact the surgical approach, difficulty, and outcomes. Current preoperative imaging lacks the ability to quantitatively assess biomechanical properties such as stiffness and adhesion, which are critical for neurosurgical planning.

This prospective clinical trial investigates the application of 3D magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) in characterizing the biomechanical properties of meningiomas. Specifically, it aims to quantify tumor stiffness and adhesion using MRE-derived shear modulus maps and correlate these measurements with intraoperative surgeon-assessed stiffness/adhesion scores and postoperative histopathology. The study will also assess the diagnostic performance of MRE in predicting challenging resections, high tumor adhesion, and histological subtypes.

Approximately 300 patients with radiologically confirmed meningioma scheduled for elective resection will be enrolled. Participants will undergo standard MRI and additional 3D MRE scanning. Intraoperative findings including tumor stiffness, adhesion, blood supply, and resection difficulty will be systematically recorded. Postoperative pathological analysis will include tumor grade and histological subtype. Statistical analyses will evaluate correlations, diagnostic accuracy, and potential prognostic value.

Findings from this study may support the use of 3D MRE as a valuable noninvasive tool in preoperative assessment of meningiomas, helping optimize surgical strategies, reduce complications, and inform treatment decisions.
