Open-label Study of DS-8273a to Assess Its Safety and Tolerability, and Assess Its Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Properties in Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphomas
This will be a Phase 1, open-label study of DS-8273a to assess its safety and tolerability, identify the Maximum Tolerated Dose and/or Maximum Administered Dose, and assess its properties in subjects with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

Up to 5 US sites are planned for participation in Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Dose Expansion) in subjects with solid tumors or lymphomas.
