Trial in Extensive-Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer (ED-SCLC) Subjects Comparing Ipilimumab Plus Etoposide and Platinum Therapy to Etoposide and Platinum Therapy Alone
The purpose of the study is to determine whether the addition of Ipilimumab to Etoposide and Platinum therapy will extend the lives of patients with Extensive-Stage Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer (ED-SCLC) more than Etoposide and Platinum therapy alone.

Overall Survival (OS) in Participants Who Received at Least One Dose of Blinded Study Therapy, Overall Survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. For participants without documentation of death, OS was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive., Randomization until date of death, up to March 2015, approximately 38 months
Overall Survival in All Randomized Participants, Overall Survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause. For participants without documentation of death, OS was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive., From randomization until date of death, up to March 2015, approximately 38 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Time in Participants Who Have Received at Least One Dose of Blinded Study Therapy, Progression-Free Survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of progression per modified World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria or death, whichever occured first. A participant who died without reported progression per mWHO criteria was considered progressed on the date of death. For those participants who remained alive and did not progress, PFS was censored on the date of last evaluable tumor assessment. For those participants who remained alive and had no recorded post-baseline tumor assessment, PFS was censored on the day of randomization., From randomization until disease progression, up to March 2015, approximately 38 months
