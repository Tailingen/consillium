Regorafenib Plus Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) Inhibitors in Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer
This is a multicenter observational study aimed to describe the efficacy and safety of regorafenib plus programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in Chinese patients with advanced colorectal cancer in routine clinical practice. The primary end point is overall survival. The secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, objective response rate, disease control rate and the incidence of treatment-related adverse events.
Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma
DRUG: Regorafenib|DRUG: Nivolumab|DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Camrelizumab|DRUG: Sintilimab|DRUG: Toripalimab|DRUG: Tislelizumab
Overall Survival, The time from treatment initiation to death due to any cause, Up to 24 months
Progression-free survival, The time from treatment initiation to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, Up to 24 months|Objective response rate (ORR), The proportion of participants in the analysis population who have complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) determined by investigators using RECIST 1.1 criteria at any time during the study, Up to 12 months|Disease control rate (DCR), The proportion of participants in the analysis population who have CR, PR or stable disease (SD) determined by investigators using RECIST 1.1 criteria at any time during the study, Up to 12 months|Incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAE), Percentage of participants with TRAEs as assessed by CTCAE v4.0, Up to 24 months
The investigators retrospectively identify patients with advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma who received at least one dose of PD-1 inhibitors plus regorafenib from 5/2019 to 2/2021 in 14 Chinese medical centers. Patients received the study treatment as part of routine medical care based on the consensus of clinicians and patients. In addition to the primary and secondary outcomes, other patient and treatment characteristics including baseline microsatellite instability status, metastatic sites, previous treatment regimens, post-treatment regimens, are collected in order to describe the real-world treatment patterns.
