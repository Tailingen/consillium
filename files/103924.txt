Anlotinib Versus Docetaxel as the Second-line Treatment in EGFR Wild Type Patients With Advanced NSCLC
This study is conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of anlotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitors of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2（VEGFR）、FGFR（Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor）, Platelet-derived growth factor Receptor（PDGFR） and c-kit, vs docetaxel in advanced Non-squamous Non-small cell lung cancer harbouring wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) .
Lung Cancer|Lung Cancer Metastatic
DRUG: Anlotinib Hydrochloride|DRUG: Docetaxel
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS defined as the time from first dose of study treatment until the first date of either objective disease progression or death due to any cause., Up to 24 months
Objective response rate(ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of subjects with evidence of a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1., Up to 24 months|Disease Control Rate (DCR), Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented complete response, partial response, and stable disease (CR + PR + SD) based on RECIST 1.1., Up to 24 months
This is a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial conducted in China to compare the efficacy and and safety of Anlotinib vs Docetaxel in patients of EGFR mutation-negative advanced nonsquamous non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

Eligible patients will be randomized to arm A and arm B:

Arm A: Patients on the anlotinib arm received 12mg anlotinib orally daily on day 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle.

Arm B: Patients on the docetaxel arm received 75mg/m2 docetaxel as intravenous infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.
