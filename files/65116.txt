Cabazitaxel +/- Carboplatin vs 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer
The purpose of this study is to find out what treatment works best for participants with metastatic prostate cancer that are not responding to hormone treatment and docetaxel and are also Prostate-specific membrane antigen(PSMA) positive.
Metastatic Prostate Cancer|Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer
DRUG: Cabazitaxel and carboplatin|DRUG: Lu-PSMA-617
PSA response rate as assessed by the change in PSA ratio, PSA decline of â‰¥50% (PSA50) at 12 weeks. PSA decline will be measured by obtaining the ratio of PSA obtained on cycle 5 day 1 to baseline PSA obtained cycle 1 day 1., Baseline, 12 weeks post intervention
Progression Free Survival, Upto 26 weeks|Time to next systemic therapy, Cycle 1 day1(each cycle will be 6 weeks upto 10 cycles) to the first day of subsequent systemic cancer-directed therapy
Brief Background/Rationale

Metastatic prostate cancer initially is very responsive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), with intensification using an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) such as abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide with or without docetaxel to prolong sensitivity to treatment and overall survival. Over time, however, prostate cancer transitions from castrate-sensitive to castrate-resistant. Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of under three years. There are now several agents with diverse mechanisms of action approved for use in mCRPC including cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, radium-223, olaparib, rucaparib, and 177Lu-PSMA-617.

Despite the treatment advances in the past decade, many cases of mCRPC either do not respond to these treatments or only respond for a short period of time. Predictive biomarkers are needed. In addition, with several options available, it is not always clear the optimal sequencing of these agents.
