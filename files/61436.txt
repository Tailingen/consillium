Ultra-low-dose Whole-body CT Using AI-based CT Reconstruction in Patients With Multiple Myeloma
This prospective study aims to perform intra-individual comparison of the image quality between ultra-low-dose whole-body CT with deep learning reconstruction and conventional low-dose whole-body CT with iterative reconstruction in patients with suspected multiple myeloma.
