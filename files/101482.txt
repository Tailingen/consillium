Comparison Between HD+ Endoscopy and Standard Videoendoscopy in Screening Colonoscopy
Colonoscopy is the accepted gold standard for screening of colorectal cancer. However, small and flat neoplastic lesions might be overlooked with standard video endoscopes. The new available EPKi system (Pentax, Japan) enables with HD+ imaging resolution above HDTV standard. Aim of the study was to test the efficacy of HD+ colonoscopy alone and in conjunction with I-Scan (newly developed post processing digital filter)in comparison to standard videoendoscopy
