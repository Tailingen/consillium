Standard Operating Procedures for Anti-HPV (Human Papillomavirus) Antibody Detection in First-void Urine (AB-SOP Study)
The aim of the study is to develop robust analytical protocols for first-void urine sample preparation and antibody assays to monitor natural and/or vaccine induced immunity against HPV (Human Papillomavirus).

OTHER: First-void urine collection|OTHER: Blood draw
Concentration HPV specific IgG (Immunoglobulin G) in paired first-void urine and serum samples, To detect HPV specific IgG concentrations (ratio HPV specific IgG/total human IgG), in paired first-void urine and serum samples from 57 women to monitor the immune response after vaccination with a prophylactic HPV vaccine (Gardasil or Cervarix)., Within 6 months after study completion
Concentration HPV specific IgA (Immunoglobulin A) in paired first-void urine and serum samples, To detect HPV specific IgA concentrations (ratio HPV specific IgA/total human IgA), in paired first-void urine and serum samples from 57 women to monitor the immune response after vaccination with a prophylactic HPV vaccine (Gardasil or Cervarix)., Within 6 months after study completion
In total 57 women will be included in this trial: 38 vaccinated with an prophylactic HPV vaccine and 19 not vaccinated with a prophylactic HPV vaccine. These women are asked to collect a first-void urine sample with the Colli-PeeTM device (Novosanis). Hereafter, a blood sample of 5-10 cc is collected. The collected urine and blood samples will be used for the development and optimisation of robust analytical protocols for sample preparation and antibody assays.
