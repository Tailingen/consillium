AIM 3: Anemia and Iron Management With Every 3 Week Dosing in Anemic Subjects With Nonmyeloid Malignancies
The study is designed to assess if the addition of intravenous (IV) iron to 500 mcg every 3 week (Q3W) darbepoetin alfa treatment enhances response as compared to the standard practice (oral iron or no iron administration).
