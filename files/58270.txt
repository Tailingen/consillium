A Study of WXFL10030390 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors or Lymphoma
WXFL10030390 (WX390) is a novel oral small molecular that inhibits phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and has demonstrated potent inhibitory effects on multiple human tumor xenografts. The first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of WX390 at single dose and multiple doses.

Adverse Events evaluated by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0, The safety and tolerability of WXFL10030390 will be evaluated based on adverse events data. Other safety parameters include physical examination, clinical laboratory tests including coagulation function, renal function, hepatic function, blood glucose and blood lipid., From first dose to within 30 days after the last dose
