Treatment of Breast Fibroadenoma With High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)
This is a monocenter, open-label, uncontrolled study in accordance with ยง23b MPG to evaluate the efficacy of the HIFU-treatment of fibroadenoma using the TH-One device

Objectives Primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of HIFU in the treatment of the breast fibroadenoma using the TH-One device Secondary objective: To evaluate the tolerability of the HIFU using the TH-One device
