Effectiveness and Toxicity of Gemcitabine/Lobaplatin Versus Gemcitabine/Cisplatin as Second-line Treatment in Metastatic Breast Cancer
Gemcitabine plus cisplatin has been proved to be an effective regimen as second-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer patients, especially for those previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. Lobaplatin, as the third generation of new cancer drug platinum, has a similar anticancer activity to cisplatin, but less kidney toxicity and gastrointestinal reaction. The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine/lobaplatin versus gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
