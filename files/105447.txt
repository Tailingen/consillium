Exploratory Study on the Therapeutic Effect Prediction Model of Advanced BTC Immunotherapy
1. Establish a predictive model for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in Chinese patients with biliary tract cancers. By analyzing the dynamic changes of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and other clinical and pathological features before and after ICI treatment in a cohort of patients with biliary tract tumors, a predictive model can be established to evaluate the efficacy of ICI treatment in the early stages or even before treatment, serving as a reliable tool for selecting patients who are likely to benefit from ICI treatment.
2. Investigate the clinical features of populations that benefit from different immune combination therapies. By comparing the differences and enrichment of mutations between patients receiving different treatment regimens, and if patients have sufficient pre-treatment tissue, further comparisons of differentially expressed genes and pathways may be made.

Progression free survival, It refers to the time from the first administration of the regimen to the first occurrence of disease progression or death due to any cause in the subjects., Baseline up to approximately 12 months
Objective response rate, The proportion of patients whose tumor volume shrinks to a predetermined value and can maintain the minimum required duration, including complete response and partial response., Baseline up to approximately 6 months|Overall survival, The time from randomization to death due to any cause in the subjects., Baseline up to approximately 15 months|Time to treatment discontinuation, The time from the beginning of ICI drug use to the cessation of ICI drug use for any reason, Baseline up to approximately 12 months
