Real-World Patient Characteristics, Treatment Patterns, and Clinical Outcomes Among Patients With BRAF-Positive Metastatic Melanoma
This was a retrospective, longitudinal, observational study conducted using the Flatiron Health electronic health record (EHR)-derived database. BRAF+ advanced or metastatic (i.e., stage III or IV) melanoma patients treated at oncology practices across the US were identified for potential inclusion. All included patients were aged ≥18 years and required to have a diagnosis of melanoma (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 172.x \& ICD-10 C43 or D03x), a pathologic unresectable stage III or IV diagnosis, subsequent first-line (1L) treatment with either immunotherapy (IO) (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab + nivolumab) or targeted therapy (TT) dafratenib + trametinib (dab/tram) on or after 01 January 2014, and evidence of a BRAF-positive result at any point in time.
