Effect of the Automatic Surveillance System on Surveillance Rate of Patients with Gastric Premalignant Lesions
In this study, we proposed a prospective study about the effect of the automatic surveillance system on surveillance rate of patients with gastric premalignant lesions. The enrolled patients were divided into group A with intelligent surveillance system, group B with manual reminder, and group C with natural state. The surveillance among the three groups will be compared.

The adherence of doctors to published surveillance guidelines for patients with gastric premalignant lesions varies greatly, and surveillance of patients is critical but time-consuming. In previous studies we developed an automatic surveillance (AS) system to accurately identify patients with gastric premalignant lesions, assign surveillance intervals for different risks of patients and proactively follow up with patients in time. In this study, we proposed a prospective study about the effect of the automatic surveillance system on surveillance rate of patients with gastric premalignant lesions. The enrolled patients were divided into group A with intelligent surveillance system, group B with manual reminder, and group C with natural state. The surveillance among the three groups will be compared.
