Evaluation of Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Imaging for the Early Estimate of Bevacizumab Effect on Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases
Bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic agent, plus fluorouracil based chemotherapy is considered a new standard for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound with gas-encapsulated microbubbles can be used to assess tumour vascularity, particularly hepatic metastases, and may become a useful tool for monitoring anti-angiogenic therapies. The aim of this prospective, multicenter, non-randomized study is to evaluate the usefulness of hepatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound to predict response to bevacizumab based chemotherapy in patient with metastatic colorectal cancer. The primary objective of this study is to compare the functional vascular changes related to bevacizumab based chemotherapy and evaluated by hepatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound with classic RECIST criteria. The secondary objectives are to do a characterization of the pharmacokinetic of bevacizumab, to explore the pharmacodynamic effects of bevacizumab on functional vascular changes of hepatic metastases evaluated by hepatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound and to analyze the possible relationships between treatment efficacy or toxicity and constitutional gene polymorphisms linked to the bevacizumab.
