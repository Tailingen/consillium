Study of AC699 in Patients With Estrogen Receptor Positive/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Negative (ER+/HER2-) Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called AC699 in participants with estrogen receptor positive/human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (ER+/HER2-) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The main goals of this study are to:

* Identify the recommended dose of AC699 that can be given safely to participants
* Evaluate the safety profile of AC699
* Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AC699
* Evaluate the effectiveness of AC699
Breast Cancer
