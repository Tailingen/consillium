Clinical Trial of TQB2868 Injection in Subjects With Advanced Malignant Tumors
The TQB2868 protein in this study targeted programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). The bifunctional fusion protein targets and neutralizes TGF-β in the tumor microenvironment. On the basis of inhibiting PD-1 / programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, T cells can restore activity, enhance immune response, and more effectively improve the effect of inhibiting tumor occurrence and development.
