Faster Elimination of HPV Infection and Cervical Cancer Using Concomitant HPV Vaccination and HPV Screening: A Demonstration Project in Rwanda
Cervical cancer is the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women, with an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths worldwide in 2020. Rwanda is among countries with a high burden cervical cancer, with an annual incidence of 28.2/100,000 women (1,229 new cases in 2020) and a mortality rate of 20.1/100,000 (829 deaths in 2018) according to WHO (IARC 2020).

Cervical cancer is almost completely preventable because of the highly effective primary (HPV vaccine) and secondary (HPV screening) prevention measures. However, these measures have not been equitably implemented across and within LMICs countries.

Given the current situation, where the screening coverage is still low due to financial and operational challenges, it will take many years to achieve the elimination targets as included in the global elimination strategy. We are proposing to implement an innovative strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer in Rwanda consisting of concomitant HPV vaccination and HPV screening for young women aged 23-29 years old.

HPV screening and vaccination are complementary preventive options often implemented as separate public health programs. This project proposal aims to address this disconnect by combining both strategies with the ultimate purpose of accelerating the reduction of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Rwanda and making the programs both cost-effective and sustainable.

Primary objective

The study aims to evaluate whether organized, concomitant HPV vaccination and HPV screening offered to girls and women aged 23-29 years will result in more rapid elimination of HPV infections in the target districts in Rwanda.

The study design is a before-after study design of the intervention, where the projected incidences and prevalence at the 2-year follow-up visit are modeled using the data from the baseline visit, with evaluation using Observed/expected numbers.

Secondary objectives

The study will evaluate whether concomitant vaccination and cervical screening result in an improved efficiency and/or safety of the cervical cancer screening program. These objectives will be examined among women who participated in the combined screening and vaccination study.

i) Protection of Gardasil 9 against HPV infection and against CIN2+ by Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine types in 23 to 29-year-old women from the study districts. This analysis will be performed every 2 years, and the first analysis will determine the effectiveness of one-dose vaccination (incident infections of HPV vaccine types at 2 years), whereas all subsequent analysis will determine the effect of 2-dose vaccinations. The study will be powered to detect a decline in invasive cervical cancer among the study participants, using the cervical cancer incidence in the surrounding districts of Rwanda as the reference.

ii) Efficiency will also be measured by the yield of histopathologically confirmed high-grade cervical cancer precursors or cancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, 3, or cervical cancer) in relation to the consumption of resources and convenience for the women, using the yield at the baseline visit (10% of women tested) as the comparator. The hypothesis is that 2 years after vaccination, there will be only a few incident infections (only some old, persistent infections) resulting in high PPV and high yield of CIN2+ at modest consumption of resources.

End of the study

One screening interval (2 years) after the last visit of the last subject, defined as the day the last study subject receives her second vaccination.

The study will be implemented in 4 districts of Rwanda covering 100,000 women aged 23 to 29 years old. We will use Gardasil 9, the HPV the second generation HPV Vaccine manufactured by Merck.

Prevalence of HPV infections in the study participants, To evaluate whether organised, concomitant HPV vaccination and HPV screening offered to women aged 23-29 will result in faster elimination of HPV infection in the study districts in Rwanda, using before-design modeling the expected numbers after the intervention.

Overall and type-specific prevalence and incidence of HPV will be obtained from the HPV screening at 2 years. Observed numbers will be compared to the predicted (expected numbers)., 24 months
Prevalence of histopathologically confirmed high-grade cervical cancer precursors or cancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, 3, or cervical cancer) (CIN2+) by HPV type in the lesion., The study screenings will determine the prevalence of high-grade cervical cancer precursors or cancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2, 3, or cervical cancer) (CIN2+) by HPV type in the lesion at baseline and at follow-up., 24 months
