Trabedersen (OT-101) With Pembrolizumab for Newly Diagnosed Advanced NSCLC and Positive PD-L1
The goal of this clinical trial is to: 1) evaluate the safety and recommended dose of the drug OT-101/Trabedersen when combined with Pembrolizumab and 2) determine the efficacy of the combination therapy in adults with certain types of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. The main question(s) it aims to answer are:

* What medical problems to participants have when taking OT101 together with Pembrolizumab?
* What is the correct dose of OT-101 to use when evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy?
* Does the combination therapy delay progression or relapse of the participant\&#39;s Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer?

Participants will:

* Receive intravenous OT-101/Trabedersen for 4 days once every 2 weeks. Clinic visits are required to receive and disconnect the infusion.
* Receive intravenous Pembrolizumab once every 6 weeks.

In Phase I, dose escalation/de-escalation of OT101/Trabedersen is performed using a BOIN design to determine dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) when combined with Pembrolizumab.

In Phase II, subjects receive the RP2D of OT101/Trabedersen together with Pembrolizumab until disease relapse, progression \[as determined by immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (iRECIST) criteria\], or death.
