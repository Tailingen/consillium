Phase 2 Study Adding Pracinostat to a Hypomethylating Agent (HMA) in Patients With MDS Who Failed to Respond to Single Agent HMA
The purpose of this open label study is to determine whether combining pracinostat (study drug) with Vidaza (azacitidine) or Dacogen (decitabine) will improve clinical responses in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) patients who have failed an initial single agent hypomethylating agent (HMA), and to provide additional safety and efficacy data.
Myelodysplastic Syndrome|MDS
DRUG: pracinostat|DRUG: Azacitidine|DRUG: Decitabine
Estimate clinical improvement, Clinical Improvement Rate defined as the proportion of patients with CR, Marrow CR, PR, and HI., 6 months
Estimate Overall Response Rate (ORR), including all Complete and Partial Responses, Marrow CR, HI, SD, transfusion independence, and cytogenetic responses, Overall Response Rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR, Marrow CR, HI, SD, transfusion independence, and cytogenetic responses according to the IWG criteria, 6 months|Estimate Complete Response (CR) rate, Complete response (CR) rate, defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed CR (i.e., confirmed by a CBC at least 4 weeks after CR) according to the IWG criteria, 6 months|Estimate Hematologic Improvement (HI) rate, Hematologic improvement (HI) rate, defined as the proportion of patients who demonstrate major hematologic improvement as defined by the IWG criteria. Only patients with pre-treatment abnormal values will be considered for this endpoint at 8 weeks., 6 months|Estimate Duration of Response (DoR), Duration of Response (for patients who have achieved CR, PR, or HI), defined as the time from the initial determination of response to the time of disease progression or death on study, whichever occurs first. For patients who are alive and have not experienced disease progression on study (prior to receiving subsequent/new treatment or stem cell transplant), duration of response will be censored at the day of the last adequate disease assessment., 6 months|Estimate Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-Free survival (PFS), defined as the time from first day of study drug administration (Day 1) to either disease progression or death. Patients who have not progressed or are alive will be censored at the date of last adequate disease assessment, 6-12 months|Estimate Event Free Survival (EFS), Event Free Survival (EFS) defined as the time from first day of study drug administration (Day 1) to failure or death from any cause according to the IWG response criteria. Patients who have not progressed, are alive or died without progression will be censored at the date of last adequate disease assessment, 12 months|Estimate Overall Survival (OS), Overall Survival (OS), defined as the time from the first day of study drug administration (Day 1) to death on study. Patients who are alive will be censored at the date last known alive., 6-24 months|Assess the safety profile of the combination, Assess the adverse event (AE) profile of pracinostat combined with either azacitidine or decitabine by clinical review of safety events by grade, relationship and event outcomes., 12 months|Estimate Marrow CR rate, Marrow CR rate, defined as bone marrow \<5% myeloblasts and decrease by \> 50% over pretreatment according to IWG criteria., 6 months|Assess transfusion independence, Transfusion independence, defined as during the treatment period the patient had no RBC transfusions during any 56 consecutive days or more., 6 months|Estimate Stable Disease (SD) rate, Stable disease rate defined as failure to achieve at least a PR, but no evidence of progression for \> 8 weeks according to IWG criteria., 6 months|Estimate Cytogenetic Response rate, Cytogenetic response rate, defined as complete disappearance of the chromosomal abnormality without appearance of new abnormalities, or partial response of at least 50% reduction of the chromosomal abnormality according to IWG criteria., 6 months
