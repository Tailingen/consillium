Atezolizumab and BEvacizumab With STereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma
To determine the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab-bevacizumab combination therapy plus stereotactic body radiotherapy(SBRT) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, Subjects will start SBRT for one or more primary cancers and/or metastatic lesions and no more than 5 sites within two month before and after the start date of atezolizumab-bevacizumab combination therapy.

In this study, it is expected to improve the treatment response rate of atezolizumab-bevacizumab therapy, which is currently first-line chemotherapy but has a low treatment response rate.

RADIATION: Stereotactic body radiotherapy
Progression-free survival at 6 month, The primary endpoint is to improve 6-month progression-free survival rate in the treatment group compared to those existing literature. Progression-free survival and overall survival are evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier curve. Verified through one sample proportion test., 6 months after registration
Overall survival, Progression-free survival and overall survival are evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier curve. Verified through one sample proportion test., 36 months after registration|Objective response rate, Objective response rate will be ratepresented as a proportion of the total., 36 months after registration|Adverse event (Toxicity), Toxicity will be evaluated using CTCAE version 5.0 and presented as a proportion of the total., 36 months after registration|Tumor marker response: AFP, PIVKA-II, Tumor markers and biological markers are descriptive as statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and median for continuous data will be presented, and changes in values before and after treatment will be compared and evaluated using paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test., 36 months after registration
The subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who are indicated for the first-line atezolizumab-bevacizumab combination therapy are the primary subjects, and if they voluntarily agree to the clinical trial after explanation of the clinical trial, they are included in the clinical trial. Subjects should begin SBRT(stereotactic body radiotherapy) to one or more but not more than five sites for primary cancer and/or metastatic lesions within two month before and after the start date of atezolizumab-bevacizumab combination therapy.
