Generating Novel Translational and Therapeutic Strategies Based on a Multicenter, Pediatric and AYA Evolutionary Tumor Board (pedsETB)
To evaluate the ability of a multidisciplinary and multisite group, the Pediatric Evolutionary Tumor Board (pedsETB), to develop additional therapeutic strategies in patients without curative options or with suboptimal outcomes.
Pediatric Cancer
OTHER: Peds Evolutionary Tumor Board (pedsETB)
The feasibility of the pedsETB developing therapeutic strategies, The investigators will measure the ability of a multidisciplinary group, the pedsETB, to develop additional therapeutic strategies in patients without curative options. The investigators plan to enroll 35 patients on the study.

The primary objective will be successfully met if the pedsETB can develop an evolutionary based therapeutic strategy that differs from the oncologist's opinion prior to presentation for at least 80%, or 28 of these patients., Baseline to up to 60 months from end of therapy
