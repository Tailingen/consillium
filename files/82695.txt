Influence of an Oral Nutritional Supplement Rich in Omega-3 Fatty Acids on Functional State and Quality of Life in Malnourished Patients With Gastroenterological Tumors
Malnutrition is a frequent symptom of various malignant diseases and is frequently observed in patients with gastrointestinal tumors. Eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) has been introduced as specific and anticatabolic acting substrate in cancer patients. Only few randomized trials are available which investigated the effect of EPA in form of an EPA-enriched, protein- and energy-dense oral nutritional supplement mostly in patients with pancreatic carcinoma.

Therefore, the effect of an EPA-rich oral nutritional supplement for two months on functional state and quality of life in patients with other gastroenterological tumors and weight loss is investigated in this randomized prospective trial.
