A Randomized Controlled Study Comparing Priming Solution Containing Crystalloid or Packed Red Blood Cells in Patients Treated With Isolated Limb Perfusion.
The primary aim of this study is to investigate the possibility to replace an erythrocyte based prime solution with a crystalloid based prime solution while maintaining metabolic function. Secondary also to study if potentially reduced immunological influence is obtained during hyper thermic isolated limb perfusion with a crystalloid based prime solution.
