Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma With Ociperlimab (BGB A1217) in Combination With Tislelizumab (BGB A317) or Rituximab
The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ociperlimab (BGB-A1217) in combination with tislelizumab (BGB-A317) or rituximab in participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
