Correlation Between Expression of Hormonal Receptors, Clinical Data, and Methylation Profile in Meningiomas (MethylRH-M)
This research aims to explore the relationship between hormonal receptor expression and the clinical and histopathological characteristics of meningiomas. The underlying hypothesis is that hormonal receptor expression, as well as the methylation profile of their gene promoters, are associated with specific aspects of meningiomas and patients' clinical outcomes. The main objective is to study the correlation between the immunohistochemical expression of hormonal receptors and clinicopathological data. The secondary objectif is to study the correlation between the methylation profile of hormonal receptor gene promoters and their immunohistochemical expression.
Meningioma
immunohistochemical expression of different hormonal receptors, Evaluated on FFPE sections, up to 24 years after surgery
methylation profile of the promoters of hormonal receptor genes, Methylation profile established from frozen tissue., up to 24 years after surgery
