Registry for Molecular Testing, Treatment and Outcome of Patients With Solid Tumors Harboring a NTRK Gene Fusion
The objective of this registry is to analyze treatment reality and outcome of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring a fusion of NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3
NTRK Family Gene Mutation
Overall response rate, Proportion of patients with CR or PR as best response, through study completion, at least 1 year
Patient and disease characteristics, Descriptive summary of demographics, patient and disease characteristics, through study completion, at least 1 year|Test methods used for diagnosis of a NTRK fusion-positive cancer, Description of test methods used for diagnosis of a NTRK fusion-positive cancer and results thereof, Day 1|Physician-reported factors affecting decision to test for NTRK fusion and treatment decision, Description of physician-reported factors affecting decision to test for NTRK fusion and treatment decision making after diagnosis of NTRK gene fusion, Day 1|Treatment reality after diagnosis of NTRK gene fusion, Description of all treatment lines given to the patient after diagnosis of NTRK gene fusion including: Type of treatment (Systemic TRK inhibitor treatments or Non-TRK inhibitor treatments), treatment duration, dosing, treatment modifications and reasons thereof, reasons for end of treatment., through study completion, at least 1 year|Safety of TRK inhibitor treatments, Treatment-emergent AEs (i.e., AEs which occurred during a specific TRK inhibitor treatment and in the respective survival FU) will be calculated per patient (absolute and relative frequencies) and case-based (absolute frequencies). The occurrence of any (S)AE will be displayed overall and per CTCAE grade. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and AESIs will be displayed accordingly.

Incidence of AEs (MedDRA Preferred Term (PT) by System Organ Class (SOC)) will be calculated accordingly for each type of AE/ADR., through study completion, at least 1 year|Physician-reported evaluation of TRK inhibitor therapy, Description of physician-reported evaluation of TRK inhibitor therapy, Day 1|Disease-related symptoms, Description of courses of disease-related symptoms (weight loss, ECOG) after diagnosis of NTRK gene fusion (Only for patients of inclusion group I), through study completion, at least 1 year|Disease control rate, Proportion of patients with CR, PR or SD as best response, through study completion, at least 1 year|Time to Response, Time from start of treatment to the first objective tumor response (e.g., tumor shrinkage of â‰¥30%) observed for patients who achieved a CR or PR, through study completion, at least 1 year|Duration of Response, Time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression or death from any cause, through study completion, at least 1 year|Progression-free survival, Time from start of treatment until disease progression or death, through study completion, at least 1 year|Overall Survival, Time from start of treatment until death of any cause, through study completion, at least average of 1 year|PFS ratio, ratio of PFS of the first treatment line with a TRK inhibitor to time to progression (TTP) in the preceding treatment line without a TRK inhibitor, through study completion, at least 1 year|Event-free survival, Time from start of treatment until PD or death, through study completion, at least 1 year
The REALTRK registry will provide data on treatment reality of patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3 gene fusions, thereby generating real world evidence. It will identify factors that influence treatment decisions after receiving the diagnosis of a NTRK (Neurotrophic Tyrosine Receptor Kinase) fusion-positive cancer. All treatment lines administered before and after the molecular diagnosis of a NTRK fusion-positive cancer, irrespective of the type of antineoplastic treatment, will be documented. Data will be assessed at least 36 months per patient (i.e. until 36 months after inclusion of the last patient in the study). This approach will allow a description of TRK fusion protein-targeted therapies and other therapy strategies regarding effectiveness and disease-related symptomology within the limitations of non-randomized studies in terms of comparative analyses. Intra-individual and inter-individual comparisons (for the latter, provided that a sufficient number of patients with a NTRK fusion-positive cancer are not treated with a TRK inhibitor) could be performed.

The associated biomarker profiling module of the REALTRK registry will aim to set up a decentralized biobank for future research on molecular alterations.
