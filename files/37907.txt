A Study of WX390 Combined With Toripalimab in Patients With Advanced Gastric-type Endocervical Adenocarcinoma With STK11 Mutations
The goal of this clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of WX390 combined with Toripalimab in patients with advanced Gastric-type Endocervical Adenocarcinoma with STK11 mutations. The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of WX390 combined with Toripalimab treatment.
* Safety and preliminary in combined therapy. Participants will be treated with WX390 orally and Toripalimab intravenously, and follow the efficacy and safety evaluation according to the protocol.
Gastric Type Adenocarcinoma (GAS) With STK11 Mutation
DRUG: WX390|DRUG: Toripalimab
Progression-free survival rate (PFS rate), PFS rate, defined as the proportion of patients who have not experienced disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause during the study period., up to 24 weeks|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR, defined as the percentage of participants with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) confirmed by RECIST v1.1 assessment., up to 24 weeks
Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS, defined as the time from the first treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death due to any cause during the study period (whichever comes first)., up to 24 weeks|Overall survival (OS), OS, defined as the time from the first treatment to death due to any cause., up to 48 weeks|Time to reach plasma Cmax (Tmax) of WX390, Test the plasma drug concentration of WX390 to calculate Tmax., up to 24 weeks
This study will be an open-label, multicenter phase II clinical trial. After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written informed consent will undergo a 28-days screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. And then patents will be administered for 8 cycles treatment and 8 weeks safety follow up after the last dose of treatment. The efficacy and safety measures will be conducted and collected every cycle.
