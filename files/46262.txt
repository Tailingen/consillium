Trial of Atezolizumab Plus Chemotherapy After Progression on PD-1 or PD-L1 in Cisplatin-ineligible Patients With Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma
This is a single arm phase II study assessing the activity of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin + gemcitabine or docetaxel compared to historical controls of chemotherapy only in metastatic or recurrent urothelial carcinoma subjects. Subjects that received a PD 1 or PD-L1 inhibitor with no prior platinum chemotherapy for metastatic disease will be treated with atezolizumab + carboplatin + gemcitabine on trial. Subjects that received sequential or concurrent PD1/PDL1 inhibitor and carboplatin-based regimen will be treated with atezolizumab + docetaxel on trial.
Urothelial Carcinoma
DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Gemcitabine|DRUG: Atezolizumab|DRUG: Docetaxel
Progression Free Survival (PFS), Evaluate PFS among patients to be treated with atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin + gemcitabine or docetaxel, who have cisplatin-ineligible metastatic urothelial carcinoma and who have progressed on prior PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. PFS defined as duration from date of treatment start until progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, or death from any cause.

Per RECIST 1.1 criteria, Progressive disease can be defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., From C1D1 until progression or death or up to a maximum of 26 months
Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Carboplatin + Gemcitabine or Docetaxel, Assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin + gemcitabine or docetaxel) using CTCAE v4.03. Number of subjects who had any adverse events or events greater than grade 3 were reported in this outcome measure., From C1D1 until death or up to a maximum of 8 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR) With RECIST 1.1, Objective response rate (ORR) using RECIST 1.1 defined as the proportion of all subjects with confirmed PR or CR according to RECIST 1.1, from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment).

Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR, From C1D1 until death or up to a maximum of 28 months.|Objective Response Rate (ORR) With irRECIST, ORR defined as the proportion of all subjects with confirmed PR or CR using immunerelated response criteria (irRECIST), from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment).

Per irRECIST for target lesions Complete Response (irCR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (irPR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = irCR + irPR., From C1D1 until death or up to a maximum of 28 months.|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) With RECIST 1.1, Clinical benefit rate (CBR) of treatment (defined by proportion of all subjects with stable disease for at least 3 months, partial response, or complete response) using RECIST 1.1 from the start of treatment until disease/recurrence(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment). Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started; Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) = CR +PR +SD (for atleast 3 months)., From C1D1 until death or up to a maximum of 28 months.|Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) With irRECIST, Clinical benefit rate (CBR) of treatment (defined by proportion of all subjects with stable disease for at least 3 months, partial response, or complete response) using irRECIST from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the start of treatment).

Per irRECIST for target lesions: Complete Response (irCR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (irPR), \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for irPR nor sufficient increase to qualify for irPD, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started; Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) = irCR +irPR +irSD (for atleast 3 months)., From C1D1 until death or up to a maximum of 28 months.|PFS by irRECIST, PFS defined as duration from date of treatment start until progression according to irRECIST criteria or death from any cause. Per irRECIST criteria, Progressive disease can be defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions., From C1D1 until progression or death or up to a maximum of 26 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS defined by the date of treatment start to date of death from any cause., From C1D1 until death or up to a maximum of 28 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS) Compared to Historical Controls, To compare Progression Free Survival(PFS) with the historical control, Null hypothesis - Patients receiving atezolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin +gemcitabine or docetaxel) will have a median PFS of 4 months.

Alternative hypothesis - Patients receiving atezolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin + gemcitabine or docetaxel) will have a median PFS of 7.2 months.
