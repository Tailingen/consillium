Proton Therapy for Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer
The purpose of this study is to determine if proton radiation therapy will reduce the amount of heart that is exposed to radiation, thereby decreasing the frequency and/or severity of any cardiac side effects.
Breast Cancer
RADIATION: Photon|RADIATION: 3D-Proton/Conventional plan or 3D-proton only
Volume of Heart Receiving ≥ 5 Gray (Gy)/Cobalt Gray Equivalent (CGE), A reduction of 50% in heart volume exposed to radiation doses ≥ 5 Gy/CGE was considered preferred outcome in this study plan., 2 weeks prior to starting radiation therapy.
Secondary Dosimetric Endpoint, Assess improvements in other dosimetry endpoints including lung dose (mean lung dose, V20, V5), heart dose (mean heart, V20, V5), mean dose to the thyroid, mean esophageal dose, D95 coverage for axillary, supraclavicular and internal mammary nodes, maximal spinal cord dose (Dmax) and skin Dmax., 2 weeks prior to starting radiation therapy.|Assessment of Acute Side Effects, Assess acute toxicities including pericarditis, pneumonitis, dermatitis, fatigue, and nausea., Participants will be assessed weekly during radiation therapy for an expected average of 7 weeks.|Assessment of Longterm Side Effects and Disease Specific End Points., Assess late toxicities including clinical and sub-clinical heart disease, pulmonary fibrosis, soft tissue fibrosis, rib fracture, and secondary malignancies.

Analyze local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival., 1 month following completion of treatment, then every 6 months for 5 years, then annually thereafter.|Assessment of Cardiac Function Markers, Assess levels of cardiac function markers Troponin and Brain Naturietic Peptide before and after treatment., after treatment
The purpose of this study is to determine if proton radiation therapy will reduce the amount of heart that is exposed to radiation, thereby decreasing the frequency and/or severity of any cardiac side effects.
