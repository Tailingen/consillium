An Exploratory Clinical Study of BC006 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors
This is a first in human, open-label, exploratory phase I clinical study including dose escalation (Ia) and dose expansion (Ib) stage. It aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BC006 in giant cell tumor of tendon sheath (GCTTS) and other advanced solid tumors.
