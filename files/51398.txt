Somatostatin Receptors Imaging in Relapsing and Refractory Multiple Myeloma Patients
This study wil assess somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression via the uptake of Gallium-68 labelled DOTA-conjugated SSTR targeting peptide using PET/CT imaging in multiple myeloma lesions pre-identified on 18F-FDG PET/CT in order to evaluate the feasibility of molecular radionuclide therapy in refractory and relapsing mutiple myeloma using the Lutetium-177 radiolabelled targeting peptide.
