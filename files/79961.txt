A Pilot Study of Oxalate Absorption in Secondary Hyperoxaluria
Identify individuals with greater absorption of oxalate based on increase in urinary oxalate excretion in response to a controlled oxalate-rich test meal.

Percent of Oxalate Absorption Normalized by Baseline Urinary Oxalate Excretion Over a 24 Hour Test Period, Percent of oxalate absorption normalized by baseline was calculated by 100\*\[UOx/test - UOx/baseline\]/Ox intake from the test meal., 24 hours during baseline and test day following oxalate-rich meal
Percent of Oxalate Absorption By Test Interval, Percent of Oxalate absorption by test interval was calculated as the urinary oxalate excretions (mg) during the test interval divided by the amount of oxalate in the test meal., 0-4 hours post test meal, 0-6 hours post test meal, 0-24 hours post test meal|Percent Change From Baseline for Urinary Oxalate to Creatinine Ratio by Test Interval, Urinary oxalate (UOx) excretion was normalized to units of mg/g creatinine by dividing the UOx in mg by the creatinine value in g from the same collection. Percent change from baseline for UOx/Cr from Baseline was calculated by 100 \* \[UOx/Cr for the test interval - UOx/Cr at Baseline\] / UOx/Cr at Baseline., 24 hours during baseline, 0 to 4 hours post test meal, 0-6 hours post test meal, 6-24 hours post test meal, 0-24 hours post test meal
This was a prospective 4-day study of oxalate absorption in subjects with secondary hyperoxaluria. Subjects visited the research center three times for outpatient visits (Screening, Test Day 3, Day 4).

Subjects were instructed to follow a low-oxalate diet, consuming only study-specified food choices that had low or no oxalate and controlled calcium content Days 1 through 4 (Baseline Period through the Day 4 clinic visit) and, on Test Day 3, consumed an oxalate-rich test meal.

Subjects performed three 24-hour urine collections during Screening, Baseline Day 2, and Test Day 3. Test Day 3 included the oxalate-rich test meal and the subject collected a 24-hour urine separated into 4 urine collection intervals. (Pre-test meal, post-test meal to 4 hours, 4-6 hours post test meal and remaining time to complete 24 hours).
