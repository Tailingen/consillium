Comparison of Microwave Ablation With Cryoablation for Breast Tumor
The investigators will perform this study to prospectively compare the clinical outcome after percutaneous microwave ablation(MWA) and cryoablation of benign and malignant breast lesion under ultrasound (US) guidance.
Breast Tumor|Microwave Ablation|Cryoablation
PROCEDURE: microwave ablation
volume reduce rate, divide the volume of ablation zone by unablated lesion volume, 3 year|overall survival, 5 year
local tumor progress, any nodular occurence adjacent to the ablation zone during the follow-up, 5 year|metastasis, any nodular occurence keeping away from the ablation zone during the follow-up, 5 year|complication, numbers of participants with side effect and major complications, 5 year
A total of more than 200 patients diagnosed with benign breast lesions and 50 patients with malignant breast lesions in two centers of China will be recruited in this study and underwent US-guided percutaneous MWA and cryoablation treatment. Information for each patient includes demographics; longest diameters of tumors; tumor numbers; tumor pathological type; location of tumor according to whether adjacent to skin, pectoralis, areola and papilla. Ablation variables including session, puncture, time, and power; complete ablation, complications; reduction in volume, palpability, pain and cosmetic satisfying outcomes,recurrence,survival will be compared and analyzed.
