Azacitidine in Combination With Venetoclax Treatment for MRD Positive Post Allo-HSCT AML/MDS Patients
In patients with MRD-positive patients after AML/MDS allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, azacytidine combined with venetoclax may be effective in eliminating micro residual diseases, reducing the risk of relapse, and ultimately improving long-term survival.The primary purpose of this study was to explore an effective protocol to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with MRD positive after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for AML/MDS.

The technology of Allogeneic Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) has been continuously improved, relpase is still the leading cause of death after allo-HSCT. Monitoring of micro residual disease (MRD) after allogeneic HSCT provides a risk stratification of relpase risk in patients after transplantation.There is an urgent need to find an effective intervention plan for patients with MRD positive after transplantation, in order to reduce the risk of relapse after transplantation and improve long-term survival.The combination of demethylated drugs with venetoclax has shown promising results in clinical trials in AML patients who cannot tolerate induction chemotherapy.In patients with MRD-positive patients after AML/MDS allo-HSCT, azacytidine combined with venetoclax may be effective in eliminating small residual diseases, reducing the risk of relapse, and ultimately improving long-term survival.The primary purpose of this study was to explore an effective protocol to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with MRD positive after allo-HSCT for AML/MDS.
