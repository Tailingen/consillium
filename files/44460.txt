Gemcitabine/Nab-Paclitaxel With HIGRT in Resectable Pancreatic Cancer
This research protocol will evaluate the feasibility of administering neoadjuvant gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel with hypofractionated, image guided, intensity modulated radiotherapy (HIGRT) in resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer
Resectable Pancreatic Cancers
DRUG: Gemcitabine/nab-Paclitaxel|RADIATION: Radiation therapy|OTHER: Sugical resection|DRUG: Adjuvant chemotheapy
Feasibility as Measured by Number of Participants Who Complete the Neoadjuvant Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel and HIGRT Regimen, The neoadjuvant regimen will be considered feasible if (a) the trial can accrue 25 patients in no more than 3 years and (b) if at least 17 of the 25 patients adhere to the neoadjuvant regimen and c) the acute grade 3+ non-hematologic acute toxicity is less than 50% (exclusing fatigue and alopecia)., approximately 6 months
Number of Participants Experiencing Grade >/=2 Acute Toxicity, CTCAE version 4 will be used for all toxicity assessments. The acute toxicity rate, defined as any non-hematologic grade 2+ toxicity occurring during HIGRT treatment through 60 days post-treatment, will be estimated with its exact 80% confidence interval. Likewise, we will determine the rate of grade 2+ hematologic toxicity occurring during treatment through 60 days post treatment and the proportion of patients requiring treatment breaks longer than 5 days., 60 days post surgery|Number of Participants Who Underwent Surgical Resection, Patients who undergo surgical resection will be documented, 14-30 days post surgery|Number of Participants Who Received an R0 Resection, Pathologic review will determine if an R0 resection has been performed. R0 resection indicates a microscopically margin-negative resection, in which no gross or microscopic tumor remains in the primary tumor bed., 14-30 days post surgery
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and accounts for roughly 40,000 deaths each year. Despite the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies, little progress has been made in the the last three decades, and the search for more efficacious treatment continues.In patients with a good performance status the combination of effective systemic therapy with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and high dose local radiotherapy may improve disease outcomes. This is a prospective, single arm study in patients in newly diagnosed, previously untreated pancreatic cancer who are planned to undergo surgical resection The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of a neoadjuvant approach incorporating gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and Hypofractionated image guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (HIGRT) prior to surgical resection. Eligible subjects will recieve standard neoadjuvant gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel dosing is as follows:Nab-Paclitaxel (125mg/m2) days 1,8,15 every 28 days for 2 cycles Gemcitabine (1000mg/m2) days 1,8,15 every 28 days for 2 cycles followed by HIGRT and surgical resection.

Adjuvant chemotherapy may be given post surgery at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist.
