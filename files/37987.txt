Trop2-targeted immunoPET Imaging of Solid Tumors
This study aims to establish and optimize the trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2)-targeted immuno-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (immunoPET/CT) imaging method and its physiological and pathological distribution characteristics, based on which the diagnostic efficacy of the above imaging agents in solid tumors (including uroepithelial cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, liver cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, thyroid cancer, head and neck cancer) will be evaluated.

Biodistribution-Standardized uptake value (SUV) of normal tissues and organs., Measurement of the overall biodistribution of the above tracers in normal tissues and organs (bladder (after voiding), background (pelvic fat), blood, brain, salivary and lacrimal glands, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, small intestine, and kidneys). To calculate the SUV, circular regions of interest were drawn around the area of focally increased uptake in the transaxial slices and automatically fitted to a three-dimensional volume of interest., 1 day from injection of the tracers|SUV of tumors, The SUV of the above tracers in the primary and/or metastatic lesions of the included subjects.

The treatment regimens vary for different tumor types but involve chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapies, immunotherapies (e.g. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors), and cell therapies., 1-2 years
Histologically confirmed solid tumors (including uroepithelial cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, liver cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, thyroid cancer, head and neck cancer), or patients with suspected solid tumors (including uroepithelial cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, liver cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, thyroid cancer, head and neck cancer) indicated by conventional diagnostic imaging will be included. Patients will also be included for routine follow-up, surveillance, and treatment efficacy evaluation.

Enrolled patients will undergo whole-body immunoPET/CT scans 1-2 hours after tracer injection (0.05-0.1 mCi/kg). The uptake of imaging tracers in tumors and normal organs/tissues will be scored visually and quantitatively.

Tumor uptake will be quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy will be calculated to assess the diagnostic efficacy. The correlation between lesion uptake and Trop2 expression level determined by immunohistochemistry staining will be further analyzed. The primary exploration endpoint will be the tracers' imaging feasibility and preliminary diagnostic value compared to conventional imaging approaches like 18F-FDG PET/CT.
