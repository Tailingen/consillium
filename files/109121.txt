A Study of Vantictumab (OMP-18R5) in Combination With Paclitaxel in Locally Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer
This is an open-label Phase 1b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of vantictumab when combined with paclitaxel.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Vantictumab combined with paclitaxel
Safety and tolerability of vantictumab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be determined in patients treated with vantictumab in combination with paclitaxel, Subjects will be treated and observed for DLT through the end of the first cycle (Days 0-28 days).
Pharmacokinetics (PK) of vantictumab when administered in combination with paclitaxel to patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, Apparent half life, AUC, clearance, volume of distribution, Plasma sample for Pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis to be obtained prior to the vantictumab infusion on Days 0, 14, 56 and 70 and at the end of the vantictumab infusion with paclitaxel infusion on Days 0 and 56.
Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been determined, up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of vantictumab combined with paclitaxel. Up to approximately 34 patients may be enrolled into the study.
