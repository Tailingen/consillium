Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from initiation of induction treatment until the criteria for disease progression is met as defined by irRECIST1.1 or death as a result of any cause for patients with disease control (defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease) following induction therapy who proceed to maintenance therapy with cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab, 6 months|Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from initiation of induction treatment until the criteria for disease progression is met as defined by irRECIST1.1 or death as a result of any cause for patients with disease control (defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease) following induction therapy who proceed to maintenance therapy with cabozantinib in combination with pembrolizumab, 19 months

This is a phase II study to assess the efficacy, safety, and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of combination cabozantinib and pembrolizumab as maintenance therapy for patients with metastatic sqNSCLC who have received 4 cycles of induction therapy with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel and achieved disease control following induction therapy defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v. 1.1 criteria. Subjects with disease control would proceed to maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab and cabozantinib.
