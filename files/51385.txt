Phase I/II Trial of Sorafenib Plus Ixabepilone in HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast Cancer
In this study, patients with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer will receive treatment with ixabepilone and sorafenib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. The Phase I portion of this study will determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of sorafenib and ixabepilone that may be used in combination for first- or second-line treatment of MBC. The MTDs identified in the Phase I portion of the study will be used in the Phase II portion which will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of sorafenib and ixabepilone in patients who have received at least one prior chemotherapy treatment in either the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting or following one prior MBC chemotherapy in MBC patients who had not received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant breast cancer chemotherapy. This will be one of the initial trials investigating the use of this treatment combination for MBC.

This trial will be conducted under the leadership of the Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) Oncology Research Consortium, a community-based, multi-center, clinical trial organization.
Metastatic Breast Cancer
DRUG: Sorafenib|DRUG: Ixabepilone
Progression-Free Survival (PFS), Measured from Day 1 of study drug administration to disease progression as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) - progression is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, every 9 weeks until treatment discontinuation or death on study
6-month Progression-Free Survival, Measured from Day 1 of study drug administration to disease progression as defined by RECIST v1.1, or death on study. Progression is defined as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions, every 9 weeks, up to 6 months|Objective Response Rate, Objective Response will be evaluated in this study using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)., every 9 weeks until discontinuation of treatment|Overall Survival (OS), Measured from Day 1 of study drug administration to date of death due to any cause., every 9 weeks until treatment discontinuation or death on study|Number of Patients With Adverse Events as a Measure of of Safety and Tolerability, Assessments are made through analysis of reported incidence of treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs., every 9 weeks until treatment discontinuation or unacceptable toxicity
