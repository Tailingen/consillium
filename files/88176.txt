Phase 2 Study IV QUZYTTIR™ (Cetirizine Hydrochloride Injection) vs V Diphenhydramine
This study is designed to compare the number of infusion reactions to treatment with an anti-CD20 such as Rituxan® (rituximab) or Taxol® (Paclitaxel) after premedication with intravenous (IV) QUZYTTIR™ cetirizine hydrochloride (HCl) or IV diphenhydramine during first-cycle infusion or re-treatment with an anti-CD20 such as Rituxan® (rituximab) or Paclitaxel. Re-treatment is defined as re-treatment with an anti-CD20 such as Rituxan® (rituximab) or Paclitaxel after 6 months or in patients with persistent infusion reactions while on maintenance or retreatment.
Oncology Patients Receiving Chemotherapy
DRUG: Cetirizine HCl 10 mg/mL|DRUG: Diphenhydramine 50 mg/mL|DRUG: anti-CD20 such as Rituximab or Paclitaxel
Number of Hypersensitivity Reactions to Treatment With an Anti-CD20 Antibody or Paclitaxel, Compare the number of patients experiencing any infusion reaction events, and the number and percentage of patients experiencing each symptom of infusion reactions (ﬂushing, itching, alterations in heart rate and blood pressure, dyspnea, chest discomfort, acute back or abdominal pain, fever, shaking chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, throat tightening, hypoxia, seizures, dizziness, or syncope) to treatment with anti-CD20 such as Rituxan® (rituximab) or Paclitaxel after premedication with intravenous (IV) QUZYTTIR™ cetirizine hydrochloride (HCl) or IV diphenhydramine during first-cycle infusion or re-treatment after 6 months or in patients with persistent infusion reactions while on maintenance with anti-CD20 such as Rituxan® (rituximab) or Paclitaxel.

The infusion reactions will be evaluated following the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 5.0) deﬁnitions of graded infusion reactions., During and after anti-CD20 agent or paclitaxel infusion, at 1 and 2 hours after the antihistamine injection, at time of discharge, and up through 1 Month post injection of antihistamine (intervention).
Patient Sedation Scores at 1 Hour and 2 Hours Post-injection of Antihistamine (IV Cetirizine HCl or IV Diphenhydramine) and at Discharge., Patient sedation scores at 1 hour and 2 hours post-injection of antihistamine (IV cetirizine HCl or IV diphenhydramine) and at discharge. The patient sedation scores are assessed on a scale of 0-4, with 0=None and 4=Extremely Severe (Asleep, Cannot Self-Rate). The HCP sedation scores are assessed on a scale of 0-4, with 0=None and 4=Extremely severe., 1 hour, 2 Hours and at discharge|Time From Injection to "Readiness for Discharge", Describe the distribution of the amount of time spent in the treatment center prior to discharge (time from injection to "Readiness for Discharge")., Time to discharge from infusion center
This will be a randomized, double-blind exploratory study of IV cetirizine HCl 10 mg/mL versus IV diphenhydramine 50 mg/mL in approximately 34 patients who require premedication for hypersensitivity infusion reactions associated with an anti-CD20 such as Rituxan® (rituximab) or Paclitaxel. The objectives and purpose of the study will be described to patients presenting at the participating infusion centers. The patients will be randomized to receive either IV cetirizine HCl or IV diphenhydramine.
