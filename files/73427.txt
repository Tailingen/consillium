Disease-free Survival (DFS) Rate at 2 Years in TOP2A-amplified and in TOP2A-nonamplified HER2+ ESBC Patients Treated With TC+H., DFS was measured from the date of registration to either the date the patient was first recorded as having disease recurrence, or the date of death due to any causes before recurrence. If a patient had not recurred or died, DFS was censored at the date of last follow-up., 2 years
Overall Survival (OS) Rate at 2 Years in TOP2A-amplified and in TOP2A-nonamplified HER2+ ESBC Patients Treated With TC+H., OS is measured from the date of registration to the date of death for a dead patient. If a patient is still alive or is lost to follow up, the patient will be censored at the last contact date., 2 years|DFS by cMyc Expression in This Population of HER2+ ESBC Patients Treated With TC+H., DFS was measured from the date of registration to either the date the patient was first recorded as having disease recurrence, or the date of death due to any causes before recurrence.
