Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (Cohort 1), Objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1 relative to the total participants in the analysis population. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as a \>=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. Independent Central Radiology (ICR) was used for disease progression assessment., From Cycle 1 Day 1 to documented progression of disease by ICR (up to 67 weeks)
Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (Cohort 2), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed response of CR or PR according to RECIST version 1.1 relative to the total participants in the analysis population.

A serious AE was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life-threatening; required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect or that was considered to be an important medical event. AEs were graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. The grades were defined as follows: Grade 0: no change from normal or reference range; Grade 1: mild AE; Grade 2: moderate AE; Grade 3: severe AE; Grade 4: life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5: death related to AE. The focus of AE summaries was on treatment-emergent AE (TEAE). An AE was considered TEAE if the event occurred during the on-treatment period., From Screening (within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) through and including at least 28 days after the last administration of the investigational product, up to 1.3 years.|Number of Participants With Central Nervous System-Related Adverse Events, The central-nervous system-related AEs included AEs under the cluster terms of MOOD EFFECTS, COGNITIVE EFFECTS, PSYCHOTIC EFFECTS, SPEECH EFFECTS., From Screening (within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1) through and including at least 28 days after the last administration of the investigational product, up to 1.3 years.|Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in Laboratory Abnormalities, Laboratory test results were graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03.
