Impact of Endostar Combined With Chemotherapy on the Angiogenesis of Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
To study the impact of endostar combined with docetaxel and cisplatin on the angiogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer, patients will be randomly assigned to the group one (endostar combined with docetaxel and cisplatin) and group two (docetaxel and cisplatin).

* The serum concentrations of Endostatin,VEGF and bFGF are determined.
* Blood circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells (CPCs) will be measured by flow cytometer.
* Statistical analysis will be applied to study the relationship between the levels of Endostatin, VEGF, bFGF, CECs and CPCs and the clinical outcomes such as objective response rate(ORT), time to progression (TTP), mean survival time(MST), toxicity and quality of life (QOL).

mean survival time, 1 year
objective response rate, 1 year
To study the impact of endostar combined with docetaxel and cisplatin on the angiogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer,patients will be randomly assigned to the experimental group(endostar combined with docetaxel and cisplatin) and the control group (docetaxel and cisplatin).

* the serum concentrations of Endostatin,VEGF and bFGF are determined.
* Blood circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells (CPCs) will be measured by flow cytometer.
* the clinical parameters such as objective response rate (ORT),time to progression(TTP) and mean survival time(MST) will be collected according to the WHO criteria.
* the toxicity will be recorded according to the NCI-CTC v3.0.
* the Quality of life was self-assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C-30 questionnaire.
* Statistical analysis will be applied to study the relationship between the levels of Endostatin,VEGF,bFGF,CECs and CPCs and the clinical outcomes such as ORT, TTP, MST, toxicity and QOL.
