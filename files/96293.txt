Iadademstat With Hypomethylating Agent in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome
This is a phase I study with a primary objective of determining the recommended phase II dose of iadademstat with azacitidine in adult subjects with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Myelodysplastic Syndromes
DRUG: Azacitidine Level -1|DRUG: Azacitidine Level 0|DRUG: Azacitidine Level 1|DRUG: Iadademstat Level -1|DRUG: Iadademstat Level 0|DRUG: Iadademstat Level 1
Recommended phase II dose of Iadademstat., The dose identified in this trial that will be used in future clinical trials., Up to two years
This is a single-arm, open-label phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety of iadademstat with azacitidine therapy. The trial will follow a 3+3 phase 1 dose-escalation design.

First, three participants are given a low dose of the experimental treatment and monitored for pre-specified toxicity events. If 0 participants experience one of these toxicity events, then the next group of three participants is enrolled at a higher dose. If two or three participants experience toxicity, then the next group of three participants is enrolled at a lower dose (or the study ends). If one participant experiences toxicity, another group of three participants is enrolled at the same dose (hence the name, 3+3): if one or more of those participants experience toxicity, then the dose is lowered for the next group of the study ends. Otherwise, if 0 of the additional participants experience toxicity, the next group is enrolled at a higher dose.
