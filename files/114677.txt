Allogeneic γ9δ2 T Cells Treatment of Recurrent Hematologic Tumors
This is an open single-arm clinical study aimed at evaluating the safety and tolerance of allogeneic γ9δ2 T cell injection in the treatment of patients with recurrent hematologic tumors after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Hematologic Diseases
BIOLOGICAL: allogeneic γ9δ2 T Cells|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Zoredronic acid
Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs), AE is defined as any adverse medical event from the date of leukapheresis to 12 months after allogeneic γ9δ2 T cells infusion. Among them, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were graded according to American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) criteria, graft-versushost disease (GVHD) according to criteria defined by the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium. Other AEs were graded according to common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v5.0, 12 months|Incidence of Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLTs), DLT was defined as allogeneic γ9δ2 T Cells-related events with onset within first 14 days following infusion:

The development of Grade (G) III-IV acute GVHD according to the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium criteria; The development of G3 or higher grade CRS lasting \> 2 weeks; Any allogeneic γ9δ2 T cells-related AE requiring intubation; All G4 non-hematologic toxicities. Symptoms of GVHD include but are not limited to skin rash, enterocolitis with diarrhea, liver dysfunction with jaundice, fever, weight loss, etc., First infusion date of allogeneic γ9δ2 T cells to 14 days end cell infusion|Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), MTD is defined as the highest dose level of less than or equal to 2 DLT among the 6 subjects finally determined., 14 days|Recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), The recommended dose for phase 2 was determined through phase 1 study, 14 days
Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from allogeneic γ9δ2 T cells infusion to the date of death. Subjects who have not died by the analysis data cutoff date will be censored at their last contact date., 12 months|Progression Free Survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the allogeneic γ9δ2 T cells infusion date to the date of disease progression assessed by investigators assessment, or death any cause. Participants not meeting the criteria for progression by the analysis data cutoff date were censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date., 12 months|Pharmacokinetics: Persistence of the allogeneic γ9δ2 T cells, Persistence of the allogeneic γ9δ2 T cells assessed by number in peripheral blood., 14 days|Pharmacodynamics: Peak level of cytokines in serum, The cytokines mainly include interleukin-2 (IL-2 ), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) etc. Peak was defined as the maximum post-baseline level of the cytokine., 14 days
To evaluate the safety and in vivo dynamics of allogeneic γ9δ2 T cell in the treatment of recurrent hematologic tumors after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients, and to explore the appropriate therapeutic dose.
