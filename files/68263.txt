Addition of Thoracic Consolidation Radiotherapy to the Maintenance Immunotherapy for ES-SCLC (STONE-001)
This study is expected to enroll 182 patients with partial response or stable disease after first-line immunochemotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer and eligible for thoracic consolidation radiotherapy within 2 years. Patients were randomized 2:1 to immune single-agent maintenance therapy in combination with hyperfractionated high-dose radiotherapy and immune single-agent maintenance therapy after being assessed by the investigator as otherwise eligible for enrollment. Patients in both arms received maintenance therapy with the PD-L1 inhibitor, atezolizumab or dulvedolizumab, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or loss of clinical benefit. Patients in the combined radiotherapy arm required hyperfractionated high-dose (54 Gy) radiotherapy twice daily for residual disease in the chest. Each patient will be followed for approximately 2 years.
Extensive-stage Small Cell Lung Cancer
RADIATION: High-dose Hyperfractionated Simultaneous Integrated Boost Radiotherapy|DRUG: atezolizumab or durvalumab
Overall survival (OS), From randomization to the date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 4 years
Progression-free survival (PFS), From randomization to any documented progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 4 years|Landmark analyses of survival, 1-year and 2-year landmark analysis of OS and 6-month and 1-year landmark analysis of PFS|Best overall response (BOR), BOR is the percentage of participants who have a CR or a PR, as determined by investigators according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 4 years|Confirmed objective response rate (cORR), cORR is defined as either a confirmed CR or PR on two consecutive evaluations â‰¥ 4 weeks apart, as determined by investigators according to RECIST v1.1., Up to 4 years|Incidence and severity of adverse events, From randomization to 30 days after the end of study treatment
