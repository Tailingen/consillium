Detecting Lesions in the Oral Cavity With Thermal Imaging
Previous studies indicate that there are significant differences in the temperature of tumors and normal, adjacent tissues. The present study will test this hypothesis for lesions in the oral cavity. Thermal images of the oral cavities of patients, undergoing examination in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Sheba hospital, will be compared to the diagnoses of the examining doctors. The results, apart from enhancing the delineation of oral cavity tumors, may help the decision to develop miniature thermal cameras to scan thermally, the GI tract.
