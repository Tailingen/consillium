Study of Safety and Efficacy of Brigatinib Plus Chemotherapy or Brigatinib Only in Advanced ALK-Positive Lung Cancer (MASTERPROTOCOL ALK)
This is a phase II randomized, open-labelled, non-comparative multicenter study in which ALK+ NSCLC patients who are naïve of treatment for advanced disease will be randomized to receive brigatinib monotherapy (Arm A) or brigatinib and carboplatin-pemetrexed therapy (Arm B). An estimated 110 patients (55 in Arm A, 55 in Arm B) will be enrolled at approximately 30 centers. A safety phase will evaluate the safety of brigatinib with carboplatin and pemetrexed treatment combination (Arm B). The first twenty-six patients enrolled in Arm B will represent the population of the safety phase. Patients will be treated until they experience progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. Continuation of brigatinib beyond progression is permitted, at the investigator's discretion, if there is evidence of continued clinical benefit. The null hypothesis is progression free survival at 12 months ≤ 69% for Arm B, which is considered not sufficiently clinically meaningful to warrant further study. The alternative hypothesis is that 86% or more of patients in Arm B would achieve progression free survival at 12 months.
