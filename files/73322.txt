Study of Brexucabtagene Autoleucel Plus Dasatinib in Adults With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
To assess the feasibility of oral dasatinib pulses (3 consecutive days per week) during the first month following infusion of brexucabtagene autoleucel (Tecartus) in adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Lymphoblastic Leukemia
DRUG: Dasatinib
Feasibility of dasatinib pulses, Feasibility of administering oral dasatinib pulses (3 consecutive doses per week) during the first month following Tecartus infusion. Feasibility will be defined as the ability of 8 out of 20 subjects to miss no more than one cycle (defined as one week of at least three consecutive days of dasatinib) within the first month following Tecartus infusion., 1 month
Safety of oral dasatinib pulses, Defined by a description of adverse events and serious adverse events at least possibly related to dasatinib following CAR T cell therapy; it will include an analysis of the sequential toxicity boundaries in that the analysis does not lead to a pause in the study; further defined as no reports of suspected death on study., 2 years|Overall response rate, The definitions for response are primarily based on the standardized response criteria defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines (NCCN, 2021 v.2)., 3 months|Complete Response (CR), The definitions for response are primarily based on the standardized response criteria defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines (NCCN, 2021 v.2)., 3 months|MRD-negative Complete Response (CR), The definitions for response are primarily based on the standardized response criteria defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines (NCCN, 2021 v.2)., 3 months|Duration of CR in responders, 2 years|Progression Free Survival (PFS) following Tecartus plus dasatinib, PFS is defined as the time from the start of the investigational therapy to the date of radiographic progression, 2 years|Overall Survival (OS) following Tecartus plus dasatinib, OS is defined as the time from the date of initial disease diagnosis to the date of death from any cause, 2 years
