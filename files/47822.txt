BIOpsychosocial Approach of the CAncer-RElated FAtigue (BIOCARE FActory)
One of the most common and stressful side effects of the disease and associated treatments is cancer-related fatigue. It deeply disrupts quality of life and can have a negative impact on patient survival. However, cancer-related fatigue is largely underestimated by patients and poorly taken into account by clinicians. One of the reasons for its poor management is a lack of knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and risk factors.

Although a multiplicity of factors are associated with the appearance of cancer-related fatigue, we do not know their respective share, nor the nature of their interactions. The phenomenon studied reveals complex and systemic interactions between the biological, psychological and social dimensions. Recent systematic reviews clearly identify 2 locks currently preventing a better understanding of the mechanisms of cancer-related fatigue: i) lack of longitudinal studies, ii) lack of interdisciplinary studies. It is precisely these two challenges that the BIOCARE FActory project wishes to respond to.
