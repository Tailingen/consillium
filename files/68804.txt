EVOLUTION: 177Lu-PSMA Therapy Versus 177Lu-PSMA in Combination With Ipilimumab and Nivolumab for Men With mCRPC
This phase II study will investigate the activity and safety of radionuclide 177Lu-PSMA therapy versus 177Lu-PSMA in combination with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

PSA progression free survival (PSA-PFS) at 1 year (PCWG3), PSA progression is defined as a rise in PSA by ≥ 25% AND ≥ 2 ng/mL above the nadir (lowest PSA point). This needs to be confirmed by a repeat PSA performed at least 3 weeks later., Date of randomisation to the date of first evidence of PSA progression at 53 weeks post randomisation.
PSA response rate (PSA-RR), PSA response rate is defined as the proportion of participants in each group with a PSA reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline., Date of randomisation through to study completion, approximately 3 years from start of recruitment. Early rises in PSA prior to 12 weeks will be disregarded in determining PSA response.|Frequency and severity of adverse events (CTCAE v5.0), CTCAE v5.0 will be used to measure frequency and severity of AEs during study treatment., Date of first dose of study treatment until 100 days after cessation of study treatment.|Radiological progression free survival (PCWG3/RECIST1.1), Radiographic PFS is defined as the interval from the date of randomisation to the date of first evidence of radiographic progression, or the date of last known follow-up without progression., Date of randomisation to the date of first evidence of progression on imaging (PCWG3 criteria for bone lesions and RECIST 1.1 for soft tissue lesions) assessed every 12 weeks through to study completion, approximately 3 years from start of recruitment.|PSA progression free survival (PCWG3), PSA progression free survival is defined as the interval from the date of randomisation to the date of first evidence of PSA progression or the date of last known follow-up without PSA progression., Date of randomisation through to study completion, approximately 3 years from start of recruitment.|Overall survival (OS), OS is defined as the interval from the date of randomisation to date of death from any cause, or the date of last known follow-up alive., Through to study completion, approximately 3 years from start of recruitment.|Objective response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as partial or complete response at any stage of the study (from the date of randomisation to date of subsequent anti-cancer treatment). RECIST 1.1 will be used to assess ORR in participants with measurable disease., Date of randomisation through to study completion, approximately 3 years from start of recruitment.|Duration of response, Duration of response is defined as the interval from the date of first response (Complete Response / Partial Response as per RECIST 1.1) to the date of first documented radiological progression as per RECIST 1.1 in participants with measurable disease., Date of randomisation through to first radiological progression or through to study completion, approximately 3 years from start of recruitment.|Time to treatment response, Time to treatment response is defined as the interval from the date of randomisation to the date of first response (Complete Response / Partial Response as per RECIST 1.1) in participants with measurable disease., Date of randomisation through to study completion, approximately 3 years from start of recruitment.|Aspects of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) - 1, The EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research on Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire for cancer patients) instrument uses 28 questions about overall quality of life with each question answerable using a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Overall scores can be from a minimum of 28 indicating a better quality of life and higher scores with a maximum of 112 indicating lower overall quality of life. The questionnaire also has two summary questions which asks participants to rank 1) overall health and 2) overall quality of life on scale of from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent)., Within 7 days prior to randomisation, assessed every 12 weeks, through to study completion, approximately 3 years from start of recruitment.|Aspects of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) - 2, Patient DATA Form (Patient Disease and Treatment Assessment Form - 47 items) is a simple, multi-item quality of life instrument based on 11-point numeric rating scales for a range of relevant symptoms and functions. It combines cancer specific items from the UBQ-C, GLQ-8 and LASA cancer-specific quality of life instruments., Within 7 days prior to randomisation, assessed every 12 weeks, through to study completion, approximately 3 years from start of recruitment.
Association between Clinical Outcomes and Possible Prognostic/Predictive Biomarkers (tissue and circulating) including PBMCs, ctDNA and CTCs, Translational research will include identifying tissue and circulating biomarkers that are prognostic and/or predictive of response to treatment, safety and resistance to study treatment.

These include but are not limited to analyses of:

1. PBMC samples may be used for immunophenotyping or characterisation of the immune cell subsets in the periphery;
2. ctDNA, immunological markers, and response data will be used to prospectively investigate the utility of early changes in ctDNA levels;
3. CTCs may be enumerated and analysed for their potential to predict or correlate with toxicity and efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors., Date of randomisation through to study completion, approximately 3 years from start of recruitment.
This is an open label, randomised, stratified, multicentre phase 2 clinical trial recruiting 110 participants over 18 months and followed for 12 months. Participants will be randomised to 177Lu-PSMA in combination with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab and 177Lu-PSMA alone in a 2:1 ratio (using minimisation with a random component) stratified by prior exposure to docetaxel.
