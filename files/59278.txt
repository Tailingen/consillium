The study's ultimate goal is to increase LCS rates compared to usual care and thus reduce lung cancer deaths., 24 months
The research team will select primary care practices included in areas where lung cancer mortality is high. An outreach registry of primary care patients obtaining care at participating practices who meet study eligibility criteria will be created from the electronic medical record. 500 primary care patients will be randomly selected for the Outreach Contact with Decision Counseling (OCDC) Group from this outreach registry. Patients targeted for inclusion in the study will have a scheduled primary care appointment 18-23 days after initial outreach contact.
