Study of GS-0201 Alone and in Combination in Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors
The main goal of this first in human (FIH) study is to learn about the safety and dosing of GS-0201 when given alone or in combination with sacituzumab govitecan (SG) in participants with advanced solid tumors.

The primary objectives of this study are to:

* To assess the safety and tolerability of GS-0201 as monotherapy and in combination with SG in participants with selected advanced solid tumors
* To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of GS-0201 as monotherapy and the MTD and/or the RP2D and dosing schedule of GS-0201 in combination with SG in participants with selected advanced solid tumors
