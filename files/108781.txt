Long-term Follow-up Study of Allogeneic Gamma Delta (γδ) CAR T Cells
The purpose of this study is to assess long-term side effects from subjects who receive an Adicet Bio γδ CAR T cell product. Subjects will join this study once they complete the parent interventional study. No additional study drug will be given, but subjects can receive other therapies for their cancer while they are being followed for long term safety in this study. For a period of 15 years from the first administration of Adicet Bio allogeneic γδ CAR T cell product, subjects will be assessed for long-term safety and survival through collection of data that include safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity.

This is a non-therapeutic, multi-center, long-term follow-up (LTFU) study of subjects who received an Adicet Bio allogeneic γδ CAR T cell product that has been genetically engineered to express the anti-CD20 CAR by transduction with a self-inactivating, replication incompetent gamma retroviral vector. The period of follow-up is 15 years after the administration of the γδ CAR T cell product.

The study involves up to 15 years post-infusion monitoring of subjects who have been exposed to a genetically engineered CAR in Adicet Bio clinical studies. Upon early termination/discontinuation or completion of the parent interventional study, subjects will enroll into this study. Collection of these data will further define the risk-benefit and efficacy profile Adicet allogeneic γδ CAR T cell investigational products.

This is an observational study, and the elements of the study design are per published guidelines for gene therapy medicinal products that utilize integrating viral vectors such as gamma retrovirus and it is important to evaluate any delayed adverse events after infusion with such products.
