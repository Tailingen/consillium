Atezolizumab + Cabozantinib in Patients w/ Metastatic, Refractory Pancreatic Cancer
Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the United States with limited treatment options, especially for those patients with metastatic disease. Combination treatment with cabozantinib and atezolizumab, has demonstrated safety for the treatment of other cancers and has shown promise in preclinical studies utilizing patient derived pancreas organoids. In this study, patients with refractory, metastatic pancreatic cancer will receive combination cabozantinib + atezolizumab and the efficacy of this treatment will be assessed through overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), median overall survival (mOS), and median progression free survival (mPFS). Safety and tolerability of combination cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients will also be assessed and immune profiling pre- and post-treatment will be explored.

DRUG: Cabozantinib + Atezolizumab
Overall Response Rate or Stable Disease, To evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in patients with refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer through overall response rate (ORR) changes or stable disease (SD) after 9 weeks of treatment., Participants will be evaluated for response every 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) thereafter until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (an average of 6 months)
Adverse Event, To evaluate the safety of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in patients with refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer through the recording of adverse events according to CTCAE version 5.0 and summarized using descriptive statistics., Participants will be evaluated for response every 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) thereafter until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (an average of 6 months)|Toxicities, To evaluate the safety of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in patients with refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer through the recording of a toxicities according to CTCAE version 5.0 and summarized using descriptive statistics., Participants will be evaluated for response every 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) thereafter until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (an average of 6 months)|Disease Control Rate, To assess the disease control rate (DCR) in patients with refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with combination cabozantinib plus atezolizumab., Participants will be evaluated for response every 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) thereafter until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (an average of 6 months)|Survival, To further define survival outcomes of median overall survival (mOS) and median progression free survival (mPFS) in patients with refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer who receive combination therapy with cabozantinib plus atezolizumab., Participants will be evaluated for response every 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) thereafter until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (an average of 6 months)
T2 Signal, To quantify T2 signal within the tumor using T2 mapping of tumors pre- and post-treatment with combination cabozantinib plus atezolizumab., Participants will be evaluated for response every 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) thereafter until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (an average of 6 months)|Immune System Effects, To explore the immune effects of cabozantinib plus atezolizumab in patients with refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer through Immune profiling of tissue and/or blood collected from study participants, Baseline, at 9 weeks, at end of treatment (approx. 6 months), and after disease progression (assessed up to 100 months)|Tumor Response, To evaluate tumor response through comparison of quantified apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of baseline and post-treatment with combination cabozantinib plus atezolizumab tumors., Participants will be evaluated for response every 3 cycles (each cycle is 21 days) thereafter until disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first (an average of 6 months).
