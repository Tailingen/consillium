68Ga-NOTA-RM26 PET/CT in Glioma Patients
The aim of this study was to investigate the value of 68Ga-NOTA-RM26, an antagonist targeting gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) PET tracer, in the diagnosis of high WHO grade glioma and prediction the grade of glioma using positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).
Glioma
DRUG: 68Ga-RM26
SUVmax, SUVmax of focal lesions are measured on 68Ga-RM26 PET/CT., through study completion, an average of 1.5 years
The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), also known as bombesin receptor subtype II (BB2), is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family of bombesin receptors. GRPR is over-expressed in various types of human tumors including breast cancer. RM26, a GRPR antagonist with high affinity, was discovered by peptide backbone modification of bombesin analogues.To target gastrin-releasing peptide receptor in neoplastic cells of human breast cancer, peptide NOTA-RM26 was synthesized with a PEG3 linker between NOTA and RM26, and then labeled with 68Ga. An open-label brain PET/ CT study was designed to assess its clinical diagnostic value in patients with glioma.
