Feasibility of Providing a Purpose Renewal Intervention for Cancer Survivors Via Virtual Groups
The Compass Course (CC) is a group intervention designed for individuals with Breast Cancer. Over the course of 8 face-to-face group sessions, the CC is designed to help participants reclaim a sense of self-grounded purpose in daily life, defined as intentional use of time and energy in ways that align with one's values, strengths, and sources of personal meaning (e.g., inner compass) in the moments that compose a day. Because of COVID-19, in-person groups are discouraged and so we need to identify new ways to provide group-based interventions that are feasible and efficacious.
