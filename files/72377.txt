Remotely Supervised Computerized Cognitive Stimulation to Reduce Post-chemotherapy Cognitive Difficulties in Patients Treated for Localized Breast Cancer
Investigator propose the first French randomized comparative study to assess the efficacy of a remotely supervised online cognitive stimulation program, compared to an unsupervised online cognitive exercise intervention, in reducing cognitive complaints in localized breast cancer patients after adjuvant chemotherapy. Previous randomized studies have confirmed the effectiveness of online cognitive stimulation programs compared to standard care. The study seeks to determine the added value of remote supervision by a neuropsychologist. The control group will have access to the same online cognitive exercises as the experimental group but without supervision. Investigator has chosen not to include a wait-list group as it would be unethical to deny patients with cognitive complaints the opportunity to participate in an intervention expected to benefit them. The secondary objective is to evaluate the benefit of the supervised digitalized cognitive intervention on objective cognitive impairment.

The research hypothesis is that incorporating personalized remote support with supervision from a neuropsychologist into a digitalized cognitive stimulation program will reinforce the effectiveness of the intervention on cognitive complaints. This will be achieved by improving participation/adherence to the online cognitive stimulation program, as well as through the personalized supervision itself. Investigator believe that the supervision sessions, including educational components, will enable patients to identify their strengths, promote their cognitive awareness, and develop individualized strategies to apply their compensatory abilities in real-life situations. Since cognitive difficulties have multiple underlying causes, reducing these symptoms requires a multifaceted approach. The hypothesis is that combining cognitive training (which increases neuroplasticity and directly targets the cognitive domains affected by cancer and its treatments), with structured supervised educational sessions based on compensatory strategies, will yield better outcomes than online cognitive stimulation alone.
