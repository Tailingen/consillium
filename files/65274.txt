Physical Training in Glioblastoma Patients During Cytotoxic Therapy
The aim of the present study is the prospective controlled use of physical activity in a collective of patients with glioblastoma after surgery and concomitant radiation/chemotherapy and during adjuvant cytotoxic therapy. The research question is whether physical exercise is feasible and whether patients benefit physically and mentally from the activities performed. For this purpose, specific training units under the supervision of a certified trainer and sports scientist as well as standardized sports medical test procedures are implemented. Beyond the instructed training, general physical activity phases are recorded electronically using a pedometer/activity tracker, which is worn at all times.

It will be examined whether the individual training program

1. improves physical fitness
2. increases quality of life/life satisfaction throughout the intervention
3. can be detected in blood due to increased concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor 1 (BDNF-1) (voluntary)

The measurements should be taken before and 8, 16 and 24 weeks after the start of training.

The personal trainers of the university clinics in Bochum and Homburg/Saar receive specific training activities from MÃ¼nster's trainer Ralf Brandt in order to ensure a standardized concept. This way, a comparison of the trainings' conduction and recording is possible both quantitatively and qualitatively.
