Intestinal Microbiome After Gastrectomy
The gastric barrier plays a major role in the maintanance of the distal intestinal microbiome composition. It has been shown before that the use of gastric acid suppression medication, such as proton pump inhibitors, are associated with distinctive alterations of the intestinal microbiome. Foremost, the invasion of predominantly oral bacteria, like Veillonella and Streptococcus species, were a resurring finding in previous reports.

Gastric cancer treatment includes the total or subtotal resection of the stomach which can influence the gastric acid production. However, the influence by alterations in gastric milieu after this treatment on the composition of the intestinal microbiome is not well studied.

Therefore, the intestinal microbiome of patients after total or subtotal gastrectomy and its influence on intestinal inflammation and gut permeability will be studied.
